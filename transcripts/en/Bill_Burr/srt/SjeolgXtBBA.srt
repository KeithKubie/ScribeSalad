1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:02,080
Okay.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,320
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and
It's time for the Thursday afternoon,

3
00:00:05,321 --> 00:00:07,440
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:07,440
And

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:10,850
Ah,

6
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:15,170
just checking in on you.
I'm just checking in on you.

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,530
Do Da, do the, how's your
fucking Cuba call old ado.

8
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,890
Dot Day. Um, what's going on? Happy
Thursday, everybody. You're almost there.

9
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,900
I'll tell you this weekend. Just
cannot come soon enough. Oh,

10
00:00:29,901 --> 00:00:32,210
fucking suck it up,
Mary.

11
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,850
They're paying you to do you do a
fucking job. Go ahead and do it.

12
00:00:36,851 --> 00:00:37,720
What are you gonna do this weekend?

13
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:42,810
It's gonna make you less of a fucking
God damn wet diaper to be around next

14
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:47,080
week. This weekend can't
come soon enough. Oh yeah.

15
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,470
Who you're hanging out with that you're
going to dump all your fucking problems

16
00:00:50,471 --> 00:00:54,280
on. Sorry, you wouldn't know
it, but I'm in a great mood.

17
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,480
I'm in a fucking great mood.
Um,

18
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,080
tomorrow morning I'm
taking an early flight.

19
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,880
I'm flying out to a casino
in Maryland doing, uh, uh,

20
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,770
one or two shows out there. I'm
not sure. I don't know what,

21
00:01:08,771 --> 00:01:12,850
just point me at this stage and I will
go out there and do my little fucking

22
00:01:12,851 --> 00:01:17,290
dance, but a red sox finally won last
night. What did I do? Did I call it

23
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,430
or did I not call it?
All of these guys?

24
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:26,320
I don't know why you guys continue
to watch ESPN when the Monday morning

25
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,200
podcasts in the Thursday
afternoon just before Friday.

26
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,290
Monday morning podcast exists.
Okay.

27
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:37,270
Why do you put on that? Okay, Joe.
Okay. They're professionals. Okay.

28
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:38,950
They went to broadcasting school.
Okay.

29
00:01:38,951 --> 00:01:43,630
They pay attention to sports way
more than I do. Having said that,

30
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,510
according to my ego,

31
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,910
nobody reads the sports
tea leaves better than me.

32
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:53,580
Yeah,

33
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,391
of course it isn't true,

34
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:57,750
but the one thing I am right about
is all these people that flip out

35
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,270
during the regular season about Gotti
records and all that shit and all the

36
00:02:04,271 --> 00:02:06,640
fucking wins. The Red Sox
half, we've seen this before.

37
00:02:06,641 --> 00:02:08,380
We saw the Seattle Mariners Stewart,

38
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,670
they want 120 something games
came home with no fucking,

39
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,030
they came home with their
pockets turned inside out.

40
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,600
And I'll tell you right now,
there was a,

41
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:29,220
there were a lot of lumberjacks in
Seattle crying on Monday. All right.

42
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:36,250
No, I know. Then I have a well earned
reputation as being a bit of a combustion,

43
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,940
a bit of a fucking wet blanket,

44
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:47,100
a bit of a fresh cut,
alright, guilty on all counts.

45
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,170
But I'll tell you one thing,

46
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:53,670
I'm right above other than my
misogynistic opinions about women,

47
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:58,260
I,
I am right about the regular season,

48
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,430
okay? And I'm here to tell all
of you to fucking stand down

49
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:09,590
with this screaming and
yelling on every fucking sport.

50
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,090
Kate,
fucking relax.

51
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:19,300
What you want to do is you take all
the stats of all the fucking 90% of the

52
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:20,730
teams or whatever sport you're watching,

53
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,660
sometimes only 40% if for watching hockey,

54
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,390
the amount of fucking teams that
are not going to win the playoffs,

55
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:29,500
you take all of those fucking stats,
all right?

56
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:32,150
As the rock used to say,
you turn him up sideways,

57
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:36,010
seven straight up the candy because cause
they don't mean shit cause you're not

58
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,290
gonna see those people
come fucking October.

59
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:43,390
So what did I sing when I jumped on
the Red Sox bandwagon six hours ago?

60
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,250
I said we got the Indians twice.

61
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:49,840
We got the Houston Astros and we got
the Yankees to more fucking times. Okay.

62
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:55,450
Now if we lay waste to those teams, I can
get excited. But even then the playoffs,

63
00:03:55,451 --> 00:03:59,380
a diff Joe Bucks there,
there's more cameras.

64
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,770
Everybody's watched. All right?
People get a little tight.

65
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:05,020
You never know what the fucking happen.
So anyways,

66
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:08,740
I've been telling you guys and
yes I am pat myself on the back.

67
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,040
I told you everybody's sleeping on the
Indians and Terry Francona and what

68
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:19,750
happens? What does Terry do? He comes
right out in the first two fucking games.

69
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:24,730
He makes us look like a 500 ball club.
Handled us with ease.

70
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,360
That's two wins. Two more. And
you just took a series. All right.

71
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,090
I know we got Chris sale and
I know we got price. Okay.

72
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:34,120
But that's only going to get us to there.
All right.

73
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,240
And I think Terry Frank Code is the
best manager in Phuket baseball.

74
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:41,160
And then never, evidently they got
this Guy Brad hand or some shit closer.

75
00:04:41,161 --> 00:04:45,100
I don't ones, no phone. I know his
last name. His hand. All right.

76
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:49,750
Very impressive. Lights out. I know
we won last night and everything,

77
00:04:49,751 --> 00:04:54,690
but I'm just saying, you know, but that's
what they do over there. The ESPNs,

78
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,630
the Fox sports,

79
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:00,930
they are in the business of saying the
sky is falling or sending something to

80
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:05,350
the fucking moon. They send it to
the bone and when the sky falls,

81
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:09,310
they have the balls to say, what happens?
What happened? Rather than being like,

82
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:11,980
wow, we will, we will fucking wrong again.

83
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:17,770
All they do is hype shit up
over there. They did. I mean,

84
00:05:17,771 --> 00:05:22,771
how many fucking times have they s how
do you compare the DD dd 2018 red sox to

85
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,500
the 96 bowls?

86
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:30,543
MMM.

87
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,850
And it's always the 96 polls.
By the way,

88
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,650
everybody ignores the 1983 Philadelphia,
70 sixers.

89
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,210
Okay. One of the most underrated
teams of all fucking time. Um,

90
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,500
anyways, I was very relieved
that we got a win last night. Uh,

91
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,180
I'm going to try to
watch the game tonight.

92
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,223
MMM.

93
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,040
And he'll be split with
them, but, uh, I, I,

94
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,760
I mean I love our manager and all
our players and all that shit, but I,

95
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:01,630
every time I see Terry Francona,
basically she's the best. You know?

96
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,220
I don't know what happens.
You just have just like,

97
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:10,610
familiarity breeds contempt. Is that
what is, how do you say that word?

98
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:13,880
Familiarity. Familiar. Familiarity.

99
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,600
Hang on a second.
That's one of those ones.

100
00:06:17,601 --> 00:06:20,510
You start the word and then
you get halfway through
and you're like, oh my God,

101
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:22,460
I'm not going to make it.
And do you have like,

102
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:24,420
you're talking to three people
at the same time, the party,

103
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,450
you just see all of them ever so slightly.

104
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:30,740
You see their faces drop and they
realize how dumb the person they are that

105
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,703
they're talking to her.

106
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:36,050
Sorry for mill year air t
didn't even spell it right.

107
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:42,970
All right. How do you say this? Okay,
everybody, here we go. You Ready? Whoops.

108
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,450
Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Familiarity,

109
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,190
familiarity, rarity. Nope. Familiarity.

110
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:58,220
Familiarity, Yardi. Familiarity.

111
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:03,170
Dude. You know what it is? It's his
field. Familiarity of the ballpark.

112
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,960
He ain't fucking scared
when he gets sick on a cat.

113
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:10,960
He knows all the nooks and crannies.
I said it right.

114
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,440
Yeah. Already. Yeah. Familiarity.
You don't look, you don't believe me.

115
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,650
Listen to the fucking robot.
White Guy in my computer.

116
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,460
Familiarity C, go fuck yourself.
Give me a bud light kit. I'm

117
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:33,360
watching my waistline for the end of
the summer. Speaking of which, oh,

118
00:07:33,361 --> 00:07:37,020
and then the Red Sox, uh,
they had some fucking little
a, as the English would say,

119
00:07:37,021 --> 00:07:40,700
a little cheeky fucking tweet
there. I didn't like it. You know,

120
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:45,320
we apologize to our,
our fans for, uh, our,

121
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:49,020
our lengthy losing streak.
Why would you do that?

122
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,713
You know,

123
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:59,010
this is what you got to ask yourself.
What would bill Belicheck do? All right,

124
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,470
I just loved that over the
net. Hey, fucking cheat.

125
00:08:02,471 --> 00:08:06,670
I know you guys would say that I cut
the sleeves off his sweater and fucking

126
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:11,410
blind a child to get an ice cream
cone quicker year. All Jealous. Um,

127
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:15,540
but funny anyways. Uh, yeah.

128
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,340
Why would you give Bolton board material?

129
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:22,230
Why would you motivate any other
fucking team? You know, that's just,

130
00:08:22,231 --> 00:08:25,890
I think that's a stupid move.
Um,

131
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,070
and that's what happens when you go on
Twitter and they probably read all these

132
00:08:29,071 --> 00:08:33,810
red sox fans. Freaking
the fuck out. You know,

133
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:39,390
if they got 50,000 tweets,
I bet 30,000 was sent by Dan Shaughnessy.

134
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,210
Oh, I always get to make fun of him. Um,

135
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,180
is this the 1978 season all over here?

136
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,430
Are they going to chant 2013 at us?
Um,

137
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,640
anyways, tonight, tonight. Big, big,

138
00:08:53,641 --> 00:08:57,780
big fucking match of who's on the for
the Indians? I have no idea. But uh,

139
00:08:57,781 --> 00:09:00,450
the Indians, oh, my team. If the
red sox don't make it this year,

140
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,310
I'd like to see them get one,

141
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,120
even though I'm going to have
to watch people in the stands,

142
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:10,750
have those stupid Cleveland shirts
that say defend the land. Uh,

143
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:16,020
I just kidding.
I think that might be the worst one.

144
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:22,960
Okay. Yankees sing. Why MCA or the seventh
inning stretch? You think that's bad,

145
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,853
right?

146
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,250
That, eh, go, yeah,

147
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,930
here's all these fucking fat hair.
He fucking Brooklyn cuts. Right.

148
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,980
You think that's bad. And then you go up
to Boston and this what is, what is it,

149
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,130
sue eight?

150
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:39,560
Uh Huh.

151
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,970
The thing is is you got to have
like a song for dumb people.

152
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:50,490
You know, like if you just
hum the melody of why MCA,

153
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,920
it's a Buddhist monk would probably tell
you that some sort of zen thing where

154
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:57,340
you just have a complete inability to
have any sort of thought in your head.

155
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,713
You know,

156
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,240
like think about your
future, why you go. Yeah.

157
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:05,800
[inaudible]

158
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,520
no, that's it. It's over. Um,

159
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:14,130
and then the temple of it,
young man walking down the fucking street,

160
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:18,660
cause you can't dance, right. Just
white guys walking around in a square,

161
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,073
you know,

162
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,510
is your girlfriend looks
over their shoulder at the
black guy in the background.

163
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,273
MMM.

164
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:37,120
Anyways. And you just think it can't get
any bad worse than that. You know? I mean,

165
00:10:37,121 --> 00:10:41,380
that's pretty bad because
it's, it's Douche behavior
combined with music. I mean,

166
00:10:41,381 --> 00:10:44,080
that's usually takes the cake,

167
00:10:44,081 --> 00:10:49,080
but defend the land,
the land,

168
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:55,590
what land? Cleveland. He'd be the
one you guys all fucking abandoned.

169
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,970
It's a fucking ghost town.

170
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,780
Drive in from your fucking
plush neighborhood.

171
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,420
All those fucking rich cuts out
there in greater Cleveland. You know,

172
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:06,900
when their gated communities sitting
out there reading their broths in their

173
00:11:06,901 --> 00:11:10,560
fucking 14 carat big green eggs,
you know,

174
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,170
then they come downtown like
the fucking Paul Revere.

175
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:17,040
I'm going to defend the land and go to
a game for three hours and then quickly

176
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:20,160
retreat back to my Culdesac,

177
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,050
the Lexus fucking riding mower.

178
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:27,260
The amount of money in greater
Cleveland is just insane, by the way.

179
00:11:27,261 --> 00:11:30,390
I have no idea what greater
Cleveland is like. Um,

180
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,820
but anyway, is it, is it
that much difficult to be
greater than Cleveland? Oh,

181
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:39,450
see what I did there. Sorry.
Anyways, having said that,

182
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,580
uh, I love the idiots. My Dad
was a big Indians fan growing up.

183
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,553
MMM.

184
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:51,650
Indians at tigers where there's two
teams as he moved around a lot there. Uh,

185
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,640
so anyways,
I'll speak to that late last night.

186
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,103
MMM.

187
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,720
I somehow, you know, went down this, this
fucking, you know, what do you call it?

188
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,280
The rabbit hole on Youtube.

189
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:07,000
And I ended up watching this youtube
video about every quarterback,

190
00:12:07,001 --> 00:12:11,180
the Detroit lions I've ever had,
you know,

191
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:16,410
and uh,
they met a lot of fucking quarterbacks.

192
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,360
Not a lot of offensive lineman, but they
have had a lot of fucking quarterbacks.

193
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,703
MMM.

194
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:29,210
Fascinating. Fascinating franchise.
Allegedly it's the curse of Bobby Lane.

195
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,510
It isn't, it isn't. It's not. Okay.

196
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:37,570
You know that to say that you're cursed
is just you just passing the buck.

197
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,650
It's like, no, we don't know what the
fuck we're doing and we need help.

198
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,880
It's not the curse of Bobby Lane.
What?

199
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:50,330
Cause he left a little disgruntled.
Yeah, you get rid of me.

200
00:12:50,331 --> 00:12:51,680
You're never going to win again.

201
00:12:51,681 --> 00:12:56,210
And then some old lady I heard he shed
for 15 years and that's how it starts

202
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,060
that Dan Shaughnessy
writes a book about it.

203
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,330
It makes a bunch of money off the misery.
That's what it should be. His next book,

204
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,420
the curse of Bombay.

205
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,173
Okay.

206
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,640
Bobby Lane would come into the
game fucking half in the bag.

207
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,600
He need hair of the dog after fucking
the second quarter going and halftime not

208
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,860
listen to coach,
slap his fucking wife around.

209
00:13:18,861 --> 00:13:22,110
And then he'd go out and he'd have
a fourth quarter comeback, you know?

210
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,500
Um, and anyways, that's the way they told
the story. But I remember Greg Landry,

211
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,443
Eric Hippel,

212
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,630
I remember Joey Harrington his whole
fucking career just running for his life.

213
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,880
You know, that's what's amazing. You know,

214
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:39,881
when you see like some of these
people that are called bus like the,

215
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,290
this ship, this should be
like a consideration for the
fucking team you went to.

216
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:51,590
You know what I mean? Like
if Jim had, Johnson did not

217
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,530
come into the fucking Dallas cowboys
organization and make that Herschel Walker

218
00:13:57,531 --> 00:14:02,460
trade, how long would have Troy
Aikman lasted in the league?

219
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,180
The amount of hits that that guy
took me the first couple of seasons,

220
00:14:06,181 --> 00:14:10,110
he guy was on his back. You can only
take those hits for so long. Now.

221
00:14:10,111 --> 00:14:13,650
I'm not saying Joey. Eric did his
fucking Troy Aikman I'm just saying,

222
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,350
remember way back in
the day when John Elway,

223
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:22,290
the Baltimore Colts drafted him and
he was, you know, and he was like,

224
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:25,320
I'm not going to that fucking franchise.
And they go, what are you talking about?

225
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,590
He got run the play baseball. I'll go
fucking play baseball for the Yankees,

226
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,583
you know,

227
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,190
because you guys don't know
what the fuck you doing.

228
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:38,270
And I have one shot at this and
then they traded him to the Broncos.

229
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:43,960
Koby Bryant did the same thing drafted
by the Charlotte Hornets. Zach,

230
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,410
I'm not fucking playing out there.

231
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:49,640
I actually think it is
like an for basketball.

232
00:14:49,641 --> 00:14:52,190
It's bullshit for baseball
would be bullshit.

233
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:55,400
Those are like non contact sports
for the most part compared to like,

234
00:14:55,401 --> 00:14:58,910
you know football, football.
I get, it's like dude,

235
00:14:58,911 --> 00:15:02,690
I'm literally going to be drinking out
of fucking Straw by the time I'm 30 if I

236
00:15:02,691 --> 00:15:07,630
play for you guys. Alright, you
don't have an offensive coordinator,

237
00:15:07,631 --> 00:15:10,510
you have no offensive line. And I'm just
gonna get like, I'm going to be like,

238
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:15,120
you know the guy, he waves his hand
for a fair catch and just get stuck.

239
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,740
Now you know,
something with the new rules of tackling.

240
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,320
Now maybe I think that you
can go to these franchises.

241
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,140
You don't have to pull an airway.
Um,

242
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,140
yeah cause I guess that you
can't lead when you fucking,

243
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,970
you can't leave with your
head where you go to tackle.

244
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:36,370
I'm trying to picture halla how
do you do that? That can, can you,

245
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,140
you can hit with your shoulder though,
right?

246
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:43,240
But there's no way to hit with your
shoulder without leading with your head

247
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,030
unless you just sort of like a,

248
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:49,660
you just come jumping by like a
pogo stick and just sorta like,

249
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,660
it's like slam dancing.
Maybe they should do that.

250
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:59,390
I think what they should do is they
should have a giant velcro belt around.

251
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:04,160
All of them right in the ball becomes
velcro and you just stick it on the person

252
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:06,050
and the person can't run that.

253
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:09,620
You bounce down the fucking field like a
pogo stick and then everybody else hops

254
00:16:09,621 --> 00:16:11,780
after you and tries to bump into you,

255
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,990
but you're not allowed to slap the ball
away the way a rod did when he ran down

256
00:16:14,991 --> 00:16:18,140
to first base. I don't know.
I'm just trying to fix the game.

257
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,340
You know,
who the fuck does,

258
00:16:22,341 --> 00:16:24,380
I know it's all about concussion
protocol and all that.

259
00:16:24,381 --> 00:16:28,010
I think they should just have NFL players
just sign a release being like, yeah,

260
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,760
basically. Um, you got to take
about 30 years off your life.

261
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,100
Okay. But in the three and a half
years you play in this league, okay,

262
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:40,220
you're going to have a,
you're going to get more pussy.

263
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:43,880
You're going to drive more goddamn cars
in a more fucking blinged than you could

264
00:16:43,881 --> 00:16:48,290
ever dream of. All right? So
joy, joy, well, less. Okay,

265
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,590
just sign here and you
can lead with your head.

266
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,280
Maybe that's what they have to do.
I Dunno.

267
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:01,170
Maybe the NFL implodes and then the
WNB takes over. I mean, who knows?

268
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,020
There's a good story for ESPN. Is
that what's going to happen? Um,

269
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,790
anyways, let me read a little
bit of advertising here. Um,

270
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:15,330
then I'm gonna talk
about, uh, my dog, Cleo.

271
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,000
Cleo is back in town.

272
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:23,010
I'm gonna go take her for a walk after
I upload this Fucker, a butcher box.

273
00:17:23,011 --> 00:17:27,960
Everybody. Oh my goodness. Oh my
goodness. Are you a kind of war?

274
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:30,203
The love,

275
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:35,390
impeccable cuts of fucking
butchered meat the way I do.

276
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,700
I literally read this.
This is disgusting.

277
00:17:38,701 --> 00:17:43,110
I literally read this in my mouth waters.
That's how much I enjoyed it. Plus also,

278
00:17:43,111 --> 00:17:46,440
I'm on this fucking, this diet, you know,

279
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,800
and this week is like the
vegetarian diet. You know, I,

280
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:54,180
I had like a quarter of a chicken breast
at some point, you know what I mean?

281
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,280
An animal has to die so I
can live. I mean, it's just,
it's just how I am, you know?

282
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,200
Um, anyways, I just wish they
didn't treat the animals like shit,

283
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:07,290
which is why I like this one. You know,
these guys, they, they treat them night.

284
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,930
They pet them, they rub their
bellies before they kill
them. You know what I mean?

285
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,170
I mean, if you were going, if you were
on death row, wouldn't you want that?

286
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,320
You know, Nice head
rub, foot rub, you know,

287
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:21,270
work out the kinks in your back for
they flip the switch. All right.

288
00:18:21,271 --> 00:18:26,271
Butcher box delivers healthy 100% grass
fed and grass finished beef free range,

289
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:29,700
organic chickens and
the greatest thing ever.

290
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,630
Heritage bread,
pork,

291
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,230
the Cuban cigar of pork.
Okay.

292
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:39,450
Uh,

293
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:44,450
the incredible quality of butcher box
meets starts with the commitment to

294
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:50,631
raising animals humanely and free of
antibiotics and hormones before we kill

295
00:18:51,031 --> 00:18:55,140
them. Each box comes with at
least nine to 11 pounds of meat,

296
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,830
which is enough for 24
individual sized meals.

297
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:02,820
You can choose from five different
box types. I disliked it.

298
00:19:02,821 --> 00:19:06,630
You can order a couple of boxes of those
and you're ready for the apocalypse.

299
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,860
Just phrase those bad boys and everybody
else is going to be all starving out

300
00:19:10,861 --> 00:19:15,420
there eating dandelions
in fucking flossing their
teeth with the flag in their

301
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:16,081
mailbox.

302
00:19:16,081 --> 00:19:20,250
And you're going to be coming out
there with just full of fucking protein

303
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:26,250
throwing elbows and knees, Huh? Um,

304
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:30,600
you can choose from five different
box types. All beef, beef and chicken,

305
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:35,550
beef and pork, and a mixed box
for are you progressive people?

306
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:39,990
Custom box lets you choose
your own cuts. Oh, this is for,

307
00:19:39,991 --> 00:19:44,400
this is for the fucking chef right here.
Antibiotic and hormone free.

308
00:19:44,401 --> 00:19:45,001
We already said this.

309
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:49,530
Butcher box believes in a healthier
food system where everyone has access to

310
00:19:49,531 --> 00:19:51,240
meets the way nature intended.

311
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,010
Free of antibiotics and hormones humanely
raised on an open pasture before we

312
00:19:56,011 --> 00:19:59,790
kill them.
Shots fired at the company,

313
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:04,320
the artist formerly known as Monsanto,
Monsanto,

314
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,660

recipes are available on the butcher box,
websites and videos.

321
00:20:27,571 --> 00:20:28,404
I literally thought like,

322
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:33,120
is this meat like tax deductible and
videos are available to follow along on

323
00:20:33,121 --> 00:20:36,550
butcher box, Youtube Channel? Uh, I, yeah,

324
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,450
they wanted me to say my personal
experience. I told you I had the,

325
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:44,220
the heritage bread pork was the best
pork chop I've ever one of the top three

326
00:20:44,221 --> 00:20:48,220
I've ever had and I've had five
unbelievable ones made by five star chefs.

327
00:20:48,221 --> 00:20:52,290
It was just an entirely different level.
It's like, did you ever just like,

328
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:56,590
you have to have a tomato at a grocery
store and then someone has a garden and

329
00:20:56,591 --> 00:20:57,700
they bring that over and you're like,

330
00:20:57,701 --> 00:21:01,210
this is what the fuck it's supposed
to taste like. It's unreal.

331
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,760
It's like our food has a mute
button that's been pushed,

332
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,760
so every once in awhile when
you get the the real shit,

333
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:09,523
you know,

334
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,150
she's just so fucking weird that,
you know,

335
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:17,300
if you went back to the 18 hundreds
how much better food would have tasted,

336
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,820
but then all the other shit
you could have died of,

337
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,283
you know?

338
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,230
Then you fast forward all that shit they
died of and now our food's all fucked

339
00:21:28,231 --> 00:21:31,920
up, which is causing more shit that
you'd die from. I'll tell you people,

340
00:21:31,921 --> 00:21:35,520
it's a quagmire. All
right. Legal Zoom fact.

341
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,740
Most Americans don't have a,

342
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:41,270
well not this guy all set.

343
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:46,050
My affairs are in order.
20 years ago,

344
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,790
that wasn't a shocking statement.

345
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,900
You had to find a trustworthy attorney
and pay them by the hour to draft your

346
00:21:51,901 --> 00:21:54,000
will,
but these days there's no excuse.

347
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,430
Legal Zoom has made it
easy to create your own.

it's your turn to take control of your

351
00:22:06,991 --> 00:22:11,670
family and assets within a state plan.
It starts with the will or living trust.

352
00:22:11,671 --> 00:22:12,391
I can tell you this,

353
00:22:12,391 --> 00:22:15,120
a lot of guys don't do it because you
don't want to contemplate your own

354
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:18,840
mortality. I gotta tell you, I was
one of those guys. I got to will.

355
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:22,200
I got everything all done and uh,

356
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:26,730
it was like a load off of my fucking
chest. You feel great afterwards,

357
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:30,690
you know,
unless you're married the wrong person.

358
00:22:30,691 --> 00:22:32,940
And then they immediately start
to poison your food. I mean,

359
00:22:32,941 --> 00:22:36,810
there's always something. There's
always a fly in the ointment anyways.

379

Thanks for fucking us over, dad. You
really screwed us. All right me undies.

385
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,410
You've heard me obsess over my me undies.

386
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,580
You've heard me talk about how they are
three times softer than cotton. Well,

387
00:24:19,581 --> 00:24:23,390
you've heard me read about it and
come with fun new prints each month,

Me undies just gave their
membership a massive upgrade.

391
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:37,940
I just pictured them like there's some
sort of shelf they have in the front of

392
00:24:37,941 --> 00:24:42,410
the underwear now that just lifts your
junk. There's your massive upgrade,

All those dirty old, whole written
disgusting underwear you've hung onto.

395
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:53,330

416

The sound you make when you sleep,
the high pitched way that you fart.

417
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:14,610
So why would you buy a generic
mattress built for everyone else?

418
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:19,500
Yeah. Next, please mention all
the talking points below. Okay.

425
00:26:41,831 --> 00:26:44,760
I would say that Helux Helix
is talking a lot of shit here.

426
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:48,750
I think they're pretty confident that
God damn product just go to helix.

That's right.

444
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,860
I'm going to get some injections in my
face. I'm going to have my teeth bleached,

445
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:12,180
my tongue scraped, and uh, you know,

446
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,980
the wind have that candle stuck in my ear.

447
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,340
He fucking melt out all the wax or some
shit. No, I'm not doing any of that.

448
00:28:17,341 --> 00:28:20,820
I'm just trying to get, I'm trying to
get my abs. I got a four pack right now.

449
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,930
My stomach reminds me of
the old fucking wine cooler.

450
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:29,820
I mean that Oh bottle and
James belly right here. Um,

451
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:35,340
it's abs sick. It's Ab five and six.
Those are the tough ones. You know,

452
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,890
even seven and eight aren't that bad.

453
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:42,870
Like the fat just goes right to five
and six. It just fucking sits there.

454
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:46,070
You know what I mean? Like,
you know, whenever you, you,

455
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:48,390
you pour some liquid into a measuring cup,

456
00:28:48,391 --> 00:28:49,920
no matter how much you
try and dump it out,

457
00:28:49,921 --> 00:28:52,170
there's always that little bit
that fucking gathers in the bottom.

458
00:28:52,171 --> 00:28:54,450
And then you try fucking snapping it down.

459
00:28:54,451 --> 00:28:56,240
He gets kids always going
to be a little bit left.

460
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:00,120
And that's what ab five and six
are like in my fucking world. Um,

461
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,290
I'm doing all right though. I look
really good with the shirt on right now,

462
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:10,520
you know, but if I take my shirt
off it's still put it back on. Um,

463
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,640
so I think I need to do a little more
cardio or something like that. Uh,

464
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:17,440
you know what I want to buy,
I don't Rogan is,

465
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:20,700
has been talking up this fucking
cardio machine. I got to check it out.

466
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:25,290
I've got to go next time I do his
podcast, her right am in the area.

467
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:27,500
I ran into him the other night and I was,
I was,

468
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,080
he was going on and on about how fucking
unbelievable this thing and how it was

469
00:29:31,081 --> 00:29:33,570
tiring him out.
So I figured if it tires Joe out,

470
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:36,360
it's borderline going to kill me.
Um,

471
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,020
but I remember way back in the day,
um,

472
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:44,070
there was gym and they had this
thing called Jacob's ladder,

473
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:50,010
which was just picture you were a fireman
and there was a ladder that reached up

474
00:29:50,011 --> 00:29:53,550
to the top of the fucking skyscraper.
Right. And that's what it was like.

475
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:58,380
It was like you're on all fours and a
like a 45 degree angle and just climbing

476
00:29:58,381 --> 00:30:03,330
this fucking never ending.
It just keeps going and going and going.

477
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,320
You know, it's like a treadmill on a 45
degree angle. They, they didn't, they did,

478
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:10,050
it's like you fucking crawl 10 miles
away from the gym and then you're like,

479
00:30:10,051 --> 00:30:14,100
fuck, now how do I get back to my
car? You know, it just, you know,

480
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:19,110
goes in a circle using your own
weight or some shit like that.

481
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:22,650
And I remember I got on that fucking
thing and with it within three minutes,

482
00:30:22,651 --> 00:30:27,300
it felt like my heart was in my
throat and I had done an eight ball.

483
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,393
MMM.

484
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:32,840
So I'm considering getting one of those.

485
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:36,500
I might buy one of those or a,

486
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:40,400
I'm going to check out the Joe Rogan was,
could chose how he chose always.

487
00:30:40,401 --> 00:30:43,070
Like he's always sees one of those guys.
He's always looking around the corner.

488
00:30:43,071 --> 00:30:45,800
So he's always,
he knows what the next shit is.

489
00:30:45,801 --> 00:30:50,801
And I feel like he's had that thing long
enough that if that he's already past

490
00:30:50,901 --> 00:30:54,140
the, Oh wait a minute, this thing
sucks. He was still raving about it.

491
00:30:54,141 --> 00:30:58,700
So whatever the fuck he got, I'm going
to, I'm going to try to get, you know,

492
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:03,260
and then maybe I'll have a spinning heel
kick at the death level that he does.

493
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,270
Um, anyways, my dogs back in town.

494
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,050
MMM.

495
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:13,750
I'm gonna go take her for a walk. I
fucking miss that dog so much, man.

496
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:14,650
I'm having a lot of here.

497
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:17,690
Uh,

498
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:18,411
it's just the best,

499
00:31:18,411 --> 00:31:21,350
but I still get to see her like once
every six weeks and she's out here for six

500
00:31:21,351 --> 00:31:23,630
days. So every day I've been
taking her on like a fucking hike.

501
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,960
She goes nuts when she sees me.
I go crazy when I see her.

502
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:30,020
It's always a little sad when
I give it back, you know?

503
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,653
But uh,

504
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:35,430
yeah, I think she's kind of used
to it at this point. You know,

505
00:31:35,431 --> 00:31:39,390
I think human beings take
it harder than, than, uh,

506
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:43,740
the fucking dogs do. But
anyways. Um, okay. Let's,

507
00:31:43,741 --> 00:31:45,800
let's look a little bit of world news.
Let's see what's going,

508
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:47,560
let's check in on the
world. Everybody, uh,

509
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:52,580
Trump under fire for claim of large
scale killing of white farmers in South

510
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,450
Africa.
Um,

511
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:58,080
is there any doubt that this guy is just
a straight up fucking racist at this

512
00:31:58,081 --> 00:32:01,110
point?
It's amazing how long he kind of hid that.

513
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,600
Like he had no idea when he
was just sort of this funny,

514
00:32:03,601 --> 00:32:07,720
famous for being famous guy.
Um,

515
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:11,590
but the things that he chooses to focus
on, not saying that this isn't happening,

516
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,820
white farmers getting killed
in South Africa, but you know,

517
00:32:15,821 --> 00:32:19,330
white people are killing a lot of other
people from different races for quite

518
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:24,060
awhile. A actually right now, I mean,

519
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:28,030
oh, I'm sorry. We thought
you were terrorists.

520
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:31,210
Will you just a family go into the market.
Sorry about that.

521
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:36,250
We've been doing that for 15 fucking
years. I mean, just, you know,

522
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:40,100
I'm not saying what's going on in
after I've read about it is right.

523
00:32:40,101 --> 00:32:44,360
But it's just like that. Like, I
dunno when you can see like, you know,

524
00:32:44,361 --> 00:32:49,190
when there's like neo Nazis and you
can kind of see their argument to,

525
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:52,310
well, you know, it's kind of six
of one half dozen of the other

526
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:59,110
and the fact that fucking politicians
on both sides are such pieces of fucking

527
00:33:00,081 --> 00:33:03,650
shit that they will,
they will sit there and they will just,

528
00:33:03,651 --> 00:33:06,470
they will tow the fucking company line

529
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:13,190
because they're grossly under fucking
paid and it's all about getting reelected.

530
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:17,810
So someday you can write three books while
you're still in office and then buy a

531
00:33:17,811 --> 00:33:20,240
$10 million house.
That's basically what it is.

532
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:24,950
A UK outlines plan to
avert chaos of a no deal.

533
00:33:24,951 --> 00:33:28,640
Brexit. When the fuck is this thing going
to go down? I thought they were leaving.

534
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,030
This is like the longest break up ever.

535
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:36,600
What is a no deal? Brexit. So they,

536
00:33:36,601 --> 00:33:39,450
they leave the European Union and then
they don't know what the fuck they going

537
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:43,110
to do. All right, so they're showing a
picture of a bunch of tractor trailers.

538
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,850
All right. Make a difference in today's
world. Support independent journalism.

539
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:53,980
Subscribe for a dollar a week. Oh,
can I read what you wrote first?

540
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:57,370
How do I know you're independent?
This is New York times.com.

541
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:02,620
You're not fucking independent.
If mainstream, uh, London,

542
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:06,580
the British government issued its
first contingency plans on Thursday for

543
00:34:06,581 --> 00:34:11,581
leaving the European Union without an
agreement seeking to prepare the public

544
00:34:11,651 --> 00:34:16,300
for possible disruption without spreading
alarm that could undermine support for

545
00:34:16,301 --> 00:34:20,380
the entire undertaking.
The government on agreement for what?

546
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:27,700
Citizens of other countries that are
living in London with some sort of work

547
00:34:28,011 --> 00:34:31,790
visa. How are you going to
trade with the rest of it? Oh,

548
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,290
this is looking like a shit show.

549
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:39,740
The government emphasized that it hoped
and expected to hammer out a deal with

550
00:34:39,741 --> 00:34:43,310
the European Union,
but in a series of technical documents,

551
00:34:43,311 --> 00:34:45,440
it warned that without an agreement,

552
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:50,120
importers and exporters could face
significant new bureaucratic hurdles that

553
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:53,810
credit or debit card payments in
continental Europe could cost more.

554
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:58,190
And that British citizens living in the
block could lose access to banking and

555
00:34:58,191 --> 00:35:01,100
pension service. I'm going to
call this right now. He, uh,

556
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:05,060
England or Great Britain leaving,
uh,

557
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:10,160
the European Union is either going to be
the greatest or the worst fucking move

558
00:35:10,161 --> 00:35:13,610
ever. I mean, it's a great
move on some level, I guess.

559
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:16,220
Do you get out of the world banks
and you get to go back? They wait,

560
00:35:16,221 --> 00:35:17,990
are they on the,
I can't remember if they were on the euro.

561
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,870
Are they still on the pound?
Where are they on the euro?

562
00:35:20,871 --> 00:35:22,850
Did they go back to the pond?
I can't fucking remember,

563
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:28,430
but that's going to be that this is
either gonna fucking make other countries

564
00:35:28,431 --> 00:35:31,280
want to do it or they're going to be like,
thank God I didn't do that.

565
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:33,770
There's not going to be, well,
you know what I mean? You know,

566
00:35:33,771 --> 00:35:38,100
there's pros and cons. It's going to
be great or a show, one or the other.

567
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,530
I just want ESPN on that. Uh, US,

568
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:46,380
China imposed fresh round of tariffs as
escalating trade wars shows no sign of

569
00:35:46,381 --> 00:35:49,470
ending. Why can't wait?
What are we doing? Well,

570
00:35:49,471 --> 00:35:53,190
why can't we just fucking get along
with people, you know? Hello China.

571
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:56,190
How are you? Is this how you want to
run your country? Well, God bless you.

572
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:59,430
This is how we run our country. You
know, you want some apples? I mean,

573
00:35:59,431 --> 00:36:02,870
how fucking hard is that?
I know,

574
00:36:02,871 --> 00:36:07,550
I just oversimplified it
anyways. Um, oh, lastly,

575
00:36:07,551 --> 00:36:09,820
but not leastly. Uh, I did, uh,

576
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:14,860
an episode of Conan O'brien last night
to hype my show at Madison Square Garden

577
00:36:15,621 --> 00:36:19,130
November 7th.
I'll be there with Joe Barton,

578
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,280
nick and the pride of Trenton,
New Jersey,

579
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:24,980
Paul Versey on November 7th.

580
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,090
I'm very excited about
that. And a, as always,

581
00:36:29,091 --> 00:36:33,740
I had the best time on, uh, on Conan ease,

582
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,540
him and Andy,
they're the best.

583
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:38,150
Colin's sets you up and
then if you get in trouble,

584
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:41,600
Andy saves you actually joked with
Andy when I left. I said, you know,

585
00:36:41,601 --> 00:36:45,380
I think you only end to save me one time,
maybe twice.

586
00:36:45,381 --> 00:36:46,760
I think he jumped in twice.

587
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:51,820
So my idea of a perfect game on
Conan is Andy never has to save me.

588
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:59,330
He's always two to five
times every segment. But um,

589
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:04,550
I had a great time. I actually got
there a little bit early. Um, and um,

590
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:08,590
I got to go check out the drum kit,
which was,

591
00:37:08,591 --> 00:37:10,820
was fucking bad SSD W kit.

592
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:17,290
So I sat down and actually played
them for a couple of minutes and uh,

593
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:17,951
I don't know what that is.

594
00:37:17,951 --> 00:37:22,951
That always like makes me more
relaxed before I go out and uh,

595
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:24,820
yeah.

596
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:28,360
Then do a show. I don't know why.
Maybe because I'm a fucking lunatic.

597
00:37:28,361 --> 00:37:32,960
I have no idea. So I actually got to
sit down at James Woolworths kit. Um,

598
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,300
sounded amazing.
I was like,

599
00:37:34,301 --> 00:37:39,020
you sure he's not going to get pissed if
I sit days egg. That's fine. Good. Um,

600
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:44,200
but, uh, anyways, I had a great time on
it. If you'd like to see some clips, uh,

601
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:47,320
maybe we'll, I'll post some links
or something like that to it.

602
00:37:47,321 --> 00:37:48,850
I had a great time as always.

603
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,270
I'm so thank you to everybody
over at Kona for helped me, uh,

605
00:37:56,350 --> 00:38:00,490

standing there in a big empty arena.

606

All right. That's the podcast here

Um, music interlude here.

608
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,740
Musical interlude before we,

609
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:16,450

podcasts from earlier in the year of

610
00:38:16,451 --> 00:38:19,310
fucking 10 years ago. I have no idea
how it works. All right, I'll see you.

611
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:36,783
[inaudible]

612
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:54,270
let's get back to this out
here. I, uh, had a great time
last night. Um, I did, uh,

613
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:59,490
surprised, not so surprised.
Um, guest spot at, uh,

614
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:05,750
on the fucking, what the fuck?
The, uh, the, all the all in tour.

615
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:10,010
Sorry guys. I've you, can you tell him
and drinking again? Drinking again.

616
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:14,840
Oh baby. I'm Drake. And again, I went 73
fucking days with that, without the booze.

617
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:18,250
And uh,
Versie Bart,

618
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:22,230
nick in law had all came in
Saturday night after, um,

619
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:27,870
my second show over here at the Mirage.
And,

620
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:32,910
uh, I came back to my room
and I was waiting for them.
They were on their way up.

621
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:37,200
Kevin Shay opened for
me. All right, so all,

622
00:39:37,201 --> 00:39:38,460
all the fucking maniacs.

623
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:43,610
We're out here and I'm sitting there
with the lovely Nia and she's going,

624
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:47,730
I'm tired. I'm like, I'm
tired too. I swear to God, if
these guys weren't in town,

625
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,500
I would just go to bed.

626
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:55,190
And they showed up.
We had a couple of drinks,

627
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,950
made some cigars sitting on a table, and
I go to my wife, hey, you know, like,

628
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:03,950
let's just, we're just going
to go outside, smoked a cigar.

629
00:40:03,951 --> 00:40:07,120
I'll be back in a couple of hours
or whatever. And that was like it.

630
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,060
I don't know what that was. That was
probably just a little bit after midnight.

631
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,530
And I don't, you know, I started
drinking and I just became that guy,

632
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:19,790
that guy who just wants to keep
going and does not want to go home.

633
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:22,220
And a Bart,
nick was joking,

634
00:40:22,221 --> 00:40:25,940
said what we did was basically they could
have shot a commercial for Las Vegas

635
00:40:25,941 --> 00:40:28,730
is what we did. Um, I hate to say it.

636
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:33,790
We did and we just did old school Vegas
shit that was not old school when I

637
00:40:34,161 --> 00:40:35,390
first started coming to Vegas,

638
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:39,830
but I've been out here for 15 years in
like the new schools go into the Dj Shit,

639
00:40:39,831 --> 00:40:43,730
so I know what the fuck
we did. We signed that.

640
00:40:43,731 --> 00:40:45,320
I think we ended up over the Venetian

641
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:48,810
and uh,

642
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:54,570
we were already smoking cigars. I don't
really even remember. I was just pounding.

643
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,650
Well,
where are we?

644
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:03,650
I played roulette somewhere and
I made money and I cashed out.

645
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:09,370
Then we went over to the v Venetian.
I remember playing craps,

646
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:16,150
throwing the dice, and
it just kept going. Hey,

647
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:19,290
I started yelling and everybody's saying,
I'm throwing numbers over here. Right.

648
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:23,380
I just started throwing.
I did what I always did.

649
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:25,150
I bet to six of the
eight and the past bar.

650
00:41:25,151 --> 00:41:29,280
I should have bet the point
I hit the point twice. I
threw like fucking, I dunno,

651
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:31,030
1215 numbers in a row,

652
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,400
you know I was bullshit

653
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,390
man. I had like five bucks on each fucking
thing or whatever I made and I made a

654
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:40,790
couple hundred bucks cause I
was too drunk to realize like,

655
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,630
you know what you feel in it?
Why not throw down a little
bit more, but I didn't.

656
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:49,650
And it's people on the other end
of the table. Well going, hey,

657
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:53,100
you're built bar, you're throwing day. I
go, that's right. They're buttoned down.

658
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:54,350
I'd throw a numbers.

659
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:58,740
I was talking shit.

660
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:04,200
Oh it was Elvin elevator type tip and
people doing what you're supposed to do.

661
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,990
Laughing my ass off. I made
money. I went back over,

662
00:42:09,991 --> 00:42:10,890
cashed out.

663
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:16,310
I had like fucking three $100 bills in
my pocket after starting off with my own

664
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:19,230
hundreds. So I guess I
was up 200 bucks. Now,

665
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:22,680
all of a sudden this shady dude comes up
to us who had this weird little sodas,

666
00:42:22,681 --> 00:42:27,180
zipper scar on his nose and
he's had us a fucking flyer.

667
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:28,951
Oh wait,

668
00:42:28,951 --> 00:42:31,890
somewhere in there I met these two
Asian chicks and I talked them back into

669
00:42:31,891 --> 00:42:34,470
their dreams.
I can't answer that.

670
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:38,070
I'm just one girl.
She was an accountant.

671
00:42:38,071 --> 00:42:42,460
She wanted to be in fashion and I
was like, so go do that. She's like,

672
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,400
do you really think I care Mike?
Yeah,

673
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,050
you totally can just keep your day job
and just start working on the fashion

674
00:42:49,051 --> 00:42:52,200
thing and then eventually fashion
thing will surpass your other thing.

675
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:56,610
She was like, you're so awesome.
And all I'm thinking in my head is,

676
00:42:56,790 --> 00:43:01,790
this is why that fucking guy was able
to buy where the Houston Rockets used to

677
00:43:03,541 --> 00:43:06,990
play and go in there and talk about Jesus.
What the fuck is that guy's name?

678
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:12,120
You know that guy, you know?
Oh, what is his fucking name?

679
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:17,070
He's got the squinty eyes. He closes
his eyes and he sits there. You know,

680
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,150
Jesus wants you to have a popsicle.
He wants you.

681
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,740
All you gotta do is just tell people
what they, what they want to hear.

682
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:25,230
And I was totally sincere

683
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:29,180
when I told this woman
to go follow her dreams,

684
00:43:29,181 --> 00:43:31,700
but I didn't really give her
any sort of concrete plan.

685
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:35,990
All I did was just tell her that she
could do it and it made it feel good.

686
00:43:35,991 --> 00:43:38,920
So I did do a good thing,
but you know something, I,

687
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:43,490
if the bottom falls out of standup comedy,
that's what I'm going to,

688
00:43:43,491 --> 00:43:47,500
I'm going to turn into a
motivational speaker. I,

689
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:51,480
I would absolutely crush it because I
already know how to make people laugh.

690
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,650
And then, uh, rather than be in a
negative comment, I would totally turn it.

691
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,170
I would finally take off like,

692
00:43:59,500 --> 00:43:59,790
yeah,

693
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:04,460
you know, you don't want Spiderman wears
that black suit and he can't control it.

694
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:06,770
And he starts acting like a cunt,
you know,

695
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:11,210
start to talking shit to women and
spraying web web juice in their face.

696
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,420
Then he goes back to the, the classic
red and blue, and then he's like, oh,

697
00:44:14,421 --> 00:44:17,330
I'm sorry about that, sweetie.
Let me get that. Um, oh shit,

698
00:44:17,331 --> 00:44:21,530
I didn't finish that fucking story.
So this guy with a Goddamn Zipper,

699
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:23,510
stark scar on his fucking nose,

700
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:29,000
he convinces us to go to a titty bar,
which really wasn't difficult.

701
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:32,070
And next thing you,
we're in this fucking

702
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:36,720
titty bar and on, these women
were really goddamn aggressive.

703
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:42,120
Like the second you sat down, one of
them sat in your lap and I was like,

704
00:44:42,121 --> 00:44:44,760
it was really, that'd be honest
with you. It's fucking suffocating.

705
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,290
I actually just kind of like,
Hey,

706
00:44:47,291 --> 00:44:50,200
can you fucking let me
just get my bearings here

707
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:55,850
before you put quit trying to shake your
tits. They're fake. They're not moving.

708
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,540
All right. What do you do
next? Shake your elbow.

709
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:02,293
MMM.

710
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:05,380
So anyways,
we're in this fucking place

711
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,920
and uh,
I dunno.

712
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:15,450
I mean we're old guys. We don't
give a fuck. Next thing you know,

713
00:45:15,451 --> 00:45:19,620
it's like six o'clock in the
goddamn morning. Six something.

714
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:21,630
We came walking out,

715
00:45:21,631 --> 00:45:26,040
it was broad daylight and
I'm sitting there like,

716
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:31,480
the only thing I can relate it to
was when I was playing up in Alaska,

717
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:33,970
when,
uh,

718
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:38,680
when it was that one of those times a
year where I had like 22 hours of sunlight

719
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,760
and you were inside the club and you're
drinking and it's about two in the

720
00:45:42,761 --> 00:45:44,980
morning. Like, all right guys,
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

721
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:46,240
And then you would walk outside,

722
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:51,070
you'd open the door into broad daylight
and immediately your body's clock,

723
00:45:51,071 --> 00:45:54,400
you would wake up set at two in
the afternoon, two, two at night.

724
00:45:54,401 --> 00:45:57,760
It seemed like two in the afternoon
is the only way I could describe it.

725
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,150
And I walked out and uh,

726
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:03,940
all I heard was Kevin Chaise.

727
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:08,890
Maniacal fucking laugh at
like how light it was out. Um,

728
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,440
so that was my,
basically,

729
00:46:11,441 --> 00:46:13,780
that was my first night out here
and I gotta be honest with you,

730
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:17,590
I'm still recovering from it.
And that was two goddamn days ago.

731
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:22,990
Last night after our show.
I was just like, I sat down
and I got something to eat.

732
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:28,680
I had one Budweiser and then I went to
bed and I was fucking psyched to come

733
00:46:28,991 --> 00:46:32,350
back and go to bed. So that goes
back to what I was talking about.

734
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,100
So I have to dress maturely and right now,

735
00:46:36,101 --> 00:46:38,170
like I was ever a guy walking
around a tank top. I didn't,

736
00:46:38,171 --> 00:46:42,490
I didn't have any fucking a pigment,
you know, but I gotta tell you,

737
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:46,420
you got out on the pool. Some people, I
don't know if they just have, they just,

738
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:50,980
they can't see it or if they just don't
give a fuck some of this shit that

739
00:46:50,981 --> 00:46:52,930
people wear it down by a Goddamn pool.

740
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:56,203
I mean,

741
00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:00,720
it's just like, can you put that all
of that shit away? Can you put it away?

742
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:04,950
Half the people at the pool should be
wearing like one of those bathing suits

743
00:47:04,951 --> 00:47:07,800
from the roaring twenties you know,

744
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:11,910
where it was basically it was
kind of a mechanic suit like that.

745
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,010
Phones are used to wear that one z zip up,

746
00:47:14,011 --> 00:47:17,850
except you would cut the sleeves
off and you would cut the legs off

747
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:21,781
as what guys would wear.

748
00:47:21,781 --> 00:47:24,420
And women wear the same thing and they'd
have a little frilly thing going around

749
00:47:24,421 --> 00:47:28,330
the outside. Now it's unreal, man.

750
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:32,500
Oh Jesus. And my generation,
Woo. It's, it's ugly.

751
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:37,090
The tramp stamps the barbed
wire tattoo around your arm.

752
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:41,590
It's just a,
it's not a good fucking [inaudible].

753
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:42,883
It's just not a good one.

754
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:58,860
[inaudible] Hey,
what's

755
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:02,630
going on? It's Belper and it is the
Monday morning podcast from Monday,

756
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:06,680
August 23rd, 2010. How the hell are you?

757
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,070
What's going on? I uh, just
got back from Portland,

758
00:48:10,071 --> 00:48:14,120
Oregon actually taping this a Sunday
night cause I got a bunch of bullshit I

759
00:48:14,121 --> 00:48:16,700
have to do tomorrow.
Um,

760
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:20,990
I dunno what the fuck I just got back
from Portland and I hate doing these

761
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:25,400
things Sunday night because I'm
still like jet lagged. I'm out of it.

762
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:29,870
So, uh, this is gonna be a rough
one and I'm plowing through this.

763
00:48:29,871 --> 00:48:31,340
Even if it fucking sucks,

764
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:36,640
I'm not stopping it and rerecording it
like I did last week because that ended

765
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:39,740
up getting me in trouble.
That's how I started talking about that.

766
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,130
Dr Laura Shit last week.
And I got to say for the first time,

767
00:48:43,131 --> 00:48:44,300
maybe the second time ever,

768
00:48:44,301 --> 00:48:47,510
I'm nominating myself as Douche bag of
the week because last week I actually

769
00:48:47,511 --> 00:48:52,370
supported Dr Laura Cause I had no
fucking idea who she was. And uh,

770
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:56,750
you know, I was having a rough time
doing the podcast. I needed some fodder.

771
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:59,210
Somebody send me an email,
what do you think about this?

772
00:48:59,211 --> 00:49:02,840
And I watched like a ten second clip of
evidently a five minute clip and I just

773
00:49:02,841 --> 00:49:06,770
thought she was imitating
something, something she saw
on def jam. So I was like,

774
00:49:06,771 --> 00:49:09,940
well she's quoting it, she's not
calling anybody that word, but the, the,

775
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:13,900
the bed and all that bullshit.
And then Jay's, oh Jesus.

776
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:15,740
The fucking emails came in

777
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:20,500
from a I ever deadly. Uh,
for my 14 podcast listeners.

778
00:49:20,501 --> 00:49:25,090
Evidently like six of them
are African American. Um,

779
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:26,891
and uh,
yeah,

780
00:49:26,891 --> 00:49:31,390
they read me the riot act in different
stages and I've got to admit they will

781
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:33,370
fucking write cause I didn't,
I didn't, you know, something.

782
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:37,300
My uninformed logic is usually funny that
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking

783
00:49:37,301 --> 00:49:40,870
about and I go off on shit and I realized
that our race probably isn't one that

784
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:44,650
you should probably do that on. I
didn't know that. She was like, uh,

785
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:48,640
like rush Limbaugh with the comment.
I had no idea. I just, you know,

786
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:53,140
I don't know the fuck she was that she
was some soccer mom with a podcast,

787
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:58,550
you know, at, she was like all the crazy
kids out there, fucking blah blah blah.

788
00:49:58,551 --> 00:50:02,860
I had no idea. Sorry.
Fucking eggs on my face. Um,

789
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:07,930
but you know, it's funny, one guy got
so into fucking trashing me, wait,

790
00:50:07,931 --> 00:50:11,380
before I close this email,
here's something I got from uh,

791
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:15,520
a former marine talking
about that clapping for, uh,

792
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:18,910
the troops going through the
airport. He goes, as a former marine,

793
00:50:18,911 --> 00:50:23,080
nothing was a bigger joke than seeing
those support, the support, the troops,

794
00:50:23,081 --> 00:50:28,081
stickers talk about an empty
gesture and is even lamer.

795
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:33,050
I've always fucking thought those bumper
stickers with stupid support the troops

796
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:33,051
.

797
00:50:33,051 --> 00:50:38,051
She does Sligo by that for a buck slapping
on the back of your truck or car and

798
00:50:38,061 --> 00:50:42,380
then he just drive away. Well, I did
my part. Do you support the troops?

799
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:47,390
Have you looked at my bumper
sticker will. All right then. Um,

800
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:51,470
yeah, that's fucking lame. Um,
he said clapping is even lamer.

801
00:50:51,471 --> 00:50:56,000
He said you're on the right track. Sending
over drinks to veterans who got back,

802
00:50:56,001 --> 00:50:59,780
but think bigger. How about a
program called head for heroes?

803
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:02,320
That's right.
Every,

804
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:06,620
every service member of returning from
whatever fucked up Third World Shit hole

805
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:11,980
we're engaged in at the time gets met at
the airport by some gorgeous whore and

806
00:51:12,171 --> 00:51:15,170
blown in a specially designated area.

807
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:19,010
That would be a great way of
showing the country's gratitude.

808
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,360
You know what? I think if he can bail
the bankers out, give him $1 trillion.

809
00:51:23,361 --> 00:51:26,540
I think it's, you can get a couple
of fucking who is, you know,

810
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:31,430
forget about the girls who have a
fucking uniform fetish. Um, but anyways,

811
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:35,150
uh, yes. So I got, I
got fucking trashed. Um,

812
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:37,610
I took a little heat off of Mel Gibson.
I bet.

813
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:41,870
Then he heard a couple of less fucking
hate mails last week, so I apologize.

814
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,480
I don't know who she is.
I'm not gonna Apologize For my stupidity,

815
00:51:44,481 --> 00:51:47,370
but in the future when it's
something, you know, race-related I,

816
00:51:47,371 --> 00:51:51,230
I will try to be a little more
informed. All right, well,

817
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:55,040
I've got to find this fucking email with
this guy fucking trashed me. You know,

818
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:59,480
he said, uh, Dah, Dah, Dah,
Dah. Let's see. He goes,

819
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:02,240
it starts off good. Just trashing
me, which I totally get it. He goes,

820
00:52:02,241 --> 00:52:05,420
just like in your bit, you did
about the Jimmy, the Greek thing.

821
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:09,290
It's best for white people to just
leave it alone. Dr. Laura May be old,

822
00:52:09,291 --> 00:52:13,220
but she's aware enough to
know what happens to white
people when they say the n

823
00:52:13,221 --> 00:52:16,130
word or bring up racial
supremacy theories. See,

824
00:52:16,131 --> 00:52:17,350
that's the part of the tape I did.

825
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:21,780
I showed up,
showed

826
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:25,560
up late to that rally. You
know, by the time I showed up,

827
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:29,340
they'd already put the cross
out. You know, everybody's
hoods. They took him off.

828
00:52:29,341 --> 00:52:31,290
It was a hot day.
I didn't know what I was walking into.

829
00:52:31,291 --> 00:52:35,070
I thought it was like a fucking, you
know, a meeting or something. You know,

830
00:52:35,071 --> 00:52:39,750
we're all over by the table. I haven't,
don't, it's my fault. I came in late. Um,

831
00:52:39,751 --> 00:52:42,030
so anyways,
he said the podium comes out.

832
00:52:42,031 --> 00:52:45,300
So I'm surprised you defended
Dr Laura in this case.

833
00:52:45,301 --> 00:52:47,610
They asked where I got a lot of them
surprise you. Defend it or can we,

834
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:50,700
cause I watched eight seconds of
the tape because I'm Maura. Um,

835
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:53,820
I don't understand why there's
any debate about racial int, Eh,

836
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:58,290
why any debate about racial inequality
always comes down to comedians and def

837
00:52:58,291 --> 00:53:02,760
comedy jam. I don't think it does,
but evidently a, in your world,

838
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:06,990
maybe it does. Um, I've heard
this argument before, well,

839
00:53:06,991 --> 00:53:11,991
black comedians say this and that
about white people and say the n word,

840
00:53:13,171 --> 00:53:17,970
why can I, is it fair for minority
comedians but put up data and all basic,

841
00:53:17,971 --> 00:53:21,450
all that's all that shit. Uh, I'm
trying to get to this part here.

842
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:26,580
So then he was talking about this
documentary where some comic was saying,

843
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,340
you know, making a joke, this is actually
a good joke where white people like,

844
00:53:29,341 --> 00:53:33,880
why can't I say the n word? Uh,
and then the dude was like, Oh,

845
00:53:33,881 --> 00:53:37,240
it was Chris Rock. Well, why
do you even want to say it?
Right. Great. Fucking joke.

846
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:42,070
Totally makes sense. And then the
punchline is, I've sailed the world.

847
00:53:42,071 --> 00:53:46,120
I've fucked Raquel Welch.
If I could just say the n word,

848
00:53:46,121 --> 00:53:50,290
my life would be complete. Uh, then
this do rights after that. He goes,

849
00:53:50,291 --> 00:53:55,000
I think that it bothers white people
because you're not used to being told that

850
00:53:55,001 --> 00:53:56,140
you can't do something.

851
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:59,920
Why people used to be able to
do and say anything they wanted.

852
00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:04,960
Now there's all these rules.
Isn't that fucking that,

853
00:54:04,961 --> 00:54:07,990
that part of the email. That's where it
just went off the fucking rails for me.

854
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:12,430
You know what I mean? It's like I
totally get it. She's a fucking idiot.

855
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:16,930
I didn't realize it because I watched
that short little clip, you know,

856
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:20,980
I shouldn't have support that shit.
And, and you're offended by that,

857
00:54:20,981 --> 00:54:24,700
which I totally get. And then
in the end, you make some dumb,

858
00:54:24,701 --> 00:54:29,050
general generalization about white
people. See, we're all the same.

859
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:33,930
We're fucking morons.
Jesus Christ.

860
00:54:33,931 --> 00:54:37,110
I've sailed the world. Fuck walk.
How we'll see. That part's the joke.

861
00:54:37,111 --> 00:54:40,200
But this here is what he writes bothers
white people that you're not being used

862
00:54:40,201 --> 00:54:45,180
to told, being told that you
can't do something. Oh yeah, yeah.

863
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:50,110
We just run around doing whatever the
fuck we want to do. It's great. Ah,

864
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:51,150
Jesus Christ.

865
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:55,710
That's one of the great stereotypes
is that we're all Kennedy's living on

866
00:54:55,711 --> 00:54:57,870
fucking Martha's vineyard
rather than fucking,

867
00:54:58,860 --> 00:54:59,660
yeah.

868
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:02,330
You know, the majority of
white people are out there.

869
00:55:02,331 --> 00:55:06,110
Majority of white people sitting
in cubicles not living their dream,

870
00:55:06,111 --> 00:55:08,750
drowning in a sea of fucking debt,
trying to get health insurance.

871
00:55:08,751 --> 00:55:11,960
Isn't that the majority of fucking
white people? Evidently not.

872
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:15,590
Evidently according to this guy,
white people have yachts

873
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:22,940
sailing the world. All 300
million of us, you know?

874
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:27,440
Do you just see it during that, the Gulf
War, uh, the Gulf spill there, you know,

875
00:55:27,441 --> 00:55:29,480
that was one of the biggest problem.
All those white people,

876
00:55:29,481 --> 00:55:34,220
all the 300 million white people with our
fucking yards, just sailing around. Oh,

877
00:55:34,221 --> 00:55:36,770
it's so awesome to be white. You can
just walk up, you can do what it say,

878
00:55:36,771 --> 00:55:40,700
whatever you want to do.
It's fucking incredible. Um,

879
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:45,350
that's an argument I've, I've
gotten to, uh, with the, um,

880
00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:50,100
I think every fucking,
yeah.

881
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:55,350
Female comics, black comics, every fight.
They just go, yeah, it's easy for you.

882
00:55:56,220 --> 00:56:00,000
All you gotta do is show up,
man. Oh yeah, that's all it is.

883
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:05,640
I don't even audition. I just lay here
and they call me up and I'm like, why?

884
00:56:05,641 --> 00:56:09,330
Why did you give me that part then?
Cause your white, here you go.

885
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:14,160
You don't have to work
for shit. Uh, you know,

886
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:17,760
that's that class, you know, that's that
fucking double standard right there. Okay.

887
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:19,590
Now we're opening a whole
nother can of worms.

888
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:21,660
Let's talk race for the next
couple of weeks. People.

889
00:56:21,661 --> 00:56:26,060
This ought to bring out a lot of ugliness.
Um, that's that classic fucking like,

890
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:29,050
that's one of those statements like you,
if you flip that thing,

891
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:30,490
what you just said there,

892
00:56:30,491 --> 00:56:34,420
that generalization that you made of
white people that basically what we just

893
00:56:34,421 --> 00:56:35,350
sit around and they do.

894
00:56:35,351 --> 00:56:39,070
People just give a shit and we can
do whatever the fuck we want to do.

895
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,410
You're basically going to
define us by the Illuminati.

896
00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:44,123
Um,

897
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:49,830
if you flip that around and somebody
white says that about another race of

898
00:56:49,831 --> 00:56:53,550
people than there are in like a
Mel Gibson situation. All right,

899
00:56:53,850 --> 00:56:55,650
now I'm open this up for discussion.

900
00:56:55,651 --> 00:57:00,060
I'm not opening this up for
fucking rednecks to come
on here and be like, yeah,

901
00:57:00,061 --> 00:57:02,460
that's why the fuck I'm talking about.
I'm not saying it like that,

902
00:57:02,461 --> 00:57:04,320
but what I'm saying, you know
what? This is what I've learned.

903
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:08,040
Traveling the fucking Globe
and by the globe. I mean,

904
00:57:08,041 --> 00:57:11,010
I went to two other continents.
I went to Australia and Europe.

905
00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:18,090
I did all my research with just white
people. All right. And uh, yeah,

906
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:23,040
I think pretty much people
are people. We're all the
same. You know, there's a few,

907
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:28,160
like very small percentage of people on
this planet are genuinely good people

908
00:57:28,471 --> 00:57:30,210
and everybody else is
pretty much full of shit.

909
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:33,330
And everybody looks at everybody else
and they think they got it easier.

910
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:36,330
And all you gotta do is l
you've got to do is this,

911
00:57:36,810 --> 00:57:39,930
I got to work twice as hard as this guy
and this guy does this and you know,

912
00:57:39,931 --> 00:57:40,980
no one wants to know

913
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:46,820
what I've learnt. Well, you probably
don't to know because I'm a fucking moron.

914
00:57:46,850 --> 00:57:48,920
But for what it's worth,

915
00:57:48,950 --> 00:57:52,760
this is what I've learned in
life is that life isn't fair.

916
00:57:52,790 --> 00:57:55,910
It's really fucking difficult.
But if you bust your ass,

917
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:00,530
you're gonna make it on whatever
level you're going to fucking make it.

918
00:58:00,531 --> 00:58:05,531
You surround yourself with positive
people and you don't fucking quit when

919
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:08,150
somebody kicks you in the fucking chest,
you get back up again.

920
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,290
You don't walk right into his foot.

921
00:58:09,291 --> 00:58:12,800
You go around finding different fucking
avenue or maybe build your own avenue.

922
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:14,630
You do whatever you're
going to fucking do.

923
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:18,170
And everybody's got different
starting positions and all that shit,

924
00:58:18,171 --> 00:58:21,920
and it isn't fucking fair and there's
nothing you can fucking do about it. But,

925
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:23,241
uh,
you know,

926
00:58:23,241 --> 00:58:27,590
and there's some people who don't get
stuff because of who they are because

927
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:30,220
they're there. So they're dad
or they're fat or that they're,

928
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:32,480
they're fucking in an
Asian guy with one leg.

929
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:37,990
Okay. And he can't work at a Goddamn
fucking place. We get a fake Tan,

930
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:41,530
you know? Yeah. That shit definitely
fucking exists. But you know,

931
00:58:41,531 --> 00:58:44,680
what are you gonna do? You
know? But you know what?

932
00:58:44,681 --> 00:58:48,640
I think most people don't make it because
they're fucking pussies and they just

933
00:58:48,641 --> 00:58:51,850
tap out, you know? And I'm
talking about fucking wipe.

934
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:54,610
I'm actually talking mostly white people,
cause that's what I know, you know?

935
00:58:54,611 --> 00:58:56,020
And I got, I got people, people I know,

936
00:58:56,021 --> 00:59:00,310
they just fucking quit and they got all
these fucking excuses why they can't

937
00:59:00,311 --> 00:59:02,710
fucking do it. And it's
like, no, you, you quit,

938
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:08,170
you got punched once in the face and then
you just fucking laid down and I going

939
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:12,160
to fucking blame everybody else.
Right. Did that make any fucking sense?

940
00:59:12,161 --> 00:59:13,630
I'm trying to say something positive here.

941
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:19,140
Trying to be balanced where
it's like, I know, you know,

942
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:21,770
like female comics, they're always
fucking complaining, but you know,

943
00:59:21,771 --> 00:59:23,680
I can't tell you the amount
of fucking times I would,

944
00:59:23,681 --> 00:59:27,200
I would be auditioning for festivals and
the industry becoming up to me going,

945
00:59:27,201 --> 00:59:29,810
we need funny women.
Where are the funny women?

946
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:33,890
And then they would pick a fucking
woman just cause they needed one.

947
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:37,610
Not because they were one of
the funnier fucking people.

948
00:59:37,611 --> 00:59:41,560
I'm not saying that female comics
aren't funny, but I'm just saying there.

949
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:45,650
There are examples. You know what?
You guys can all go fuck yourself.

950
00:59:45,651 --> 00:59:48,710
I'm a balding redhead trying to get
into movies. All right? You know,

951
00:59:48,711 --> 00:59:51,410
cry me a fucking river. I
don't give a shit. All right?

952
00:59:51,411 --> 00:59:54,500
But I was wrong about the
doctor Laura thing. Okay?

953
00:59:55,390 --> 00:59:59,790
When I start a fucking group crying
about how there's no fucking redheaded

954
00:59:59,810 --> 01:00:03,920
action heroes out there. You know,
Jesus Christ. What's that fucking movie?

955
01:00:03,921 --> 01:00:05,360
That's number one movie in the country.

956
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:09,560
They got 58 fucking action stars in there.
One of them can't be a redhead.

957
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:15,010
Couldn't call up David Caruso to show
his pasty white ass walking up to

958
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:22,280
Arnold Schwartzenegger. Ah, gives a fuck.
All right, so there you go. That was,

959
01:00:22,281 --> 01:00:26,960
that was my, that was my roundabout
apology. Uh, no, seriously.

960
01:00:26,961 --> 01:00:27,950
I really felt bad about that.

961
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:32,030
Felt like an ignorant ass at a rather
than just immediately come on and

962
01:00:32,031 --> 01:00:33,650
apologize.
I left it up there for the week,

963
01:00:33,651 --> 01:00:38,390
so I get my nice pounding from everybody
and uh, yeah. You know what I mean?

964
01:00:38,391 --> 01:00:40,610
I fuck around and said a lot of
fucked up shit, but I, you know,

965
01:00:40,611 --> 01:00:43,580
I'm trying to start your week off right.
I'm not trying to Piss you off,

966
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:47,000
although there's probably a lot of women
out there who had fucking disagree,

967
01:00:47,001 --> 01:00:50,570
but you know, it's comedy. You
know, people, people get hurt.

968
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:54,230
That's how it fucking works.
This is the worst apology over,

969
01:00:54,270 --> 01:00:56,450
but it's coming from the heart. All
right, rights. Go Fuck Yourself.

970
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:59,840
That's how we got to end it all right.
I grew up with no hugs,

971
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:04,580
so if I'm trying to be fucking nice,
it has to end with go fuck yourself.

972
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:09,530
Um, speaking of go fuck yourself.
Um, I just got back from

973
01:01:09,550 --> 01:01:13,820
in Portland, Oregon and I had a great
time up at the a helium comedy club,

974
01:01:13,821 --> 01:01:17,780
the grand opening helium
comedy club and Portland,

975
01:01:17,781 --> 01:01:21,200
Oregon is a city that I
have not worked in, um,

976
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:26,420
in 10 years because there was no comedy
club for a guy in my situation to come

977
01:01:26,421 --> 01:01:31,220
in there and work. Uh, I, I did work,

978
01:01:31,221 --> 01:01:35,810
there was a local club there but it
wasn't really a comedy club. It was,

979
01:01:35,811 --> 01:01:38,330
but it wasn't like the club owner.
This is basically what he would do.

980
01:01:38,331 --> 01:01:42,050
He would paper the room,
which is a, the showbiz term.

981
01:01:42,051 --> 01:01:45,710
He would just just call people up and I
talk about this last week I came fuckin

982
01:01:45,711 --> 01:01:49,400
remember he would just call
people up and just say, you know,

983
01:01:49,401 --> 01:01:53,480
or have this whole team of telemarketers
call up people and tell them that they

984
01:01:53,481 --> 01:01:54,650
want a comedy show.

985
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:58,640
And he would just call enough people
where he would fill up his room every

986
01:01:58,641 --> 01:02:03,250
fucking night of the week from Tuesday
through Sunday. And uh, everybody carried,

987
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:04,250
got in for free.

988
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:08,240
And then all he did was fucking just
throw food and drinks down their fucking

989
01:02:08,241 --> 01:02:11,660
throats. And that's how he makes
his million. But meanwhile,

990
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:16,120
the comedian stands on stage in front
of a bunch of fucking drunk overeaten

991
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:18,500
jackasses who could give
a fuck about the show.

992
01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:22,260
And you had to go up there on a Tuesday
night with a goddamn whipping a chair,

993
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:26,460
two shows, Friday, three
shows Saturday the guy would,

994
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:28,410
he wouldn't even let you
talk to the waitstaff.

995
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:30,900
You'd think if you put a
comedian through that bullshit,

996
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:33,450
they can at least try to get fucking leg,
you know,

997
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:35,880
try to get a little bit of action.

998
01:02:35,881 --> 01:02:38,430
He fucking cock block you on
like nine different levels.

999
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:41,190
It's a fucking horrific Gig,
is what I'm telling you.

1000
01:02:41,191 --> 01:02:44,670
And then the second you got a
TV credit and you said, hey,

1001
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:49,140
can I have an extra quarter the
next time I fly across the country?

1002
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:53,370
And then the guy that you just wouldn't
return your phone call. So he basically,

1003
01:02:54,210 --> 01:02:57,720
other than up and coming guys would
just be booking horrific talent.

1004
01:02:57,721 --> 01:03:02,721
So Portland has been really starved
for any sort of national headliners.

1005
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:05,880
So now there's a new club out there and
I was really excited to be the first guy

1006
01:03:05,881 --> 01:03:09,660
to come to town and uh,
and have, uh, you know,

1007
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:11,370
work the comedy club.

1008
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:15,030
And I had no idea how bad that other
club was until I talked to some of the

1009
01:03:15,031 --> 01:03:18,800
younger comics. This guy told me,
he walked in there to do with spot.

1010
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:20,100
He moved up from,
uh,

1011
01:03:21,390 --> 01:03:25,950
from host to feature in that club owner.
Guy Calls him and he's like, look,

1012
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:29,220
I make $1 million a
year just selling food.

1013
01:03:30,570 --> 01:03:35,550
That's what he said.
When you get on stage,

1014
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:40,380
no f bombs. It just reads them the
fucking riot act. It's, it was horrible.

1015
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:42,930
It's great business model.
He's made his money,

1016
01:03:42,931 --> 01:03:45,870
but it's fucking horrible for
the development of Comedians.

1017
01:03:45,871 --> 01:03:47,970
He's just sitting on their fucking chest.

1018
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:49,653
Okay.

1019
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:52,770
And that Dick's, he's not even letting
them get fucking lay. What did they,

1020
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:56,980
you know, just asshole
fucking asshole. Um,

1021
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:01,330
so it's great that there's a new comedy
club out there and that the, you know,

1022
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:05,230
there's another place for these comics
to work and that they can actually see

1023
01:04:05,231 --> 01:04:06,130
national headlines.

1024
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:09,640
Cause that was a fucking big thrill for
me when I was back in Boston. So, uh,

1025
01:04:09,850 --> 01:04:13,660
so if you live in the Portland area,
you know, if you're a lumberjack,

1026
01:04:13,661 --> 01:04:18,010
climbed down out of the fucking tree
and come on down and do a helium comedy

1027
01:04:18,011 --> 01:04:21,490
club. It's a great club. And uh,
he's got C's who's he got next week?

1028
01:04:22,270 --> 01:04:25,660
He's got a
Jimmy Pardot

1029
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,910
is who he's got Jimmy Pardot a right.

1030
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:34,530
Is that what is what I think
there was one other person, um,

1031
01:04:34,890 --> 01:04:36,000
oh,
Reggie watts.

1032
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:41,030
Reggie rots on Wednesday and then Jimmy
Pardot from the never not funny podcast.

1033
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:44,160
Jesus Christ. I'm losing my goddamn
memory. I knew there was somebody else.

1034
01:04:44,161 --> 01:04:47,010
So go check out those
shows next week and uh,

1035
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:51,870
support a comedy club that actually
will book somebody who's funny and on

1036
01:04:51,871 --> 01:04:56,090
television. All right, low
plowing ahead here. Um,

1037
01:04:56,670 --> 01:04:59,970
what's the next thing on the docket? I
really have. I don't have shit this week.

1038
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:03,450
Do I have one of my 17 minutes in?
That's not bad.

1039
01:05:04,070 --> 01:05:07,380
You gonna fucking tap out
at 40 minutes yet. You know,

1040
01:05:07,410 --> 01:05:10,800
you guys don't go home early every once
in awhile and just fake a fucking injury

1041
01:05:10,801 --> 01:05:15,060
at work. Try to pretend like a
forklift drove over here or some shit.

1042
01:05:15,390 --> 01:05:18,550
You know what I really wanted to do was
I wanted to up that five hour energy

1043
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:23,170
here on the Internet,
five hour energy.

1044
01:05:24,070 --> 01:05:25,660
Now this is how I do my research now.

1045
01:05:25,661 --> 01:05:30,661
Five hour energy I think is a liquid
cocaine and I think it really fucks with

1046
01:05:32,291 --> 01:05:36,130
you yet. I think it's bad. So, um,

1047
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:40,150
rather than just look up five
hour energy consumer reports,

1048
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:45,150
I'm going to search five
hour energy unhealthy. See,

1049
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:46,870
and this is how most people do research.

1050
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:50,170
They already have their mind made up
and then they just read shit that agrees

1051
01:05:50,171 --> 01:05:52,150
with them,
you know,

1052
01:05:52,151 --> 01:05:56,470
according to a fuck face.com um,
I'm exactly right.

1053
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:01,830
Side effects of five hour energy drink
shots. Are they unhealthily unhealthy?

1054
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:06,710
Let's read this one. This is the first one
that came up. Side effects of fibers. A.

1055
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:07,211
Okay.

1056
01:06:07,211 --> 01:06:12,211
I was at lunch today and my friend was
trying to get someone to drink five hour

1057
01:06:12,281 --> 01:06:14,230
energy caffeine shot.
So I,

1058
01:06:14,350 --> 01:06:18,610
I opened it and smelled it
and said I'd give it a shot.

1059
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,210
Anyways, I think you're
supposed to mix them in a drink,

1060
01:06:22,211 --> 01:06:25,780
but I straight shrugs that, chugged
it, and almost gagged from the taste.

1061
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:29,920
After I swallowed it, it took me like
15 minutes to get that horrible taste.

1062
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:34,270
Uh, out of my mouth. I tried
eating food, chewing gum, drinking,

1063
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:37,360
but the taste stayed in my
mouth for like 40 minutes.

1064
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:41,230
I felt sick every time I
thought about the taste,

1065
01:06:41,231 --> 01:06:44,320
I think the tastes bothered me so
much. Ah, Jesus. Why you do research?

1066
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:46,690
Are you going to get to the part where
you had the heart attack so I can feel

1067
01:06:46,691 --> 01:06:47,524
like I'm right?

1068
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:49,360
Yeah.

1069
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:53,900
Take the taste bothered me so
much caffeine. But anyways,

1070
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:56,530
I'm shy. So after the tastes
and the sickness wore off,

1071
01:06:57,070 --> 01:07:02,070
I was feeling great all day and I felt
probably the happiest I have all school

1072
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:08,260
year because all my subtle tendencies
wore off and I acted more outgoing and

1073
01:07:08,261 --> 01:07:10,780
funny like I do around friends.

1074
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:14,140
They just turn this dude
into a fucking coke head.

1075
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:19,960
That's classic reason why people
do drugs. Helps me loosen up, man.

1076
01:07:19,961 --> 01:07:23,050
I could talk to the chicks.
Um,

1077
01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:27,010
there's nothing on here.
Are you shitting me?

1078
01:07:30,370 --> 01:07:33,500
Oh, gives a fuck. I just, you know,

1079
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:38,150
why don't you get eight hours sleep? Why
don't you do, why did you start that?

1080
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:39,553
You know,
I had somebody else,

1081
01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:43,440
another mother call in or call in or
write in going back to that fucking a,

1082
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:48,380
that shit I said about stay at home moms
and once again they were doing, she was,

1083
01:07:48,381 --> 01:07:51,860
she was saying, I totally agree with you.
I understand. You're absolutely right.

1084
01:07:51,861 --> 01:07:54,800
They have no right to be saying
it's the most difficult job ever.

1085
01:07:54,801 --> 01:07:59,510
And then she wrote three paragraphs about
how difficult it is to be a mother and

1086
01:07:59,511 --> 01:08:04,070
to be worrying up and
having the responsibility of
another life. And it's like,

1087
01:08:04,071 --> 01:08:07,520
I like, I don't, I get it. I know I don't
totally get it cause I don't have a kid.

1088
01:08:07,521 --> 01:08:12,210
But you know enough already. Alright,

1089
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:14,990
like that other listeners
said you chose to be a mother.

1090
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,150
You know you're acting like a,

1091
01:08:18,151 --> 01:08:20,520
all of a sudden you've got
like a fucking terminal disease

1092
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,950
and all you're doing is bringing up
the bad shit. What about when you have,

1093
01:08:24,951 --> 01:08:27,110
you have a bad day and you
come home and that kid with,

1094
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:30,440
you know all that innocent just
looks at you and just thanks.

1095
01:08:30,590 --> 01:08:34,860
You're bigger than life. What about
that? Doesn't that, that, that, you know,

1096
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:39,870
wash away some of the spittle
on your shoulder blade?

1097
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:44,540
I don't fucking know. You know,
it's funny, actually ironic. It was,

1098
01:08:44,541 --> 01:08:47,960
I was just watching 60 minutes and they
have one of those guys on the fucking BP

1099
01:08:47,961 --> 01:08:50,660
oil rig and I said when
they jumped off of it,

1100
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:54,770
it was the equivalent of jumping off
a three story fucking brownstone.

1101
01:08:54,771 --> 01:08:58,460
Evidently it's the equivalent of
jumping off a 10 story fucking building.

1102
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:00,950
That's what they did.
That was their choice.

1103
01:09:00,951 --> 01:09:05,080
Standing there in the middle
of the goddamn ocean either.
I burn up. All right.

1104
01:09:05,081 --> 01:09:08,630
Jump into the fucking oily water
without, oh, it was brutal.

1105
01:09:09,370 --> 01:09:14,050
Okay, so while you mom's stand the
fuck down, stop giving me shit.

1106
01:09:14,051 --> 01:09:15,430
I was just fucking joking around.

1107
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:17,950
I'm just gonna have to end up
apologizing to everybody here.

1108
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:23,860
You know I had somebody ran into me today
from a New Zealand podcast is really

1109
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:26,290
going to be random.
Somebody wrote into from a New Zealand,

1110
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:32,250
I was thinking about this topic that
for people in all these random countries

1111
01:09:32,561 --> 01:09:34,090
who listened to this podcast,

1112
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:37,940
I'm going to start nominating who I think
the coolest person from your country.

1113
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:42,820
Yes, and with new New Zealand,
I think it's a no brainer.

1114
01:09:42,821 --> 01:09:46,090
It's Phil Rudd.
You don't get any cooler than that guy.

1115
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:52,320
He's played the exact same drum beat for
fucking 35 years and he's such a tough

1116
01:09:52,691 --> 01:09:55,390
bastard that no one has the balls
to tell them to switch it up.

1117
01:09:57,070 --> 01:10:00,840
You don't feel like, how about boom,
check, boom, check, check. You know,

1118
01:10:00,910 --> 01:10:04,590
how about that
fucking guy?

1119
01:10:05,890 --> 01:10:08,170
The whole fucking,
the whole goddamn album.

1120
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:11,740
I think he just goes in there,
right?

1121
01:10:11,741 --> 01:10:14,860
And he just starts fucking playing
that beat and then they just,

1122
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:18,670
they just play the whole song,
the whole fucking album worth of socks.

1123
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:23,270
And then when they're done, they
just, they just started yet fail.

1124
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:25,513
Okay,

1125
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:28,740
fail. It's over. We're done.
Yeah. We made another album.

1126
01:10:29,710 --> 01:10:33,440
He just like, oh, all right. Yeah.
Just starts breaking down his kit

1127
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,190
out cheese. I got nothing. I
really riffing about Phil Rudd.

1128
01:10:38,810 --> 01:10:42,180
What's some of the wars beat box. And
you're ever gonna fucking here. Um, oh,

1129
01:10:42,181 --> 01:10:44,940
here we go. You know what? I got to read
this right here. Now I've got something.

1130
01:10:44,970 --> 01:10:49,650
This will take up a good three fucking
minutes. You know what? I liked it.

1131
01:10:49,651 --> 01:10:52,980
This podcast is this difficult. Now
you guys can relate to me. You know,

1132
01:10:53,110 --> 01:10:56,430
you sitting there and you Goddamn
cubicles on a fucking Monday unless you're

1133
01:10:56,431 --> 01:11:00,030
white, of course you're out on your yacht.
You know, chat it up with the Kennedy.

1134
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:04,070
Hey, when's the stock market going
to crash again? Give me the heads up.

1135
01:11:05,290 --> 01:11:09,730
Don't tell the Puerto Ricans.
That's what it's like.

1136
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:11,710
That's exactly what it's like.

1137
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:13,220
Okay.

1138
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:14,053
There's not white people

1139
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:16,860
work in farms.
Slaves to corporations.

1140
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:20,463
Yeah.

1141
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:24,240
Ah, not at all. Not at all. All you
do, you, you don't have to get up.

1142
01:11:24,270 --> 01:11:25,081
You don't even have to get up.

1143
01:11:25,081 --> 01:11:28,680
I spent nine years in bed just because
I was white and they just fucking

1144
01:11:28,681 --> 01:11:31,350
hilarious.
I made more money then than when I worked.

1145
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:35,880
That's how great it is to be white.
It's so fucking easy.

1146
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:38,910
And thank God for people who aren't white,

1147
01:11:38,911 --> 01:11:42,600
who've never been white to tell
me what it's like to be white.

1148
01:11:43,410 --> 01:11:44,460
It's fucking awesome.

1149
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:53,810
Let me tell you something about being
white white guy. This is how good it is.

1150
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:58,540
Oh yeah. What do you reincarnated,
what's your name? Frank,

1151
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:03,080
in another life. Um, is that a white guy
name? I don't fucking know. All right.

1152
01:12:03,470 --> 01:12:07,430
So anyway, so I've pissed off a bunch
of people and uh, I just want to,

1153
01:12:07,431 --> 01:12:11,490
I just want to try and redeem myself
and show you that it's not all bad. I,

1154
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:15,560
that's not all bad. You know, I do inspire
some people. Uh, here's one for you.

1155
01:12:15,610 --> 01:12:19,580
Milk white thighs is the name of this.
This email.

1156
01:12:19,581 --> 01:12:21,770
Somebody sent me a said bill,
a few things.

1157
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:26,360
The last five years I've been
six feet tall, 240 pounds.

1158
01:12:27,070 --> 01:12:30,200
Upon trying to work out with
no results and no willpower,

1159
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:35,120
I usually lose five pounds,
give up and sit in each shit.

1160
01:12:35,630 --> 01:12:40,280
However, you talked on the podcast a few
weeks ago about Bill Clinton and Al Gore

1161
01:12:40,550 --> 01:12:42,350
sloshing around the White House.

1162
01:12:42,350 --> 01:12:47,210
I believe I said sashaying around the
White House with their milky white hips.

1163
01:12:48,650 --> 01:12:53,600
Um, I was in a quiet room with
about 15 people and blurted, blurt,

1164
01:12:53,601 --> 01:12:57,200
laughed out loud, laughed
loudly, blurt laughed loudly.

1165
01:12:57,290 --> 01:13:01,160
That's really worded strangely. You
burst out laughing. There we go.

1166
01:13:01,550 --> 01:13:05,270
Ever since then,
I will be sitting watching TV,

1167
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:08,750
looking at my treadmill
and I will say to myself,

1168
01:13:09,530 --> 01:13:13,940
slosh your ass up there and work off those
milky white hips or something to that

1169
01:13:13,941 --> 01:13:18,200
effect. It makes me laugh every time
and realize how pathetic I've been.

1170
01:13:18,530 --> 01:13:23,530
It's been about three weeks of this every
day and 45 minutes on the treadmill.

1171
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:26,600
I'm down to 208 pounds.

1172
01:13:27,290 --> 01:13:32,060
Well on my way to my goal
of a hub of a buck 80. Also,

1173
01:13:32,061 --> 01:13:34,040
I'm a dude and my name is Lindsey.

1174
01:13:34,550 --> 01:13:36,680
I know you don't have a
lot of female listeners,

1175
01:13:36,681 --> 01:13:40,280
so if you ever feel like you need a
quote or just a woman's approval on

1176
01:13:40,281 --> 01:13:44,960
something, you do, feel free
to use my name and just say,
yeah, this chick Lindsay,

1177
01:13:44,961 --> 01:13:48,200
I know this chick,
Lindsey, you digs it. Uh,

1178
01:13:48,201 --> 01:13:52,070
I'm more than willing to compromise my
sexuality for the furthering of your

1179
01:13:52,071 --> 01:13:54,140
career.
Um,

1180
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:59,030
I would buy five of anything, Bill burrs
endorsing. All right. There you go.

1181
01:13:59,031 --> 01:14:03,350
There's a good email. Congratulations.
You're down to 208. Keep going.

1182
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:05,900
And, uh, I'm glad. You know,

1183
01:14:05,990 --> 01:14:10,220
I'm glad I just didn't bring all
negativity to the podcast this past week.

1184
01:14:10,221 --> 01:14:14,380
I felt fucking about that even though
I've been kind of a count again this week.

1185
01:14:15,010 --> 01:14:18,430
That's what I do. You know,
you came back, didn't you?

1186
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:24,110
You know, I don't know any better.
I'm just a white guy laying in bed.

1187
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:31,100
I can't remember the last time
I've had disappointment in my life,

1188
01:14:32,540 --> 01:14:35,900
which just doesn't happen. Just
doesn't happen. You know, you know,

1189
01:14:35,901 --> 01:14:40,340
sometimes the sale on my schooner
will break and I'm just like, AH,

1190
01:14:40,370 --> 01:14:44,030
Jesus Christ. And then I call the
government and I say, Hey, can you uh,

1191
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:46,650
can you send me another one? They're
like, why and what color are you? I said,

1192
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:51,610
why they guy? There you
go. Right on the way.

1193
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:56,140
You know, I agree with the first half of
the email. This guy I'm making fun of,

1194
01:14:56,141 --> 01:14:59,620
but I would love to send this guy
my fucking taxes. I really would.

1195
01:15:00,970 --> 01:15:02,020
These mother fuckers,

1196
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:06,040
what a lot of people don't realize is
that rich people feel there's enough rich

1197
01:15:06,041 --> 01:15:08,560
people and they got all kinds of fucking,

1198
01:15:09,430 --> 01:15:13,010
they take a fucking pipe to your God
damn knees every fucking quarter.

1199
01:15:13,030 --> 01:15:16,030
They make sure they can only be,

1200
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:20,350
they can only be a certain number that
are a fucking rich people unless you just

1201
01:15:20,351 --> 01:15:23,650
invent some shit. Like,
uh, I dunno. I Dunno what

1202
01:15:25,410 --> 01:15:28,790
if you come up with the technology
for the fucking iPod then even then,

1203
01:15:29,180 --> 01:15:32,510
I mean they'll just, they'll just hire
you on as like a scientist. Right.

1204
01:15:33,140 --> 01:15:35,510
I'm really getting to know over my
fucking head here. You know what I mean?

1205
01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:38,540
Do you come up with Facebook?
If you invent that?

1206
01:15:38,541 --> 01:15:40,850
I think that's the way now that you
can actually become fucking rich,

1207
01:15:40,851 --> 01:15:45,500
but I'll tell you right now, it's not
fucking telling jokes. Fucking assholes.

1208
01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:48,560
Fucking assholes.

1209
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:50,753
Yeah.

1210
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:55,420
God. Damn. Fucking quarter.
I gotta I gotta. Oh Gee.

1211
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:57,460
I am going to get into it.
I'm going going to fucking get it.

1212
01:15:57,570 --> 01:16:01,870
Just give me some me so
fucking mad. You're telling
me I think I'm getting ahead.

1213
01:16:01,871 --> 01:16:04,570
Look at me. Yeah, I'm getting
the hey a fucking sit down.

1214
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:07,690
That's what they do every quarter.
You sit the fuck down.

1215
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:11,050
You stay right where you're at.
Hey, sit right where you're at.

1216
01:16:13,450 --> 01:16:16,020
It's what it is. Anybody else?
This isn't even a color thing.

1217
01:16:16,021 --> 01:16:20,790
Anybody else in the fucking middleclass.
There you go. Fucking rich pricks

1218
01:16:23,870 --> 01:16:26,180
fucking last goddamn eight years,

1219
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:29,030
but then making a ton of fucking money
and then all of a sudden the shit hits

1220
01:16:29,031 --> 01:16:31,430
the fan and they run out
of the Goddamn restaurant.

1221
01:16:32,330 --> 01:16:34,200
Leave everybody else
with the fucking check.

1222
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:40,860
Fucking unbelievable.
My ever going to get that fucking car.

1223
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:42,150
I'll tell you,

1224
01:16:42,150 --> 01:16:45,510
I got off the plane today and somebody
had the dodge challenger and the all

1225
01:16:45,511 --> 01:16:48,990
white, like the vanishing point guys
ever see that movie with that dude?

1226
01:16:49,660 --> 01:16:52,650
Kuwalski he's getting an all white
chargers. So they did this tribute to,

1227
01:16:52,651 --> 01:16:57,270
it's all fucking white and the guy
had these fucking rims on it and uh,

1228
01:16:58,580 --> 01:16:58,770
yeah,

1229
01:16:58,770 --> 01:17:02,520
I just sat there drooling at it. My
girls looking at me like, she's like,

1230
01:17:02,521 --> 01:17:07,290
Jesus Christ, you were obsessed with
that car. It's like, yeah, you know,

1231
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:12,020
I am. Okay. Well, you know, I'm standing
here. You just get off the plane.

1232
01:17:12,021 --> 01:17:14,810
You could say hello to me.
You know,

1233
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:20,240
I know what that reminds me of.
I fucking went to go to this pizza place.

1234
01:17:20,241 --> 01:17:24,260
I really try to do fun things. When I
was in Portland, tried to be healthy.

1235
01:17:24,261 --> 01:17:28,670
I went for a fucking hike. I was
sticking with my smoothies, you know,

1236
01:17:29,450 --> 01:17:32,900
dropping pounds here and uh,

1237
01:17:34,290 --> 01:17:34,750
yeah.

1238
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:37,530
Anyway, somebody tells me that in, in
Portland they have this fucking wreck.

1239
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:41,580
They got this pizza parlor where they
had the best God damn pizza and all the

1240
01:17:41,910 --> 01:17:42,480
fucking northwest.

1241
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:47,370
So this guy has like this homemade goddamn
doe and he only makes so much of it

1242
01:17:47,371 --> 01:17:50,880
every day. And when he's done making
the dough, he's done making pizza.

1243
01:17:50,970 --> 01:17:55,770
Go Fuck Yourself. All right? So
I'm like, you know, well shit,

1244
01:17:55,771 --> 01:18:00,570
I gotta try this pizza. So I go on the
Internet, I look up, I see where it is.

1245
01:18:00,571 --> 01:18:05,190
It's right on Hawthorne Street,
like 45th and Hawthorne,

1246
01:18:05,191 --> 01:18:08,240
46 in Hawthorne, something like
that. Right? So I'm like all,

1247
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:10,470
I gotta go check this fucking thing out.
So I allow,

1248
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:15,500
I get myself an hour and a half before
the show to get there to get a God damn

1249
01:18:15,751 --> 01:18:19,410
pizza. Right? It's a fucking
pizza. Okay. So I call up,

1250
01:18:19,540 --> 01:18:24,150
just told me to cut just
to call this place. And uh,

1251
01:18:24,810 --> 01:18:27,060
I call up the,
it rings like 11,

1252
01:18:27,061 --> 01:18:31,700
12 fucking times and nobody picks up.
So I'm guy.

1253
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,660
You know what? They're probably
busy. No big deal. I got an hour,

1254
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:36,930
I'll get there an hour and a half
before, right? I get a goddamn cab.

1255
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:40,500
I'm driving over there. Cab driver
goes out. Just to let you know,

1256
01:18:40,501 --> 01:18:42,930
this guy's kind of like the
pizza Nazis, like, like the,

1257
01:18:42,931 --> 01:18:46,860
like the fucking a soup Nazi on Seinfeld.

1258
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:50,280
So I show up and I walk in. Lo
and behold, the place is packed,

1259
01:18:50,281 --> 01:18:55,110
but I see this little two top gets up,
waitresses cleaning off the table,

1260
01:18:55,111 --> 01:18:57,390
she walks away.
So I go over and I sit down,

1261
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:00,150
get re order the pizza,

1262
01:19:00,151 --> 01:19:03,390
I'm checking out what people are ordering
of getting excited is what I'm trying

1263
01:19:03,391 --> 01:19:06,870
to tell you. And then the weight
just comes over. She's like, um,

1264
01:19:07,530 --> 01:19:12,030
were you over in the waiting room next
door or did you just like walk in here

1265
01:19:12,031 --> 01:19:16,950
and sit down? And I was like, um, I
just came in and sat down. She goes,

1266
01:19:16,951 --> 01:19:20,850
yeah, you have to like thein in, um,

1267
01:19:20,851 --> 01:19:23,490
next door and all those people,
everything's,

1268
01:19:23,610 --> 01:19:27,390
everything's a question you
have to like sign in next door.

1269
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:32,580
And I'm like, oh, all right. I go, well,
how long is the wait? She's like, wow,

1270
01:19:32,581 --> 01:19:36,720
I can't really like say it's, you
know, it's kind of as a, at that point,

1271
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,920
he's like a quarter of, I go,
well, I've got to show at eight,

1272
01:19:38,990 --> 01:19:42,990
a quarter to 7:00 AM I going to have
time to order a pizza and eat it?

1273
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:47,400
She's like, yeah, now, now

1274
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:49,560
and um,

1275
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:54,420
and then that's when my blood starts
fucking boiling because I realized what I

1276
01:19:54,421 --> 01:19:56,460
just walked into.
You know what I walked into?

1277
01:19:56,610 --> 01:20:01,610
I walked into the pizza version of
pink's hot dogs out here in fucking La,

1278
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:07,520
the pizza version of magnolia bakery in
new city or that fucking place where you

1279
01:20:09,811 --> 01:20:11,670
get the hot dogs in Chicago,

1280
01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:14,263
you know,

1281
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:17,950
hour and 15 minutes to
make a fucking pizza.

1282
01:20:17,951 --> 01:20:21,790
You can't do that sky sitting
here acting like, you know,

1283
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:26,180
like he's making some sort of gourmet
for now. I'll tell you right now,

1284
01:20:26,181 --> 01:20:31,010
that's my overrated for the fucking week.
Standing in line at any restaurant.

1285
01:20:31,011 --> 01:20:34,130
These, you know, the, the, the
breakfast place in your neighborhood,

1286
01:20:34,610 --> 01:20:36,050
your girlfriend's like,
oh my God,

1287
01:20:36,230 --> 01:20:41,230
this stuffed French toast is to die for
and you stand there and fucking line.

1288
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:46,550
Never worth it. It's never
worth the hype, okay?

1289
01:20:46,850 --> 01:20:50,420
You learn anything from this podcast
other than I'm an ignorant asshole.

1290
01:20:51,260 --> 01:20:55,130
Don't ever stand in line for
fucking food. Okay? And less some,

1291
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:58,970
there's a natural disaster.
The places flooded and this,

1292
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:00,770
they're scooping out fucking pea soup.

1293
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:03,320
You know when you're putting
it into your baseball hat,

1294
01:21:03,321 --> 01:21:06,770
then you'll stand in line. Soup
kitchen. You stand in line,

1295
01:21:06,890 --> 01:21:10,040
but don't stand outside these fucking
places. It's stupid. It's never worth it.

1296
01:21:10,070 --> 01:21:12,770
You know fancy restaurants. You
don't stand outside. You call up,

1297
01:21:12,771 --> 01:21:13,940
you make a fucking reservation.

1298
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:16,700
But I'm not standing out there
like I'm waiting to fucking

1299
01:21:18,950 --> 01:21:20,430
did they even make goddamn sense.
You know what I mean?

1300
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:24,270
He's fucking people in New
York. They stand outside for
90 minutes for a cupcake,

1301
01:21:24,510 --> 01:21:29,100
for fucking cupcake. It's gone in three
seconds. You're just going to Piss me off.

1302
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:30,720
Is some people in Portland.
Okay.

1303
01:21:30,870 --> 01:21:34,200
They're actually going to figure out
what pizza parlor I'm talking about and

1304
01:21:34,201 --> 01:21:35,430
then they're going to tile. Tell me, dude,

1305
01:21:35,431 --> 01:21:38,700
it's totally fucking worth at
these low self esteem Douche bags

1306
01:21:40,350 --> 01:21:45,350
who just allow themselves to get totally
treated like absolute fucking shit for

1307
01:21:45,931 --> 01:21:48,810
pizza. Yeah. Sorry,

1308
01:21:48,811 --> 01:21:52,110
I can't make you a pizza within an hour
and 15 minutes. Well, you know what?

1309
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,490
Fuck you and your fucking pizza.

1310
01:21:54,491 --> 01:21:56,970
What do you think about that and
your number one goddamn rating.

1311
01:21:57,670 --> 01:22:00,720
I'll go to pizza hut.
Eat their fucking slop.

1312
01:22:03,230 --> 01:22:05,620
Doug, you got to kill him. He is that.
I know. I'm going to have to go back.

1313
01:22:05,621 --> 01:22:08,170
I have to try it.
People hyped it so much.

1314
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:12,730
That's what I'm really mad about is I
know as much as I just fucking talked

1315
01:22:12,731 --> 01:22:13,301
about that shit,

1316
01:22:13,301 --> 01:22:16,900
I'm going to have to go back down and go
get it and for all you guys wonder and

1317
01:22:16,901 --> 01:22:20,560
yelled at Magnolia. It's a great
cupcake, but it's not that great.

1318
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:25,540
It's not that great to have to stand there
and listen to that awful conversation.

1319
01:22:27,020 --> 01:22:28,660
Now if people driving by looking at you,

1320
01:22:28,661 --> 01:22:30,610
trying to figure out what are
they standing in line for,

1321
01:22:32,210 --> 01:22:33,043
you know,

1322
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:36,870
is the president,
they're doing a book signing.

1323
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:42,100
Is there a porn star there was going
to blow you at the front of the line.

1324
01:22:42,101 --> 01:22:45,490
Can I raise the stakes for something
funny within the last seven minutes?

1325
01:22:45,491 --> 01:22:48,670
All right. Fuck this. Fuck
this podcast. Here we go.

1326
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:53,310
Why don't I nominate some youtube
videos for the week? Everyone. Um,

1327
01:22:53,350 --> 01:22:57,880
I have a ton of them and I'm going to
make the bold rex Ryan statement that I

1328
01:22:57,881 --> 01:23:01,100
think pretty God damn soon,
if not already, the MLM,

1329
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:05,380
podcast.com it's going to have the best
fucking youtube video collection of

1330
01:23:05,381 --> 01:23:08,930
youtube videos. All right. I mean,

1331
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:10,700
cause you guys are on the cutting edge.

1332
01:23:10,730 --> 01:23:14,180
A lot of these videos that you guys
send me, they only got like, you know,

1333
01:23:14,210 --> 01:23:16,340
10,000 to 40,000 fucking hit.

1334
01:23:16,341 --> 01:23:20,660
Some of them have like a hundred thousand
or so like that and even a few with a

1335
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:22,070
million. But if they're really
funny, I don't give a shit,

1336
01:23:22,071 --> 01:23:23,930
but I think that we're on the
cutting edge of some shit.

1337
01:23:24,260 --> 01:23:27,590
Like here's two that I found
that, you know, only, you know,

1338
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:33,110
in the tens of thousands of hits. So
I'm assuming you haven't seen them. Uh,

1339
01:23:33,140 --> 01:23:35,450
look up a prank of the century.

1340
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:40,460
This woman puts on a mask and scares
the shit out of this other woman. And,

1341
01:23:40,870 --> 01:23:45,680
and it's, you gotta watch it. It's
fucking great. And then piss off.

1342
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:49,210
Pissed off.
Cat freaks out.

1343
01:23:50,450 --> 01:23:50,670
Yeah,

1344
01:23:50,670 --> 01:23:55,500
look up that one. Um, and we got a lot
of people, you guys like violent shit.

1345
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:58,470
I'm trying to categorize them now.
And by the way,

1346
01:23:58,471 --> 01:24:01,650
the MM podcast is the official fan page.
There's the Monday morning podcast.

1347
01:24:01,651 --> 01:24:02,484
If you don't have to,
you know,

1348
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:05,670
it's a pain in the ass to go on youtube
and try to find six different videos,

1349
01:24:05,671 --> 01:24:09,210
right? Typing it in and all
that shit. You're going to
get caught. You're at work,

1350
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:11,880
you're not supposed to be doing it,
but if he just subtly type in the Mlm,

1351
01:24:11,881 --> 01:24:13,730
podcast.com and nobody's fucking looking,

1352
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:17,760
all of them are going to be right there.
And you can watch one after another,

1353
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:20,910
you know, or you can make it
last the whole fucking day.

1354
01:24:21,330 --> 01:24:24,600
You can even drink that five hour fucking
energy and just start screaming at

1355
01:24:24,601 --> 01:24:29,430
your screen if you want. It's
all up to you. Um, so anyways,

1356
01:24:29,630 --> 01:24:33,360
uh, here's a couple of, for you fight
fans out here. I will start slow.

1357
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:37,720
Look up a choke slam.
Um,

1358
01:24:37,721 --> 01:24:39,190
I hope that's the name
of the fucking video.

1359
01:24:40,350 --> 01:24:43,960
Just referee reffing a fight and this,
it's a choke slam.

1360
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:48,840
Look it up. All right. Um,

1361
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:52,900
here's kind of a cute one. Says little
girl boxer. It's actually a boy.

1362
01:24:52,930 --> 01:24:56,470
His name's pretty Boyd. Bam, Bam. And
you gotta look at this fucking kid.

1363
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:58,600
This kid would kick the shit.

1364
01:24:58,630 --> 01:25:02,800
Just imagine this kid fighting
another fifth grader. Um,

1365
01:25:03,340 --> 01:25:04,990
and this is the most insane one.

1366
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:11,220
Boston Street fight guy with bat does
damage Boston Street fight guy with bat as

1367
01:25:14,261 --> 01:25:19,180
in baseball bat does damage.
Um,

1368
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:23,200
what else do we got?
Some ridiculous is something ridiculous.

1369
01:25:23,201 --> 01:25:24,850
Swollen in south Philly.

1370
01:25:26,210 --> 01:25:29,830
It's a guy walking around like he's got
a fucking hard on having conversations

1371
01:25:29,831 --> 01:25:32,620
with people. Sort of an old
bit. I've seen it done before,

1372
01:25:32,621 --> 01:25:37,030
but this guy does a
great, um, wrestling fans.

1373
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:37,890
We've got two for you.

1374
01:25:37,890 --> 01:25:42,890
A macho man on Coke and a ultimate
warriors confession is absolutely fucking

1375
01:25:44,621 --> 01:25:49,000
brilliant. You've got to look
at that one. And, uh, Oh,

1376
01:25:49,001 --> 01:25:52,960
more violence office worker goes insane.
Second Angle.

1377
01:25:53,740 --> 01:25:57,610
Evidently there's some new
footage. Uh, what else?

1378
01:25:59,270 --> 01:26:02,960
Oh, this is a great one.
Look up the turtle, man. This
one might be my favorite.

1379
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:05,660
This guy's missing all his front teeth.

1380
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:08,360
And when you find out how
he's missing his teeth,

1381
01:26:08,810 --> 01:26:12,950
it's just one of the great stories
that he g just alludes to it.

1382
01:26:12,951 --> 01:26:16,610
It's fucking awesome. It's just this
redneck who just fucking catches turtles.

1383
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:21,230
And a,
I swear to God,

1384
01:26:21,231 --> 01:26:24,350
I would pay admission to sit on the
side of the pond and just watch this guy

1385
01:26:24,351 --> 01:26:28,370
catching turtles. It's fucking hilarious.
And I actually getting into covers,

1386
01:26:28,450 --> 01:26:30,530
we talk about the worst
covers of all time.

1387
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:33,920
Here's a great one of the best covers
I've ever seen just as far as being

1388
01:26:33,921 --> 01:26:37,070
creative.
Look up a stairway to heaven,

1389
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:41,360
the beatniks and that's all
one word, B, e. A. T. N. I. X.

1390
01:26:41,361 --> 01:26:44,210
It's fucking cool as hell.
It's really fucking cool.

1391
01:26:44,211 --> 01:26:49,040
They do stairway to heaven the way the
Beatles would do it. It's really fucking,

1392
01:26:49,910 --> 01:26:52,670
I dunno, it's really creative. Um,

1393
01:26:53,690 --> 01:26:58,580
and speaking of movies,
here's one for you is, uh,

1394
01:26:59,310 --> 01:27:01,130
I got in this conversation
with somebody on the Internet.

1395
01:27:01,131 --> 01:27:05,180
They sent me an email and they were
talking about how, uh, you know,

1396
01:27:05,181 --> 01:27:06,050
they're not married yet,

1397
01:27:06,051 --> 01:27:08,450
so they're kind of hanging out with
people who are younger than them,

1398
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:11,720
so they get a little bummed out when
they make references to movies that

1399
01:27:11,721 --> 01:27:16,040
nobody's seen before. So, uh, he started
showing him some of the classics,

1400
01:27:16,041 --> 01:27:18,620
like the dirty dozen and that type
of shit. And he asked me, you know,

1401
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:21,330
what are some of the great fucking movies,
uh,

1402
01:27:22,490 --> 01:27:27,290
I should recommend with then let it to
like music and that type of shit. And,

1403
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:31,550
uh, here's a new topic for you. Is
it, do you guys have like songs?

1404
01:27:31,551 --> 01:27:34,420
You must have these, these fucking
songs that the second you hear him,

1405
01:27:34,421 --> 01:27:38,480
you can't hear the song without thinking
of the movie. You know what I mean?

1406
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:43,670
Of course you do. Here, I'll give you
a classic fucking example. And, uh,

1407
01:27:43,671 --> 01:27:47,210
I think even the broads will know
this one. Did I get rid of it?

1408
01:27:47,211 --> 01:27:50,720
I had it all fucking cued up.
I really am the worst.

1409
01:27:51,890 --> 01:27:52,880
Can I ever do this?

1410
01:27:52,881 --> 01:27:57,110
This is why I started off in fucking
radio and then my career quickly ended

1411
01:27:57,830 --> 01:27:59,570
because I would do the whole beginning.

1412
01:28:00,330 --> 01:28:05,330
You're listening to 6:40 AM
WEC be broadcast service,

1413
01:28:07,030 --> 01:28:09,860
the fucking whatever the fuck I
used to say. Hang on a second.

1414
01:28:09,861 --> 01:28:11,750
Let me get to youtube. God dammit, Bill.

1415
01:28:12,940 --> 01:28:13,700
Yeah.

1416
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:17,120
And now there's a lull. See what happens.
You know what? I'll play the other one.

1417
01:28:17,630 --> 01:28:21,680
Well, no, I can't do that. Have the end
and ability to do that shit. All right,

1418
01:28:21,681 --> 01:28:24,080
let me set the mic down. Hang on a
second. All right. Do you want it?

1419
01:28:24,170 --> 01:28:26,550
She act like your work and for once.
All right,

1420
01:28:26,990 --> 01:28:28,760
now I'm yelling at you
because I fucked up.

1421
01:28:29,630 --> 01:28:34,310
What the hell's the name of that
fucking Sabata oh, something.

1422
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:38,900
Something, something. Something.
Um, air. It is. I got it.

1423
01:28:41,170 --> 01:28:46,160
Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Oh,

1424
01:28:46,161 --> 01:28:48,440
you fucking content. Come on. Come up.

1425
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:51,350
Should I edit this out?

1426
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:55,940
You know what this is
like is when you fucking,

1427
01:28:55,941 --> 01:28:59,030
someone just told you what their
name is and then somebody you know,

1428
01:28:59,031 --> 01:29:02,730
comes walking in and you go to introduce
them and you have no fucking idea who

1429
01:29:02,731 --> 01:29:06,190
they are. That's how I'm speaking
right now. All right. What,

1430
01:29:06,191 --> 01:29:08,070
what movie does this remind you of?
Instantly?

1431
01:29:19,490 --> 01:29:22,670
Come on. You know what? You
know the movie, right? I
know. Most of you know though.

1432
01:29:22,671 --> 01:29:25,810
Even abroad's we'll get
it. Come on. You know this,

1433
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:30,500
I'll wait for the breakdown.
I'll wait for the breakdown of it.

1434
01:29:30,501 --> 01:29:31,334
Where the hell is it?

1435
01:29:35,420 --> 01:29:39,780
How was it? I had this whole fucking
thing queued up. This part right here.

1436
01:29:39,781 --> 01:29:40,614
You don't remember this?

1437
01:29:44,220 --> 01:29:47,270
Ah,
[inaudible]

1438
01:29:47,610 --> 01:29:50,190
I haven't did the sound effects.
Remember that reservoir dogs,

1439
01:29:50,191 --> 01:29:52,020
when he cuts the fucking dude's ear off.

1440
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:56,930
I used to love that Goddamn song and
I couldn't listen to it for 10 years.

1441
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:58,730
Cause every time I fucking heard it,

1442
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:02,750
I just thought about Marvin Nash
getting his Goddamn ear cutoff.

1443
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:06,620
Stop.
Stop yelling at him.

1444
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:11,740
Fuck yeah.
What a great piece of acting

1445
01:30:13,270 --> 01:30:17,140
by both of those guys who ever
played Marvin Nash. And, uh,

1446
01:30:18,070 --> 01:30:21,430
Mister Blonde. I can never remember
people's fucking names. Uh,

1447
01:30:21,730 --> 01:30:24,640
we'll call him Vince Gilligan. I Dunno
his fucking name and I want to fuck that.

1448
01:30:24,641 --> 01:30:25,474
I forget his name.

1449
01:30:26,550 --> 01:30:26,720
Yeah.

1450
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:29,990
You know, most guys to play a psycho
would act like a fucking psycho.

1451
01:30:29,991 --> 01:30:32,870
How they think a psycho supposed to act,
you know,

1452
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:37,850
and it just how fucking Cami was, you
know, that's what's really fucking scary.

1453
01:30:38,060 --> 01:30:41,150
Somebody cut your ear off on
and act like a fucking maniac.

1454
01:30:41,510 --> 01:30:43,670
You almost start laughing
halfway through it. Like,

1455
01:30:43,671 --> 01:30:48,050
is this guy mocking being crazy? But
it's the calmness with which he does it.

1456
01:30:48,290 --> 01:30:51,230
Here's another one for you.
These are really easy for like guy movie.

1457
01:30:51,231 --> 01:30:55,250
So I need some more, more suggestions.
I'm actually going to disguise this one.

1458
01:30:55,430 --> 01:31:00,430
I downloaded this song because of the
movie and I didn't realize that this

1459
01:31:00,471 --> 01:31:05,330
fucking Irish dude babbles telling some
fucking story for 20 minutes before they

1460
01:31:05,331 --> 01:31:08,270
get to the part that I
actually recognized. Uh,

1461
01:31:08,450 --> 01:31:10,460
let's see if you can guess this
one. Here we go. What movie

1462
01:31:11,860 --> 01:31:16,560
goes to wear
shoes to the main blog

1463
01:31:18,230 --> 01:31:19,810
that does with Joyce and lettuce,

1464
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:21,800
right? You're like, what the fuck is this?

1465
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:32,070
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1466
01:31:32,070 --> 01:31:33,720
I didn't,
I didn't want to get blood on the floor.

1467
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:38,990
Yep.

1468
01:31:38,990 --> 01:31:39,823
Well you know it.

1469
01:31:42,510 --> 01:31:43,343
[inaudible]

1470
01:31:43,550 --> 01:31:44,383
hello audio.

1471
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:49,150
Tion that's a Donovan singing a Atlantis.

1472
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:51,700
That was from a,
the Billy bad scene.

1473
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:56,140
When they start kicking the shit.
Fucking Billy bet.

1474
01:31:56,320 --> 01:32:00,680
Is there anything better than that
fucking camera when they're doing that?

1475
01:32:01,150 --> 01:32:04,990
Pointed up at Robert De Niro's character.
Jimmy just fucking kicking him.

1476
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:08,620
Rick flair. Couldn't do fake
kicks better than Robert Dinero.

1477
01:32:08,621 --> 01:32:10,420
You know it just sitting
there kicking him.

1478
01:32:14,550 --> 01:32:15,600
See this was bad.

1479
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:20,490
Billy batts was a made guy with
some real grease balls. Shit.

1480
01:32:20,940 --> 01:32:23,940
We did what we wanted.
We were wise guys. Right?

1481
01:32:25,050 --> 01:32:28,470
What's the last one I got here? So
I, I, you know, as usual, you know,

1482
01:32:28,471 --> 01:32:32,340
whenever people ask you these questions,
I can't end up, I can't remember them.

1483
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:34,733
MMM.

1484
01:32:35,710 --> 01:32:36,820
Let's see.
Here's one for you.

1485
01:32:36,821 --> 01:32:39,740
This is actually an interesting
one that's really fucking obscure.

1486
01:32:39,910 --> 01:32:42,940
This is one from a movie that
the dude ended up selling.

1487
01:32:42,941 --> 01:32:46,300
This is from cool hand Luke.
All right,

1488
01:32:47,110 --> 01:32:49,750
for those of you who've seen cool hand
Luke, if you haven't seen cool hand Luke,

1489
01:32:49,850 --> 01:32:51,460
you've got to fucking watch that movie,
right?

1490
01:32:51,850 --> 01:32:56,110
And basically the guy who did
the score, uh, wrote this song,

1491
01:32:56,111 --> 01:33:00,070
there's a scene where they
have to tar this road and uh,

1492
01:33:00,130 --> 01:33:02,530
Paul Newman's character,
you know,

1493
01:33:03,530 --> 01:33:06,920
rather than just sitting there and being
like, this is a miserable fucking job.

1494
01:33:06,921 --> 01:33:11,450
He gets them all amped up that it's
supposed to take all fucking day,

1495
01:33:11,451 --> 01:33:15,140
but he gets these guys so fucking
amped up, they just, they just fucking,

1496
01:33:15,141 --> 01:33:15,680
they just,

1497
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:20,120
it's like they took five hour energy
and before they just flying down the

1498
01:33:20,121 --> 01:33:21,650
fucking road and they're all laughing,

1499
01:33:21,651 --> 01:33:24,800
having a great fucking time when they
finished the road and they actually have

1500
01:33:24,801 --> 01:33:26,930
an afternoon off,
right?

1501
01:33:27,170 --> 01:33:32,000
So it was like Paul Newman's way
of saying fuck you to the, to the,

1502
01:33:32,001 --> 01:33:35,390
to the, to the screws. Is that what they
call them back down to the, to the guards.

1503
01:33:35,391 --> 01:33:38,150
Right. So they had to
have this music. So they,

1504
01:33:38,151 --> 01:33:42,010
this guy wrote this score for this scene.
Uh,

1505
01:33:42,110 --> 01:33:44,840
but the problem was it
was perfect for the movie,

1506
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:50,200
but the problem was years later he sold
it or I don't know how far along he sold

1507
01:33:50,631 --> 01:33:55,631
it and it got played so much in this
other shit that it actually kind of fucks

1508
01:33:55,791 --> 01:33:57,620
up the movie. This is, this is the score.

1509
01:33:57,950 --> 01:34:01,790
This is going to be for some older
people to actually understand this is the

1510
01:34:01,791 --> 01:34:04,280
music that they had for the tea.
It's called tar sequence. When they,

1511
01:34:04,310 --> 01:34:06,980
when they tar the road
and they ended up selling,

1512
01:34:06,981 --> 01:34:10,460
the guy ended up selling the song
for something else. Here it is.

1513
01:34:10,461 --> 01:34:14,800
Just listen to this shit.
Ah,

1514
01:34:14,801 --> 01:34:18,770
you suck. God dammit. Fuck the, see.

1515
01:34:18,990 --> 01:34:22,990
This is why I got out of rain.
I used to do shit like that on the air.

1516
01:34:23,970 --> 01:34:28,000
That would be the worst break ever.
I am the fucking worst.

1517
01:34:28,001 --> 01:34:30,700
I want a great intro. I gave
that song. All right, here we go.

1518
01:34:33,270 --> 01:34:35,460
This is the tar in the road.
Totally makes sense.

1519
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:45,273
Florida.

1520
01:34:55,700 --> 01:35:00,390
Good evening and welcome to the six news.
It was a four car accident.

1521
01:35:01,850 --> 01:35:04,890
The motherfuckers sold it to
every six o'clock news station.

1522
01:35:05,910 --> 01:35:08,340
This was the classic with
you fucking old like me.

1523
01:35:08,341 --> 01:35:12,000
Anytime the fucking news came on,
this is the fucking song that they played.

1524
01:35:12,930 --> 01:35:13,763
This is back when,

1525
01:35:13,770 --> 01:35:18,300
when they actually had fucking journalists
telling you what the corporations

1526
01:35:18,301 --> 01:35:19,134
wanted you to know.

1527
01:35:20,230 --> 01:35:21,063
Yeah.

1528
01:35:28,790 --> 01:35:33,370
Good evening. I'm Jake Johansen. What?
I say Jay, I'm a chickshaw Hansen.

1529
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:37,910
I was, that's how fucked up my brain
is. I was trying to think a Chet Curtis.

1530
01:35:38,550 --> 01:35:42,530
I was like, well I can't say I can't
say Chet. That's an actual fucking name.

1531
01:35:42,531 --> 01:35:44,810
I don't name names. So then
I'll go, I'll go with Jake.

1532
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:47,960
And then for some reason I don't.
It just got crossed up and I said,

1533
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:49,340
Jake Johann's I gave Jake,

1534
01:35:49,340 --> 01:35:54,290
Joe answered a fucking shout out the best
God Damn Comedians the last fucking 20

1535
01:35:54,291 --> 01:35:55,280
years from my money.

1536
01:35:57,300 --> 01:35:57,620
Yeah.

1537
01:35:57,620 --> 01:36:00,200
So anyways, yeah, it's called
out of the tar sequence.

1538
01:36:00,230 --> 01:36:03,280
So that one actually doesn't remind
me of the, the, the, the fuck it.

1539
01:36:03,281 --> 01:36:04,160
That's a reverse one.

1540
01:36:04,161 --> 01:36:07,670
I actually watched the movie and I'm
getting into that scene and then I think

1541
01:36:07,671 --> 01:36:09,740
there's like all of a sudden I'm
going to start listening to the news.

1542
01:36:10,460 --> 01:36:13,010
So Jesus Christ,
that was,

1543
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:17,870
that was probably the worst debut
of any segment. But you knew,

1544
01:36:17,871 --> 01:36:20,810
you got to admit you were
definitely into it, right?

1545
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:25,130
I know you guys have suggestions.
Can you help me out? All right.

1546
01:36:25,131 --> 01:36:27,470
I'm fucking burned out
with this fucking podcast.

1547
01:36:28,380 --> 01:36:32,240
I'm trying to get ready to do other
shit and I'm just, you know, look at me.

1548
01:36:32,270 --> 01:36:35,990
I'm fucking supporting Nazis now is
that what I'm doing is then I'll fucking

1549
01:36:35,991 --> 01:36:40,070
tired. I am doctor Laura. If you're
not a bad birthday book and Moron,

1550
01:36:41,070 --> 01:36:45,200
all right, here's one for you. You know
what? I'm going to actually do one.

1551
01:36:45,620 --> 01:36:50,040
I'm going to do one here for it to try
and make peace after my doctor Laura. Uh,

1552
01:36:52,700 --> 01:36:57,180
Dr Laura comments. Here we go. Oh,

1553
01:36:57,320 --> 01:37:00,070
wait a minute. Wait a minute. I've
got to get a secretary for this shit.

1554
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:09,560
All right. Where the fuck are we?
Yeah, I fucking hate you tube.

1555
01:37:09,561 --> 01:37:13,280
I don't want you douchebags doing the
fucking thing. I want the actual guy.

1556
01:37:14,450 --> 01:37:19,400
Everybody doing a fucking remix.
Wait, hang on. Hang in there.

1557
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:29,700
There it is. [inaudible] we go. Alright.

1558
01:37:30,210 --> 01:37:34,860
Now, this one's mainly going to be
for, uh, the people that I offended

1559
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:40,950
last week, last week,
uh, with the fuck is it?

1560
01:37:42,690 --> 01:37:46,530
Come on now. All right, here we go.
Here we go. This isn't going to remind.

1561
01:37:47,610 --> 01:37:49,440
This isn't going to remind you of a movie.

1562
01:37:49,441 --> 01:37:52,530
This is going to remind you of a TV show.
What show was this?

1563
01:37:53,220 --> 01:37:57,570
Hang on the last one.
Come on. Wait a minute.

1564
01:37:57,571 --> 01:38:01,960
You fucking cunt. I did.
I didn't hit pause. Did I?

1565
01:38:02,950 --> 01:38:07,170
Hang on.
All right,

1566
01:38:07,171 --> 01:38:10,110
this is going to remind you of a TV show.
What TV show.

1567
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:30,040
I somehow missed that when that came
out. That is a, that's the Carlton Dance.

1568
01:38:30,130 --> 01:38:34,270
I think I was too old for that one. I
kind of tapped out with sitcoms after, uh,

1569
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:36,730
after why happy days.
And I wanted the chairs.

1570
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:41,920
I started Busan and actually
believed cheers. You know,

1571
01:38:41,980 --> 01:38:42,970
I believe that,
you know,

1572
01:38:42,971 --> 01:38:47,971
there was a bar like that and you come
in and just being an alcoholic was like

1573
01:38:48,070 --> 01:38:52,690
funny and fulfilling.
I guess there was the sadness.

1574
01:38:52,691 --> 01:38:57,340
He completely avoided his wife
fear and they never showed her. Um,

1575
01:38:57,870 --> 01:38:59,770
anyways, you know what? I think that's
going to be the podcast for the week.

1576
01:38:59,771 --> 01:39:02,530
I have to, I got a tap out
here, man. This, this, uh,

1577
01:39:03,190 --> 01:39:06,640
this trying to do one on the road the
day after I come off the road is really

1578
01:39:06,641 --> 01:39:07,810
difficult. But, uh,

1579
01:39:08,110 --> 01:39:12,190
fortunately things have been
going well that I'm really busy,

1580
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:14,800
so I guess that is a good fucking thing.
But you know,

1581
01:39:14,801 --> 01:39:16,780
you get used to this comedian lifestyle,

1582
01:39:16,900 --> 01:39:20,620
you just get the fucking hang out
on a Monday. Now I actually, uh,

1583
01:39:21,310 --> 01:39:24,400
I have shit to do,
which is annoying.

1584
01:39:24,520 --> 01:39:28,180
It's not why I started being a comedian.
I started to be a comedian,

1585
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:32,140
so I would not have shit to do,
you know,

1586
01:39:33,250 --> 01:39:36,730
wouldn't have a boss
to tell fucking jokes,

1587
01:39:36,731 --> 01:39:41,590
talk about my Dick in all 50 states
and whatnot. Believe it or not,

1588
01:39:41,591 --> 01:39:45,850
people, my neck stand up date
isn't until September 9th, uh,

1589
01:39:45,851 --> 01:39:50,170
at the comedy works in Denver, Colorado.
Let's blow through some dates, shall we,

1590
01:39:50,380 --> 01:39:53,650

Oh, you got to live nation.com. Um,

1596
01:40:16,510 --> 01:40:18,040
before the theater's tour starts.

1597
01:40:18,190 --> 01:40:20,860
I'm also going to be at Zany
Comedy Club in Nashville,

1598
01:40:20,861 --> 01:40:24,850
Tennessee on September 23rd,
24th and 25th,

1599
01:40:25,570 --> 01:40:30,220
one of, uh, one of my favorite clubs to
play as is the comedy works in Denver.

1600
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:34,720
September 10th. Well, we
got there September 10th,

1601
01:40:35,870 --> 01:40:40,210
11th. I have September 9th,
10th and the 11th. There we go.

1602
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:44,020
That's when I'm working there. Um,
and then starts to theater. Shit.

1603
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:46,510
I'm going to be at the egg in Albany,
New York.

1604
01:40:46,900 --> 01:40:50,500
All you people in upstate New York
always say come to upstate New York, man.

1605
01:40:50,501 --> 01:40:54,010
What the fuck? I'm going to be
there. I'm going to be at the

1606
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:56,320
egg in Albany,
New York.

1607
01:40:56,321 --> 01:41:00,280
And then the following day I'm going
to be at the center for the arts,

1608
01:41:00,550 --> 01:41:03,910
Buffalo, New York. Um,

1609
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:05,650
so I'm finally coming to buffalo.

1610
01:41:05,651 --> 01:41:09,790
I'm actually hitting up a bunch of
towns that I haven't been to in fucking

1611
01:41:09,791 --> 01:41:12,820
forever. Uh, another city, a city.

1612
01:41:12,821 --> 01:41:16,000
I've never done standup in a full set.
I've done a guest set,

1613
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:20,740
but I've never gotten a gig out there.
I'm going to be at the, uh, pantageous

1614
01:41:23,560 --> 01:41:26,740
Pantages pan and ages, whatever the
fuck it is, theater in Minneapolis,

1615
01:41:26,741 --> 01:41:30,310
Minnesota on October 22nd.

1616
01:41:30,970 --> 01:41:33,460
And then the following
day I'm going to be at

1617
01:41:35,350 --> 01:41:40,330
the Vic Theater in Chicago,
Illinois on, um, October 23rd.

1618
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:43,870
And uh,
any other ones?

1619
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:48,900
I got another theater date on November
19th and met the listener auditorium,

1620
01:41:49,601 --> 01:41:53,020
Washington DC.
And uh,

1621
01:41:53,021 --> 01:41:57,340
the last theater I have is
the more theater in Seattle,

1622
01:41:57,341 --> 01:42:00,580
Washington on November 27th.
Uh,

1623
01:42:00,581 --> 01:42:05,350
you can go on to bird.com and just click
on the links in the lower left hand

1624
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:10,210
corner and you can check out
all that bullshit and uh,

1625
01:42:10,211 --> 01:42:14,200
hopefully you'll come out to the
shows. We'll see how it goes. Um,

1626
01:42:14,230 --> 01:42:17,590
for those of you wondering if I'm just
going to try and do theaters exclusively,

1627
01:42:17,970 --> 01:42:20,950
um, no, I am not. I'm always going to
be doing the clubs. The clubs are like,

1628
01:42:20,951 --> 01:42:24,910
the gym keeps you in shape, you
come in, you do five, six shows,

1629
01:42:25,330 --> 01:42:28,360
and then every once in awhile like,
uh, like Buffalo, I don't know,

1630
01:42:28,361 --> 01:42:30,940
they don't really have like a
big time comedy club out there.

1631
01:42:31,390 --> 01:42:34,750
No disrespect to anybody out there.
So why you just come in,

1632
01:42:34,751 --> 01:42:38,380
you try to do with theater. Same
thing with Albany, you know,

1633
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:41,580
you start going to those really
smaller fucking towns, um,

1634
01:42:42,220 --> 01:42:45,790
or smaller comedy markets. And
then that's just when, you know,

1635
01:42:45,791 --> 01:42:49,750
the local comedy club is just
neat name like knee slappers,

1636
01:42:50,770 --> 01:42:55,240
you know? Um, God damn it, you're funny.

1637
01:42:57,040 --> 01:43:01,330
Who's ready to laugh? You know, they
just got awful fucking names and uh,

1638
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:05,170
yeah. And they try to make
you stay in a comedy condo.

1639
01:43:05,171 --> 01:43:06,970
So that's why I always
avoided those things.

1640
01:43:06,971 --> 01:43:08,890
And I tried to stay in the
bigger markets where I could,

1641
01:43:08,891 --> 01:43:13,750
they actually put me in a hotel. I'm
like, you, I lie, like my comforts. So,

1642
01:43:13,960 --> 01:43:16,960
uh, that's, that's the big,
uh, my big tour coming up.

1643
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:21,790
And there's also a date there I missed in
Columbus, Ohio. That's a club date, uh,

1644
01:43:21,850 --> 01:43:24,970
November 12th, 13th. And
14th and the fucking,

1645
01:43:24,971 --> 01:43:27,520
you know what kills me is how
quick that's all gonna go by.

1646
01:43:27,670 --> 01:43:31,030
And another year is going to
go by as well as, you know,

1647
01:43:31,480 --> 01:43:35,590
by the end of that tour, um, football
season will be three quarters over.

1648
01:43:35,620 --> 01:43:39,010
How fucking sad is that? At
least the regular season. Uh,

1649
01:43:39,070 --> 01:43:42,580
who do you like by the way?
Anybody.

1650
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:44,140
Anybody for some predictions.

1651
01:43:45,310 --> 01:43:48,400
How about we try to do some predictions
and whoever comes the fucking closest

1652
01:43:48,730 --> 01:43:53,300
gets a, an autograph and
autographed DVD of my brand new DVD.

1653
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:56,090
Let it go. Because by then it'll be the
end of the season and I'll fucking sent,

1654
01:43:56,300 --> 01:43:59,570
Nah, I'm not gonna do that then
you won't fucking buy it. Right.

1655
01:43:59,780 --> 01:44:03,830
I need to get you to buy it. Got,
damn it. I suck at marketing. Anyways,

1656
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:07,610
that's a podcast for this week.
Was very disjointed. I, you know,

1657
01:44:08,180 --> 01:44:10,550
they can all be gold.
You know,

1658
01:44:10,551 --> 01:44:13,880
even Peyton manning throws an interception
every once in awhile on the file

1659
01:44:13,881 --> 01:44:17,330
drive of a fucking Superbowl,
doesn't he? Well, doesn't,

1660
01:44:17,331 --> 01:44:21,380
he actually saw what's his face? Uh,
drew Brees finally getting some props.

1661
01:44:21,950 --> 01:44:24,800
He came in there with John Gruden,
you know,

1662
01:44:25,390 --> 01:44:27,340
John Grooms got that
unbelievable intensity that,

1663
01:44:27,341 --> 01:44:29,030
that vein down the middle of his forehead.

1664
01:44:29,240 --> 01:44:32,420
That's one of my favorite
announcers out there are color men.

1665
01:44:32,421 --> 01:44:34,310
Whatever the hell that guy's doing,
that guy's the shit.

1666
01:44:34,311 --> 01:44:37,360
There's nothing better than
an ex football player at this.

1667
01:44:37,410 --> 01:44:41,030
This is provided that they
have broadcasting skills.

1668
01:44:41,270 --> 01:44:44,780
Somebody that played the game,
coached the game and that type of shit.

1669
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:48,410
And then you get the classic
like broadcast or like a,

1670
01:44:48,440 --> 01:44:52,880
like an Al Michaels or something like
that to call the game. And then, uh,

1671
01:44:53,090 --> 01:44:55,640
then you got your crew.
Thank you bill.

1672
01:44:55,641 --> 01:44:58,430
Thank you for breaking that down
is if we didn't fucking notice,

1673
01:44:59,450 --> 01:45:00,570
why don't you just admit,
Bill,

1674
01:45:00,571 --> 01:45:04,550
that you just babbling at this point to
somehow try and make it to 'em up to 57

1675
01:45:04,551 --> 01:45:07,250
minutes. That qualifies. I
can tap out at this point.

1676
01:45:07,900 --> 01:45:10,820
Why don't you guys leave sometimes
three minutes before five.

1677
01:45:11,870 --> 01:45:13,190
So what did we learned this week?

1678
01:45:13,610 --> 01:45:18,200
We learned that even on major topics
like race bill really doesn't do his

1679
01:45:18,201 --> 01:45:22,090
research. Uh, we learned
that I had at why act, uh,

1680
01:45:22,350 --> 01:45:27,350
that got some fat guy with a milky white
ties to laugh at himself and he's lost

1681
01:45:27,861 --> 01:45:32,780
40 pounds. So I'm not totally
a bad guy. And uh, I guess
from the troops, come back,

1682
01:45:33,020 --> 01:45:36,710
send him a drink or get, get them,
get them a blow job or shut your face.

1683
01:45:37,550 --> 01:45:40,640
And evidently they, they, they
feel the same way of the support,

1684
01:45:40,641 --> 01:45:44,240
the troop bumper stickers as I do.
You like I'm taking one marine,

1685
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:47,540
his point of view and just saying that
that's everybody's well that's what the

1686
01:45:47,541 --> 01:45:51,920
fuck I do. That's what I
do. Support the troops.

1687
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:54,890
I always thought it was ridiculous.
A lot of those bumper stickers that said,

1688
01:45:54,891 --> 01:45:58,370
I support the troops. It's like,
well, why wouldn't you? What do you,

1689
01:45:58,371 --> 01:46:00,620
what are you rooting for the,
the other team.

1690
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:08,990
So fucking obvious. I support the
troops. Ice Cream tastes good.

1691
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:10,473
Okay.

1692
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:12,230
I like babies.

1693
01:46:12,231 --> 01:46:14,690
You know what he's gonna have all kinds
of obvious bumper stickers on the back

1694
01:46:14,691 --> 01:46:18,860
of your fucking car. I saw a
guy at a big heart on, on his,

1695
01:46:18,861 --> 01:46:21,710
on his side of his house.
It said love our troops.

1696
01:46:21,950 --> 01:46:24,920
It just really gave me the creeps.
And every time I see it,

1697
01:46:24,921 --> 01:46:28,430
I want to fucking rip
it down. You know, I,

1698
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:32,570
this other guy wrote me an angry fucking
email all about the politics about

1699
01:46:32,571 --> 01:46:34,940
sending the troops over there,
you know? And it's just like,

1700
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:39,140
like he was fucking dropping
all this knowledge, man,

1701
01:46:39,141 --> 01:46:43,430
about what's really going on
with the war man. You know,

1702
01:46:45,260 --> 01:46:49,010
like, I don't realize, like
I don't realize that shit,

1703
01:46:49,020 --> 01:46:52,770
but I also realized that those guys
don't determine where the fuck they go.

1704
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,930
All right? So I'll just try
not to be a dick. You know,

1705
01:46:55,590 --> 01:46:59,790
they got been a dick enough, haven't
I? I've gotta be honest with you.

1706
01:46:59,791 --> 01:47:02,130
I have no idea what I said
for the last 11 minutes,

1707
01:47:02,131 --> 01:47:06,150
but all I know is I recorded it and you're
listening to it. Okay. So who's worse?

1708
01:47:07,410 --> 01:47:11,790
May you guys just shaking your heads right
now? He's really losing his mind. Well,

1709
01:47:11,791 --> 01:47:15,300
maybe I am. Um, that's it.
So I got, I got like two,

1710
01:47:15,301 --> 01:47:17,570
three weeks off on be hanging out,

1711
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:21,000
can be gone doing a lot of spots down the
comedy store. If you're in Los Angeles,

1712
01:47:21,550 --> 01:47:22,710
going to be working out my shit.

1713
01:47:22,711 --> 01:47:25,470
If you want to come down there and
watch me bomb, lean on the mic,

1714
01:47:25,471 --> 01:47:29,070
stand and stare at that. All weather
carpet is, I work out my bits,

1715
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:35,130

store and that's it. Thanks.
Everybody wrote in it. Uh,

1716
01:47:35,850 --> 01:47:38,100
