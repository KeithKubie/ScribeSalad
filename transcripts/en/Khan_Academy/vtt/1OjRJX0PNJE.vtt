00:00:00.332 --> 00:00:01.901
- [Voiceover] Hello grammarians!

00:00:01.901 --> 00:00:06.092
So we had said previously
that prepositions express

00:00:06.092 --> 00:00:08.759
relationships between two ideas.

00:00:10.191 --> 00:00:12.132
And we can do that either in time

00:00:12.132 --> 00:00:14.037
or in space or in other ways.

00:00:14.037 --> 00:00:15.250
But today I wanna talk about

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.417
prepositions in space.

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:23.601
Because this is, again,

00:00:23.601 --> 00:00:26.070
one of the things that prepositions do,

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.803
is they can set up
relationships between objects

00:00:29.803 --> 00:00:31.388
and their locations.

00:00:31.388 --> 00:00:32.592
So I could say,

00:00:32.592 --> 00:00:35.259
the triangle is over the square,

00:00:36.538 --> 00:00:38.885
or on top of the square.

00:00:38.885 --> 00:00:39.885
I could say,

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.017
the circle is inside the square.

00:00:46.615 --> 00:00:47.615
Over,

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:50.669
inside.

00:00:50.669 --> 00:00:53.289
What I would like to do is
review some of the major ones,

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:56.489
and talk about what their uses are.

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.324
So when we use the word at in a sentence,

00:00:59.324 --> 00:01:01.305
and here I'm talking about,
something we should note,

00:01:01.305 --> 00:01:04.017
is that some of these prepositions

00:01:04.017 --> 00:01:07.110
can be used in multiple ways.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.341
So at has a space connotation,

00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:12.763
but it also can have a time connotation.

00:01:12.763 --> 00:01:15.537
But I don't want you to really
worry about that right now,

00:01:15.537 --> 00:01:17.091
I think it makes the most sense to just

00:01:17.091 --> 00:01:19.758
think of their uses as separate,

00:01:20.885 --> 00:01:23.552
and just think of them separately.

00:01:23.552 --> 00:01:27.135
So when we talk about
at, at means a point.

00:01:29.313 --> 00:01:30.837
It's talking about a point.

00:01:30.837 --> 00:01:33.047
So we could say something like,

00:01:33.047 --> 00:01:35.964
we stood at the entrance to a cave.

00:01:37.557 --> 00:01:40.844
But you can also have this
connotation of direction.

00:01:40.844 --> 00:01:44.594
As in, the creature
launched itself at Amina.

00:01:49.468 --> 00:01:53.034
The word by when we're talking
about space means near.

00:01:53.034 --> 00:01:57.201
As in, the house by the old
mill is totally haunted.

00:02:02.162 --> 00:02:06.002
Man all these sentences
are like really spooky,

00:02:06.002 --> 00:02:08.303
ooooh, I don't know what I was thinking.

00:02:08.303 --> 00:02:12.470
The preposition from has this
connotation of coming from

00:02:13.804 --> 00:02:15.721
somewhere else to here.

00:02:17.065 --> 00:02:19.148
As in, we came from Mars.

00:02:25.126 --> 00:02:27.459
In denotes an enclosed area,

00:02:28.722 --> 00:02:30.124
so you could say something like

00:02:30.124 --> 00:02:32.374
there's a bunny in the box.

00:02:36.021 --> 00:02:37.854
Off denotes away from,

00:02:42.726 --> 00:02:44.726
she hopped off the rock.

00:02:48.562 --> 00:02:52.145
On, which usually notes
being on a surface,

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:57.446
as opposed to in which is an
enclosed area like I said.

00:02:57.446 --> 00:03:01.613
So we could say, there's a
goblin on the front steps.

00:03:11.754 --> 00:03:14.004
The goblin is on the steps.

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.272
The bunny is in the box.

00:03:20.272 --> 00:03:22.086
Do you see the difference?

00:03:22.086 --> 00:03:26.253
Out is another direction
word. Away from something.

00:03:28.074 --> 00:03:31.685
And off and on and in
and out mean the opposite

00:03:31.685 --> 00:03:32.722
of each other.

00:03:32.722 --> 00:03:36.889
So away from, out means
away from an enclosed area,

00:03:40.097 --> 00:03:42.930
and off means away from a surface.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.950
So if you can imagine, there's
someone who's on the rock,

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.754
and then they hop off the rock.

00:03:51.754 --> 00:03:54.131
There's a goblin on the front steps,

00:03:54.131 --> 00:03:56.082
the goblin leaves the front
steps he's off the front steps.

00:03:56.082 --> 00:03:57.682
There's a bunny in the box,

00:03:57.682 --> 00:04:02.604
if the bunny leaves the box
it will go out of the box.

00:04:02.604 --> 00:04:04.996
And there's plenty of other prepositions

00:04:04.996 --> 00:04:08.425
but let's talk about to,
which when you're talking

00:04:08.425 --> 00:04:10.147
about to in the physical sense it has this

00:04:10.147 --> 00:04:12.230
connotation of direction.

00:04:16.126 --> 00:04:19.626
So you could say, I'm going to Mozambique.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.516
These are some of but certainly not all

00:04:24.516 --> 00:04:27.335
of the spacial prepositions of English.

00:04:27.335 --> 00:04:30.718
Now we're lucky because
prepositions are a closed group

00:04:30.718 --> 00:04:33.502
in English, a closed group.

00:04:33.502 --> 00:04:36.656
We don't add many of them to the language

00:04:36.656 --> 00:04:38.774
the way that we add nouns and adverbs

00:04:38.774 --> 00:04:40.785
and verbs and adjectives.

00:04:40.785 --> 00:04:42.736
There are a lot of them
and you have to memorize

00:04:42.736 --> 00:04:46.012
all of them and their
various obnoxious nuances,

00:04:46.012 --> 00:04:50.218
but there isn't a limitless
number of prepositions.

00:04:50.218 --> 00:04:53.905
There's maybe 100 plus,
and of those maybe 50

00:04:53.905 --> 00:04:56.488
are quite useful, and of those,

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:00.336
maybe 20 to 25 are super useful.

00:05:01.433 --> 00:05:03.841
And it's the super
useful, most common ones

00:05:03.841 --> 00:05:06.797
that are in the exercises,
so give those a go,

00:05:06.797 --> 00:05:09.630
you can learn anything. David out.
