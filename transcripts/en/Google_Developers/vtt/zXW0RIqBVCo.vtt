00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:03.010
Now, another key feature that we have heard
from developers that they want access to in

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:08.630
the browser is the camera.
Here, for examples the Buzz Web application.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.640
We'd love to not only post a Buzz but we would
love to be able to include a picture. How

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.759
do you access the camera from the Web browser?
In this development build we built those APIs

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:23.170
right into the Web browser such that Matt
can now simply select, if he wants to -- and

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.019
it looks like in this case this demo is not
going to work. We will give it one shot, and

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.710
we will move on if it doesn't work -- but
you can access that camera capability right

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.010
from within the browser.
And we will show you that in the sandbox later.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.469
It's great.
[ Laughter ]

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.539
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Let's talk about another capability
that's available.

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:48.149
But before we talk about that capability,
let me remind you of what's possible in Android.

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.640
Google, starting about several years ago,
really made a deep investment in voice recognition.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.289
We recognized that the mobile device, because
of its limited input capability, would be

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.300
the platform in which people used voice input
more than any other platform.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.370
In fact, we see a stunning number of queries
being done on mobile devices where the input

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.110
is a human voice.
Now, just as a reminder of how fantastic our

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.650
capability has become over the past two years,
let me do a few demos. Or more accurately,

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.900
Matt, why don't you highlight a few cases.
&gt;&gt;Matt: Pictures of Barack Obama with the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:32.790
French President at the G8 summit.
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: That's a tough one. Boom!

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.580
Look at that!
[ Applause ]

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:42.930
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Because this is so fun, let's
do a few more.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.110
&gt;&gt;Matt: Pictures of the Golden Gate Bridge
at sunset.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.680
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: These are queries you are
likely not to type in let alone get a response

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.200
back in a few seconds. Isn't that great?
And one more.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.100
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Matt: Del Dotto Vineyards, Napa.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.430
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: My favorite vineyard in Napa.
Boom.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:13.500
What Matt just showed you was phenomenal voice
recognition that we are now shipping in Japanese,

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.670
English, a number of languages, and that's
constantly increasing, but what is coming

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.300
next is the also the ability to understand
human intentions. We will give you a very

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:30.330
simple sneak peek at the kinds of things we
are going to enable.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.090
&gt;&gt;Matt: Call fifth floor restaurant.
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: So in this case, because he

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.750
said "call," it got a trigger. And there are
many, many more intentions we are going to

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.500
build in and make it very, very simple for
to you use voice input as a first class way

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.190
to interact with your Android device.
&gt;&gt;Matt: Vic, we have got it.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.790
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Let's go back to the camera
and see if this thing works. This is a Web

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.640
app. It's a Buzz Web app. There is the camera.
From the browser, boom! Right into the camera.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.690
Isn't that great? And now you can post a picture
and give Web developers the same type of capabilities

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.430
you would expect in a native application.
Glad that worked. No need for you guys to

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.990
visit the sandbox.
[ Applause ]

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:19.180
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Getting back to the speech
demonstration, what we showed you was capability

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.760
that we make available to developers, but
what about accessing that capability from

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.700
the browser? Here is a Web app.
It is a translate app from Google with one

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.510
new feature. You will note the microphone
right there at the top. Matt, if you could

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.070
just point to the microphone. There it is.
And watch what Matt does.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:45.230
&gt;&gt;Matt: Can you help me find the nearest hospital?
&gt;&gt;&gt; (repeating in French).

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:52.330
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Awesome! Awesome!
[ Applause ]

00:03:52.330 --> 00:04:03.770
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: All right. Let's go back to
slides.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:09.300
Now, we're not only committed to making sure
that Android -- You can clap. I will let you

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.400
clap.
[ Applause ]

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:17.680
[ Cheering and Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: You know, I love it when I

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.819
don't even have to speak to a slide and we
just get applause.

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:21.620
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: I am so tempted to go on.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.349
But let me just make a point here. We are
not only committed to having the world's fastest

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:32.289
browser. We're committed to having the world's
most comprehensive browser.

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:35.880
It turns out that on the Internet, people
use Flash!

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.039
[ Laughter ]
[ Applause ]

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:45.020
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: And part of being open means
you are inclusive, rather than exclusive.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.949
And you are open to innovation.
You know, this was driven home to me very

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:56.749
powerfully when my daughter picked up my iPad
and went to her favorite Web site, Web site

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:59.770
nickelodeon, and this is what she saw on the
iPad.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:06.129
Can we switch to the iPad? A sea of orange!
[ Laughter ]

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:12.150
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: She said, "Daddy, can I play
with your Android device?" And this is what

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.550
she saw.
The full nickelodeon site. Isn't that great?

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.919
That's what openness means.
[ Applause ]

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:28.039
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: And by the way, a special
thanks to Adobe for their incredible willingness

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:32.479
to work with us, engage with us on Android
and in chrome and in many other areas. It's

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:38.050
really fun to work with other folks in the
ecosystem to meet the needs of users.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.380
Much nicer than just saying no.
[ Applause ]

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:51.900
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: All right. Let's go back to
slides.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.499
Now, we have also made significant improvements
in the Android Marketplace.

00:05:56.499 --> 00:06:01.710
We listened carefully to the feedback we have
gotten from developers and from users, and

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.379
I think you are going to like the enhancements.
Let's talk about what we have done on average,

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:12.379
our data shows that our users are installing
more than 40 apps on their Android device,

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:17.430
so finding those apps is a challenge. Also
they want to search within the data of those

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:23.050
apps, they want to move those apps to the
SD card, and they want to update all without

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:28.650
having to update each individual app by themselves.
Let me show you through a series of demos

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:32.621
what we have done here. Let's go to demos.
The first demonstration we are going to show

00:06:32.621 --> 00:06:37.370
you is just searching the apps. Now with the
Quick Search box we make it trivially easy

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.529
to scope it to apps. As soon as you start
typing a letter, the app you are looking for

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:45.569
just comes up.
It's a simple and easy way to go find apps.

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:51.589
Not only can you find apps, but we have improved
the Quick Search box so developers can plug

00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:58.479
into the search framework. In that case that
icon is for Mint. Mint is a financial application,

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:03.149
and now you are searching within the data
of that application bringing up your financial

00:07:03.149 --> 00:07:05.409
records.
We think developers are going to extend this

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:10.740
in all sorts of exciting ways, making not
only Android more usable, but their own applications

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:16.099
be surface, discoverable, and more fun and
engaging for the user.

00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:20.289
Another issue we have heard is people want
to take advantage of the openness of Android,

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:24.599
the ability for you to plug in an SD card
with arbitrary amounts of memory. And they

00:07:24.599 --> 00:07:28.719
want to move apps not just in the internal
memory but off to the SD card.

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:35.460
Two points. We've enabled that capability
in a secure way with Froyo, but we have also

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.969
made it so the user never has to worry about
it. When they install an application, we will

00:07:39.969 --> 00:07:45.939
intelligently look at the space and if appropriate,
move it to the SD card. If the user wants

00:07:45.939 --> 00:07:51.199
to get involved and manually move things around,
that's what this demonstration shows. In this

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:55.520
case, Matt is going to take a brand-new game,
Need for Speed, and he is going to shift that

00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:02.149
game from the internal memory onto the SD
card. There you go. The whole 50 megabytes

00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:05.100
is being moved over. Why don't we just start
the game. Why don't you launch that game.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:12.509
You can see it's on the SD card.
Why don't you launch that game.

00:08:12.509 --> 00:08:18.479
Isn't that awesome? Great new game, Need for
Speed, and it can live on your SD card.

00:08:18.479 --> 00:08:20.669
Okay. Let's move on.
[ Laughter ]

00:08:20.669 --> 00:08:26.899
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Matt, Matt, we have got to
go. I know the game is fun.

00:08:26.899 --> 00:08:30.039
All right. Let's go into the marketplace and
talk about....

00:08:30.039 --> 00:08:38.250
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: All right. Let's talk about

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:41.320
update all functionality.
Matt, that's you.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:45.850
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: He is easily distracted.

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:51.470
All right. Today, you have to update each
application individually. In Froyo, we have

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:56.139
made it simple. At the bottom of the Android
Marketplace you see the update all button.

00:08:56.139 --> 00:09:02.560
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: I am kind of embarrassed you

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:08.040
have to clap on that. We're glad it's there.
We have gone one step further with Froyo.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:12.790
Why should the user have to take any action?
Starting with Froyo, with the user's permission

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:17.790
you can allow automatic updating, and all
your apps are updated all the time. Isn't

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:19.300
that great?
[ Applause ]

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:23.670
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: And the user doesn't have
to worry about this at all.

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:33.790
Let's go back to slides.
Another key feature we're adding in Froyo

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:39.220
is designed to meet the needs of developers.
We want the best apps on Android, the highest

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:43.350
quality apps. And that means we need to close
the loop when there's a problem.
