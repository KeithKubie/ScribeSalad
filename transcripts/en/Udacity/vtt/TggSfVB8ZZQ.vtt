00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.950
So Trisomy 21 or having three copies of

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.520
chromosome 21, is an example of aneuploidy, where

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.880
we gained a chromosome and this is referred

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.430
to clinically as Down's Syndrome. It's a disorder

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.810
which results in a delay of cognitive development,

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.320
physical growth as well a particular set of

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.850
facial features. Now monosomy X or XO, is

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.400
an example of aneuploidy from having lost a chromosome.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.550
We only have one X chromosome and no Y chromosome or no other X chromosome. And

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.970
this is referred to as Turner's Syndrome, a

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.430
disorder with physical and hormonal abnormalities that result

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.340
in infertility. In general, aneuploidy has largely negative

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.140
effects. In fact, I haven't been able to

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.940
come up with one example where aneuploidy has

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.710
an overall net positive effect. Now for you advanced

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.110
learners out there, aneuploidy and polyploidy aren't

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.430
the same thing and there are net positive

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.470
effects to polyploidy. But if you can come

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.870
up with a good positive example, a net

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.349
positive example for aneuploidy, I would love it

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:06.380
if you go to the forums and post

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.320
it. I think we'd all like to see what a good example of that would be.
