00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.990
[SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.890
So I'm going to speak
English for our benefit.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.370
So let me go back.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.740
So my name is Brahim.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.509
As Summer said, I'm a product
manager on the Play Store team.

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:24.300
I work on a couple of
things, but today I'm

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.990
going to talk to you about
commerce and monetization.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.980
One of the reasons
why we're here

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.850
is to make sure that all of you,
developers based out of China,

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.180
can now be successful selling
your apps and goods globally.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.810
One of the key services we
provide to you is payments.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:47.410
It is collecting payments for
you from 130 plus countries,

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.769
and then remitting that
to you here in China,

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:51.560
so I'm going to talk
to you more about that

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.643
over the next few minutes.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.090
So I couldn't help but
repeat this number.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.030
Chris Yerga mentioned
this earlier,

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.560
and the fact that we
are where we are today

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.300
is incredibly exciting
to us as a team.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.940
I started on the
team three years ago

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.380
when things were very
different, and having paid out

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.400
over $5 billion in that
one year time frame

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.370
is incredibly exciting.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.850
And we think that with the help
of all of you here in China,

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.710
we will be even more successful
and we're just getting started.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.290
So just another call out
for that number, which

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.150
for us is incredibly exciting.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.890
So we think of payments
in terms of two

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.500
main chunks of activities.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.110
One is you are building
all these applications.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.950
These apps and
games are ultimately

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.100
driving a user to
make a purchase,

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.990
or obviously just
have fun, but I'm

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.780
a commerce guy so it's
about making a purchase.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.540
And as you drive more
and more of your users

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.630
towards pressing that
Buy button, which

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.870
is incredibly difficult,
it is our responsibility

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.070
on Google's side to actually
convert as many of those users

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.530
as possible.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.160
And so to do that,
we've done a ton of work

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.601
over the past couple years
I'm going to walk you through,

00:02:08.601 --> 00:02:10.850
but I'm also going to walk
you through what things you

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.550
can do within your applications
to actually make sure

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.090
that users successfully
get to that step.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.100
So there are two
chunks of activities.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.630
There is you getting people
to press that Buy button,

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.650
and then there is us converting
more and more of those users

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.040
around the world.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.850
This is a frame of reference.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.570
So I'm going to start
off a bit to talk

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.140
about how an entrepreneur
and how a business starts.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.240
Essentially, you're in a
market you're familiar with.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.500
Let's not say that's Europe.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.520
Let's say that's actually China.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.870
And you're thinking of an idea.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:47.700
You have a need.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.189
You have an opportunity you
feel is really important.

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:51.730
And at some point,
you say, I'm going

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.901
to build an app that
fulfills that need.

00:02:53.901 --> 00:02:55.400
And so you start
off with the market

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.980
you're most familiar with.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.490
You may then jump to another
one that's somewhat close

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.250
and that is somewhat
familiar with you

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.190
that has a similar
need, and then you

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.200
expand to another market.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.880
What's amazing is
all of a sudden,

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.950
you're a global business.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.380
You're a global business.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.630
In the past, this
used to be a big deal.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.760
Companies used to
restructure when

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.480
they are a global business.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.480
Companies used to hire
different kinds of people.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.400
But one thing that's important
is for you, it happens so fast

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.670
and it's so seamless that
sometimes it kind of just

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.030
happens and you
operate the same way.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.500
You don't actually change
the way you operate.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.910
But it's actually
really important,

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.510
as you build these
global businesses on top

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.610
of Google Play,
which we believe is

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.390
an incredible global platform,
as you build these businesses,

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.645
that you think about it
as a global business.

00:03:51.645 --> 00:03:56.040
You are all global
businesses, I guarantee it.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.150
So that's another aspect, and
what's exciting to us is that

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.130
developers that earn most of
their revenue from abroad,

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.620
from outside their main
market, their home market,

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.910
they earn 2.5 times
compared to those who don't.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.440
And so when you go global, when
you take this step to drive

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.769
most of your
revenue from abroad,

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.550
you're actually also
earning much more,

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.880
so keep that in mind.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.950
Now, what's exciting
to us is this number.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.190
Over the past year,
we've had 38% growth year

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.010
over year in developers
doing just that,

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.770
developers earning
most of their revenue

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.650
from outside their home market.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.880
This is important for
us because, of course,

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.260
we believe Google Play is the
perfect global platform, being

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.230
incredibly objective, so when
more and more users and more

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.490
developers are taking
advantage of it in that way,

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.447
that makes us incredibly happy.

00:04:56.447 --> 00:04:58.030
And I know you guys--
no, I'm kidding.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.210
You don't want to make
us happy, it's fine.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.900
So that's another point.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.550
So starting off
talking about, what

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.290
are we doing on the Google
side to make you successful

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.720
globally?

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.890
First off is reach.

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.500
You can distribute your
apps in over 190 countries.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.350
Today, with our
launch, literally you

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.000
can have users in
that many countries.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.450
You can sell to users
in over 130 markets.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.230
This is the point about you
being a global business.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:32.090
You are going to have purchases
from 20, 30 plus markets.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.960
That's a fact.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.720
And finally, we
have 65 countries

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.020
where you can
tailor your pricing,

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.050
and as we'll talk about later,
that is actually particularly

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.170
important to your users.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.060
So broad reach, global reach.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.230
Again, the theme of you
are a global business.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.490
Interestingly, as we
went out and started

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.920
building a payments
and commerce platform,

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.120
we realized that to actually
be a global platform,

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.110
you have to think very locally.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.050
You have to think about each
user and their preferences

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.520
in each market.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.400
We spent a lot of
time working on this.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.180
So for example, in
the US, credit cards

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.190
are the way to buy.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.360
They're essentially the
frictionless payment method.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.670
In Asia, DCB and
Direct Carrier Billing,

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.630
which is when you place your
purchases on your carrier bill,

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:28.130
on your monthly phone bill,
is actually extremely popular.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.940
So two markets, both
extremely large,

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.950
both extremely successful, that
use entirely different payment

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.430
methods.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.460
China is no different.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.750
And so as you think about
your markets and users

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.590
that you have in
those markets, you

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.060
have to think locally
in addition to that.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.910
So over the past
year, we've actually

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:55.220
launched Google Play gift
cards in over 25 markets,

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.410
we've launched carrier
billing in over 28 markets,

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:02.300
and we've launched
PayPal in 19 markets.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.560
All of these steps are,
again, to make sure

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.750
that as users in different
markets come to Google Play,

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:14.420
that we convert as many of
those users for you as possible.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:18.720
So when a user presses the
Buy button, we convert as many

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.500
of those users as possible.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.910
That's our mission, and with
these local forms of payment,

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:25.910
we're able to do that,
and I'll show you

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.610
a case study to that effect.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.320
This is the launch of the Google
Play gift card in Germany,

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.140
and what happened in Germany
was super interesting.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.700
There you go.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.420
Since launch, year
over year, we've

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.550
had a 70% increase in buyers.

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.560
This is the number of
users that are actually

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.310
making purchases in Germany.

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:51.550
So step one, more
people are buying.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:56.220
Step two is we've had a 25%
improvement in our conversion

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:59.870
rate, which means how many users
who click on that Buy button

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.430
actually complete that
purchase, and that's

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:04.380
important because you
don't care about people

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:05.620
pressing the Buy button.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.510
You care about them
completing that purchase.

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:12.910
So we've had a 25%
increase year over year.

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:20.520
And what that led to is a 3x
increase in sales in Germany.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.560
So this is a case study that
represents the way we think

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.780
about local forms of payment.

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:31.350
You enable a market, you give
it the right forms of payment,

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:34.030
you get more users
to become buyers,

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:36.390
they increase their engagement.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:39.179
You then get better
conversion and ultimately

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:41.919
what you all probably
care about is the sales

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:44.730
are up significantly.

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:47.140
And so we hope to
replicate this elsewhere.

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.900
So in Hong Kong, we've had
an 80% increase in buyers

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.850
year over year.

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:57.200
Over that year, we've launched
carrier billing and gift cards.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:02.160
In Russia, we had 100% increase
in buyers year over year,

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.230
again, launching
carrier billing.

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:07.800
And so as we launch
these forms of payment,

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.650
we're seeing that model
replicate-- increased

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.700
engagement, increased
conversion, increased sales.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.550
That should probably not
say "starting today."

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:22.000
It's been awhile that we've
actually enabled this feature.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.271
But essentially, payments
are about consistency.

00:09:26.271 --> 00:09:28.770
What used to happen in the past
is that a user that actually

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:31.940
uses carrier
billing to purchase,

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.550
when they came to
their Wi-Fi tablet,

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:37.470
they could not use that
form of payment, which led

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:40.280
to just a broken experience.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.250
So a few months ago
now, we've actually

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:46.510
enabled carrier billing
on Wi-Fi tablets.

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:48.670
And so if you activate your
carrier billing account

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:53.380
through your phone with your
SIM, that form of payment

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:56.160
would then be available
on your other devices,

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.260
including Wi-Fi devices.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.080
This led to a really cool
improvement in the user

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.540
experience for
tablet users, which

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:09.430
is an extremely
important segment for us.

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:13.850
Also important to us, just like
what we're talking about today,

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:18.260
is enabling local content
and local apps to be created.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.010
And so over the past
year, we've really

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:23.560
prioritized how many
countries from which

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.570
developers are able to sell
apps into the global market.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.330
That's what we
did here in China,

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.040
and that's what we're
here to talk to you about.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:36.210
And so we are at about 54,
and actually, the number

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:39.210
is probably 62 or
over 62 by now.

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:43.050
And so you can see us continuing
to push more and more markets

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:46.620
where developers can build local
content, because as all of you

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.830
probably know, it's all
about local content.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.850
The more local content is
there, the more engagement users

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:57.190
you have, and from then on, the
monetization cycle can begin.

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:58.750
So really excited
about this number.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:05.170
So now let's talk about what you
can do to improve monetization

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:07.940
within your apps.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:11.570
First off is localizing
your listings.

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:14.560
If you are targeting a
market, you obviously

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.420
can't localize in every
language and every market.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.860
We know you need to prioritize.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.620
But if you're
targeting a market,

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.650
if you're serious
about a market,

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:26.470
you're investing ad spend,
you're actually acquiring users

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:28.410
there, you're doing
user acquisition.

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:33.010
If you're doing that, then you
need to localize your listing.

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:37.570
Dropping a user into an English
language or Korean language

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:39.880
listing when they're
coming from Indonesia

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.410
or Malaysia or any
other combination,

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:43.716
it just doesn't work.

00:11:43.716 --> 00:11:45.090
And so what we've
seen, actually,

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:48.290
listings that are localized
convert 6x better than those

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:54.220
that aren't, and Pocket here
does a really good job at that.

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.150
Next is localizing
your pricing, and this

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:59.430
is one of those really
simple things that actually

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:01.790
cause a lot of trouble.

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:06.120
I always hear that local
developers have an edge over

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.280
those that aren't
local, that somehow,

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.790
the local developers know things
that the foreign developers

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:12.580
don't.

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.470
Where this is one of those
really simple things that local

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:19.320
developers get right that
foreign developers don't.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:23.720
In Japan, 100 yen is the
right pricing format.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:27.350
It is not 101 in this case.

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:29.100
And so while we have
this real easy to use

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:34.300
tool that automatically converts
your prices into all 65 country

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:38.660
currencies, you actually need
to go through and understand,

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:40.450
is that the right price?

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:44.040
What is the equivalent of
that magical number that

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:48.990
makes the purchase seem low cost
or makes it seem significant?

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:53.270
There are prices that, as we all
know, mean those kind of steps

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:57.240
in the user's mind, and
converting in a purchase flow,

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:01.330
any slightest thing can
give your users pause,

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:04.050
end up hurting your conversion.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:07.360
So when you do your pricing,
think about the local market,

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:11.250
think about the local norms,
and adapt your prices to that.

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:14.790
So 101 yen should be 100 yen.

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:17.355
We did an analysis of prices
in Japan in particular,

00:13:17.355 --> 00:13:21.210
and we saw apps that are priced
a little bit over and a little

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:24.910
bit less than 100 yen actually
converted 2x worse than those

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:27.320
that aren't.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.191
So think about this.

00:13:28.191 --> 00:13:28.940
This is important.

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:31.770
This is one of
those no brainers.

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:35.840
Please, you just
have to do this.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.880
I think we've touched on
this a few times today,

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:41.780
but there are multiple
models for you.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:45.530
A point I want to make here
is that your business model

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:47.750
may actually vary by market.

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:50.920
So different markets may have
different buying patterns.

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.830
In some, it's all about ads.

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:55.930
Maybe it's the only way
for users to pay, i.e.

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:58.820
they can't, and so you're
going to have ads primarily.

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:01.430
In other markets,
you may do in-app.

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:03.630
Subscriptions is more
of another dimension,

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:07.230
where certain types of apps
do best in subscription.

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:09.860
Others do really well in-in app.

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.160
And so there are multiple
dimensions to consider,

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.590
and the important
thing about this

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:16.940
is that you need to decide
at the very beginning

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.200
of your product iteration.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.620
When you build your
product, it fundamentally

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:24.720
depends on what kind of business
model you're going to choose.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.670
Is it going to be a feature
upgrade, and so that's

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:29.630
more of an in-app?

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:32.910
Is there recurring value
that you're creating,

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:35.300
in which case, it's more
of a subscriptions product,

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.230
paid app, ads, et cetera?

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:43.250
Subscription sales
on Google Play

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:45.880
have continued to grow
over the past year.

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.650
We're super excited
about it and we

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:50.600
believe that it's a really
good model for certain types

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.200
of apps, again.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.610
And so again, as you
build your application

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:56.650
and as you design
it, think about

00:14:56.650 --> 00:15:00.560
whether you are offering
recurring value for your users.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.480
If you are, then you
should definitely

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.840
consider using Google
Play subscriptions.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.790
We're building out the
platform to offer you

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:10.390
all the tools you
need to build a really

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:13.000
good experience for your users.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.460
Now, another important aspect
is if you have recurring costs,

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:20.150
then you probably want
to have either an in-app

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:23.670
or a subscription experience
because a paid app model

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:27.040
obviously will not work out.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.330
So we've launched a few
of these features already.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.410
So for example, we already
have seasonal subscriptions

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:37.850
that could work for sports
type apps, content type apps.

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:40.797
We've launched your ability
to give goodwill credits,

00:15:40.797 --> 00:15:43.130
and what that means is when
a user calls and they're not

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:46.570
happy about something that
your app has done to them,

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:49.020
unfortunately, you
can give them a credit

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:51.200
or you can refund them
a particular purchase.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.310
So that, again, helps with
building user engagement

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:56.440
and retention.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:00.390
We also offer you now APIs so
you can issue these refunds

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:01.810
from your back ends.

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:04.980
So if you have already
customer support tools,

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:07.130
you can plug into
our APIs and make

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:11.680
this completely seamless
for your support staff.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.470
Upgrades and downgrades is a
feature we're working on now,

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:17.840
and we're going to be launching
that in the near term as well.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.720
What that will
allow you to do is

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:23.250
allow you to upgrade a user
from one tier to the next.

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:26.640
So a lot of times, you have
an introductory tier where,

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:28.270
let's say it's a storage app.

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:32.820
You may have a 1.99 tier
for one terabyte of storage,

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:34.910
then you may have a 10
terabyte or 100 terabyte

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.460
storage tier for even more.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.350
What we're going to
do with this feature

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:43.970
allows users to swap between
those plans very easily.

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:46.350
So within your app, you
can trigger an upgrade.

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:48.360
The user upgrades, they
get the right credits,

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.570
we do all of the
math in the back end,

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:53.830
and the user just
seamlessly changes plans.

00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:00.010
Chris touched on this as well.

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:02.580
I cannot stress this enough.

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:05.880
It is incredibly,
incredibly important.

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.980
Building quality apps
is just the baseline

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:10.790
for being successful.

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:15.510
And these numbers, everybody
intuitively thinks and knows

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:18.319
that building a higher
quality app converts better

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:20.660
and does better for
you, but these numbers

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:22.880
are staggeringly high.

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:26.930
An app going from two to
three stars to four stars

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:29.890
has a 9x improvement in revenue.

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:33.275
Going from the four
range to five star

00:17:33.275 --> 00:17:35.900
or getting close to
five, obviously, you

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:39.640
get another 4x
improvement in revenue.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.720
So the ratings,
the stuff that Elie

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:45.900
talked about around replying
to reviews, fixing bugs,

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:51.090
QA, all of these things
actually impact your sales.

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:55.260
They actually help you
earn more from your app.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:59.800
We know that a lot of you are
obviously resource constrained,

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.690
and so when you are
investing in resources,

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:04.260
you can either build
features or fix bugs.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.570
We all have to deal with that.

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:08.910
And so this number,
what we're hoping

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:12.060
to do is give you some data
that can help you drive

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.870
that decision, give
you some information

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:17.610
that can help you
make those decisions

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:19.350
on a day to day basis.

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:22.005
But quality is
absolutely important.

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:30.830
This is another kind of
quality/basics type of thing.

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:35.540
Apps designed for tablets
monetize 10 times better than

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:37.390
those that aren't.

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:40.300
When you have someone
using a device,

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:43.860
they expect the app
to work well in it.

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:47.260
They expect it to be
designed for that device.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.340
If you are not designed
for that device,

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:51.670
then don't target that
device, but if you

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:53.650
are trying to
acquire users, again,

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:57.570
tablet users or
specific device users,

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:00.190
then you have to build
an application that

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:03.550
works well and is
designed for that device.

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:06.540
This is really, really
important, especially

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:11.240
as we see more form factors
become available on Android.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:15.560
Whether it's Auto, ATV,
Android TV, or Wear.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.620
So Wear, you get
it almost for free,

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:26.780
but you should check whether
the basic experience works well.

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:29.650
Of course, you can build really,
really awesome experiences

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:34.240
when you tailor your app's
experience for that ecosystem,

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:38.710
but the baseline is make sure
that whatever device tier

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:42.560
you're targeting, that
it's designed for it

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.007
and it works well in it.

00:19:44.007 --> 00:19:46.090
There's going to be more
and more of these things,

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:47.960
so you really need
to say ahead of it.

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:56.390
So to summarize, one of the
first things we talked about

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:58.910
is thinking beyond
your familiar markets.

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:01.170
Obviously, you are
going to be reaching out

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:05.770
to markets in 130
plus buying markets,

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:08.067
and so that gives
you lots of choices.

00:20:08.067 --> 00:20:10.150
It gives you a lot of
countries you can target to.

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:11.691
It gives you a lot
of countries where

00:20:11.691 --> 00:20:13.500
you can do user acquisition.

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:17.760
But be very mindful of what
countries you're targeting.

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.490
Be very purposeful.

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:24.580
When you reach a market, design
your app for that device.

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:25.980
Localize your listing.

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:27.820
Localize your pricing.

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:30.310
If you're acquiring
users in a market,

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:34.270
just be very
intentional about it.

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:36.770
Being easily global
on this platform

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:40.610
has that double edged sword of
one, you reach a billion users.

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:43.340
On the other side, you
reach a billion users,

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:46.990
and so you need to think about,
how will each of those users

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:49.040
interact with your
app, and make sure

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.150
that your experience is good.

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:55.280
That's the second point around
localize, localize, localize.

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:59.090
And finally, continue
to focus on quality.

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:02.940
We on Google Play are extremely,
extremely focused on quality

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.540
and make sure that
our users have

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:07.220
a great experience on Android.

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:11.810
And so success is directly tied
to you building great quality

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:12.910
apps.

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:17.510
This is especially true, again,
as the proliferation of devices

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:19.760
and Android TV and
Wear and Auto and all

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:23.620
these awesome new opportunities,
this is particularly true

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:26.720
that you need to be mindful
of the quality of your app

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.890
in each of those platforms.

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:30.900
That's all I had.

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:32.250
Thank you so much.

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:33.362
