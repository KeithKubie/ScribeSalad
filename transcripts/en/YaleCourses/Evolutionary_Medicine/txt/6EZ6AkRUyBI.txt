Speaker 1:          00:00          We're now going to all have a series of lectures on how pathogens evolve. The first lecture we'll deal with pathogen causing very islands. The second with how the Microbiota are managed and the distinction between symbiotes and pathogens. The third with how pathogens have evolved to evade and suppress the immune system. The fourth deals with an extremely important problem, the rapid evolution of antibiotic resistance and the fifth concerns therapies that can mitigate the consequences of that kind of evolution. Pathogens have their own agendas, they respond flexibly in rapidly to anything that we do to them. And you can think of them as being primarily interested in their own reproductive success and not really being at all interested in what happens to you, either good or bad. So let's first discuss pathogen caused very ones. And the key idea here is the tradeoff between virulence and transmission.

Speaker 1:          01:06          Another is the distinction between vertical and horizontal transmission. And the third is the distinction between single and multiple infections. Each one of these contrasts affects intrinsic pathogen virulence. Now virulence is caused both by direct pathogen effects and by host responses we've just seen in the last set of lectures how many diseases there are that are associated with the immune response. Virulence is always an interaction between pathogen and host, and in these lectures we are analyzing the portion of damage done to the host that is caused by properties that are intrinsic to the pathogen rather than by the host response.

Speaker 1:          02:01          The first idea here is that there is a trade off between the virulence of the pathogen and the probability that it will be transmitted. And the example that brought that idea to the forefront is Myxoma virus in rabbits. So the Myxoma virus is a member of the pox virus family. It's transmitted by mosquitoes or fleas, ticks and Mites. So it's an arbovirus. It causes tumors, but not immediate death in cottontail rabbits in the Americas, but in European rabbits, the genus or rectal as it causes myxomatosis, which is an acute disease that initially has a 100% mortality rate.

Speaker 1:          02:47          Now it is European rabbits who were brought into Australia. Myxomatosis was introduced to Australia to control their devastating outbreak. There were no natural predators of European rabbits and they were essentially grazing the countryside right down to the dirt. Both the pathogen and the host then evolved. The pathogen evolve less virulence and better resistance evolved in the host. Virulence did decline, so virulence did go down, but myxoma remained quite very lengthy. Infected rabbits at the end still only survive for 20 days. So this is how virulent strains changed. They identified five grades of virulence by case fatality rates. So real and great one had more than 99% case fatality rate down through Vereal. That's great. Five which had less than 50% the mean survival time was less than 13 days for various grade one and quite long, quite a bit longer than 50 days for Vereal inch grade five. These rows indicate time periods between 1950 and 1981 what you can see is that initially 100% of the strains of Myxoma virus were great. One. They lost very once, but they essentially evolved into virulence grade three here in the middle, which still has a case fatality rate of between about 50 and 70%.

Speaker 1:          04:30          So the way this works is that if the rabbit dies quickly, there's very little opportunity for fleas and other biting insects that transmit the disease. The less virulent forms that can then out compete, the more virulent forms because they have superior transmission.

Speaker 2:          04:49          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:49          However, they do worse while doing worse in a single host, they are doing better in the population as a whole.

Speaker 2:          04:58          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:58          No. The hosts also evolved genetic resistance and they do have adaptive immunity.

Speaker 2:          05:05          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:05          So the take home point from the Myxoma virus in Australia is that there's often a trade off between Varian once and transmission from the pathogens point of view. This trade off is a major problem. If the pathogen is only living in this host, if it also has other hosts, then that's not so much of a problem. If this problem is not solved a host specific pathogen, we'll go locally extinct because it will essentially kill all of its hosts before it can transmit out of them, which is what happened in the initial eval epidemics.

Speaker 2:          05:40          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          05:41          The second major issue with very Lynch's vertical versus horizontal versus vector transmission. Strictly vertical transmission, which is a transmission from parent to offspring, selects for low virulence and eventually for commensalism this. In other words, this is pathogen transmission, which is mimicking the transmission of genes from parents to offspring. Strictly horizontal transmission. That is no transmission from parent to offspring, but all transmission between individuals who are of the same age class and not necessarily related. It selects for Highbury ones selection for virulence with vector transmission depends on the impact of virulence on the efficacy of the vector. So in vector borne diseases, the genome of the pathogen has to be able to deal with both the host and with the vector that gets it to the host and they can often have different kinds of immune systems. Waterborne horizontally transmitted diseases, uh, have major impact. So here are a few of the major health problems. On the planet, typhoid fever, cholera, amoebic, dysentery, rotavirus and Basler dysentery. The annual deaths that are being caused by these diseases continue at high levels, so we're seeing in some more than a million, about a million and a half deaths annually from waterborne diseases. Now, this is why the clean water that's provided by a modern sewage system has such a huge impact on human survival.

Speaker 2:          07:28          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:30          Another major determinant of the intrinsic virulence of pathogens is thought to be weather infection is single or multiple, just the host infected just by one strain of pathogen or by multiple strains. And first we have effects that are mediated by host mortality,

Speaker 1:          07:49          so multiple infection will select for increased intrinsic virulence. If the impact of the parasites on the host is through the mortality of the host. Then competition among strains for representation and trends in transmission modifies the virulence transmission trade off. Because to be transmitted, the pathogen has to dominate the competition, but in doing so, it damages the host. So virulence is going to increase because the competing pathogens or is a pro is a byproduct of their competition damaging the host. They can't avoid doing so because if one of them doesn't do what the other one will.

Speaker 1:          08:38          However, if the effects are mediated by host growth or host condition rather than by the death of the host, if they have sub lethal effects, and if those effects feedback to the parasites to reduce their rate of development. So we're slowly, slowly growing. Host or a host in poor condition is one in which the parasites cannot develop as rapidly. Then multiplicity of infection generally leads to lower variance. So this is a complex one to summarize. Virulence intrinsic to pathogens increases when anything affects the virulence transmission tradeoff. Anything shifts transmission from vertical to horizontal. Anything increases the frequency of multiple infections that have more impact on mortality than on growth. So virulence is a characteristic of pathogens that can evolve in response to these sorts of conditions.
