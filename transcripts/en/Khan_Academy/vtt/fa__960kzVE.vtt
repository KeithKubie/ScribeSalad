00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:02.414
- What I hope to do in this
video is several examples

00:00:02.414 --> 00:00:04.213
from the Khan Academy exercise on

00:00:04.213 --> 00:00:06.350
negative number addition and subtraction

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.993
equivalent expressions.

00:00:07.993 --> 00:00:09.668
This is just to really make sure that we

00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:12.606
fully digested how we can compute with

00:00:12.606 --> 00:00:14.162
negative and positive numbers,

00:00:14.162 --> 00:00:15.589
and also the properties

00:00:17.558 --> 00:00:20.561
of arithmetic that we can apply
when we compute with them.

00:00:20.561 --> 00:00:21.722
Let's get started.

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:24.067
It says Raul tried to evaluate

00:00:24.067 --> 00:00:25.867
an expression step by step.

00:00:26.081 --> 00:00:27.863
All right, they start with the expression,

00:00:27.863 --> 00:00:29.000
they give us the steps.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.380
They say find Raul's mistake.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.221
We have Step 1, Step 2, Step 3,

00:00:33.221 --> 00:00:35.635
or maybe Raul did not make a mistake.

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:38.289
Like always, I encourage
you to pause the video

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:40.773
and try to solve it on your
own before I work through it.

00:00:41.665 --> 00:00:43.255
All right, so let's
look at this first step.

00:00:43.255 --> 00:00:46.703
It says 3 minus negative 5 minus 7.

00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:49.153
It looks like he correctly recognized

00:00:49.153 --> 00:00:52.229
that subtracting a negative
5 is the same thing

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:54.380
as adding a positive 5.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.096
He replaced the minus negative 5

00:00:57.096 --> 00:01:00.138
with the plus 5 right over there.

00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:02.042
That seems right.

00:01:02.042 --> 00:01:02.901
All right.

00:01:03.685 --> 00:01:05.873
Step 1 seems all right.

00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:08.090
Then, what does he do next?

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.274
He has two options.

00:01:09.274 --> 00:01:12.618
He could say 3 plus 5 is equal to 8,

00:01:12.618 --> 00:01:14.649
and then subtract 7 from that,

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:15.996
an you would get 1.

00:01:16.857 --> 00:01:20.384
He could even say 5 minus 7 is negative 2,

00:01:20.384 --> 00:01:22.880
and then add that to 3, and get 1.

00:01:23.726 --> 00:01:26.664
It looks like Raul tried
to go that second way,

00:01:26.664 --> 00:01:28.905
but he made a slight mistake.

00:01:28.905 --> 00:01:33.862
He said 5 minus 7 is
equal to 2 not negative 2.

00:01:33.862 --> 00:01:35.452
5 minus 7 should be negative 2,

00:01:35.452 --> 00:01:37.484
but he wrote a positive 2 right over here.

00:01:37.484 --> 00:01:40.242
His mistake is in Step 2.

00:01:40.242 --> 00:01:42.517
Then obviously, Step 3 becomes wrong,

00:01:42.517 --> 00:01:43.725
because Step 2.

00:01:46.155 --> 00:01:49.117
This is where he first makes the mistake.

00:01:50.054 --> 00:01:52.010
Let's do several more of these.

00:01:53.163 --> 00:01:55.572
Which of the following
expressions are equivalent

00:01:55.572 --> 00:01:59.693
to 6 plus negative 4 minus 5.

00:02:00.077 --> 00:02:02.294
All right, so let's look
at all the options here.

00:02:03.094 --> 00:02:04.418
This first one, let's see,

00:02:04.418 --> 00:02:05.834
has a negative 5.

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:07.111
Well, the negative 5,

00:02:07.111 --> 00:02:09.155
this minus 5 if you put it out front,

00:02:09.155 --> 00:02:11.476
you could represent it as a negative 5.

00:02:12.383 --> 00:02:14.634
Then it has a negative 4 here.

00:02:15.264 --> 00:02:16.886
Here, we're adding a negative 4,

00:02:17.362 --> 00:02:18.599
or I guess you could say,

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.501
we have minus 4 here,

00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:24.520
which is the same thing
as adding a negative 4.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.866
That seems reasonable.

00:02:25.866 --> 00:02:27.341
Then, you have plus 6,

00:02:27.341 --> 00:02:29.918
and you just had a
positive 6 right over here.

00:02:29.918 --> 00:02:32.019
This one actually seem equivalent.

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:32.901
It just the order,

00:02:32.901 --> 00:02:34.167
they just switched the order.

00:02:34.751 --> 00:02:36.588
Instead of adding the 6 first,

00:02:36.588 --> 00:02:38.410
they add the positive 6 last.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.628
Instead of having the minus 5 at the end,

00:02:40.628 --> 00:02:42.555
they put a negative 5 in the beginning.

00:02:42.555 --> 00:02:44.729
Instead of saying adding negative 4,

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:46.147
they just said minus 4.

00:02:46.147 --> 00:02:47.249
These are all equivalent.

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:49.815
This one is going to be
an equivalent expression.

00:02:49.815 --> 00:02:51.469
Now, let's see, this one has ...

00:02:52.453 --> 00:02:54.702
it has the 6 and the minus 4,

00:02:54.702 --> 00:02:55.486
they just changed the order.

00:02:55.486 --> 00:02:56.926
Now, it has positive 5.

00:02:56.926 --> 00:02:58.157
That's not going to work,

00:02:58.157 --> 00:03:00.943
because we're subtracting 5 out here.

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:03.404
If we want to put the 5 out front,

00:03:03.404 --> 00:03:05.621
it needs to be a negative 5.

00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:06.898
This isn't going to be right.

00:03:06.898 --> 00:03:08.163
I'm not going to select none of the above,

00:03:08.163 --> 00:03:09.858
because I found a choice
that is equivalent.

00:03:10.672 --> 00:03:12.361
Let's keep going, it's a lot of fun.

00:03:12.361 --> 00:03:14.717
Which of the following expressions are

00:03:14.717 --> 00:03:18.514
equivalent to negative 4
plus 4 plus 5 in parenthesis.

00:03:18.514 --> 00:03:19.593
If I were to compute this,

00:03:19.593 --> 00:03:20.963
I would say negative 4 plus,

00:03:20.963 --> 00:03:23.656
and I would add the 4 and the 5 first.

00:03:23.656 --> 00:03:25.282
I would get 9.

00:03:25.282 --> 00:03:27.336
It would be negative 4
plus 9 which is equal to 5.

00:03:28.028 --> 00:03:28.904
Let's see.

00:03:28.904 --> 00:03:33.161
Zero plus 5, well that's
going to be equal to 5.

00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:34.277
That's equivalent.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.161
I mean, I could just do it again.

00:03:38.714 --> 00:03:41.283
Negative 4 plus 9 is 5,

00:03:41.283 --> 00:03:43.557
which is the same thing as 9 minus 4.

00:03:43.557 --> 00:03:45.298
This right here is 5.

00:03:45.651 --> 00:03:47.554
Now, this is negative 4 minus 4,

00:03:47.554 --> 00:03:49.516
which would be negative 8.

00:03:49.516 --> 00:03:52.256
Then, plus 5 would be negative 3.

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:54.078
That's not equivalent.

00:03:54.078 --> 00:03:54.937
In order to be equivalent,

00:03:54.937 --> 00:03:56.575
this should evaluate out to be 5.

00:03:56.575 --> 00:03:57.620
I'm not going to select that,

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:58.739
and I'm not going to
select none of the above,

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.538
because I all ready found
a choice that I like.

00:04:01.353 --> 00:04:02.709
Let's do a few more of these.

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.625
One again, which are equivalent?

00:04:04.625 --> 00:04:08.048
Negative 5 plus 7 minus negative 3.

00:04:09.032 --> 00:04:12.530
Here you have negative 5 plus 7 plus 3.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:13.173
Well, that make sense.

00:04:13.173 --> 00:04:15.053
If you subtract a negative 3,

00:04:15.053 --> 00:04:17.096
that's the same thing as adding a 3.

00:04:17.096 --> 00:04:19.429
They didn't change the negative 5 plus 7.

00:04:19.736 --> 00:04:21.530
They didn't change the negative 5 plus 7.

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.167
I definitely select this one.

00:04:23.167 --> 00:04:24.525
Definitely select that.

00:04:24.525 --> 00:04:25.732
Now, let's look at this one.

00:04:27.716 --> 00:04:30.806
Negative 5, here they're subtracting a 5,

00:04:30.806 --> 00:04:31.966
so that seems reasonable.

00:04:31.966 --> 00:04:34.091
Adding 7, they're adding 7.

00:04:34.783 --> 00:04:36.889
Here, they're subtracting a negative 3,

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.628
which is the same thing
as adding a positive 3.

00:04:39.628 --> 00:04:42.927
Here, they just have a negative 3 here.

00:04:42.927 --> 00:04:44.668
If this was a positive 3,

00:04:44.668 --> 00:04:45.933
then we would be in business.

00:04:45.933 --> 00:04:46.769
This is a negative 3,

00:04:46.769 --> 00:04:47.988
so this isn't going to work.

00:04:47.988 --> 00:04:49.728
I will not select that.

00:04:49.753 --> 00:04:50.914
I won't select none of the above,

00:04:50.914 --> 00:04:52.156
because I found a choice.

00:04:53.217 --> 00:04:54.426
Let's do one more of these.

00:04:55.041 --> 00:04:56.875
Which of the following expressions

00:04:56.875 --> 00:04:59.371
are equivalent to X plus Y,

00:04:59.371 --> 00:05:00.718
and since there's parenthesis around it

00:05:00.718 --> 00:05:01.879
I would do that first,

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:04.015
and then I would subtract Z.

00:05:04.015 --> 00:05:05.257
Select all that apply.

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.801
All right.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.065
Here, they have Z plus X plus Y.

00:05:13.772 --> 00:05:15.654
They have the X plus Y part,

00:05:16.361 --> 00:05:19.821
but then they have a Z here,

00:05:19.821 --> 00:05:22.247
while over here they have minus Z.

00:05:22.247 --> 00:05:23.861
If there were a negative Z here,

00:05:23.861 --> 00:05:25.661
this and this would of been equivalent,

00:05:25.661 --> 00:05:27.065
but they don't have a negative Z here.

00:05:27.065 --> 00:05:29.817
I would not select that one.

00:05:30.617 --> 00:05:34.449
Now, this one you have X plus Y minus Z.

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:36.968
Well this, they just
changed the parenthesis.

00:05:36.968 --> 00:05:38.663
Instead of doing the X plus Y first,

00:05:38.663 --> 00:05:41.286
they're dong the Y minus Z first.

00:05:42.239 --> 00:05:45.291
This goes back to
addition and subtraction.

00:05:45.291 --> 00:05:47.323
You have the associative property.

00:05:47.323 --> 00:05:48.948
You could associate these.

00:05:48.948 --> 00:05:50.202
You could start with

00:05:50.202 --> 00:05:51.630
adding these two first,

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.069
and then you do the subtracting,

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:54.544
or you could do the subtraction first.

00:05:54.544 --> 00:05:56.320
Then, you add this one.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.527
If you don't believe me,

00:05:57.527 --> 00:05:58.944
you could try it out with some numbers,

00:05:58.944 --> 00:06:00.000
and I encourage you to try it out

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.567
with some negative numbers.

00:06:01.567 --> 00:06:03.401
It will indeed all work out.

00:06:03.401 --> 00:06:05.526
All they do is they change
where the parenthesis are.

00:06:05.526 --> 00:06:07.662
They did the Y minus Z first,

00:06:07.662 --> 00:06:11.145
and then they do the Y minus Z,

00:06:11.145 --> 00:06:12.526
and then they add it to the X,

00:06:12.526 --> 00:06:14.639
as opposed to doing the X plus Y first,

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:16.520
then subtracting the Z.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.621
I would go with that one.
