00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.190
Hey guys, I'm Nate welcome back to our workshop.

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.779
Today we've got a fun experiment where we're going to see what happens if we put a microphone and a speaker

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:10.709
In our vacuum chamber. As many of you probably know, sound waves are

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.180
vibrations in the air around us and so,

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.840
in theory: if we take away that air those sound waves should no longer propagate

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.520
and we shouldn't be able to hear anything.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.120
We want to try putting that to the test in a few different ways.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.400
As first test let's try putting our speaker into the chamber but leaving all of the air in

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.700
and see how much of the sound our microphone can pick up right outside the glass?

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.420
Wow... that's a huge difference right there!

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.880
Well, I guess we know that glass and thick Plexiglas does a good job of dampening sound all on its own.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.009
All right, I think we've pretty well established

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.230
What its gonna sound like with our speaker in air inside the vacuum chamber. So now we need to try pulling out the air.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.580
But I also want to make sure that we aren't just blasting too much sound straight into the glass

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.100
because that can also conduct the noise. So to add a little bit of padding

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.560
let's throw some cotton balls down into the bottom of our chamber and make sure that our speaker is facing the correct direction.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.360
This speaker actually blasts the sound out of the back

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.610
So we'll try putting it face down on

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.780
Top of a pile of cotton balls to make sure that we're really playing into a vacuum as much as possible

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.180
That seems like a good amount of cotton balls

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.320
it should keep our speaker off of the glass so

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.720
the sound is just projecting into the air or the lack of air once we pull a vacuum

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:39.959
Now let's try pulling out a vacuum, hope that our Bluetooth speaker still works in a vacuum, and see if we can hear it.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.119
All right, air is being pulled out!

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.180
I Admit, I hadn't actually tried seeing what happens with cotton balls in a vacuum before just now

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.110
I don't think it's gonna do anything, and it looks like I'm right

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.540
They aren't puffing up the way marshmallows do because they aren't holding any air. There's just air in between the fibers

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.860
This is looking good. Almost up to a vacuum...

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.700
We have very little air in there right now.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:17.440
At about 25 on this pump the most vacuum. It pulls is about 26 inches of mercury

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.460
All right that is really close. We're gonna try calling that good

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.989
Let's see how well we can hear our speaker or not with a vacuum!

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.019
Here goes playing the same clip of music

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.820
If I attack my ear to it, then I can hear a little tiny bit

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.560
It's extremely quiet

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.299
I can't hear anything if it's on the glass

00:02:54.299 --> 00:03:00.359
It's only on the Plexiglas side where the speaker is actually pointed right at it, so there may be a tiny...

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:07.350
tiny bit of air still in there or maybe it's conducting directly through the speaker into the cotton balls into the glass

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.869
through the rubber to the plexiglass. I don't know I'm not sure how it's getting there, but like this

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.560
Can barely hear the faintest music other than that...

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.420
' See, I'm gonna try it like pushing it touching this microphone to the plexiglass. I don't know if it'll pick anything up

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.700
So quiet...

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.360
All right, let's let the air back in while it's still playing and we'll see what happens

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.500
Letting it in slowly so we can kind of see at what point we can hear it

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.760
I'm hearing a little bit of it now

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.660
All right, that seems like a pretty good conclusive test to me that this does not play well through a vacuum.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.280
There was just the Tiniest bit of sound that was able to get through

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.440
somehow, maybe, there's just a little bit of air in there,;

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.020
maybe was conducting through the other materials inside the chamber, but it was almost completely silent

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.120
So now, let's try switching: put the microphone inside the speaker outside and see if the microphone can pick anything up.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.800
All right, let's pull all the air out, and then we'll turn on the sound and see if the microphone can pick anything up.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.360
All right, let's call that good.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.140
The microphone is still recording. We'll see if it can pick up any of the sound here goes

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.720
All right, now also as an experiment

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.079
let's try touching the speaker to the glass and the plexiglass and see if it picks anything up like that

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:18.818
All right, let's let the pressure back in and we'll find out how it went.

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:25.119
I'll try letting some music play while it depressurizes to see at what point the microphone starts picking things back up.

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.910
There we go. Microphone in the vacuum chamber with the speaker outside the vacuum chamber

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:12.439
Now I want to try putting both of them in the vacuum chamber with the cotton balls

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.220
and then pulling the air out

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:20.089
and I think I might actually try letting the sound run as the air pulls out so we can see if it just

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.869
slowly drops off as we run out of air. Let's give a shot.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.839
Speak here in here make sure it's not touching the walls

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.320
microphone in there

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.500
All right, there we go. We've got both of them in there.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:37.010
Let's get the sound going and then start pulling out the air and see if we get that sound

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.720
to just seem like we're turning down the volume knob.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:12.680
Very quietly I can hear if I touch my ear to the Plexiglas like really press it on there

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:21.600
Think I can even hear it a little bit with my ear on the glass itself this time

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:28.840
Super quiet although. Alright, let's let the air back in while it's still playing see what kind of result we get.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:48.460
All right.

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:49.200
There we go!

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:54.990
Both the microphone and the speaker in the vacuum chamber at the same time, pulling the vacuum while it's playing music.

00:08:54.990 --> 00:09:01.049
So hopefully we can hear the sound diminishing as it loses the ability to transfer the sound through the air.

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:06.779
Now I've had a chance to go and listen to the sounds that the microphone recorded while the microphone and the speaker will both inside the

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.040
vacuum chamber with no air

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:12.029
I really thought that the sound is gonna be almost nothing that it would be almost completely silent

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:16.000
But the microphone managed to pick up quite a bit of the music from the speaker

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.820
so something in that chamber is still vibrating enough to get the sound from our speaker to our microphone.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:24.180
There you have it playing sound and music inside a vacuum chamber,

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.880
we tried a whole bunch of different varieties with the speaker

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.140
or the microphone inside the chamber, outside the chamber, both inside the chamber,

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.060
and I think we got some really good results

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:36.740
and luckily for us our microphone does still function in a vacuum! That was good to learn.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.200
This has been a really fun experiment

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.280
I love learning and testing new things like this

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:45.620
Thank you for joining us for this video today and remember to come gear yourself up with products and merch at the "kingofrandom.com"

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.200
See you there!

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.420
Hey guys, I'm Nate wel- man!

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.500
A little worried about the LCD screen...

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:53.980
So far it seems alright

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.320
Sorry I'm super weird
