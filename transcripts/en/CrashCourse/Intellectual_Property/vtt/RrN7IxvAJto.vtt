Hi, I'm Stan Muller. This is Crash Course:
Intellectual Property and today we're talking

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.419
about patent law. That's why I'm wearing these
fancy patent leather shoes. They're a little

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.099
too small and uh, I had a hard time putting
them on. If only somebody would invent a new

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:18.639
useful and non-obvious tool for forcing feet into
too small shoes. Mark, can I take these off now?

00:00:18.639 --> 00:00:27.199
[Theme Music]

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.060
A patent is a grant by a government that allows
an inventor to maintain a monopoly on the

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.670
use and development of an invention for a
limited time. Patents allow inventors to prevent

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.730
or exclude other people or companies from
manufacturing, selling, or using their patented

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.650
inventions. Governments grant these exclusive
rights in exchange for the clear and detailed

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.631
public disclosure of inventions.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.399
So here's the deal. You invent something awesome,
explain how you did it in patently obvious

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.959
terms, we'll let you be the sole owner for
a couple of decades or so which should give

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.220
you enough time to make some money off the
thing.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.940
Ideally, you'll get rich for your inventive
efforts before the term expires or maybe you'll

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.680
pour all that money into more research and
develop new patents.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.620
The notion of giving talented inventors and
innovators a limited monopoly in exchange

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.800
for their instructing the rest of their less
talented fellow citizens is not new.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.080
It's generally accepted that the first systematic
patent law was developed in Venice, a hotbed

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.140
of Renaissance Industrial activity. The 1474
Venetian patent statute sums up the economic

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.560
rationale of patent law pretty nicely.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.560
"We have among us men of great genius, apt
to invent and discover ingenious devices;

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.110
and in view of the grandeur and virtue of
our city, more such men come to us every day

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.600
from diverse parts. Now, if provision were
made for the works and devices discovered

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.380
by such persons, so that others who may
see them could not build them and take

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.680
the inventor's honor away, more men would
then apply their genius would discover, and

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.000
would build devices of great utility and benefit
to our commonwealth."

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.740
Wow. These Venetians really thought a lot
of themselves. "Grandeur and virtue of our city."

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.640
This idea of granting exclusive rights to inventors
to encourage discovery, spread throughout Europe,

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.920
into England and then to the United States, where
it was incorporated into the U.S. Constitution.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.480
In order for an innovation or invention to
be patentable, the invention must satisfy

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.259
five requirements. We'll look at all of these
requirements generally, and we'll look at

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.519
the patent for our trusty liquid-filled die
agitator containing a die having raised indicia

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:20.860
on the facets thereof. Magic 8 Ball's patent was issued in 1964 and did it meet all these requirements? Yes.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.560
So this seems a little circular, but the first
requirement is that the patent's subject matter

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.060
be patentable. The categories for patentable
subject matter are defined as broadly as any

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.920
process, machine, manufacture, or composition
of matter, or improvement thereof. The Supreme

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.760
Court has interpreted this to mean that anything
under the Sun that is made by human beings

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.150
is patentable. However broad this definition
might be, certain things like, the laws

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.270
of nature, physical phenomenon, abstract ideas,
have consistently been held not to be patentable.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.780
The distinction here is that the innovation
has to be the product of human inventiveness,

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.270
and not the product of nature.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.100
The Supreme Court recently looked at this
issue in a 2013 case involving a biotech

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.540
firm that had isolated human DNA linked to
ovarian and breast cancer. The company argued

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.300
that it had developed an innovative process for looking for mutations that might lead to cancer and isolating.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.560
They argued that the isolated genes were the product
of human inventiveness and therefore patentable.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.900
The court disagreed, finding that a naturally
occurring DNA segment is a product

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.330
of nature and not patent eligible merely because
it's been isolated.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.740
The Magic 8 Ball is certainly the product
of human inventiveness, although it would

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.930
be fantastic if these were formed by nature,
like if they washed up on beaches or maybe

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.620
there was a Magic 8 Ball tree. I use fantastic
here in the sense that this is obviously a

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.810
fantasy. But, uh, mmm, what a world that would
be.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.560
So are you patentable subject matter or what?

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.800
It is certain.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.310
The second requirement for patentability is
that the invention be useful, which means

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.530
both that it has some identifiable benefit
and that it's capable of being used. Patent

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.680
law often refers to a person of ordinary skill
in the art. What they're talking about here

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.319
is an engineer or fellow inventor that can
understand the technical information included

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.310
in the patent. This differs from like tort
law, where the law often refers to a reasonable

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.790
person standard. Understanding patents requires
a little more technical expertise. I mention

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.770
this because the second requirement relies
on a person skilled in the art to accept that

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.700
the invention described in the patent is useful
and that it works.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.250
The Magic 8 Ball is very useful. It functions
in the way that the patent claims it does.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.630
It displays answers to yes-or-no questions such as, "Should I join the Merchant Marines?"

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.830
or "Will I die alone?"
Are you useful?

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.340
It is decidedly so.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.000
The third requirement for patent protection
is that the invention be new or novel. Basically,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.940
if somebody else already invented or patented
a similar invention, you can't get a patent.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.800
Going back to the case of our Magic 8 Ball,
despite the fact that its application notes

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.510
that similar devices exist, the novelty of
the 1964 version lies in the shape of the

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.389
die, which allows for a better question-and-answer
experience.

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:46.370
Are you novel?

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:47.690
Outlook good.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.010
The innovation must also be non-obvious. The
test for non-obviousness is whether the innovation

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.830
and the prior art, by which I mean all that
which has come before the innovation, are

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.010
such that the innovation as a whole would
not have been obvious to a person having ordinary

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.699
skill in the art at the time the invention
was made. This is kind of a difficult theoretical

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:08.479
task for a judge or patent examiner. Sometimes
the most inventive leaps of logic yield solutions

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:13.150
that are so elegant that they seem obvious
once you've seen it. The Magic 8 ball 1964

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.620
patent was for an improvement to the original
invention. The inventor added many more sides

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.960
to the die and also added the all-important
raised indicia: the raised lettering, so as

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.520
to prevent bubbling between the viewing screen
and the die. It doesn't seem obvious to me.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.580
Magic 8 ball, are you non-obvious?

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.780
Without a doubt.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.650
The final requirement is enablement. Technically,
this means "the specification of the patent

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.250
shall contain a written description of the
invention, and of the manner and process of

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.720
making and using it, in such full, clear,
concise, and exact terms as to enable any

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.060
person skilled in the art to which it pertains
to make and use the same, and shall set forth

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.150
the best mode contemplated by the inventor
of carrying out his invention." Whoever wrote

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.040
this doesn't understand the terms clear and
concise. What they're saying is that the plan

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.690
submitted with the patent have to be clear
and complete enough for someone else to recreate

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.430
the invention without too much trouble. Beyond
this, the applicant has to describe the best

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.100
mode of making this thing happen. The inventor
can't give people the runaround. If there's

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.900
a best way to recreate the invention in question,
the inventor is required to disclose it.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.300
This final step is essential to the underlying
rationale of patent law. Without a clear and

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.650
accurate explanation of how to make and use
the innovation, the public gets nothing in

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.660
return for granting the limited monopoly.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.740
So, what's it gonna be, Magic 8 ball?

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.110
Can we make or use you based on the patent's
description?

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.480
As I see it, yes.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.880
There are 3 types of patents issued by the
Patent &amp; Trademark office: utility patents,

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.560
design patents, and plant patents. The 5 requirements
we just talked about refer to utility patents.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.820
Design patents cover any new, original, and
ornamental, rather than useful, article of

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:42.990
manufacture. Apple is famous for their design
patents and their utility patents.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.600
Plant patents are granted to persons who first
noticed the distinctiveness of a plant, then

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.940
reproduced it asexually, by grafting or cloning,
rather than growing it from a seed. If you

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.850
grow it from a seed, you can't patent it.
The plant must be novel and distinctive to

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:58.330
be granted a patent, which basically means
that it has to have at least one significant

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.650
distinguishing characteristic to establish
it as a distinct variety. So this is what

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:07.020
a plant patent looks like. Not a lot of them
get issued relative to utility or design patents.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.900
On a related note, the human-made plant, or
a plant that's been genetically engineered,

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:14.430
can also be the subject of a utility patent.
Provided it meets all the 5 requirements we

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:18.070
talked about. Often, these are plants that
are resistant to certain herbicides or are

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:22.190
better suited to shipping. There's even a man-made
variety of cotton that's resistant to pests.

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:26.479
Patents don't last forever. The term of protection
for utility patents is 20 years, measured

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:30.410
from the date of filing. There are extensions
of up to 5 years allowed for drugs, medical

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:34.630
devices, and additives. The current term of
protection for design patents is 14 years,

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:38.479
and that's also from the date of filing. So
patents are all about the money.

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:40.080
Let's talk about that in the Thought Bubble.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.440
In terms of economic impact, patent law is
arguably the most important branch of intellectual

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.949
property. There are legitimate questions about
the role of patents and what types of research

00:07:47.949 --> 00:07:51.759
and development patent law encourages. Does
the law encourage more research into highly

00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:56.210
lucrative erectile dysfunction medications
than stuff like anti-malarial drugs? Should

00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:00.199
developing nations be able to create public
health exceptions for life-saving proprietary

00:08:00.199 --> 00:08:03.740
medications? If so, then how would companies
be able to pay for the development of these

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.720
medications or future life-saving medications
without the assurance of patent protection?

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.340
And then there are non-practicing entities,
often called patent trolls, that go around

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:16.220
acquiring huge patent portfolios, and then
threaten to sue pretty much everybody. Patent

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:20.130
trolls bring these lawsuits despite the fact
that they have no interest in developing or

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:23.840
manufacturing any actual products. This is
their business model. Because of the high

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:28.350
cost of litigation, costs can range from about
a $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 if this goes to

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:33.140
trial and the threat of massive damage awards.
Most companies sued by patent trolls settle or agree

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:38.180
to pay a licensing fee to the trolls. There's legislation
pending in Congress designed to address this issue.

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:42.500
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So the policy issues
around patents are incredibly complex and

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:46.640
controversial, and this video is only a basic
overview. The underlying purpose of patent

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.589
law, which is to reward inventors for their
skill and effort, is often in direct opposition

00:08:50.589 --> 00:08:55.070
to the public's interest in accessing those
innovations. Whether it be life-saving medications

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:58.480
that costs thousands of dollars per pill or
water treatment technologies that developing

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.830
countries can't afford to license. The trick
is to strike a balance between providing inventors

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:08.820
with incentives and ensuring public access. How we
attain that balance is still very much an open question.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.380
