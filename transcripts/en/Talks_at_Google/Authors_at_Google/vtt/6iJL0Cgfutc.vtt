00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.783
FEMALE SPEAKER: Please join me
in welcoming to Google New York

00:00:02.783 --> 00:00:03.288
Adam Braun.

00:00:03.288 --> 00:00:08.178
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.178 --> 00:00:10.865
Adam and I were chatting a
bit before you guys came in

00:00:10.865 --> 00:00:12.865
and I was telling him
that this book is really--

00:00:12.865 --> 00:00:14.010
it's an amazing story.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.430
It really captures the
spirit of the organization

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.350
and how it started.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.330
But I thought something that
was a really interesting thread

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.560
throughout the book was this
exploration journey internal

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.340
and also throughout the world.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.660
Can you tell me how
that started for you?

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.980
ADAM BRAUN: A great question.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.165
So for those that aren't
familiar with the book,

00:00:35.165 --> 00:00:37.050
it's first and
foremost the story

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.980
of turning $25-- which is how
I started the organization--

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.060
to now more than 200
schools globally.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.260
But along the way, it
provides the guiding steps

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.440
to a life of both
success and significance.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.010
I think for a long time,
previous to the current era,

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.925
you almost have to
choose one or the other.

00:00:51.925 --> 00:00:55.545
You could have what we deem
success or more purpose

00:00:55.545 --> 00:00:57.450
or meeting and
philanthropy in your life

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.482
and nowadays there's this
beautiful intersection

00:00:59.482 --> 00:01:00.190
that's occurring.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.110
So the book is really
written to help individuals

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.360
find their own path
to achieving both.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.900
And it's framed
around 30 mantras.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.990
So every chapter is a very
short, quick vignette--

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.890
an individual story and their
titles with these mantras

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.940
that are guiding steps
like a central truth

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.440
that I found helpful
over the years.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.960
And I would write in
journals or on white boards.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.130
And one of them is get
outside of your comfort zone,

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.879
or get out of your comfort zone.

00:01:29.879 --> 00:01:31.420
And I think it speaks
to the question

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.664
that you asked because
I think part of it

00:01:33.664 --> 00:01:36.080
is maybe because I was a middle
child and middle children,

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.082
you're given the
freedom to explore.

00:01:38.082 --> 00:01:39.540
Because people are
paying attention

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.320
to your oldest and
your younger siblings.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.986
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm
a middle child, too.

00:01:42.986 --> 00:01:44.510
ADAM BRAUN: Yeah.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.872
You have this recognition
pretty early on have

00:01:46.872 --> 00:01:51.190
that you have a freedom that's
afforded to you by virtue

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.630
of your birthplace.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.690
And I started to--
really in college,

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:03.770
I think-- recognize when I
was a sophomore or junior,

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.270
I started to get into
music really heavily.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.632
And I decided for
a semester or two

00:02:09.632 --> 00:02:11.840
that I was just not going
to buy any of the textbooks

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.680
that my classes assigned.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.598
And I spent the money instead
on creating my own curriculum.

00:02:18.598 --> 00:02:21.620
And that meant that I bought
all of these biographies

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.377
of the rock-- the Rolling
Stones and Bob Dylan-- some

00:02:26.377 --> 00:02:27.960
of the other musicians
that I was into

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.710
and I decided to read
their life stories

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.960
as well as some of the
really influential books

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.200
that you're almost supposed
to read in your early 20s.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.190
And what I found
was that the artists

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.010
that I really
revered-- when I looked

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.060
at their history of
their music they never

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.570
created great music
or art or literature

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.264
during periods of contentment.

00:02:46.264 --> 00:02:47.930
It was never when
things were going well

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.469
and they were happy and
peaceful that their greatest

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:52.260
songs were written.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.260
It was always during
periods of struggle.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.020
Culture was at odds in
some way, shape or form.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.780
There was societal unrest.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.150
They just had their
heartbroken, maybe.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.330
There was a passing,
some level of adversity.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.100
And that's when these explosive
creative breakthroughs happen.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.004
And so, at that point in time,
I was a sophomore becoming

00:03:13.004 --> 00:03:14.920
a junior and I was playing
basketball at Brown

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.320
and I had a girlfriend and I
was really happy with my life.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.945
And for some reason,
I was like, I just

00:03:18.945 --> 00:03:20.270
need to be uncomfortable.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.650
I have to find a way to
get out of my comfort zone

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.380
and that led me to
go on Semester at Sea

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.070
and on Semester at Sea a series
of things happened that I think

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.210
changed my perspective
pretty drastically on I

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.130
wanted to spend my life.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.650
But it was that
kind of recognition

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.444
of how those that
I had admired most

00:03:38.444 --> 00:03:39.860
have lived their
lives that led me

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.522
to this kind of
exploratory nature.

00:03:41.522 --> 00:03:42.980
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Don't you think you

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.990
could talk about
the Semester at Sea?

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.950
Because that's actually
my next question request

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.160
is-- in the book
and also in speeches

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.765
that Adam has given he
talks about this Semester

00:03:54.765 --> 00:03:56.410
at Sea experience.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.070
And it's not the idyllic
Semester at Sea experience.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.845
And can you just talk
to us a little bit

00:04:02.845 --> 00:04:05.220
and briefly tell everybody
what your experience was like?

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.680
ADAM BRAUN: Yeah.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.800
So for those that aren't
familiar, Semester at Sea

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.633
is a cruise ship that
goes around the world.

00:04:09.633 --> 00:04:13.230
And you most the time stop
in anywhere from EIGHT

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.089
to 13 countries--
every voyage has

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:16.380
a slightly different itinerary.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.130
But my year it was supposed
to be 10-- different countries

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.660
across Asia, Africa
and Latin America.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.810
And I'm part of one of
the three famous voyages.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.343
And you don't get
famous on Semester

00:04:27.343 --> 00:04:29.550
at Sea unless something
goes really wrong.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.740
So my ship left from
Vancouver headed

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.530
toward South Korea,
January, 2005.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.114
And while crossing
the North Pacific--

00:04:37.114 --> 00:04:39.488
it was the very first time
that they had gone that route.

00:04:39.488 --> 00:04:41.170
They always went
the other direction.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.950
But they had a brand
new ship my year

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.710
and they decided that
it was OK to cross

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.870
the North Pacific in winter.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.376
And three major storm
fronts developed.

00:04:49.376 --> 00:04:51.125
We tried to go underneath,
and another one

00:04:51.125 --> 00:04:52.240
developed underneath us.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.530
And we got caught in
essentially a superstorm.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.210
And there's a 30 minute
"Storm Stories" episode

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.600
just on my ship that's on
YouTube that can look up.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.150
But we were struck
by 60 foot rogue wave

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.130
about 800 miles from land.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:07.630
And it went over
the top of our ship

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.630
and it shattered the glass on
the sixth floor bridge, which

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.870
housed all the navigational
equipment and the power

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:13.830
to our engines.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.720
And so we lost all
power to our engines

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.810
while in 45 foot
swells surrounded

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.400
by freezing cold
hypothermic water.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.605
And I had a certain
death experiencing.

00:05:22.605 --> 00:05:25.595
I mean, the announcement
came telling

00:05:25.595 --> 00:05:27.220
us to get to the
fifth floor or higher,

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.970
help the women and
children up the stairs,

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.327
keep on your life jackets,
and to your muster stations.

00:05:31.327 --> 00:05:32.785
And for those that
aren't familiar,

00:05:32.785 --> 00:05:35.120
a muster stations is where
you evacuate a ship from.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.260
So we were basically
told-- without saying it

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.760
explicitly-- the ship's going
down and you have to evacuate.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.410
And I'm looking out at a small
mountain of freezing cold water

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.810
with no ability to
get into lifeboats.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.960
And so I was sure I was
dying in the next hour,

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.210
there was no doubt in my mind.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.840
Went through the emotional
experience of that.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.515
And about 30 or 45 seconds
in-- and I try and detail it

00:05:56.515 --> 00:05:58.530
in the book but it's hard
to articulate it all--

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:59.946
FEMALE SPEAKER:
You do a good job.

00:05:59.946 --> 00:06:01.230
ADAM BRAUN: Thank you.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.870
I just have this total calm,
stillness, settle over me

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.996
and it was recognition--
not like belief or hope--

00:06:07.996 --> 00:06:11.000
but recognition that I
was not going to perish.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.770
I just knew it.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.980
And within that recognition,
there was the knowledge

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.620
that if I'm not meant
to die today, then

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.790
there's something
else that gives me

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.390
that knowledge,
which is purpose.

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.840
That my life is not meant
to be a 21-year-old man who

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.730
perishes at sea-- that I have
some purpose in being here.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.480
And from that point
forward, I just became

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.730
relentlessly committed to the
pursuit of individual purpose,

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.230
and sought to find
what that thing was.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.912
And eventually other
experiences led me to find it

00:06:41.912 --> 00:06:44.161
and then it manifested into
this organization, Pencils

00:06:44.161 --> 00:06:46.330
of Promise.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.810
FEMALE SPEAKER: From that
kind of purpose-- that moment

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.684
I'm here for a reason
I'm here for a purpose.

00:06:51.684 --> 00:06:53.830
ADAM BRAUN: And I believe that
about every single person.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.210
And I think every
single person--

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.080
anyone who is
sitting in this room

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.307
or watching this
online-- I distinctly

00:06:59.307 --> 00:07:01.140
believe that you have
an individual purpose.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.194
Your existence is for a
reason, and ultimately

00:07:04.194 --> 00:07:06.860
the most powerful thing that you
can do is discover what that is

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.763
and live it fully because
then you become unstoppable.

00:07:10.763 --> 00:07:12.210
FEMALE SPEAKER: I like that.

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.360
Very cool.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.080
So the ship almost went down--
it didn't go down, thankfully.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.620
ADAM BRAUN: Spoiler alert.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:20.120
I survived.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.494
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Yes, he survived.

00:07:21.494 --> 00:07:21.996
Thank God.

00:07:21.996 --> 00:07:28.694
And I guess the organization
was started or at least was

00:07:28.694 --> 00:07:30.860
created from this question
that you were asking kids

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.489
of what do you
want most in the--

00:07:32.489 --> 00:07:33.530
ADAM BRAUN: In the world.

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:34.652
FEMALE SPEAKER: If you
could have one thing,

00:07:34.652 --> 00:07:35.810
what would it be?

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.796
How did you-- why did you
start asking that question?

00:07:38.796 --> 00:07:40.162
Do you remember?

00:07:40.162 --> 00:07:40.870
ADAM BRAUN: Yeah.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:43.092
In general I've always
found that it's better

00:07:43.092 --> 00:07:45.202
to come in as a
listener than a speaker.

00:07:45.202 --> 00:07:49.880
And I'm naturally
introverted and I was not

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.280
comfortable going
up to strangers

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.700
and starting up a conversation.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:57.130
But at the time, I think, when
you're college kid you almost

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:00.370
envision your cool idea of
what your room is going to be.

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:02.110
And when you go on
a Semester at Sea

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:04.568
you almost know that everyone
does one thing for a country.

00:08:04.568 --> 00:08:07.510
Like they got a beer cap from
each country, or a t-shirt

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:09.430
or they take a
photo with a Beanie

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:12.300
Baby in front of a tourist spot.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.045
Yeah, you know what
I'm talking about.

00:08:14.045 --> 00:08:14.920
They really did that.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:19.140
And so I decided that rather
than having push pins of where

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:22.700
I went, I'd always
been interested in kids

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:23.650
and worked with kids.

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:26.300
And so I thought, let me ask
one child in each country

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.439
that I go to, what do you
want most in the world?

00:08:28.439 --> 00:08:30.730
And this way I can start up
a conversation with anybody

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:32.320
just by asking a
question, and I'll

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.770
have them write it down
on a piece of paper.

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:34.799
And then when I
get back I'll have

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:36.260
this collage of global interest.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.760
But I assumed they were going
to be the material things that

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:39.260
wanted.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.909
I thought it was like a kid in
China is going to want a house,

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:44.740
and a kid in Brazil is going
to want a professional soccer

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:45.240
team.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.400
It was all these
big material ideas

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.940
that were worth lots of money.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:53.570
And I detail in the book
that the first answer I got

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:54.590
was to dance.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.575
A young girl said no,
you can always enroll,

00:08:56.575 --> 00:08:58.090
but her answer was to dance.

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:01.070
In China it was a book-- girl
hadn't owned a book before.

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:04.640
In Hong Kong it was magic,
which I thought was my favorite.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.455
And then in India where this boy
was begging on the street and I

00:09:07.455 --> 00:09:09.530
though, OK he's going
to be my one kid.

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:10.980
His answer was a pencil.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.770
And it was just such
a disarming answer

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:15.410
and when I gave him my
pencil he was so excited.

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:17.410
And at that point, I
realized for the first time

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:19.800
my life that they were kids
that lived without any access

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.174
to quality education-- which
is the one thing that lifted

00:09:22.174 --> 00:09:24.780
my family out of property--
from Holocaust survivors

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.210
in a rural village on a
countryside to the life

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:30.510
that I was able to
live going to school

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:32.200
and great public
education system.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:32.980
FEMALE SPEAKER: Two generations.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:33.300
ADAM BRAUN: Yeah.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.000
Yeah.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.910
And so I thought maybe
this is my purpose

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.372
is to help create a world
in which every single child

00:09:39.372 --> 00:09:41.705
on Earth-- regardless of where
you were born, regardless

00:09:41.705 --> 00:09:43.940
of your socioeconomic
status-- has

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.660
access to quality education.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.620
FEMALE SPEAKER: So after you
went on this amazing journey

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:53.117
and you went back, you
got a job at Bain, right?

00:09:53.117 --> 00:09:54.450
That was your first of that job.

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:54.940
ADAM BRAUN: Yeah.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.180
FEMALE SPEAKER: And then you
started your organization

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:57.965
during that process.

00:09:57.965 --> 00:09:58.690
ADAM BRAUN: Mm-hmm.

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:00.189
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Looking back, if you

00:10:00.189 --> 00:10:02.540
were to do it a
different way, would you?

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.050
Or would you go back
and do it the same?

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:06.550
ADAM BRAUN: So, I
think, if I wanted

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:11.135
to create a more successful
organization-- larger in scale

00:10:11.135 --> 00:10:14.100
or impacted more lives
than we have thus far.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.055
As a what would be
second-time entrepreneur--

00:10:17.055 --> 00:10:18.430
I've learned a
lot along the way.

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:21.012
And so I realistically would
have taken the advice that I

00:10:21.012 --> 00:10:23.470
got which I speak about in the
book from one of my mentors,

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:27.450
George, who said to me-- this is
a very tough period it was late

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:30.199
2008, a bunch of companies
had just declared bankruptcy,

00:10:30.199 --> 00:10:31.990
everyone was losing
their jobs in New York,

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:34.540
it was not a good time for
philanthropic capital--

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.285
and he said to me, you cannot
build an organization off

00:10:37.285 --> 00:10:40.780
of small donations from young
people especially through this

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:43.990
social media thing you
keep on telling me about.

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:47.160
And so he said, go with
five donors who can give you

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.137
$50,000 each, and you have
$250,000 in startup capital,

00:10:50.137 --> 00:10:52.220
and then you can hire a
team and build from there.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:55.610
And if I was-- knowing
what I know now,

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:57.110
I probably would
go in and say yeah,

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:59.580
I should get a bunch of
high-net worth individuals

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.205
and get a bunch of
capital and then you

00:11:01.205 --> 00:11:03.110
can springboard from
that point forward.

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:06.070
But I was so committed to
proving that any person can

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:08.780
create something of
large scale-- change--

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:11.320
that I was willing to
go into a bank and say

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.150
what does it take to
start a bank account.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:15.910
And they said $25 to open up
something at Bank of America.

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:18.900
And so I put $25 in because one,
I didn't have a lot of money,

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.860
and two, my friends certainly
had no money at the time,

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:24.396
and I wanted to prove
that this could be done.

00:11:24.396 --> 00:11:24.895
And so--

00:11:24.895 --> 00:11:26.562
FEMALE SPEAKER: You
were 24 at the time?

00:11:26.562 --> 00:11:28.270
ADAM BRAUN: Yeah, it
was my 25th birthday

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:29.920
at the launch of
the organization.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.176
And so--

00:11:31.176 --> 00:11:32.150
FEMALE SPEAKER: $25.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.500
ADAM BRAUN: Right.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:32.999
Right.

00:11:32.999 --> 00:11:35.887
And so if I was purely committed
to building the organization

00:11:35.887 --> 00:11:38.220
up, maybe I would have done
it a little bit differently.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.002
But the ambition has
never been to solely

00:11:40.002 --> 00:11:41.460
make Pencils of
Promise successful.

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:45.795
It's to change the thinking that
people have around philanthropy

00:11:45.795 --> 00:11:47.780
and what we call a
nonprofit-- and I

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.400
like to call for-purpose
organizations--

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.540
and hopefully inspire
people and then

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:54.950
provide them with
the tools and ability

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:57.250
to create their own
extraordinary journey that

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:00.160
fulfills their sense of purpose.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:04.850
FEMALE SPEAKER: So with
that $25 that you started,

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:08.800
besides that-- almost
more advice to people that

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.750
are interested in starting
their own side-organization

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:15.880
or organization-- what else are
the bare bones that you think

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.420
that you need to
start an organization?

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:23.730
You could forget the 5
giant $50,000 donation,

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:28.480
but what are the bare bones
that you would advise?

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.114
ADAM BRAUN: So there's
a lot, but if I

00:12:30.114 --> 00:12:34.080
was to distill it into,
let's say, three things.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.030
The first one is you
have to knowledge

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:37.190
that it's going to work.

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:38.763
And I'm not talking
about hope, and I'm not

00:12:38.763 --> 00:12:39.637
talking about belief.

00:12:39.637 --> 00:12:43.250
You have to be completely
delusional about the fact

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:45.180
that your idea is
going to succeed,

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.990
because you're going to
hear no, or that's nice

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:51.340
but I'm not interested,
99.9% of the time.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.389
Even to this day, I
hear 99.9% of the time

00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:55.680
I explain to somebody what
we do and they make a choice

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.380
not to support
Pencils of Promise.

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.074
Just by their own volition, so--

00:12:59.074 --> 00:13:01.490
FEMALE SPEAKER: You'll hear
no way more than you hear yes.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:01.910
ADAM BRAUN: Right.

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:02.410
Right.

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:05.300
And so the first is you
can't think it's a good idea,

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.690
you have to genuinely
believe that no matter what

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:10.650
anybody else says this
thing has to succeed.

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:13.720
And that, again, when it comes
from a place of purpose, which

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:17.440
is beyond passion,
that's step number one.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.786
The second one is--
there's a chapter called

00:13:19.786 --> 00:13:21.160
"Find The Impossible
Ones," which

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.495
is you need to find your tribe.

00:13:23.495 --> 00:13:26.570
And I really advocate for people
almost creating an underdog

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:30.057
sense around your organization
or your company or your idea.

00:13:30.057 --> 00:13:31.640
Because people rally
around underdogs.

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.514
There's a reason that
we watch March Madness.

00:13:33.514 --> 00:13:36.480
It's not in hopes that the
final bracket is 1, 1, 1, 1.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.860
It's that we want to see 8s
play against 15s and 15s win

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:40.710
and somehow make it.

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:42.210
Like that's the
stories that we love

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:43.890
and the stories that we tell.

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:46.537
And so as much as people
tell me this is impossible,

00:13:46.537 --> 00:13:47.786
I thought, well, that's great.

00:13:47.786 --> 00:13:49.260
I'm going to create a tribe.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:53.905
Like our team is going to be
people that embrace that idea.

00:13:53.905 --> 00:13:56.030
And so you have to have
like-minded individuals who

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:57.280
become your early adopters.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.260
Because otherwise you're just
a lunatic preaching something

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.370
that nobody believes in.

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:04.032
And then the third
one is I genuinely

00:14:04.032 --> 00:14:05.740
believe that you have
to combine business

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.510
acumen with the ideals found
your company, whether it's

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:10.880
a nonprofit or for profit.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.730
But I've seen way too
many failed projects,

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:16.900
nonprofit or for
profit, because people

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.780
go into the space
with purely passion

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:20.840
and they're not equipped
with business acumen.

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.589
And I think that more
than anything that's

00:14:22.589 --> 00:14:25.010
what's enabled us to
succeed is the training

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:27.830
that I had working at a hedge
fund when I was 16 or Bain

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:29.480
out of college.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.280
It differentiated
me in the space.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.490
And the reason that we are
successful in our programs

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:36.800
is because the business
acumen drives what we do.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.610
It's not just pretty pictures
and a flashy website.

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:41.520
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:45.710
So in the midst of all
of this growing in your--

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:48.162
it's an amazing organization.

00:14:48.162 --> 00:14:50.350
Why did you decide
to write a book now?

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:51.862
What was the motivation?

00:14:51.862 --> 00:14:53.320
ADAM BRAUN: There
was a few things.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:56.370
The first was that I had a
lot of people coming to me

00:14:56.370 --> 00:15:02.000
and asking the natural question
of saying, I have an idea.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.870
How did you turn $25 into
this big organization?

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:06.720
Can you just sit with
me for 30 minutes?

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.470
And after I did a bunch of
these phone calls and meetings,

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:11.690
I found that I was often
inspired by the feedback

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:12.960
that I was getting from them.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.020
But I didn't have the
time or the ability

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:18.190
to give them all the
advice that I wanted.

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:21.360
So the first thing was
literally to create

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.740
a guidebook for any
other individual

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:25.780
to pursue their thing,
whatever that might be--

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:29.320
side job within a company,
something entrepreneurial.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.880
But I read a lot of
these great books

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.910
and they were purely
inspiring narratives.

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:35.469
And they didn't have
the how-to element.

00:15:35.469 --> 00:15:37.760
So that was the first thing
was I wanted to show people

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.850
how they could go and do it.

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:42.715
And then the second one was
that I wanted the organization

00:15:42.715 --> 00:15:45.130
to continue and
scale its impact.

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:46.510
And either I could
get on a plane

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:48.970
and try and speak on
every stage possible,

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:51.277
or I could write something
that somebody else could

00:15:51.277 --> 00:15:52.860
hand to somebody
else and say, oh, you

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:54.630
want to learn about
this organization?

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:55.380
Read this book.

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:57.740
And as part of that, all
proceeds from the book

00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:59.220
go back to the organization.

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.428
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's great.

00:16:00.428 --> 00:16:03.180
ADAM BRAUN: And so it made it a
very easy decision for somebody

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:04.885
to say to another
individual, hey,

00:16:04.885 --> 00:16:06.260
if you are interested
in learning

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.330
about a great organization,
here's the PoP book.

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:11.821
And this will provide with the
full background and the ability

00:16:11.821 --> 00:16:13.695
to either get involved
with this organization

00:16:13.695 --> 00:16:17.260
or to discover your own
passion and pursue it.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.830
FEMALE SPEAKER: From the
time that this idea came up

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:21.370
to the time was
published, how long

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:23.780
was this process of writing it?

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:28.070
ADAM BRAUN: So one of
my bucket-list items

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:30.090
was to write a book,
just because I think

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:32.820
that it outlives the individual
and it was just a cool idea

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.710
that 100 years from now
there'll be some digital library

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:37.460
that Google has created
and this book will

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:40.640
be in the digital library
that people can go and see

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.960
with their robot eyes.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.710
So the idea has been
there for a long time,

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:50.180
but the actual process
of writing was quick.

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.600
I mapped it out
with my co-writer,

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.580
Carly, over no more than
really three months.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.520
And then I took a
sabbatical last year

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.060
with my fiance and
just a backpack each.

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.200
We did around the world
trip for a little bit more

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.220
than three months.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.849
And I brought a
computer in the backpack

00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:09.805
and so I would write most days
and send my draft back to Carly

00:17:09.805 --> 00:17:11.554
and she would give me
her little revisions

00:17:11.554 --> 00:17:14.260
and be like, pull out this
story, and more description

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.210
here, and really
guide me through it.

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:19.150
And so the entire
manuscript was actually

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:20.700
written in three months,
which is really fast.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.079
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's
incredibly fast.

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:22.787
ADAM BRAUN: Yeah.

00:17:22.787 --> 00:17:24.849
And the original mentions
was 81,000 words,

00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:26.619
and the final book is 66,000.

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:29.390
So a fair amount was
actually cut out,

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:31.610
but that was because I
wanted it to be an easy read.

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:33.950
I wanted it to be something
that you could pick up

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:36.309
in the airport on a
flight cross-country

00:17:36.309 --> 00:17:37.975
and read it by the
time that you landed.

00:17:37.975 --> 00:17:39.870
FEMALE SPEAKER: I think
I read it about two days.

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:40.578
ADAM BRAUN: Yeah.

00:17:40.578 --> 00:17:43.370
I mean, that's been the most
consistent feedback thus far

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:47.760
is I've read your book in no
more than three days for most

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:48.260
people.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.399
It's like a weekend read
or flight read or their

00:17:50.399 --> 00:17:52.940
on the beach for the afternoon
and they just tear through it.

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:55.930
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
it's a great read.

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:57.790
Something that you
talked about earlier

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:00.350
or brought up that I thought
was a really clever in the book

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:02.370
is the way the chapters
are named after mantras.

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:08.260
Why did you decide to
name them after mantras?

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.520
ADAM BRAUN: So somebody
asked me at one point,

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.250
there were 650 or 700 students
that went on your Semester

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:13.965
at Sea voyage.

00:18:13.965 --> 00:18:16.140
What was it that was
different about you

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.050
that you came back with
not only this feeling

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:21.940
but then you converted
intention into action.

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:25.020
And the truth is, if I
think about what led to it,

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:28.390
I think it was the fact
that I just adopted mantras.

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:31.290
And so I've always had
one powerful phrase

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:32.590
that guides my decision-making.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:35.110
And it's tough to
have a set of values

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:36.860
that you live by if
there's eight of them.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:41.010
But I think it's really simple
if you find one essential truth

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:44.495
that you almost treat
as the guiding principle

00:18:44.495 --> 00:18:46.570
that you make all
your decisions around.

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:50.390
And I find that oftentimes
I discover one phrase

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:52.140
or I come up with
one phrase and that

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:55.170
feels right for that
period of my life.

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:58.230
And so given that I
found these phrases so

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:00.950
helpful in my
decision-making process,

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:03.260
I thought, the way we
consume media nowadays

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:04.510
is really different.

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:08.510
So we want 140 characters
that describe something,

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:11.070
and then we want the ability
to click in an expand.

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:13.790
And so when I read, most of
the time it's tough for me

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:15.180
to read a whole book.

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:18.137
I don't about you guys, but I'm
like eight-- there's probably

00:19:18.137 --> 00:19:20.010
eight books right now
that I'm between 50

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:22.010
and 100 pages through.

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:24.020
And I just kind of get
bored and I put it down.

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:26.190
I'm like, all right, I
get the general principle.

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:28.870
And so the one thing that I do
stick with is short stories.

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:30.570
So I listen to Moth Podcasts.

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:32.130
And I watch TED
Talks, and I like

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:34.400
episodes of "House of Cards"
and "Game of Thrones,"

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.434
and I like to watch
three if I want, or one.

00:19:36.434 --> 00:19:38.100
So I thought, why
can't you write a book

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:41.070
with that same ideology,
the same kind of framework.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:45.460
So the mantras could be the
quick way to access something.

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:46.880
And I'm sure you would agree.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.400
Someone could pick up this
book and read Mantra 13 alone,

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.690
separate from the rest, and
feel like they gain value.

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:54.070
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
that's very true.

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:55.570
ADAM BRAUN: And so
I wanted to write

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:58.485
in the way we consume
media nowadays as well,

00:19:58.485 --> 00:20:03.290
like episodic versions,
and ultimately the Mantras

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:06.310
seemed like the best
way to frame it.

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:08.540
FEMALE SPEAKER: It does
feel like episodes.

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:11.229
Like each chapter does
really feel like an episode.

00:20:11.229 --> 00:20:13.520
ADAM BRAUN: Yeah, and I was
talking to a friend of mine

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.260
yesterday who's written
a really fantastic book.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:19.280
And one of the things that
I was sharing with him

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:23.770
is that when I wrote the book I
was traveling for three months.

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:27.599
And I wanted to read great
books while I was traveling.

00:20:27.599 --> 00:20:29.890
And what I found is that
there is, and I won't name it,

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:31.395
there's one book that was
an international bestseller

00:20:31.395 --> 00:20:33.470
on a topic that I'm
so interested in,

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:35.680
but as I read it
was really dense.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.290
It was like a textbook.

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:40.030
And it wasn't enjoyable
for me to read.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:41.990
But when I thought about
the books that I did

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:44.240
enjoy they were kind
of these page turners

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:47.340
that left little hooks
at the end of a chapter

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:50.409
when I'd want to kind of put
it down and go get lunch.

00:20:50.409 --> 00:20:51.950
I'd almost be like,
but, wait, I need

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:54.580
to know what happens next,
because he or she previewed

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.170
what's about to happen.

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:57.930
And so selectively--
it probably happens

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:00.100
six or seven times
throughout the book--

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.740
but at the end of a chapter
I would just kind of

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:05.160
plug in what's
coming next, and then

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.940
paint that scene in the next
paragraph on the side page.

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:11.310
And I found that it's
really enabled people

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:13.990
to kind of like watch the next
episode, if that makes sense.

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:15.175
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:21:15.175 --> 00:21:20.792
What was your biggest
discovery writing this book?

00:21:20.792 --> 00:21:22.500
ADAM BRAUN: I think
the biggest discovery

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:25.180
was how valuable failures are.

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:32.500
You know, I got to a
point about, maybe,

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.140
six weeks before the book
went to physical print

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:38.572
where I had one final
ability to edit the material.

00:21:38.572 --> 00:21:40.780
And at that point in time
you're really only supposed

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.700
to be editing a few words,
maybe a sentence here and there.

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:47.090
And there's a chapter called
"Fess Up To Your Failures,"

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:49.800
which is about a point
in time where I really

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.290
acted like a jerk to our staff.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:53.800
Basically two of
our staff members

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:57.290
were held up at knife point and
robbed, and kind of roughed up,

00:21:57.290 --> 00:21:59.296
a man and a woman in Guatemala.

00:21:59.296 --> 00:22:01.170
And they were in a
community that they really

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:02.562
weren't supposed
to be in, and it

00:22:02.562 --> 00:22:04.130
was after like a
Super Bowl party.

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:06.609
And so they emailed me
saying, we were roughed up,

00:22:06.609 --> 00:22:08.650
and our passport and our
wallets, and our mobiles

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:09.365
were stolen.

00:22:09.365 --> 00:22:11.240
And I thought that they
wanted reimbursement.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.090
And I pretty much emailed
them back and said,

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:14.580
I'm so sorry that this
happened, but we're not

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:16.930
going to reimburse you,
because we value every dollar,

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:19.055
and you made the decision
to go on into this place.

00:22:19.055 --> 00:22:22.180
And I really felt like I was
protecting Pencils of Promise,

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:27.390
when in fact I was actually
damaging the individuals which

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:28.450
make up the organization.

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:30.650
The organization is nothing more
than a collection of people.

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:31.880
And they were really
offended by it,

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.675
and they were like, we weren't
even asking for reimbursement.

00:22:33.675 --> 00:22:35.820
We just wanted to notify
you that this happened.

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:38.580
And I really had to take a
kind of rough internal look,

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:40.305
and say, all right, what type
of leader do I want to be,

00:22:40.305 --> 00:22:41.721
and was really
apologetic to them.

00:22:41.721 --> 00:22:44.680
And the whole chapter
is about exclusively

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.600
failure on a personal level.

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.695
And six weeks before
the book came out

00:22:48.695 --> 00:22:51.530
I just decided to take out the
chapter, because I was like,

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:55.585
I don't want to look like a jerk
to the thousands of people that

00:22:55.585 --> 00:22:58.200
are hopefully going
to read this book.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.320
And you're kind of
worried about criticism.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.430
And, you know, there's
other chapters.

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:05.240
"Practice Humility
Over Hubris" is also

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.990
about where I made a
mistake, but this one

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:10.430
was like really being a jerk.

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:13.265
And so I told a few
people that had read it,

00:23:13.265 --> 00:23:15.640
including my publisher, that
I'm taking out that chapter,

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:17.370
and I told a few of
our staff members.

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:19.760
And there was an
overwhelming response.

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.779
At least 90% of the people
that had read the book that I

00:23:22.779 --> 00:23:24.570
informed that I was
taking out that chapter

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:28.340
came back and said, that was my
favorite chapter in the book,

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.240
because it showed
that you are human,

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.206
and it showed that you
make serious mistakes.

00:23:32.206 --> 00:23:34.330
And there was a line at
the end of the chapter that

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:38.310
said, we learn far more from
the methods in which we address

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:41.970
failure than the moments
in the midst of success.

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:44.360
And that line really
resonated with people.

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:47.990
And so I decided to put
the chapter back in because

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:49.990
of their feedback, and
it's been one of the ones

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:51.073
that people point to most.

00:23:51.073 --> 00:23:53.470
When I ask, what do you
remember, they're like the fact

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:56.500
that you were so honest
about your mistakes.

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:59.390
And when I look at the Amazon
reviews or any other review,

00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:01.230
that's consistent
feedback is the book

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:03.189
is written with an honesty
and a vulnerability.

00:24:03.189 --> 00:24:05.521
And that's something that I
didn't expect going into it,

00:24:05.521 --> 00:24:07.480
that the failures
would resonate so much

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:10.224
with people rather
than the successes.

00:24:10.224 --> 00:24:11.890
FEMALE SPEAKER: I
like that chapter too.

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:12.890
I'm glad you kept it in.

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:15.065
ADAM BRAUN: I'm glad everyone
loves my [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:15.065 --> 00:24:16.565
FEMALE SPEAKER:
It's good, because I

00:24:16.565 --> 00:24:19.307
feel like it's towards the
end of the book too, right?

00:24:19.307 --> 00:24:21.640
ADAM BRAUN: Yeah, I think
it's the 23rd or 24th chapter.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.460
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's very cool.

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:26.800
I mean, you're watching this
rise of your organization's

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:30.797
success, and you do have
this moment of humility.

00:24:30.797 --> 00:24:32.630
ADAM BRAUN: I mean,
there's another chapter,

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:34.500
"Vulnerability is
Vital," which is

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.439
all about my fear of
asking people for money.

00:24:36.439 --> 00:24:37.980
At three and a half
years in I hadn't

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.010
sat in front of one
person and said,

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:41.880
can you give $5,000
to the organization?

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.030
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Which is amazing.

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:43.780
ADAM BRAUN: Right.

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:46.820
I mean, I articulated a vision
that I was delusional about,

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:47.660
and still am.

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:49.369
And people either
chose to donate or not,

00:24:49.369 --> 00:24:50.743
and that was it,
because I didn't

00:24:50.743 --> 00:24:52.060
want to ask anyone for money.

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:54.590
And then I recognized it
was such as big weakness

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:56.280
that it was holding
back our growth,

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.680
and that I need to admit to
my board of directors, which

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.480
are these huge business
leaders, that I was actually

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.635
bad at something,
not that I was great.

00:25:03.635 --> 00:25:05.010
And it was in the
acknowledgement

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:07.009
of that vulnerability
that they said, OK, we

00:25:07.009 --> 00:25:08.550
want to invest in
you getting better.

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:10.635
And I went through
the top course

00:25:10.635 --> 00:25:13.799
at Harvard run by two
global experts on the space.

00:25:13.799 --> 00:25:15.340
And the biggest
thing that I realized

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:18.690
is it was my sense of ego,
that I was putting myself

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:21.730
in the middle of the equation,
that if I asked you for money,

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:23.780
I felt like you were
giving money to me.

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:26.000
When in fact you're
actually supporting

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.379
Mit, and Noot, and Timone,
and some of our students

00:25:28.379 --> 00:25:30.670
in the field, and you're not
giving money to me at all.

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:33.210
You're facilitating their
educational attainment.

00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:36.480
And once I learned to remove
myself from the equation,

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.870
it changed from an
obligation or a fear

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:41.200
to actually something
that I felt honored to do,

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.225
that I could be the steward for
their educational attainment.

00:25:43.225 --> 00:25:45.170
And if you say no,
you're not rejecting me.

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:48.060
You're just not choosing
to support them.

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:51.290
And so it drastically changed
my perception and approach

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:52.219
to fundraising.

00:25:52.219 --> 00:25:54.260
But that only happened
because I said, look guys,

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:56.090
I'm bad at this, and
I need your help.

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:57.640
And so that was another chapter.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.140
You know, it's later
on in the book.

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.490
Like, we're really
successful up to that point,

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:03.640
and it was important for
me to write, I admit.

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.316
Like even when people on the
outside think it's going well,

00:26:06.316 --> 00:26:08.440
there's still major areas
of growth and improvement

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.780
that are needed.

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:14.360
FEMALE SPEAKER: On that same
kind of idea of fundraising,

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.360
social media has a huge--

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:17.120
ADAM BRAUN: Huge.

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.020
FEMALE SPEAKER:
--huge part of how

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:21.890
you developed your organization.

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:26.100
And up to a point you never
asked directly for money.

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:28.677
It was mainly through
social media tools.

00:26:28.677 --> 00:26:30.760
ADAM BRAUN: Yeah, peer-to-peer
fundraising events,

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:30.980
stuff like that.

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:32.396
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Can you talk a bit

00:26:32.396 --> 00:26:34.770
about that, social
media, how you've

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:37.052
used it to grow
your organization?

00:26:37.052 --> 00:26:38.010
ADAM BRAUN: Yeah, sure.

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:41.550
So we were one of the
first organizations

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:43.600
to really app
social and digital,

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.340
especially at a time when
it wasn't being done.

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:49.608
And so late '08 was, again,
a tough economic period,

00:26:49.608 --> 00:26:50.608
especially in this city.

00:26:50.608 --> 00:26:53.024
So the perception was you can't
waste your energy and time

00:26:53.024 --> 00:26:55.545
on this crowd sourcing, small
donation, and like status

00:26:55.545 --> 00:26:56.284
stuff.

00:26:56.284 --> 00:26:58.660
You need to be kind of
hunkering down, and getting off

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:00.640
line checks from major donors.

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:04.209
And cause I was Zuckerberg's
year in college,

00:27:04.209 --> 00:27:06.750
he was a sophomore at Harvard,
and I was a sophomore at Brown

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:10.360
when it launched, my friends
were all on Facebook,

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:11.810
and then early
adopters on pretty

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:14.890
much every other
platform, and so

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:16.480
I had to make two early bets.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.990
And I think with any company, to
the point of the Wayne Gretzky

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:23.220
quote, you skate to where the
puck is going, not where it is.

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:28.640
And so my two early bets were,
one, that social media would

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:32.030
become integral to the fabric
of, not just our daily lives,

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:33.120
but business.

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:37.460
And so if I could build one of
the most engaged and largest

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:39.750
social media followings
around the organization,

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:41.647
that would be a
really valuable asset.

00:27:41.647 --> 00:27:43.730
And then the second was
that cause marketing would

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:46.710
become really important for
large brands and start ups,

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:49.460
and that companies would
recognize that consumers will

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:51.917
change brands, if all
things are equal, if one has

00:27:51.917 --> 00:27:53.500
a positive social
impact, and the best

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:55.840
way to do that is to partner
with a beautiful, well

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.660
branded organization.

00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:01.320
And so with those two
kind of ideas in mind

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:03.690
I focused for the
first three years

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:07.090
not on high level fundraising,
but on building a community.

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:13.720
And now I was on
call with like think

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:16.000
of the most powerful
and maybe well-known

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.890
woman in the country,
her office, yesterday,

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:21.360
and the question that
they asked is, how are you

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.640
doing such an effective job
of engaging young people

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.420
and their families,
in particular?

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:27.927
And I had a call also
yesterday with a woman who

00:28:27.927 --> 00:28:30.260
runs a really large business,
came to one of our events,

00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:32.291
and said to me on the
phone, you know something,

00:28:32.291 --> 00:28:34.540
I came to the event expecting
to learn about you guys.

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:36.270
I told my daughter I was
going, and she was like, yeah,

00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:38.060
of course, how do you not
know about Pencils of Promise?

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:39.726
That's the first time
my daughter's ever

00:28:39.726 --> 00:28:41.530
informed me about
an organization.

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:46.570
And so I focused on
creating an opportunity

00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:49.480
for other individuals
to become heroes.

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:52.872
Any kind of dissection
of a great speech,

00:28:52.872 --> 00:28:54.580
if you really break
it down, they usually

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:55.680
share this hero's journey.

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:58.430
This person comes up against
an obstacle, they fall back,

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:00.070
and then they overcome.

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:02.430
Great speeches actually
have the hero's journey

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:03.800
as the core element.

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.210
But it's not the speaker
on stage who's the hero,

00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:07.330
it's the audience.

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:08.850
And that's what
eventually converts

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:12.120
the audience into action is the
opportunity for them to fulfill

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.750
this destined promise.

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:15.500
And so when I look
at social media,

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.389
the job is not to
highlight my story,

00:29:17.389 --> 00:29:18.930
but it's actually
to get other people

00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:21.790
to feel like their
story can succeed

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:23.170
through Pencils of Promise.

00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:25.864
And digital and social is the
best way for us to enable it.

00:29:25.864 --> 00:29:27.280
So that's always
been our approach

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:30.017
is to make other people heroes.

00:29:30.017 --> 00:29:31.975
FEMALE SPEAKER: You
touched on cause marketing.

00:29:31.975 --> 00:29:34.779
And it's something that
I'm really fascinated in.

00:29:34.779 --> 00:29:36.570
And I love that it's
included in this book.

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:42.580
People that are in
for profit businesses,

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:47.842
how do you think that
they can-- what advice

00:29:47.842 --> 00:29:50.300
do you have for people that
would want to incorporate cause

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:53.269
marketing into their
for-profit strategies?

00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:54.810
ADAM BRAUN: I mean,
it's very simple.

00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:57.499
You will make more money by
having positive social impact.

00:29:57.499 --> 00:29:58.790
There's just no doubt about it.

00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:00.510
I mean, all the
data is behind it.

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:03.000
If you look at the generational
wealth transfer that's

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.950
going to happen in the coming
years, trillions of dollars

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:08.910
are being transferred from
basically baby boomers

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:11.460
over to millennials,
and millennials just

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:14.260
have a clear preference to
support products, and goods,

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:17.170
and services that create
a positive social impact.

00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:19.800
And so I advise
companies to focus

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:22.270
on what you do best, which
is probably sell your product

00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:25.929
or service, but to partner
with great organizations

00:30:25.929 --> 00:30:27.970
that do what they do best,
which is, in our case,

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:29.110
educating children.

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:31.730
And so if that resonates
with both your consumers

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:34.810
and your employees, then
find an organization that

00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:37.820
fits your mission
or ethos and enable

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:40.460
them to do more great
work, and they in turn

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:42.940
can help you become
more profitable.

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:45.410
But part of the reason I
don't like the term nonprofit

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:47.950
is because we don't
exist to not profit.

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:50.150
We exist to create
positive social impact.

00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:52.360
And there's this kind
of traditional approach

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:56.200
in the space that it's a one
way street, that because we

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.665
work with people in
poverty, like pity us.

00:30:58.665 --> 00:31:00.890
Pity us as an organization
and the people we serve.

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:03.800
So you're kind of
obliged to help us maybe.

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.000
But I look at it as an
equal value exchange.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.970
So Pencils of Promise can help
people make a lot more money.

00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:11.860
And in doing so we
accomplish our mission,

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:14.080
which is educate more children.

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.054
And it should be
perceived that way.

00:31:16.054 --> 00:31:17.470
I mean, our social
media following

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:19.980
is a valuable
marketing asset that we

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:22.720
can be help both us
and another company

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.020
achieve mutual objectives.

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:26.880
But it's really important
to align up front, and just

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.710
be really clear, and
say, look, you're

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:31.780
in this for x, we're in this
for y, and if both happen,

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:33.840
both of us end up
very happy, as well as

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.937
your employees and
your consumers.

00:31:35.937 --> 00:31:37.395
FEMALE SPEAKER: I
could talk to you

00:31:37.395 --> 00:31:39.960
for like another
hour and half, but I

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:42.630
want to make sure we
have some time for Q&amp;A.

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:44.930
So I'm going to just ask
a couple more questions,

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:46.810
and then I'll turn it over.

00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:48.804
What's next for you?

00:31:48.804 --> 00:31:50.220
ADAM BRAUN: The
next thing is what

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:51.720
we're calling our
innovation pilots.

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.879
So when we look at
the organization,

00:31:53.879 --> 00:31:55.420
the mission was not
to build schools.

00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:57.419
The mission was to help
in which every child has

00:31:57.419 --> 00:31:58.647
access to quality education.

00:31:58.647 --> 00:32:00.480
The good thing is we
now have a distribution

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.417
system of more than 200 schools.

00:32:02.417 --> 00:32:04.000
And when I think
about all the changes

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.690
that have happened in
education since I started,

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:08.690
there's some really
fascinating stuff happening.

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:11.850
But it's almost impossible
to test it out domestically,

00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:13.510
because it's either
too expensive,

00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:14.960
or you have
entrenched interests,

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:18.110
like teachers' unions, and labor
unions, and parental groups,

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:19.890
and government
funded programs that

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:21.940
can't push the
bounds of innovation

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:25.110
rapidly and at low
cost, whereas we can.

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:28.500
And so what we're
doing is testing out

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:31.550
innovations in education within
three to five of our schools,

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:33.830
globally, across the
course of the next year.

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:37.127
So next month e-readers go
into classrooms in Ghana.

00:32:37.127 --> 00:32:39.210
And we'll see what happens
when you have e-readers

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:40.844
for every single
student in one school,

00:32:40.844 --> 00:32:43.010
and then a peer community
doesn't have access to it,

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:44.676
and what's the
educational outcomes that

00:32:44.676 --> 00:32:46.100
are different because of it.

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:49.220
Long distance radio programming
into rural Guatemala.

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:51.770
We have 3D printers in Laos
that are producing literacy tool

00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:53.920
kits, and then we're
using sign language

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:57.720
to teach early stage phonetics,
which is, in my mind,

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.630
one of the most
fascinating things that

00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:01.080
is going to happen in ed period.

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:02.760
And we're pushing it forward.

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:05.282
And then there's a couple
others that were driving.

00:33:05.282 --> 00:33:06.907
And that's what I'm
most excited about.

00:33:06.907 --> 00:33:08.310
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's sweet.

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:11.575
So on that, I'm going to ask
a couple questions of just

00:33:11.575 --> 00:33:13.005
like finish this sentence style.

00:33:13.005 --> 00:33:13.630
Keep it Googly.

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:15.226
Keep it light.

00:33:15.226 --> 00:33:17.100
And then we'll open it
up for some questions.

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:23.970
I'm going to say, in your
tense, but you finish,

00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:25.525
what inspires me the most is--

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:32.300
ADAM BRAUN: Listening
to people's stories

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:34.060
of fulfillment of purpose.

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:35.560
FEMALE SPEAKER: I
am challenged by--

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:43.661
ADAM BRAUN: The people
I surround myself with.

00:33:43.661 --> 00:33:46.160
FEMALE SPEAKER: The food I miss
most when I'm traveling is--

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:49.420
ADAM BRAUN: Chicken Parmesan.

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:50.300
No doubt.

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:50.840
AUDIENCE: You didn't
hesitate at all.

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:51.740
ADAM BRAUN: Nah.

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.810
My favorite food by far.

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:55.660
FEMALE SPEAKER: If I
weren't running an NGO,

00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:59.230
or a for-purpose
organization, I would be--

00:34:03.022 --> 00:34:04.730
ADAM BRAUN: Launching
a different company

00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:07.280
that created the largest
positive social impact

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:08.739
possible.

00:34:08.739 --> 00:34:10.114
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Here at Google we

00:34:10.114 --> 00:34:12.400
have something called Moonshots.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:16.495
So my Moonshot is--
the biggest idea

00:34:16.495 --> 00:34:19.031
you can possibly think
of to make happen.

00:34:19.031 --> 00:34:21.364
ADAM BRAUN: I mean, I don't
even think this will happen.

00:34:21.364 --> 00:34:22.905
I know it will happen
in my lifetime.

00:34:22.905 --> 00:34:25.656
Quality education for
every child on Earth.

00:34:25.656 --> 00:34:27.489
FEMALE SPEAKER: When
The Promise of a Pencil

00:34:27.489 --> 00:34:31.150
is made into a movie, the
actor that will play me is--

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:32.956
ADAM BRAUN: Denzel Washington.

00:34:32.956 --> 00:34:34.342
FEMALE SPEAKER: Amazing.

00:34:34.342 --> 00:34:36.270
Oh, that's fantastic.

00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:38.449
OK, I want to open up
to Q&amp;A. There's a mic.

00:34:43.524 --> 00:34:44.149
ADAM BRAUN: Hi.

00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:45.574
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.

00:34:45.574 --> 00:34:48.123
First and foremost, I really
liked that you called attention

00:34:48.123 --> 00:34:49.898
to something
[INAUDIBLE], which is

00:34:49.898 --> 00:34:52.686
the false dichotomy of
doing well and doing good.

00:34:52.686 --> 00:34:54.642
And so that's fantastic.

00:34:54.642 --> 00:34:56.598
Having done some
international travel

00:34:56.598 --> 00:34:58.391
and [INAUDIBLE]
work myself, I feel

00:34:58.391 --> 00:35:02.710
like when you go there to
different countries, East

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:05.304
Africa, or wherever
you are, you are just

00:35:05.304 --> 00:35:07.845
taking the sense of privilege,
whether the American privilege

00:35:07.845 --> 00:35:09.801
or white male privilege.

00:35:09.801 --> 00:35:12.610
What have you done
with Pencils of Promise

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:15.110
when it comes to creating
meaningful community

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:18.110
partnerships to empower
community members

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:21.610
to be engaged in what you're
doing versus what I think

00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:24.735
a lot of companies fall into
to being like a White Savior

00:35:24.735 --> 00:35:26.610
complex and helping and
making those changes.

00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:27.610
ADAM BRAUN: Yeah.

00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:29.380
So there's a really
powerful story

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:32.066
in the book, which is
about when I was 23,

00:35:32.066 --> 00:35:33.860
I was in rural Guatemala.

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:36.200
And a man approached me
kind of by this lakeside,

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:37.760
and asked me to go live
with him for a while.

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.759
And I was like what is
this guy asking me to do?

00:35:39.759 --> 00:35:42.600
But I took him up on the offer
cause the mantra at the time

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.550
was tourists see,
travelers seek.

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:46.830
And I went, and I live
with him for three days.

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:51.070
And he asked me to stay with
him because he had a large tape

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:53.454
cassette recorder, and a Bible.

00:35:53.454 --> 00:35:55.870
And he wanted me to read his
Bible into this tape cassette

00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:56.370
recorder.

00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:58.140
And I couldn't really
understand why.

00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:00.700
And then I came to realize he
had a big set of headphones,

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:02.260
and he was teaching
himself English.

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:03.757
And he was teacher.

00:36:03.757 --> 00:36:05.590
And he couldn't pronounce
English very well.

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:09.550
So the goal was for him
to listen to my voice

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:11.590
pronouncing the words
properly so he could teach

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:13.160
himself to then teach his kids.

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:15.526
Completely changed my philosophy
on global development,

00:36:15.526 --> 00:36:17.150
because he wasn't
asking for a handout.

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:19.250
He wanted the tools
to self-educate,

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:21.590
and then pass it down
to future generations.

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:24.680
And so that's informed every
one of the philosophies that's

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:25.940
launched the organization.

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:30.890
So, for example, we don't build
schools on behalf of villages.

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:32.810
Villages have to
commit to 10 to 20,

00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:34.740
and now it's almost
always 20%, or more

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:37.290
of the funding for every
project that we undertake.

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:39.660
They have no spare cash,
because it's $300 to $500

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:42.810
in annual income for the
family in most communities

00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:43.620
where we work.

00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:45.370
So they make it up in
materials and labor.

00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:47.619
So they collect the scrapwood,
the gravel, the cement.

00:36:47.619 --> 00:36:49.637
And then more importantly
mothers and fathers

00:36:49.637 --> 00:36:51.220
and elders and
siblings are physically

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:52.404
building the schools.

00:36:52.404 --> 00:36:53.820
They provide almost
all the labor.

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:57.140
In Ghana it's 100% of labor
is provided by the community.

00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:00.120
And that creates a sense of
real ownership and investment,

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:02.264
because we don't do
build trips, for example.

00:37:02.264 --> 00:37:04.680
Like if somebody asks me, can
I go out and build a school,

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:05.580
and live in a village
for three weeks,

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:08.152
my answer is no, because I
want these communities to build

00:37:08.152 --> 00:37:10.360
their own school so that
when it starts to break down

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:13.303
they don't say, hey, where was
that college kid from Wisconsin

00:37:13.303 --> 00:37:15.386
that built my school,
because the piping's broken.

00:37:15.386 --> 00:37:15.940
It's no, no.

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:17.524
I built my son's school.

00:37:17.524 --> 00:37:18.690
It's starting to break down.

00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:19.405
I need to fix it.

00:37:19.405 --> 00:37:20.780
And he needs to
make sure he gets

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:22.460
his butt in the
classroom every day.

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:25.440
And so there's a
whole set of practices

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:28.310
in place across the organization
that insure local ownership

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:29.101
and sustainability.

00:37:35.521 --> 00:37:39.000
AUDIENCE: So it's sometimes
difficult for somebody

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.479
like me to get a vision of
what these schools look like,

00:37:42.479 --> 00:37:46.455
living in America [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:46.455 --> 00:37:49.437
Can you tell us a story of
maybe one of the schools,

00:37:49.437 --> 00:37:51.300
kind of paint a
picture of what it's

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:54.407
like for the kids,
who's teaching the kids,

00:37:54.407 --> 00:37:59.874
and sort of how you, or your
work with your organization,

00:37:59.874 --> 00:38:02.500
interact while they're there?

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:03.210
ADAM BRAUN: Sure.

00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:07.339
So we build between one
and six classroom schools.

00:38:07.339 --> 00:38:09.380
The first one was like a
one classroom preschool.

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:10.254
Just getting started.

00:38:10.254 --> 00:38:11.930
Now most of the prop
schools I would say

00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:13.220
are four to six classrooms.

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:16.200
They serve anywhere
between 100 and 200 kids.

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:19.640
Once they're opened, most
likely 1,500 to 2,500 kids

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:21.510
over the life of that school.

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:24.240
And they're quality in material.

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.820
So it's rebar and cement.

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:29.010
It would look like, if you've
been to any kind of developing

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:31.650
world country, and there's
a quality structure there,

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:32.880
they're usually one floor.

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:35.180
In Guatemala we'll
build earthquake proof

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:37.060
two floors at times.

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:40.190
But they're the
nicest buildings,

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:43.870
I would say, in the
community, usually by far.

00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:45.620
But they're built
completely for function.

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:47.120
So I've seen other
NGOs that spend

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:48.900
a ton of money on
huge bathrooms.

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:50.610
It's more important
for us to have

00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:52.610
latrine for a boy and
a girl separately.

00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:55.915
Because oftentimes when girls
start to go through they're

00:38:55.915 --> 00:38:58.440
period they drop out
of school for those

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:00.830
four days out of the month,
and then they fall behind.

00:39:00.830 --> 00:39:03.040
So we build separate bathrooms.

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.790
But the schools, let's see.

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:07.590
They're all public schools.

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:10.370
So they're under the education
ministry's jurisdiction.

00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:12.900
The teachers are trained
by the education ministry

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:14.639
and then sent to
the schools, but we

00:39:14.639 --> 00:39:16.180
realized that the
quality of teaching

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:17.460
wasn't as high as
we wanted it to be.

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:19.210
So we launched a teacher
training program.

00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:20.570
That was our second program.

00:39:20.570 --> 00:39:22.486
And then we saw that
when kids were completing

00:39:22.486 --> 00:39:25.500
our primary schools, most of
the time, girls in particular,

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:27.460
were not continuing
with secondary school.

00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:31.109
It was a small prohibitive
cost, like $250 in total.

00:39:31.109 --> 00:39:32.650
So we launched a
scholarship program.

00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:34.590
So that's our third program.

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:37.120
And then most of our
staff is international.

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.740
So there's about 15
here in New York.

00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:41.901
There's almost 75 international,
and more than 90% of them

00:39:41.901 --> 00:39:43.650
are from the countries
in which they work.

00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:46.150
So it's Ghanaians
leading Ghanaian staff,

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:47.740
working with Ghanaian children.

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:51.320
It's not westerners showing
off and like passing out gifts.

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:53.060
And oftentimes our
staff actually comes

00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:55.380
from the rural countryside,
you know, and grew up

00:39:55.380 --> 00:40:00.330
in a bamboo hut, or a mud hut,
or a corrugated tin shack.

00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:02.640
And so there are
about as familiar

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:05.730
as it gets with both the
needs and the preferences,

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:07.420
and the ideals, of
the communities.

00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:23.012
AUDIENCE: So you just mentioned
sort of some of the impressions

00:40:23.012 --> 00:40:26.725
that you had opening
schools, training teachers,

00:40:26.725 --> 00:40:29.200
and you've also
talked about the angle

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:31.675
being quality education for all.

00:40:31.675 --> 00:40:33.160
What's in five years?

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:36.199
What's in 10 years for you?

00:40:36.199 --> 00:40:37.990
ADAM BRAUN: Well, I
bet some of the answers

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:39.710
are housed here at Google.

00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:46.390
So one of my mentors
is a guy, Ray Chambers,

00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:48.826
who's probably most
responsible at the end

00:40:48.826 --> 00:40:50.500
of the day for
eradication of Malaria.

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:53.802
When there's gets to zero, Ray's
done it more than anybody else.

00:40:53.802 --> 00:40:56.260
Co-founder of Malaria No More,
just this incredible history

00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:56.892
of philanthropy.

00:40:56.892 --> 00:40:58.933
It's like Buffet, and
Gates, and Ray is up there.

00:40:58.933 --> 00:41:00.680
He's now the United
Nations Special

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:02.242
Envoy for Global Health.

00:41:02.242 --> 00:41:03.700
So he's responsible
for achievement

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:05.460
of the four Millennium
Development Goals.

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:06.460
And he joined our board.

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:08.570
He's in the book as well.

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:10.330
So the thing that I
learned most from Ray

00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:12.610
was to ask yourself
this question, which

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:15.320
is to think about where the
world is going in the next 10

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:18.560
years, what your goal
will evolve into,

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:21.040
as well as your resources and
your networks over those 10

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:24.910
years, and play the most
meaningful part in the world

00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:26.870
that you're trying to
create over that period.

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:29.370
And what I've seen
him do so effectively

00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:32.320
is create a convenient space
for ideas and individuals.

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:36.000
So they raised $6 billion
for eradication of Malaria,

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.180
which Ray has
charged forward on.

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:40.910
Malaria No More raises like
$10 or $15 million a year,

00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:44.165
but they've been kind
of this focal point that

00:41:44.165 --> 00:41:46.940
has rallied a community
around collective ideas.

00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:49.230
And so when I think about
the next five or 10 years,

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:51.550
I know Pencils of Promise
will not build enough schools

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:52.970
to educate every child on Earth.

00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:55.470
Even if we launch one of these
innovation pilots that works,

00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:57.610
we're not the ones that're
going to scale it out

00:41:57.610 --> 00:41:59.540
to reach every single child.

00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:02.420
But the ambition is to
constantly push the space

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:05.110
forward and play the most
meaningful role possible

00:42:05.110 --> 00:42:08.580
in the end goal, which is
quality education for all.

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:11.110
And so I don't think we'll
go into the advocacy space,

00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:15.790
but I can see some of our ideas
being adopted through advocacy.

00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:20.660
And the biggest thing that
we're going to provide value on

00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:24.360
is changing people's thinking
around, one, the nonprofits,

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:27.180
and hopefully shift it towards
more of a for-puporse approach.

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:30.760
And then secondly, the idea
that like most nonprofits,

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:32.990
or for-purpose
organization, in our space

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:36.710
would commit to building
1,000 schools by 2017.

00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:37.660
Like that would be it.

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:39.535
You know, we would be
building 1,000 schools,

00:42:39.535 --> 00:42:43.570
but if that doesn't lead to
the mission being solved,

00:42:43.570 --> 00:42:45.190
then we're not doing
the right thing.

00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:48.270
And so my hope is that
five years from now

00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:51.395
we're doing something that
I don't even know about.

00:42:51.395 --> 00:42:53.018
Five years ago,
there's no chance

00:42:53.018 --> 00:42:55.184
I would have told you about
e-readers in classrooms,

00:42:55.184 --> 00:42:57.390
because it just
wasn't even an idea.

00:42:57.390 --> 00:43:01.170
And so my hope is we're almost
like, if you watch a baby

00:43:01.170 --> 00:43:03.660
walking, you know, like
they're almost falling forward,

00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:05.950
but they always somehow
catch themselves.

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:08.170
And the idea is to
move the organization

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:09.992
with that type of momentum.

00:43:14.176 --> 00:43:15.426
FEMALE SPEAKER: Any questions?

00:43:20.235 --> 00:43:20.860
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:22.943
I was wondering if you
could say a little bit more

00:43:22.943 --> 00:43:25.306
about your data-driven approach
to solving [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:25.306 --> 00:43:28.932
It seems to be a common
theme now in a lot of NGOs.

00:43:28.932 --> 00:43:29.890
ADAM BRAUN: Completely.

00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:33.350
So I think the Gates
Foundation has probably

00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:35.760
moved the space in that
direction more than any other,

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:39.010
because they've just applied
so much rigorous data driven

00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:42.654
monitoring and evaluation to
the way that they issue grants,

00:43:42.654 --> 00:43:43.570
as well as Robin Hood.

00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:45.670
Robin Hood's about as
data-driven as it gets.

00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:48.589
So one of the things that's
really important to us

00:43:48.589 --> 00:43:51.130
is that we're not purely driven
by passion, but by commitment

00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:51.750
to results.

00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:54.420
And so we track about
25 different metrics

00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:56.370
in every community after
a school is opened.

00:43:56.370 --> 00:43:59.060
So that's everything
from teacher attention,

00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:01.750
to student attendance,
to literacy progression,

00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:04.450
grade progression, numeracy.

00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:08.070
And what we're seeing is
some really compelling data.

00:44:08.070 --> 00:44:10.391
So kids that go
through classrooms

00:44:10.391 --> 00:44:12.140
where we've provided
our teaching training

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:15.630
outperform peer communities
three to one on test scores.

00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:17.315
85% of the communities
where we work

00:44:17.315 --> 00:44:19.650
are reporting
increases in literacy.

00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:22.550
And kids in Pencils
of Promise schools

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:25.590
are progressing from one
grade to the next at two times

00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:27.010
the national average.

00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:30.580
And so that to me is what's,
truthfully, most important.

00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:34.910
So this is a little bit jargony,
but the nonprofit space always

00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:37.460
celebrates outputs.

00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:40.200
And so the output would be
broke ground on 200 schools,

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:44.660
22,000-plus kids
in our classrooms,

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:47.340
and 15 million education
hours delivered.

00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:48.810
And those are
nice, flashy stats,

00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:50.820
and people say, wow,
that's really great.

00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:54.360
But the analogy of that
would be for a company

00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:58.410
to purely be based on the
amount of employees they have.

00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:00.329
Or, you know, I define
it to background.

00:45:00.329 --> 00:45:02.120
So it'd be like someone
saying, hey, I just

00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:04.780
launched an investment fund,
and we have $25 million

00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:06.175
under management.

00:45:06.175 --> 00:45:08.490
Now, that's great,
but all that matters

00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:11.170
is what's the performance
of your investment strategy.

00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:14.690
So if you have $25 million under
management but you're down 30%

00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:17.000
on the year, you're
not doing a good job.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.800
And yet the nonprofit
space kind of

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:23.380
has this free pass, where
people assume, oh, I gave $100,

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:24.790
I got my $100 tax deduction.

00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:26.310
I did good in the world.

00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:30.430
And oftentimes that $100 is
either used ineffectively--

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:32.724
sometimes it has
unintended consequence

00:45:32.724 --> 00:45:35.630
that are adversely
effecting the communities.

00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:39.790
And so our commitment
is to always stay

00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:41.910
held accountable to
the results themselves.

00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:44.170
And so we kill programs often.

00:45:44.170 --> 00:45:46.134
We mapped out all
of our programs,

00:45:46.134 --> 00:45:48.550
and we were doing something,
it was called Sister Schools.

00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:51.020
So we pairing together schools
in low income communities,

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:54.370
in the Bronx, and Queens,
and parts of the city,

00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:56.370
and parts of California
with some of our schools

00:45:56.370 --> 00:45:57.430
internationally.

00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:59.014
And, you know, parents
and individuals

00:45:59.014 --> 00:46:00.263
were like, can we do pen pals?

00:46:00.263 --> 00:46:00.779
We did it.

00:46:00.779 --> 00:46:02.070
We thought it was a great idea.

00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:04.330
And then when we mapped
it out on a two by two,

00:46:04.330 --> 00:46:06.087
and kind of did
consulting style work,

00:46:06.087 --> 00:46:07.920
we realized, all right,
this is actually not

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:10.267
advancing our mission
very effectively.

00:46:10.267 --> 00:46:12.100
It's not advancing the
fundraising component

00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:12.960
of the organization.

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:17.410
And it's a huge effort on behalf
of our time, energy, resources,

00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:18.020
our staff.

00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:20.600
And so we stopped the program
because it was ineffective.

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:22.330
Now, it would be
nice for me to show

00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:24.360
you pictures of kids in
the Bronx communicating

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:26.360
with kids in rural Laos,
and everyone would say,

00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:27.175
oh, I feel so good.

00:46:27.175 --> 00:46:30.090
But it was an ineffective
usage of our dollar.

00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:32.020
And so when you have
a data-driven approach

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:34.980
I think you make those
emotionally tough decisions.

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:37.105
But if you're committed to
the mission achievement,

00:46:37.105 --> 00:46:39.246
then it's a no-brainer.

00:46:47.542 --> 00:46:49.982
AUDIENCE: So I wanted
to sort of understand

00:46:49.982 --> 00:46:52.422
a question that you asked.

00:46:52.422 --> 00:46:54.154
[INAUDIBLE]

00:46:54.154 --> 00:46:54.862
ADAM BRAUN: Yeah.

00:46:54.862 --> 00:46:57.310
AUDIENCE: But I wanted
to like focus it around

00:46:57.310 --> 00:47:01.680
how we could apply technology
advances to this mission.

00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:03.600
And I want to ask the
question this way.

00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:06.480
Just sort of think about
some big things that we do,

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.440
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:14.480
If you could have a bunch of
[INAUDIBLE] for six months,

00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:17.360
what would you have them do?

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:20.040
ADAM BRAUN: Great question.

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:24.886
So the underlying,
I guess, variable

00:47:24.886 --> 00:47:27.010
is whether there's Wi-Fi
access in our communities,

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:28.900
which there is currently not.

00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:30.920
And so the first
thing I would say

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:32.765
is bringing Wi-Fi access
to every community

00:47:32.765 --> 00:47:33.670
in which we worked.

00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:35.350
If I could get that
in itself, like

00:47:35.350 --> 00:47:36.967
that would be the Moonshot.

00:47:36.967 --> 00:47:38.550
I think that, whatever,
it's something

00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:41.990
like 4 billion people are
not currently connected.

00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:44.830
And so if we could connect every
single one of our communities

00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:47.620
into the internet
in some capacity,

00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:49.520
that would be the dream.

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:52.060
But because it's probably,
let's say, five years away--

00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:54.770
it's not that far away--
but in the meantime

00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:57.280
I think there's some really
interesting capabilities

00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:00.450
around mobile access
in communities,

00:48:00.450 --> 00:48:03.010
and provision of
content, quality content.

00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:05.130
Because what we
see is most people

00:48:05.130 --> 00:48:07.810
have mobile phones,
certainly in Ghana.

00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:10.630
They're starting to get them in
Guatemala at pretty high rates.

00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:13.260
Laos is less frequent, but
somebody in the community

00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:14.590
has a mobile phone.

00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:18.950
And there should be some
type of content delivery

00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:20.390
system within feature phones.

00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:22.790
So right now people are mainly
focused on smart phones,

00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:24.920
but the communities where
we work don't have those.

00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:27.830
So I would almost ask
engineers to say, OK,

00:48:27.830 --> 00:48:29.466
what is the mobile
capacity going

00:48:29.466 --> 00:48:32.210
to be in this community
in the next three years?

00:48:32.210 --> 00:48:34.360
And then how do we build
a content delivery system

00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:35.610
so that they can self educate?

00:48:38.995 --> 00:48:40.975
FEMALE SPEAKER: Time
for one more question.

00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:52.848
AUDIENCE: So you have these
organizations like [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:52.848 --> 00:49:04.256
What's your take on, since
you're [INAUDIBLE] organization

00:49:04.256 --> 00:49:06.736
maybe it's going to
be really good at it

00:49:06.736 --> 00:49:08.720
at the end of the year.

00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:11.402
What's your thinking
on [INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:11.402 --> 00:49:12.110
ADAM BRAUN: Sure.

00:49:12.110 --> 00:49:14.730
So, one, I would
never personally knock

00:49:14.730 --> 00:49:17.610
anyone that's trying to create a
positive influence in the world

00:49:17.610 --> 00:49:19.050
and in the lives of others.

00:49:19.050 --> 00:49:21.450
So it's hard for me to say
this is a bad organization

00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:23.860
unless they actually
do bad things.

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:26.340
My personal preference,
my genuine belief,

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:28.300
is that the single
most powerful way

00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:30.817
to bring positive
aid to the world

00:49:30.817 --> 00:49:32.805
is through greater
access of opportunity,

00:49:32.805 --> 00:49:35.290
to not dictate what somebody
should or shouldn't do,

00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:37.775
but purely to give them
the opportunity to choose.

00:49:37.775 --> 00:49:40.260
And there's no more
powerful way to do that

00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:41.751
than through education.

00:49:41.751 --> 00:49:44.236
The second thing is from
a data-driven approach.

00:49:44.236 --> 00:49:46.721
The only measured
way that has proven

00:49:46.721 --> 00:49:48.709
effective to raise
a country's GDP

00:49:48.709 --> 00:49:51.691
is through greater access
to education and attainment

00:49:51.691 --> 00:49:55.162
through educational achievement
of primary age children.

00:49:55.162 --> 00:49:56.661
It's just the only
thing that's been

00:49:56.661 --> 00:49:58.649
proven to lift up
GDP's consistently.

00:49:58.649 --> 00:50:00.637
And so when I look
at that, and I think,

00:50:00.637 --> 00:50:02.920
OK, education, now I
have the data behind it.

00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:05.170
I have the personal
preference towards it.

00:50:05.170 --> 00:50:08.290
And in my opinion it's
the only root cause

00:50:08.290 --> 00:50:09.350
that lifts up all others.

00:50:09.350 --> 00:50:11.100
So when you look at
discrimination issues,

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:13.570
when you look at
disease, education

00:50:13.570 --> 00:50:16.287
is the one that just
has some type of kind

00:50:16.287 --> 00:50:18.510
of residual impact on the rest.

00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:20.980
And my second thing
is around health.

00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:24.060
Health and education
are tied hand in hand.

00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:28.169
But my personal passion has
always been around education.

00:50:28.169 --> 00:50:32.033
But if somebody
works on-- I mean,

00:50:32.033 --> 00:50:34.931
there's an MIT study
that tried to say,

00:50:34.931 --> 00:50:37.730
what is the most dollar for
dollar effective intervention,

00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:39.372
[INAUDIBLE].

00:50:39.372 --> 00:50:41.610
Now, that said,
that's like in a lab.

00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:42.318
It's theoretical.

00:50:42.318 --> 00:50:45.755
It's think-tanks
putting it together.

00:50:45.755 --> 00:50:48.210
But for me it's
always been access

00:50:48.210 --> 00:50:51.156
to quality education, and
in particular, for youth.

00:50:51.156 --> 00:50:53.485
And so I wouldn't knock
any other organization,

00:50:53.485 --> 00:50:56.810
but I think there's something
powerful within that.

00:50:56.810 --> 00:51:03.160
And the last part for me is
that the former CEO of Malaria

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:04.830
No More said this
to me outright.

00:51:04.830 --> 00:51:07.420
He said education is the
most stupidly solvable issue

00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:09.702
of our time, because
we have everything

00:51:09.702 --> 00:51:11.166
needed to educate every child.

00:51:11.166 --> 00:51:13.118
So with malaria
there's vaccinations.

00:51:13.118 --> 00:51:15.110
There are bed nets that
may or may not work.

00:51:15.110 --> 00:51:17.744
With water you have to dig for
aquifers that you're not sure

00:51:17.744 --> 00:51:18.910
if they're going to show up.

00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:21.694
With prevention
of AIDS or cancer,

00:51:21.694 --> 00:51:23.110
again, you'll have
to do research.

00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:26.246
And diabetes, we just don't
have the solution known yet.

00:51:26.246 --> 00:51:28.576
With education we have
everything, right now,

00:51:28.576 --> 00:51:30.290
to educate every child on Earth.

00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:33.332
And within that knowledge
gives me confidence

00:51:33.332 --> 00:51:36.410
that it's the thing that I like
to work on, because I believe

00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:38.192
I can solve it-- not
I, but collectively

00:51:38.192 --> 00:51:41.108
we together-- can
actually solve this,

00:51:41.108 --> 00:51:44.024
which gives me a
lot of excitement.

00:51:44.024 --> 00:51:45.646
FEMALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:51:45.646 --> 00:51:47.270
Well thank you guys
so much for coming.

00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:50.140
Thank you for coming
and talking with us.

00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:52.790
It's been really, really
cool to have you here.

00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:53.914
ADAM BRAUN: Thank you guys.

00:51:53.914 --> 00:51:55.914
FEMALE SPEAKER: Books are
available in the back,

00:51:55.914 --> 00:51:57.580
and thank you so much.
