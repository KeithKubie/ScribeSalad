00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:01.360
Welcome back.

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.100
And I just want to apologize
ahead of time because I'm

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.230
actually in a hotel right now
because my wife is at a

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.950
medical conference and I'm using
my laptop, with a kind

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.260
of ad hoc configuration.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.260
So it might not sound as good as
it normally does, but let's

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.320
just try to keep learning.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.580
So let's start off the way I
start off every video, but

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:19.850
maybe I'll do it a little
different this time.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.350
So I want to start a bank.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.090
So I use 300 gold pieces, 100
to actually build a bank.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.290
So this is my vault.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.240
The actual physical structure--
that took 100 gold

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.030
pieces and I'm actually going
to initially capitalize this

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.550
bank with 200 gold pieces.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.030
You want to show people what it
looks like for gold to be

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.030
sitting in the vault
to get the idea.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:57.270
So my initial equity
is 300 gold pieces.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.100
Like all of the other examples,
I start off by

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.060
taking deposits.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.580
The villagers trust me.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.750
So Villager A comes and gives
me-- let me just do

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.690
Villager A in green.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:14.800
He comes and gives me
his 100 gold pieces.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.200
This is just all gold.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.150
And then that's an asset sitting
in my vault and then

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.540
the offsetting liability for me,
although this would be an

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.220
asset for him, is a
checking account.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.970
So account for Person A and he
can write checks against that

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.770
and we know how that can be
used as actual currency or

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.470
actually be used to
make payments.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.250
And then Person B comes.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:46.870
He's a little bit richer,
gives 200 gold pieces.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.180
And he wants half of that in
his checking account and he

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.790
wants the other half essentially
in cash.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.505
Or in bank notes, as
we've learned.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.450
And then half of it, he wants
in terms of bank notes.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:13.810
So this liability would be bank
notes outstanding, 400

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.800
gold pieces.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.350
This is 100 right here.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.470
And I'll print up
some bank notes.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.640
Maybe he wants five 20s.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.570
So I'll give him five times--
each of the bank notes might

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:34.150
look something like this-- 20
gold piece denomination, have

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.460
a picture of a handsome
bank founder.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.040
It'll say Bank of Sal
at the bottom.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.770
I'll give it to him and then
he could use that for

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.870
transactions with people who
maybe don't like to leave a

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:44.910
paper trail.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.070
But anyway-- or whatever, buying
a newspaper, whatever

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.950
he needs to do.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.200
But he can use these and then
whoever he hands these to, if

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.960
they have one of these 20 gold
piece bills, they can come

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.700
back to the Bank of
Sal and actually

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.390
redeem 20 gold pieces.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.950
So it's kind of like a checking
account, but you

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.080
don't know who actually has
rights to it at any given

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.980
moment in time.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.330
But anyway, we've done that in
the last couple of videos and

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.590
we've shown how you can change
hands and how when someone

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.720
writes a check, say, between A
and B, you're just kind of--

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.610
you're just changing what
happens in the books and the

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.430
gold never has to leave. But
let's think about what happens

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.770
now when we actually start
to lend some money.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.290
So the old example-- if someone
had a project that

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.720
required, let's say, 300 gold
pieces, we would actually give

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.080
them the 300 gold pieces.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.000
We would actually take
it out of our vaults.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.600
They would use that 300 gold
pieces to hire the people or

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.200
buy whatever supplies they
needed to actually do their

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.890
project and then those people
maybe would redeposit it back

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.230
in the bank and that process
would continue.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.490
What we're going to do now is
try to think about, how could

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.220
we do this without the
bank ever having to

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.210
give the gold out?

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.380
One, it's just a safety concern
and then the gold is

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.760
just not an easy thing
to transact with.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.630
If someone wants to sell
something worth half a gold

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:55.590
piece, do they cut it?

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.490
If someone wants to sell
something worth 1,000 gold

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.220
pieces, it's a security risk
and it weighs a lot.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.720
So what can we do?

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.190
So let's say entrepreneur--
let's see.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.660
We did A, B-- so let's
do Entrepreneur C.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:07.690
He has an idea.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.360
Let's say it's the irrigation
ditch again.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.440
And he needs 300 gold pieces.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.310
So what we do is, we lend
him 300 gold pieces.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:27.850
So I have an asset-- 300 gold
piece loan to Entrepreneur C.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.330
And instead of actually taking
it out of my assets here and

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.770
then waiting maybe for his
laborers to redeposit it, I

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.550
can just create a checking
account for Entrepreneur C.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.250
In fact, it can be maybe part
checking, maybe part cash.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.820
What I could do is maybe 100 of
it, I can make a checking

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:54.820
account and then the other 200,
I could put some more

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.070
bank notes outstanding.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:06.520
So maybe I do 20, maybe
he wants it in 10s.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.240
And I give him a bunch of these
things that I've printed

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.490
out from the Bank of Sal.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.620
And maybe he could use this
to pay his laborers.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.920
And if the laborers later on,
they don't want to just hold

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.900
these pieces of paper, they can
come back to the Bank of

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.490
Sal and get gold in
exchange for it.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.840
And then let's say another
entrepreneur comes and he

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.890
wants to build a factory.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:33.420
He needs 100 gold pieces.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.290
So I have a loan-- 100 loan.

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:38.540
That's my asset.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.360
And then I can create a checking
account for him.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.740
So this is account for D.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.040
And I know what you're
thinking.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.110
It looks like I'm making
money out of nowhere.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.840
I'm just increasing both the
left and the right-hand side

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.990
of the balance sheet for
every new loan I make.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.660
And if you think about, this
was actually not that

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.820
different when we
issued the gold.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.720
It's just that we had to
wait for the gold to

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.180
come back to the bank.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.400
This is essentially a way of
keeping the gold here and we

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.230
just use these checking accounts
and these bank notes

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.950
as a way of transacting instead
of the gold itself.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.270
So for example, let's say this
Entrepreneur D, he wants to

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.460
build a factory.

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.760
Let's say that person
A is the person who

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.010
actually builds the factory.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.820
Person D can write
Person A a check.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.690
He could write 100-- You know
what a check looks like.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:35.760
He'll sign it.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.370
Person D-- He'll say
it's for a factory.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.580
He'll write out 100 here and
he'll write it out in words.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.510
However a check is, just
something that shows-- it has

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.700
to be authenticated so that when
A takes it back to the

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.200
bank, the bank believes that
D actually wrote it in his

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.850
checkbook as opposed to
somehow A forging it.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:55.500
And in return, A is going
to build D a factory.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.950
And then when A takes this
check that he got from D,

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.060
brings it back to the bank, then
the bank says, OK, well,

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.930
D is going to take all this
money out of his account and

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:08.050
we have to transfer it to A.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:10.140
So I could move that down
or I could just

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.220
change it to A's color.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.750
And I think you get the point.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:16.220
All this 100 gold pieces
is now A's.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:20.390
And once again, we did not
have to change anything.

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:23.170
We didn't have to deal
with any gold.

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:25.750
Now the natural question
is, how far can

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.430
this process continue?

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:31.060
Can a bank just continue issuing
loans and checking

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.610
accounts indefinitely and
essentially collecting the

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.150
difference in the interest
between the interest it gets

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.190
on the loan and the interest
it gives on

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:40.220
the checking account?

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:40.650
Well, no.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:44.180
Because then a bank take on
arbitrary amounts of risk--

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.210
and there are regulations,
although I think a bank would

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:48.370
do it on their own to some
degree, but there are

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:51.800
regulations called reserve
requirements that tell us how

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.910
much lending can a
bank do relative

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:59.090
to its actual reserves.

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:02.450
In this case, it's
reserves of gold.

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:05.990
Actually, even a better
definition-- How much checking

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.260
accounts and bank notes
it can issue

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.500
relative to its reserves.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.820
And in the next video-- The
point of this video was

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.480
showing you how this loan
process can occur with the

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.720
gold never leaving.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.990
In the next video, we'll
actually talk about reserve

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.680
requirements and think about why
reserve requirements are

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:26.130
what they are and what happens
in extreme circumstances.

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:27.990
See you in the next video.
