Build it, draw it, play it.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.410
Vsauce, this is your home
for some of the coolest creations

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.657
from everyday people.
This is BIDIPI.

00:00:07.657 --> 00:00:10.490
Build it—Justin Beckerman
is a high school student

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.996
who built his own submarine
that he actually uses.

00:00:13.996 --> 00:00:17.316
He spent a month designing it
and five months building it.

00:00:17.316 --> 00:00:19.316
The body of the submarine is
is a drain pipe,

00:00:19.316 --> 00:00:23.186
it has a motor, regulators and valves
from an old soda machine,

00:00:23.186 --> 00:00:25.485
three battery systems,
float sensors,

00:00:25.485 --> 00:00:28.805
a horn, a CB radio to communicate
with people on the surface,

00:00:28.805 --> 00:00:31.751
lights, and a camera system
that allows him to send a signal

00:00:31.751 --> 00:00:34.119
to a TV for others to see
what he does,

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:37.161
and all of this set him back
around $950 dollars.

00:00:37.161 --> 00:00:41.758
Rosanna Pansino creates pop culture
and video game-inspired cakes and cookies

00:00:41.758 --> 00:00:43.758
on her show, Nerdy Nummies.

00:00:43.758 --> 00:00:47.493
Her custom baked good creations include
Mario Piranha Cookie Pops,

00:00:47.493 --> 00:00:52.207
Creeper Rice Krispie Treats,
and even an Indian Jones Monkey Brain cake.

00:00:52.207 --> 00:00:54.207
And for the last episode
of BIDIPI,

00:00:54.207 --> 00:00:56.549
she actually made
some Vsauce cupcakes.

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:01.420
Caleb from Hackaday created
an 80,000-volt homemade Thor hammer.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.853
The head of the hammer is made from foam,
and the handle is PVC

00:01:04.853 --> 00:01:08.452
wrapped in leather, with the battery located
in the bottom of the handle.

00:01:08.452 --> 00:01:11.238
In the core of the hammer,
there's a built-in Tesla coil

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:14.721
that's able to power lightbulbs
and shock metal pieces.

00:01:14.721 --> 00:01:16.721
Check out his channel
for more hacks.

00:01:16.721 --> 00:01:20.877
Tom Eckert makes
extremely lifelike sculptures out of wood.

00:01:20.877 --> 00:01:23.942
Some of his most impressive work
includes flowing forms,

00:01:23.942 --> 00:01:27.007
like that of fabric, that look
as though they're translucent.

00:01:27.007 --> 00:01:30.281
He uses traditional woodworking techniques
to create the pieces

00:01:30.281 --> 00:01:32.626
and then paints them
with a waterborne lacquer

00:01:32.626 --> 00:01:35.435
that he applies with both an airbrush
and brushes,

00:01:35.435 --> 00:01:38.660
and he says that his preferred woods
are basswood, linden,

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.516
and lime-wood, because they're stable
and carve well.

00:01:41.516 --> 00:01:45.878
Draw it—Kirsten of Chicago created
this delightful series of illustrations

00:01:45.878 --> 00:01:49.918
of what famous TV
and movie characters do on their days off.

00:01:49.918 --> 00:01:52.844

00:01:52.844 --> 00:01:56.814
Michael irons the Jumpsuit,
and the Twin Peaks homage,

00:01:56.814 --> 00:01:58.814
Bedtime for Log.

00:01:58.814 --> 00:02:03.636
LA-based Dan Luvisi created
these nightmare pop culture character illustrations,

00:02:03.636 --> 00:02:08.512
including Donald Duck, Yoshi,
and this one, called Nightmare Finn,

00:02:08.512 --> 00:02:11.995
where he says, "The idea here
is that Finn devoured Jake,

00:02:11.995 --> 00:02:15.361
consuming his abilities, and thus turning
into this huge creep."

00:02:15.361 --> 00:02:18.098
And now
for some retro video game-themed art

00:02:18.098 --> 00:02:21.209
