00:00:05.467 --> 00:00:09.623
(uplifting piano music)

00:00:09.623 --> 00:00:12.564
- [Announcer] We are
the paradoxical eight.

00:00:12.564 --> 00:00:15.064
Bipedal, naked, large-brained,

00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:21.128
long the master of fire,
tools and language,

00:00:21.128 --> 00:00:24.545
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:29.282
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:29.282 --> 00:00:31.365
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.817 --> 00:00:34.317
We grow up slowly.

00:00:35.155 --> 00:00:37.763
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.763 --> 00:00:39.846
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.776 --> 00:00:43.493
We shape the future from
our shared understanding

00:00:43.493 --> 00:00:44.493
of the past.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.396
Carta brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.396 --> 00:00:53.141
to exchange insights on who we are

00:00:53.141 --> 00:00:55.438
and how we got here.

00:00:55.438 --> 00:00:59.583
And exploration made possible
by the generosity of humans

00:00:59.583 --> 00:01:00.416
like you.

00:01:22.111 --> 00:01:24.778
(digital music)

00:01:34.765 --> 00:01:37.900
- Okay, the question that
we have been interested in

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.185
over the past 25 or so years,

00:01:40.185 --> 00:01:43.458
is how do brains in evolution get bigger?

00:01:43.458 --> 00:01:46.990
And to put the question in
a bit more specific terms,

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.253
what underlies the evolutionary
increase in the number

00:01:51.253 --> 00:01:55.420
of neurons that are generated
in cortical development?

00:01:56.394 --> 00:01:57.782
And as you heard from
the previous speakers,

00:01:57.782 --> 00:02:01.323
this reflects the activity
of cortical stem and

00:02:01.323 --> 00:02:03.202
progenitor cells.

00:02:03.202 --> 00:02:06.241
And the answer, how you
get more neurons formed,

00:02:06.241 --> 00:02:10.320
is simple: all you need is
an increased and prolonged

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.489
proliferation of these
cortical stem-cells.

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.502
But the key question is, what
underlies the differences

00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:18.173
across species?

00:02:18.173 --> 00:02:21.217
Why do we have more neurons
than, say the macaque,

00:02:21.217 --> 00:02:22.300
or the chimp?

00:02:23.995 --> 00:02:26.337
Let me give you a very
brief introduction to these

00:02:26.337 --> 00:02:27.177
stem-cells.

00:02:27.177 --> 00:02:31.373
What you see here is a
developing mouse brain

00:02:31.373 --> 00:02:34.890
and the neocortex forms
from a structure called the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.059
dorsolateral telencephalon,
that is shown here in the box,

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:41.479
and shown here at greater magnification.

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:44.582
And what has fascinated
me, as a cell biologist

00:02:44.582 --> 00:02:45.415
over the years is that this cortical wall,

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:49.082
this developing cortical
wall, has polarity.

00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:53.228
It has an apical side, a you
heard from previous speakers,

00:02:53.228 --> 00:02:55.161
and a basal side.

00:02:55.161 --> 00:02:58.660
And the process of making
neurons is a strict apical

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.577
to basal process in which
progenitors that form the

00:03:03.577 --> 00:03:06.728
primary germinal layer,
the ventricular zone,

00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:10.142
progenitors that we collectively
call apical progenitors

00:03:10.142 --> 00:03:14.302
but notably the apical or
ventricular radial glia,

00:03:14.302 --> 00:03:17.754
these progenitors do not
make many neurons but rather,

00:03:17.754 --> 00:03:22.303
generate a secondary class
of progenitors that form

00:03:22.303 --> 00:03:25.699
the secondary layer of the
germinal zone called the

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:27.407
subventricular zone.

00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:30.255
We call these collectively
basal progenitors and there

00:03:30.255 --> 00:03:34.797
are two major types: the
basal or outer radial glia

00:03:34.797 --> 00:03:36.882
and basal intermediate progenitors.

00:03:36.882 --> 00:03:40.885
And in a important paper
from Coleta colleagues

00:03:40.885 --> 00:03:44.707
it was shown that in more
highly developed brains,

00:03:44.707 --> 00:03:48.852
the outer subventricular
zone is very characteristic

00:03:48.852 --> 00:03:51.547
and it is very highly populated by

00:03:51.547 --> 00:03:53.576
basal radial glial cells.

00:03:53.576 --> 00:03:57.476
So these are the one implicated
in cortical expansion.

00:03:57.476 --> 00:04:01.552
And there is actually a cell
biological reason why these

00:04:01.552 --> 00:04:05.496
progenitors have advantages
to expand the cortex.

00:04:05.496 --> 00:04:08.709
The apical progenitors, because
of their cell biological

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.123
nature, can divide only at the ventricle,

00:04:12.123 --> 00:04:14.630
and that's a very limited space.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.744
In contrast, the basal
progenitors can divide

00:04:16.744 --> 00:04:18.945
anywhere in the subventricular zone.

00:04:18.945 --> 00:04:21.540
There they can thicken
the subventricular zone,

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.257
and this is a huge advantage
if one wants to maximize

00:04:24.257 --> 00:04:26.608
the number of cell divisions.

00:04:26.608 --> 00:04:29.255
And this is the reason why
cortical expansion is linked

00:04:29.255 --> 00:04:33.678
to basal progenitor
abundance and proliferation.

00:04:33.678 --> 00:04:37.784
So a few years ago, we decided
then to embark on a search

00:04:37.784 --> 00:04:41.789
for human specific genes
that would do two things:

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:45.147
increase basal progenitor generation,

00:04:45.147 --> 00:04:49.630
and also induce or promote
basal progenitor proliferation.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.148
And when I say we, I talk
about an outstanding PhD

00:04:53.148 --> 00:04:56.514
student in the lab: Marta Florio.

00:04:56.514 --> 00:05:00.681
What Marta has developed is
a cell biological approach

00:05:01.525 --> 00:05:04.394
to isolate these various,
these two major classes of

00:05:04.394 --> 00:05:05.749
stem-cells.

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:08.832
This is a cartoon of the
developing cortical wall,

00:05:08.832 --> 00:05:11.664
and you can label the apical
side with an antibody against

00:05:11.664 --> 00:05:13.759
a protein called Prominin-1,

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:16.713
and the basal side where the
membrane die that diffuses

00:05:16.713 --> 00:05:19.349
into plasma membrane called DiI.

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:22.571
And with this approach, you
get a dual labeling of the

00:05:22.571 --> 00:05:26.258
apical radial glia and a
single labeling of the basal

00:05:26.258 --> 00:05:31.165
radial glia such that the
aRGs would be blue and red

00:05:31.165 --> 00:05:35.179
and the bRGs in the
mouse would only be red.

00:05:35.179 --> 00:05:37.648
Now the neurons would also be red,

00:05:37.648 --> 00:05:41.405
but in the mouse you have a
transgenic mouse line that,

00:05:41.405 --> 00:05:44.087
with the neurons in addition
green, and we can sort

00:05:44.087 --> 00:05:45.410
them away.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.005
So we get relatively pure populations.

00:05:48.005 --> 00:05:51.786
In humans this is more
complicated, and so we focused

00:05:51.786 --> 00:05:55.123
our attention to those cells
that had duplicated the DNA

00:05:55.123 --> 00:05:58.697
which turns them into
progenitors, so the aRGs are blue

00:05:58.697 --> 00:06:03.155
plus red, the bRGs are red
only, but please note that the

00:06:03.155 --> 00:06:07.477
bRGs in the G1 phase and of
the cell cycle so before they

00:06:07.477 --> 00:06:11.448
duplicate the DNA, would be
recovered in the neuron fraction

00:06:11.448 --> 00:06:15.615
shown here, and in fact we know
that about 10% of the cells

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:20.619
in the neuron fraction are these cells.

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:24.397
And this will become important
as you will see in a minute.

00:06:24.397 --> 00:06:27.753
What Marta then did was, she
isolated the cell populations

00:06:27.753 --> 00:06:31.920
and determined the transcriptome
and went for those genes

00:06:33.084 --> 00:06:36.303
that are highly expressed
in the stem-cells, and found

00:06:36.303 --> 00:06:40.470
a total of about 400 such genes
that were highly expressed

00:06:41.304 --> 00:06:44.243
in the basal and apical
radial glia but very low in

00:06:44.243 --> 00:06:45.741
the neurons.

00:06:45.741 --> 00:06:48.810
She then eliminated, from
these roughly 400 genes, those

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.571
which were also expressed in
the mouse stem-cells which

00:06:52.571 --> 00:06:56.964
brought the number down
to 266, and then of these,

00:06:56.964 --> 00:07:00.516
she again eliminated those
that were also expressed in the

00:07:00.516 --> 00:07:03.821
human neurons or human cortical
plate, which brought the

00:07:03.821 --> 00:07:05.404
number down to 263.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:11.450
These 263 genes come in
two classes: 207 have an

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:16.224
rtholog in the mouse
genome, but the gene is not

00:07:16.224 --> 00:07:20.307
expressed in the mouse
stem-cells, and 56 have no

00:07:21.412 --> 00:07:23.705
ortholog in the mouse
genome but exist, of course,

00:07:23.705 --> 00:07:25.236
in the human genome.

00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:27.745
These were for us the
more interesting ones.

00:07:27.745 --> 00:07:31.119
And now remember that we had,
we noticed by the approach

00:07:31.119 --> 00:07:35.177
of our way of isolating
these cells, that 10% of

00:07:35.177 --> 00:07:38.259
the cells in the neuron
fraction would actually be

00:07:38.259 --> 00:07:42.247
the stem-cells, the basal
radial glia, so we introduced

00:07:42.247 --> 00:07:46.414
another filter and asked which
of these 56 genes is at least

00:07:47.733 --> 00:07:51.321
tenfold more highly expressed
in the stem-cells than in

00:07:51.321 --> 00:07:54.386
the neurons, and amazingly
that reduced the number down

00:07:54.386 --> 00:07:55.219
to one.

00:07:56.110 --> 00:08:00.233
This one gene has this
pattern of expression:

00:08:00.233 --> 00:08:03.646
it is highly expressed in the
apical and basal radial glia,

00:08:03.646 --> 00:08:06.937
and this is the contamination
if you wish, of the bRGs

00:08:06.937 --> 00:08:09.437
in G1 and the neuron fraction.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:14.051
This gene is called
ARHGAP11B, and as I said it is

00:08:14.051 --> 00:08:17.809
specifically expressed in
human but not mouse apical

00:08:17.809 --> 00:08:21.013
and basal radial glia, but not neurons.

00:08:21.013 --> 00:08:24.897
This gene is interesting
for several reasons:

00:08:24.897 --> 00:08:27.314
one is what it, how it arose.

00:08:28.326 --> 00:08:31.129
It arose as both first
shown by Evan Eichler who's

00:08:31.129 --> 00:08:34.789
actually here in the audience
as a product of a partial

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:39.526
duplication of a ubiquitous
gene called ARHGAP11A,

00:08:39.526 --> 00:08:42.731
which encodes a specific
enzyme-like protein called

00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:46.020
a Rho GTPase-activating-protein.

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:50.637
But it has, in contrast to the
mother gene, it does not have

00:08:50.637 --> 00:08:53.841
the GAP domain in full,
but it has a novel sequence

00:08:53.841 --> 00:08:58.526
here at the C-terminal end
of 47 amino acids, which are

00:08:58.526 --> 00:09:02.026
actually also specific to humans.

00:09:02.026 --> 00:09:06.245
Now this sequence comes about
because 55 nuclear tides shown

00:09:06.245 --> 00:09:10.981
here in purple, which are
present in 11A, are actually not

00:09:10.981 --> 00:09:14.866
present in 11B, and this
leads to a reading frame shift

00:09:14.866 --> 00:09:18.392
and this new green protein
sequence shown here.

00:09:18.392 --> 00:09:21.148
And the other reason why
this gene is interesting,

00:09:21.148 --> 00:09:24.474
is when it arose in
evolution, as both shown by

00:09:24.474 --> 00:09:27.017
Evan Eichler, but also by
my friend and colleague

00:09:27.017 --> 00:09:30.154
Svanta Paabo who cannot be
here today, unfortunately.

00:09:30.154 --> 00:09:34.201
It arose about 5,000,000
years ago, after the lineage

00:09:34.201 --> 00:09:37.038
that leads to the chimpanzee
segregated from the lineage

00:09:37.038 --> 00:09:41.944
that leads to us, but before
the lineage that leads to the

00:09:41.944 --> 00:09:46.315
Neanderthals segregated from
the lineage that leads to us.

00:09:46.315 --> 00:09:48.068
And as you know Neanderthal brains were

00:09:48.068 --> 00:09:50.210
at least as big as ours.

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:53.538
So we have here a gene that
is expressed in the right

00:09:53.538 --> 00:09:56.704
stem-cell at the right time
of development, and that is

00:09:56.704 --> 00:10:00.261
only found in those
hominids with 1.3 liter

00:10:00.261 --> 00:10:01.928
to 1.4 liter brains.

00:10:02.809 --> 00:10:05.434
So the obvious question
was with that gene,

00:10:05.434 --> 00:10:08.760
increased brain size or increased
or increased neuro number

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.486
in a model system, the mouse.

00:10:11.486 --> 00:10:15.139
And this is what Marta
investigated, by expressing the

00:10:15.139 --> 00:10:19.671
gene by a technique that we
call in utero electroporation

00:10:19.671 --> 00:10:22.858
and to make a long story
short, what she found was

00:10:22.858 --> 00:10:25.853
that when you express this
human-specific gene in the

00:10:25.853 --> 00:10:29.306
mouse developing neocortex,
it triples the number of

00:10:29.306 --> 00:10:32.584
mitotically active basal progenitors,

00:10:32.584 --> 00:10:36.650
so the progenitors implicated
in neocortex expansion.

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:39.840
So it increases these progenitors,
but there are two ways

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.635
how it can do that:

00:10:41.635 --> 00:10:45.168
either you make more of these
progenitors from the apical

00:10:45.168 --> 00:10:49.458
radial glia or, you increase
the proliferation of these

00:10:49.458 --> 00:10:51.793
basal progenitors once formed.

00:10:51.793 --> 00:10:56.351
And we solved this, or we
studied this issue and made use

00:10:56.351 --> 00:10:59.415
of a method that Elena Taverna developed.

00:10:59.415 --> 00:11:03.213
Elena, like Marta, is also
from Milan, and you can believe

00:11:03.213 --> 00:11:05.703
me these are such outstanding
people that whenever I get

00:11:05.703 --> 00:11:08.953
an application from Milan, I accept it.

00:11:10.019 --> 00:11:12.530
So what Elena developed
was a technique where she

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:17.006
microinjects, an organotypic
slices into the apical

00:11:17.006 --> 00:11:18.107
radial glia.

00:11:18.107 --> 00:11:20.427
So here you see the slice
and here you see the pipette,

00:11:20.427 --> 00:11:23.719
and basically she injects
blind, but the pipette is filled

00:11:23.719 --> 00:11:26.422
with fluorescent Dextran
and so you can identify the

00:11:26.422 --> 00:11:30.706
injected cell and very accurately
trace what happens to the

00:11:30.706 --> 00:11:33.214
daughter cells and
granddaughter cells of this cell

00:11:33.214 --> 00:11:36.471
after one cell cycle or
two cell cycles, and what

00:11:36.471 --> 00:11:39.735
Elena could show, and I'll
just summarize this data

00:11:39.735 --> 00:11:42.582
is the following: she showed
that when you stick in this

00:11:42.582 --> 00:11:46.557
human-specific gene, you will
change the mode of division

00:11:46.557 --> 00:11:50.758
of the aRG cell to a style
where it immediately gives rise

00:11:50.758 --> 00:11:52.569
to two basal progenitors.

00:11:52.569 --> 00:11:55.943
That is good but it's
also bad unless these

00:11:55.943 --> 00:11:59.009
basal progenitors would keep
on dividing, and that is

00:11:59.009 --> 00:12:02.110
in fact, the second thing
that ARHGAP11B does.

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:04.795
Normally in the mouse, one
of these basal progenitors

00:12:04.795 --> 00:12:08.021
will make two neurons, but
in the presence of 11B,

00:12:08.021 --> 00:12:10.759
it will now keep on proliferating.

00:12:10.759 --> 00:12:13.824
So this is what we found in the mouse:

00:12:13.824 --> 00:12:17.276
Nereo Kalebic very recently expressed this

00:12:17.276 --> 00:12:20.707
human-specific gene, not in
the mouse, but in the ferret

00:12:20.707 --> 00:12:23.719
a carnivore with a folded brain.

00:12:23.719 --> 00:12:27.373
And when he does that, he
found that also in the ferret,

00:12:27.373 --> 00:12:31.540
11B massively increases
the basal progenitors, but

00:12:32.409 --> 00:12:35.540
interestingly, it very
dramatically increases the

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:38.827
basal radial glia which is not
what happened in the mouse,

00:12:38.827 --> 00:12:42.052
but in the ferret it
increases the relevant

00:12:42.052 --> 00:12:43.885
basal progenitor type.

00:12:44.979 --> 00:12:48.340
And importantly, these basal
radial glial cells have

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:52.345
markers that are very
characteristic of the human state

00:12:52.345 --> 00:12:55.389
rather than the mouse
state or the ferret state.

00:12:55.389 --> 00:12:58.754
So the other question we ask
is whether 11B can induce

00:12:58.754 --> 00:13:01.835
folding of the mouse
neocortex which normally is an

00:13:01.835 --> 00:13:03.560
unfolded brain.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.936
So when we elect operate we
have always a control side

00:13:06.936 --> 00:13:10.492
which is smooth as shown here,
and then we can stick it in

00:13:10.492 --> 00:13:13.278
the gene and we see where
it is expressed by the green

00:13:13.278 --> 00:13:16.761
color, and when we look five
days after sticking this

00:13:16.761 --> 00:13:20.174
human-specific gene into a
developing mouse brain, we

00:13:20.174 --> 00:13:23.205
actually see that folds can
arise in about half of the

00:13:23.205 --> 00:13:26.372
embryos that are expressing this gene.

00:13:27.326 --> 00:13:30.858
And here is another case where
you have the electoporated

00:13:30.858 --> 00:13:34.042
area and you see these folds
in the mouse developing

00:13:34.042 --> 00:13:37.380
cortex which are somewhat
reminiscent of the folds that

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.797
happen in a fetal human brain shown here.

00:13:41.786 --> 00:13:45.234
Question is how does 11B
achieve these effects?

00:13:45.234 --> 00:13:48.970
Is it like the gene from
which is arose, 11A, a

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:50.720
RhoGAP question mark?

00:13:51.634 --> 00:13:54.188
And so a postdoc fantastic
postdoc from Japan,

00:13:54.188 --> 00:13:56.975
Takashi Namba, took on that question,

00:13:56.975 --> 00:13:58.784
made various constructs,

00:13:58.784 --> 00:14:03.331
the mother gene 11A, a full
GAP domain of 11A, a truncated

00:14:03.331 --> 00:14:06.748
GAP domain of 11B, and a modern 11B form,

00:14:08.591 --> 00:14:12.252
and asked which of these
exhibits RhoGAP activity,

00:14:12.252 --> 00:14:16.401
and the answer is these
upper two ones do, and these

00:14:16.401 --> 00:14:19.917
bottom ones including 11B, do not.

00:14:19.917 --> 00:14:24.084
And we actually know that
the ability of 11B to amplify

00:14:26.071 --> 00:14:29.676
basal progenitors, is tightly
linked to the existence of

00:14:29.676 --> 00:14:33.093
this new, green, human-specific sequence.

00:14:34.282 --> 00:14:37.608
Question then was, can the
evolutionary increase in

00:14:37.608 --> 00:14:41.191
brain size in us be
explained by ARHGAP11B?

00:14:42.763 --> 00:14:45.463
And there we have a
problem, because as I said,

00:14:45.463 --> 00:14:48.782
Evan Eichler and Svanta
showed that this gene arose

00:14:48.782 --> 00:14:52.167
about 5,000,000 years ago,
but 5,000,000 years ago

00:14:52.167 --> 00:14:53.943
our brains were small.

00:14:53.943 --> 00:14:57.565
The big increase in brain
size happens later, but we now

00:14:57.565 --> 00:15:00.892
have at least an
interesting possibility of

00:15:00.892 --> 00:15:02.809
explaining this enigma.

00:15:04.343 --> 00:15:07.042
And this has to do with
the question, how this loss

00:15:07.042 --> 00:15:10.699
of the 55 nuclear tides that
gives rise to the reading

00:15:10.699 --> 00:15:14.792
frame shift and the new
sequence, actually comes about.

00:15:14.792 --> 00:15:18.310
When we started this work,
we thought that as the gene

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:22.709
duplicated, these 55 nucear
tides got lost at the level of

00:15:22.709 --> 00:15:24.538
the genomic DNA,

00:15:24.538 --> 00:15:27.272
but when we looked more closely
we actually noticed that the

00:15:27.272 --> 00:15:31.439
genomic DNA of 11B contains
these 55 nuclear tides.

00:15:32.458 --> 00:15:35.492
What's happening is something
much more interesting.

00:15:35.492 --> 00:15:39.236
What you see here is in the
top, the sequence of 11A,

00:15:39.236 --> 00:15:42.261
and this is the spliced donor
side, the side where one

00:15:42.261 --> 00:15:45.919
coding sequence is moved
and so spliced onto the

00:15:45.919 --> 00:15:47.399
next one.

00:15:47.399 --> 00:15:51.566
Now in 11B, there is a
point mutation; a C to a G,

00:15:52.942 --> 00:15:56.165
which creates a new spliced donor side,

00:15:56.165 --> 00:15:58.850
and when this is taken, the
55 nuclear tides here are

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:02.963
removed and that induces the
shift in the reading frame

00:16:02.963 --> 00:16:06.882
because it truncates the coding
region of EXON 5 and then

00:16:06.882 --> 00:16:10.904
when that's spliced together
to a messenger RNA then you

00:16:10.904 --> 00:16:12.558
get a new protein sequence.

00:16:12.558 --> 00:16:15.055
So this human-specific
sequence is caused by

00:16:15.055 --> 00:16:18.222
a single nuclear tide splice mutation.

00:16:19.365 --> 00:16:22.301
This raised a very interesting
explanation, or at least

00:16:22.301 --> 00:16:26.867
the possibility, and that
is that ARHGAP11B arose as a

00:16:26.867 --> 00:16:29.971
with a full GAP domain
and having this activity

00:16:29.971 --> 00:16:33.506
5,000,000 years ago, and
then later, but before the

00:16:33.506 --> 00:16:37.403
Neanderthals branched off from
our lineage, later as point

00:16:37.403 --> 00:16:40.768
mutation takes place, which
gives this protein a new

00:16:40.768 --> 00:16:43.424
function or this gene a new function.

00:16:43.424 --> 00:16:47.729
So Marta investigated this
possibility by creating what we

00:16:47.729 --> 00:16:50.062
call an ancestral ARHGAP11B.

00:16:51.211 --> 00:16:54.729
So it is a gene that is
essentially or a CDNA that is

00:16:54.729 --> 00:16:58.896
identical to modern 11B, except
that it doesn't have the G,

00:16:59.794 --> 00:17:03.625
but the C, so it cannot
make the green sequence but

00:17:03.625 --> 00:17:06.310
makes this kind of a protein.

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:09.845
And we then asked the question,
will this ancestral 11B

00:17:09.845 --> 00:17:12.575
exhibit RhoGAP activity?

00:17:12.575 --> 00:17:16.730
And so Takashi again made
various constructs, and tested

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:21.298
their possible activity in
an essay in which a decrease

00:17:21.298 --> 00:17:25.465
in phosphorylation is
indicative of RhoGAP activity.

00:17:27.021 --> 00:17:30.903
And as you can see, the
modern 11B does not exhibit

00:17:30.903 --> 00:17:35.070
RhoGAP activity, but the
ancestral 11B, like the 11A,

00:17:36.223 --> 00:17:38.938
exhibits RhoGAP activity.

00:17:38.938 --> 00:17:43.105
Next question then was, would
this ARHGAP11B increase basal

00:17:44.682 --> 00:17:48.849
progenitors, and again by in
utero elect operation into mice

00:17:49.836 --> 00:17:54.082
in contrast to the modern
11B which increases basal

00:17:54.082 --> 00:17:58.249
progenitors, the ancestral
11B is unable to do so.

00:17:59.376 --> 00:18:03.739
So we have a rather interesting
situation as follows:

00:18:03.739 --> 00:18:07.685
we have a single C to G base substitution

00:18:07.685 --> 00:18:11.435
which creates a new
splice donor site in 11B.

00:18:12.924 --> 00:18:16.672
That leads to the loss of
the 55 nuclear tides as the

00:18:16.672 --> 00:18:18.505
messenger RNA is made,

00:18:19.829 --> 00:18:23.571
that causes a reading-frame
shift, that leads to a

00:18:23.571 --> 00:18:27.467
human-specific c-terminal
sequence that is key for

00:18:27.467 --> 00:18:30.375
basal progenitor
amplification, we believe.

00:18:30.375 --> 00:18:34.542
So if ARHGAP11B should have
contributed to the increase

00:18:37.324 --> 00:18:40.076
in the evolutionary increase
in brain size in humans

00:18:40.076 --> 00:18:43.820
and Neanderthals, it
would have done so by a

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:45.653
single point mutation.

00:18:46.744 --> 00:18:49.136
And with that I would just
like to acknowledge my

00:18:49.136 --> 00:18:52.617
collaborators, Marta, who
is now a postdoc in Boston,

00:18:52.617 --> 00:18:56.259
with significant help from
Mareike Albert, Takashi Namba,

00:18:56.259 --> 00:18:59.825
and Elena Taverna and Nereo
Kalebic who did the ferret

00:18:59.825 --> 00:19:01.720
work that I briefly mentioned.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:05.814
This is Dresden at night,
and these are people in my

00:19:05.814 --> 00:19:07.887
lab I didn't have time to mention.

00:19:07.887 --> 00:19:11.093
These are people who have left the lab.

00:19:11.093 --> 00:19:13.909
This is the famous Semperoper,
I'm not all the time yet

00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:15.276
I notice.

00:19:15.276 --> 00:19:18.012
And we have the good
fortune of collaborating

00:19:18.012 --> 00:19:20.712
with Svante Paabo, very
beautiful collaboration with him.

00:19:20.712 --> 00:19:24.461
The fetal tissue is given
to us by Robert Lachmann and

00:19:24.461 --> 00:19:27.422
Pauline Wimberger, and we
have a lot of bi-informatic

00:19:27.422 --> 00:19:30.595
support from Michael Hiller,
and these are present

00:19:30.595 --> 00:19:34.061
collaborators outside
of Dresden in Leipzig.

00:19:34.061 --> 00:19:37.283
And this is the reconstructed
church in Dresden,

00:19:37.283 --> 00:19:39.946
and I don't mention this
people's work on prominent

00:19:39.946 --> 00:19:42.544
but I would like to
acknowledge our support by the

00:19:42.544 --> 00:19:44.912
Max Planck Society, the
German Research Foundation

00:19:44.912 --> 00:19:47.254
and the European Research
Council, and with that I

00:19:47.254 --> 00:19:49.579
thank you for your attention
and I'm curious which questions

00:19:49.579 --> 00:19:51.203
you will write down.

00:19:51.203 --> 00:19:53.453
(applause)
