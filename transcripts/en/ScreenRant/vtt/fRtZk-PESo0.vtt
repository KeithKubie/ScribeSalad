00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.880
You might think that taking actual people
out of a movie means taking the mistakes and

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.430
human error out with them.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.090
But anyone paying close attention to modern
animated films knows that even the smallest

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.670
mistakes seem hilarious considering someone
made them one frame at a time.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.680
And the bigger the mistake, the better it
is to search for.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.320
Here are 20 Massive Mistakes in Animated Movies.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.770
Zootopia
The animals may have evolved to walk and talk,

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.060
but math is still a problem.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.720
Predators make up just 10% of the population,
but assistant mayor Bellwether later claims

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.340
that they're outnumbered 10 to 1.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.460
Hopefully kids didn't take that as a math
class, since 10% means a ratio of 9 to 1,

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.500
not 10.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.930
No older fan of Zootopia can forget the cameo
from actor Tommy Chong playing the mellow

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.649
Yax, one of the city's "Naturalists" - the
word the writers were looking for was actually

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:53.140
"Naturists" another words for nudists.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.030
The Lion King
The age of hand-drawn animation may be all

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.239
but over for Disney, but some awesome mistakes
remain thanks to one animator.

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.339
Look closely when Mufasa is filling Simba
in on the kingdom, and you'll notice the label

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.560
"45" appearing on screen for two frame.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.430
And you'll wonder how you never caught it
before.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.430
Reference

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.410
Beauty and The Beast
Nobody fights like Gaston - or talks like

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:13.410
him.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.610
His lips don't match his words in his final
fight with Beast, since his line - "Belle

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.050
is Mine" - was originally "Time to Die."

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.320
Softening the tone makes sense, but the original
animation was left behind.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.900
The Good Dinosaur
The movie may be set in an alternate history,

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.550
one where the asteroid that killed off the
dinosaurs 65 million years ago passed by completely.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.130
One problem though: the hero Apatosaur and
his family went extinct over 50 million years

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.620
before the asteroid ever struck.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.340
Wreck-it Ralph
It isn't an animation glitch or error that

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.920
gives Wreck-it Ralph its funniest mistake,
but time itself.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.080
Think about it: did you ever notice that Ralph
makes a jump into Hero's Duty as the arcade

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.000
opens, only for it to close just minutes later?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.810
Either time passes faster in the game, or
it's an editing shortcut audiences aren't

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:58.970
supposed to catch.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.370
The animators went to serious lengths to fill
the movie with video game cameos and details,

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.250
but a few mistakes slipped through as a result.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.780
The sign at Game Central Station clearly says
that "Burger Time" is Now Playing - but nobody

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.450
told the star chef, serving pie to Q*bert
and his friends.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.810
Despicable Me
The devil is in the details, especially in

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:17.980
animated films.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.160
When Gru first reveals the stolen jumbotron
from Madison Square Gardens, the animators

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.480
added in some missing bulbs for character
- missing bulbs that somehow scroll along

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.620
with the words - it should have been one or
the other.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.620
The movie's villain, Vector gets what's coming
to him eventually, but he should have gotten

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.910
his even sooner.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.261
When he idiotically shrinks his sink and toilet,
his bathroom should have been a disaster of

00:02:38.261 --> 00:02:42.010
spraying pipes - apparently, his toilet doesn't
even need plumbing, but it's a bad lesson

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.080
to teach troublemaking kids, either way.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.560
Aladdin
The animators took the time to make sure all

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.480
the writing in the film was Arabic, but when
scrolls are read, or Genie takes an order

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.580
while in the form of a waiter the writing
is written and read left to right, like English.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.459
But Arabis is read right to left.

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.580
As part of the romance between Aladdin and
Jasmine, the pair enjoy a Chinese fireworks

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.520
show in every color of the rainbow.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.430
But colored fireworks are a more modern invention,
so the fireworks would only have been yellow

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.470
or white prior to 1850 - which the movie most
definitely is.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.380
The Little Mermaid
Endings don't get much happier than this one,

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.750
with Ariel and Eric sailing off into the distance,
married, and treated to a rainbow.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.490
But dark magic might still be at work - the
rainbow is reversed, making it one truly weird

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:25.490
mistake.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.700
Finding Nemo
Sure, fish can't talk.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.630
But you'll have to ignore science and physics,
not just marine biology when the final scene

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.010
of Finding Nemo comes, showing the escaped
fish each in their own bags of water - magically

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.099
defying physics, keeping their bags full of
water floating above the surface, instead

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:42.170
of sinking to match the height.

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.230
Monsters, Inc
The billions of hairs covering the monster

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.000
stars meant hours to render a single frame.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.099
Luckily, some old fashioned mistakes slipped
through too, like the Pixar artist who forgot

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:56.020
the "i before e" rule when it came to the
word "yield" in Mike's file - TWICE.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.630
A misspelled word is one thing, but how about
the biggest plot hole Pixar's ever seen?

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.870
Boo's laughter is so powerful, it overloads
entire city blocks when she really gets giggling...

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.349
that is, until she spends the rest of the
movie laughing with absolutely no effect on

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.710
the city around her.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.310
Shrek
Kids now know that ogres aren't monsters to

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.340
be feared... well, not until they catch the
mosts disturbing animation glitch in the entire

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.710
Shrek series, when the hero's eyeball decides
to peek through his own eyelid.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.970
It's still giving us nightmares all these
years later.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.910
The plot holes get even bigger when it comes
to the movie's villain, Farquaad, who sets

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.530
the movie in motion because he needs a princess
to marry, so he can become king.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.410
He chooses Fiona over Snow White, but Cinderella
is also offered up as a candidate... which

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.710
doesn't make much sense, since she married
a prince, she wasn't close to a princess before.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.330
Frozen
As much as we'd like to believe that the famous

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.690
"Let it Go" musical number is perfect, one
of the strangest, most debated mistakes can

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:49.930
be found in the scene.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.710
Watch as Elsa pulls her braided hair from
behind her shoulder to the front - until it

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.500
magically travels through her shoulder, already
in front ahead of time.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.360
Don't be surprised if you don't catch it the
first time, but trust us, it doesn't add up.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.199
Toy Story
It may be Pixar's first movie mistake, and

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:08.260
it's impossible to miss for any parent who's
used a baby monitor to keep a close ear on

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.260
a sleeping baby.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.271
When the army men first set out to see what
new toys Andy's gotten for his birthday, they're

00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:16.389
carrying the handheld unit - which only plays
audio.

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:21.100
They use the monitor as a walkie-talkie, and
Woody's base unit should let him send messages,

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.120
but the actual device wouldn't make much sense
if it send sound both ways.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.590
Tangled
W/hen your lead character has hair longer

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.560
than &nbsp;a football field, some mistakes are
to be expected.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.830
But it's obvious the animators wasted no time
in deciding what they could and couldn't actually

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.840
show: the second Rapunzel leaves her tower,
her hair ceases to exist.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.160
It's understandable, but still a shame since
it's impossible to miss on repeat viewings.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.070
Those are the animated movie mistakes we love
to watch out for, but what are yours?
