We're at Michael's, in Phoenix
Arizona

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:09.042
with talented comedian Bryan
Ricci, Terrence DeLane,

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:11.110
Jill Kimmel, James McCowen.

00:00:11.143 --> 00:00:12.045
JayMac is what they call you.

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:13.346
Yes, sir.

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:14.480
In Phoenix, is
there a comedy scene?

00:00:14.513 --> 00:00:16.349
Do you guys think there's a--
- Big scene.

00:00:16.382 --> 00:00:17.483
Yeah.
- --a big comedy scene here?

00:00:17.516 --> 00:00:18.618
- Underrated for sure.
- Really?

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:19.585
Yes.

00:00:19.618 --> 00:00:20.953
Got a lot of
great clubs in town.

00:00:20.986 --> 00:00:21.988
What about rooms as well?

00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:23.456
Are people doing the
whole room thing?

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:24.057
Yeah, I have an open mic
I've been running for--

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.292
Ever.

00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:27.627
--six and a half years,
every Tuesday night.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.262
Like, at a restaurant,
a Mexican restaurant.

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:31.230
It's a crummy
joint, nobody comes.

00:00:31.263 --> 00:00:33.266
But the comics come, and
they run their material,

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:34.767
and you do what you got to do.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.935
That's good.

00:00:35.968 --> 00:00:37.703
One thing I will say
about Phoenix is it makes

00:00:37.736 --> 00:00:40.940
you well-rounded as a comedian,
because there's not urban

00:00:40.973 --> 00:00:42.542
rooms.

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:45.344
There's no room that you can go
to to just work an urban set.

00:00:45.377 --> 00:00:46.212
So you have to kind of,
you know, stick and move--

00:00:46.245 --> 00:00:48.114
KEVIN: Some of everybody here.

00:00:48.147 --> 00:00:49.615
--and be diverse.
Absolutely.

00:00:49.648 --> 00:00:50.550
- That's a good thing.
- Yeah, for sure, for sure.

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:51.584
So how many years you got in?

00:00:51.617 --> 00:00:52.785
I've been doing it 16 years.

00:00:52.818 --> 00:00:54.187
16.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.421
And when you're doing it long
like that, you get people--

00:00:55.454 --> 00:00:57.090
I get people asking
me, they haven't

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:57.990
seen me in a little bit.

00:00:58.023 --> 00:00:59.692
OK.

00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:01.294
Be like, hey, Bryan, you
still doing that comedy thing?

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:02.829
- Right.
- You mean my life?

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:03.896
Like, you don't--

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:04.730
You still following
that dream, Bryan?

00:01:04.763 --> 00:01:06.365
- Yeah!
- What about you?

00:01:06.398 --> 00:01:07.533
I've been doing it
little bit over four years.

00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:08.568
OK.

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:09.535
I wanted to be a
gangsta rapper first.

00:01:09.568 --> 00:01:10.837
I wanted to be a rapper first.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.438
My boy just signed me up
for an open mic one night.

00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:13.773
I thought I was
going to do a song.

00:01:13.806 --> 00:01:14.507
He was like--

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.008
That's an amazing segue.

00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:17.376
That's an amazing segue.

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:18.644
I was gonna be a gangsta
rapper, that's what it was.

00:01:18.677 --> 00:01:21.180
And I got on stage and I
was like, I'm funny as shit.

00:01:21.213 --> 00:01:23.516
[all laughing]

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.884
Jimmy Kimmel is your brother.

00:01:24.917 --> 00:01:27.053
And how is that for you
doing stand-up comedy?

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:28.588
Is that a clutch?

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:30.289
You know, I started doing
comedy, I was married,

00:01:30.322 --> 00:01:31.858
so I had a different last name.

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:34.026
No one except comics knew
that I was related to him.

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:37.029
I get on stage, none of
my material is about him.

00:01:37.062 --> 00:01:39.098
It's great to look at him and
see what he's accomplished.

00:01:39.131 --> 00:01:41.200
I'm very proud of him.

00:01:41.233 --> 00:01:44.070
But as far stand-up
goes, that's all me.

00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:45.171
You got to do it yourself.

00:01:45.204 --> 00:01:46.105
"Hart of the City."

00:01:46.138 --> 00:01:47.607
Big moment for you guys.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.374
What do you want
from this moment?

00:01:48.407 --> 00:01:50.643
I want to get bookings.

00:01:50.676 --> 00:01:53.146
I want to possibly become
your stunt double in movies.

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:54.680
[all laughing]

00:01:54.713 --> 00:01:56.048
You got a bunch of movies
every month, you know?

00:01:56.081 --> 00:01:57.650
I've been working out lately,
you know what I'm saying?

00:01:57.683 --> 00:01:59.218
Stunt double, you
don't want that process.

00:01:59.251 --> 00:02:01.053
I done seen that move before.

00:02:01.086 --> 00:02:02.155
These guys get fucked up.

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:03.923
The shit they do to
me in these movies.

00:02:03.956 --> 00:02:05.224
All right, this is where Kev
gets thrown through the glass.

00:02:05.257 --> 00:02:05.892
You ready, Jay?

00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:07.860
[heavy sigh]

00:02:07.893 --> 00:02:08.893
[laughing]
