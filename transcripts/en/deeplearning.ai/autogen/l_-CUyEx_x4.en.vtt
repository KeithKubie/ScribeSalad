speech systems had this notion of a

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590
speech systems had this notion of a
 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.799

obvious that you want to force your
 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.960

and if you let your learning algorithm

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490
and if you let your learning algorithm
 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.760
and if you let your learning algorithm
learn whatever representation they want

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770
learn whatever representation they want
 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.380
learn whatever representation they want
to learn rather than forcing your

to learn rather than forcing your
 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.569

learning algorithm to use phonemes as a
 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.520
learning algorithm to use phonemes as a
representation then there's overall

the second benefit that entering deep

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390
the second benefit that entering deep
 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.090
the second benefit that entering deep
learning is that there's less hand

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100
learning is that there's less hand
 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.999
learning is that there's less hand
designing of components needed and so

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009
designing of components needed and so
 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.130
designing of components needed and so
this could also simplify your design

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140
this could also simplify your design
 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.870
this could also simplify your design
workflow that you just don't need to

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880
workflow that you just don't need to
 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.850
workflow that you just don't need to
spend a long time hand designing

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860
spend a long time hand designing
 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.620
spend a long time hand designing
features and designing these

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630
features and designing these
 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.440
features and designing these
intermediate representations how about

so to learn this x2y mapping directly

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969
so to learn this x2y mapping directly
 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.929
so to learn this x2y mapping directly
you might need a lot of data of X comma

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939
you might need a lot of data of X comma
 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.120
you might need a lot of data of X comma
Y and we've seen in a previous video

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130

some examples of where you could obtain

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560
some examples of where you could obtain
 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.980
some examples of where you could obtain
a lot of data for sub toss um

a lot of data for sub toss um
 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.440
a lot of data for sub toss um
for face recognition we could find the

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450
for face recognition we could find the
 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.990
for face recognition we could find the
raw data for finding a face in the image

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000
raw data for finding a face in the image
 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.570
raw data for finding a face in the image
as well as identifying the face once you

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580
as well as identifying the face once you
 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.340
as well as identifying the face once you
found the face but there was just less

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350
found the face but there was just less
 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.950
found the face but there was just less
data available for the entire end-to-end

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960
data available for the entire end-to-end
 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.760

task so you know x2 Suspiria input end

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770
task so you know x2 Suspiria input end
 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.400
task so you know x2 Suspiria input end
of the end and learning and Y is the

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410
of the end and learning and Y is the
 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.110
of the end and learning and Y is the
output and and so you need a lot of data

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120
output and and so you need a lot of data
 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.780
output and and so you need a lot of data
X Y with both the input and any output

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790
X Y with both the input and any output
 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.880

and in order to train some of these

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890
and in order to train some of these
 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.980
and in order to train some of these
systems and this is why the content and

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990
systems and this is why the content and
 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.740
systems and this is why the content and
learning part as well because you're

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750
learning part as well because you're
 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.110
learning part as well because you're
learning a direct mapping from one end

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120
learning a direct mapping from one end
 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.870
learning a direct mapping from one end
of the system you know all the way to

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880
of the system you know all the way to
 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.900
of the system you know all the way to
the other end of the system the other

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910
the other end of the system the other
 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.240
the other end of the system the other
disadvantage is that it excludes

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250
disadvantage is that it excludes
 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.290
disadvantage is that it excludes
potentially useful and design components

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300
potentially useful and design components
 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.900
potentially useful and design components
so machine learning researchers tend to

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910
so machine learning researchers tend to
 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.000
so machine learning researchers tend to
speak disparagingly of hand designing

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010
speak disparagingly of hand designing
 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.920
speak disparagingly of hand designing
things but if you don't have a lot of

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930
things but if you don't have a lot of
 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.890
things but if you don't have a lot of
data then your learning algorithm

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900
data then your learning algorithm
 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.960
data then your learning algorithm
doesn't have damage insight you can gain

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970
doesn't have damage insight you can gain
 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.760
doesn't have damage insight you can gain
from your data if your training set too

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770
from your data if your training set too
 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.430
from your data if your training set too
small and so hand designing component

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440
small and so hand designing component
 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.830
small and so hand designing component
can really be a way for you to inject

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840
can really be a way for you to inject
 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.950
can really be a way for you to inject
nan your knowledge into the algorithm

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:19.960
nan your knowledge into the algorithm
 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.460
nan your knowledge into the algorithm
and that's not always a bad thing I

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470
and that's not always a bad thing I
 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.170
and that's not always a bad thing I
think of a learning algorithm as having

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180
think of a learning algorithm as having
 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.110
think of a learning algorithm as having
two main sources of knowledge one is the

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120
two main sources of knowledge one is the
 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.170
two main sources of knowledge one is the
data and the other is whatever your hand

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180
data and the other is whatever your hand
 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.070
data and the other is whatever your hand
design being components or features or

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080
design being components or features or
 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.440
design being components or features or
other things and so when you have a ton

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450
other things and so when you have a ton
 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:39.160
other things and so when you have a ton
of data

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170
of data
 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.500
of data
it's less important to hand design

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510
it's less important to hand design
 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.690
it's less important to hand design
things but when you don't have much data

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700
things but when you don't have much data
 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.450
things but when you don't have much data
then having a carefully hand design

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460
then having a carefully hand design
 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.430
