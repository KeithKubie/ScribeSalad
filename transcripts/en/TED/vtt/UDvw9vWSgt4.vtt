00:00:13.614 --> 00:00:15.516
Representation matters.

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:19.917
Authentic representations of women matter.

00:00:21.404 --> 00:00:25.222
I think that too often,
our public representations of women

00:00:25.246 --> 00:00:27.627
are enveloped in the language
of the extraordinary.

00:00:29.441 --> 00:00:32.301
The first American woman
to become a self-made millionaire:

00:00:32.325 --> 00:00:33.570
Madam C. J. Walker ...

00:00:34.794 --> 00:00:37.476
The dresses of the first ladies
of the United States ...

00:00:39.086 --> 00:00:42.030
Shirley Chisholm, the first woman to seek

00:00:42.054 --> 00:00:44.520
the US Democratic party's
presidential nomination --

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:46.463
(Applause)

00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:48.852
As a museum curator,

00:00:48.876 --> 00:00:51.292
I understand why these stories
are so seductive.

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:55.411
Exceptional women
are inspiring and aspirational.

00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:58.704
But those stories are limiting.

00:00:59.365 --> 00:01:02.578
By definition, being extraordinary
is nonrepresentative.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.260
It's atypical.

00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:08.773
Those stories do not create a broad base
for incorporating women's history,

00:01:08.797 --> 00:01:10.857
and they don't reflect
our daily realities.

00:01:12.276 --> 00:01:15.720
If we can collectively apply
that radical notion

00:01:15.744 --> 00:01:17.607
that women are people,

00:01:17.631 --> 00:01:19.981
it becomes easier to show
women as people are:

00:01:21.025 --> 00:01:25.217
familiar, diverse, present.

00:01:25.241 --> 00:01:27.852
In everyone's everyday throughout history,

00:01:28.923 --> 00:01:31.962
women exist positively --

00:01:31.986 --> 00:01:34.905
not as a matter of interpretation,
but as a matter of fact.

00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:39.620
And beyond a more accurate
representation of human life,

00:01:39.644 --> 00:01:42.426
including women considers
the quotidian experiences

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.545
of the almost 3.8 billion people
identified as female on this planet.

00:01:48.827 --> 00:01:52.763
In this now notorious museum scene
from the "Black Panther" movie,

00:01:52.787 --> 00:01:56.067
a white curator erroneously
explains an artifact

00:01:56.091 --> 00:01:58.225
to Michael B. Jordan's
character seen here,

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:59.911
an artifact from his own culture.

00:02:01.042 --> 00:02:04.797
This fictional scene caused
real debates in our museum communities

00:02:04.821 --> 00:02:09.344
about who is shaping the narratives
and the bias that those narratives hold.

00:02:11.461 --> 00:02:12.742
Museums are actually rated

00:02:12.766 --> 00:02:16.854
one of the most trustworthy sources
of information in the United States,

00:02:16.878 --> 00:02:20.269
and with hundreds of millions of visitors
from all over the world,

00:02:20.293 --> 00:02:22.845
we should tell accurate histories,

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:24.020
but we don't.

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.251
There is a movement
from within museums themselves

00:02:28.275 --> 00:02:29.855
to help combat this bias.

00:02:30.472 --> 00:02:34.176
The simple acknowledgment
that museums are not neutral.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.816
Museums are didactic.

00:02:37.146 --> 00:02:39.535
Through the display of art and artifacts,

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:42.843
we can incite creativity
and foster inclusion,

00:02:42.867 --> 00:02:45.705
but we are guilty
of historical misrepresentation.

00:02:46.418 --> 00:02:50.443
Our male-centered histories
have left our herstories hidden.

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:57.153
And there are hard truths
about being a woman,

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:59.461
especially a woman of color
in this industry,

00:02:59.485 --> 00:03:03.260
that prevents us from centering
inclusive examples of women's lives.

00:03:04.572 --> 00:03:06.446
Museum leadership:

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.786
predominantly white and male,

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.899
despite women comprising
some 60 percent of museum staffs.

00:03:13.472 --> 00:03:15.694
Pipelines to leadership
for women are bleak --

00:03:15.718 --> 00:03:17.712
bleakest for women of color.

00:03:18.721 --> 00:03:21.752
And the presence of women
does not in and of itself guarantee

00:03:21.776 --> 00:03:24.019
an increase in women's
public representation.

00:03:24.905 --> 00:03:26.873
Not all women are gender equity allies.

00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:30.503
In the words of feminist
theorist bell hooks,

00:03:30.527 --> 00:03:32.216
"Patriarchy has no gender."

00:03:32.968 --> 00:03:35.212
Women can support the system of patriarchy

00:03:35.236 --> 00:03:37.943
just as men can support
the fight for gender equity.

00:03:39.284 --> 00:03:42.360
And we often downplay
the importance of intersectionality.

00:03:43.694 --> 00:03:48.852
Marian Anderson was one of the most
celebrated voices of the 20th century,

00:03:48.876 --> 00:03:51.576
and the Smithsonian
collected her 1939 outfit.

00:03:52.186 --> 00:03:55.472
After the white Daughters of
the American Revolution denied her access

00:03:55.496 --> 00:03:57.971
to sing in Constitution Hall,
because she was black,

00:03:58.966 --> 00:04:02.267
she famously sang instead
on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial,

00:04:02.291 --> 00:04:05.013
to a crowd of over 75,000 people.

00:04:07.531 --> 00:04:10.421
And in libraries all over,
including museums,

00:04:10.445 --> 00:04:14.470
you can still find the groundbreaking
1982 anthology, entitled

00:04:14.494 --> 00:04:16.579
"All the Women Are White,

00:04:16.603 --> 00:04:18.592
All the Blacks Are Men,

00:04:18.616 --> 00:04:20.327
But Some of Us Are Brave."

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.545
Demands for the increase
of women's representation

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:28.398
does not automatically include
Afro-Latinas like me ...

00:04:28.422 --> 00:04:31.944
or immigrant women,
or Asian women, or Native women,

00:04:31.968 --> 00:04:34.189
or trans women, or undocumented women,

00:04:34.213 --> 00:04:36.612
or women over 65, or girls --

00:04:36.636 --> 00:04:38.975
the list can go on and on and on.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.367
So what do we do?

00:04:43.307 --> 00:04:46.340
Targeted initiatives
have helped incorporate perspectives

00:04:46.364 --> 00:04:48.189
that should have always been included.

00:04:48.547 --> 00:04:52.202
I arrived at the Smithsonian
through a Latino curatorial initiative

00:04:52.226 --> 00:04:54.135
whose hiring of Latinx curators,

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:56.344
mostly women, by the way,

00:04:56.368 --> 00:05:00.378
has raised the profile for Latinx
narratives across our institution.

00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:02.440
And it served as a model

00:05:02.464 --> 00:05:06.727
for our much larger Smithsonian
American Women's History Initiative,

00:05:06.751 --> 00:05:10.139
which seeks to amplify diverse
representations of women

00:05:10.163 --> 00:05:12.473
in every possible way,

00:05:12.497 --> 00:05:13.739
so that women show up,

00:05:13.763 --> 00:05:16.903
not only in the imagery
of our contemporary realities,

00:05:16.927 --> 00:05:19.328
but in our historical representations,

00:05:19.352 --> 00:05:21.096
because we've always been here.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.465
Right now though, in 2018,
I can still walk into professional spaces

00:05:27.489 --> 00:05:29.310
and be the only --

00:05:29.334 --> 00:05:31.609
the only person under 40,
the only black person,

00:05:31.633 --> 00:05:33.443
the only black woman, the only Latina,

00:05:33.467 --> 00:05:34.706
sometimes, the only woman.

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:39.308
My mother is African-American
and my father is Afro-Panamanian.

00:05:40.023 --> 00:05:42.542
I am so proudly and inextricably both.

00:05:43.346 --> 00:05:45.407
As an Afro-Latina, I'm one of millions.

00:05:46.704 --> 00:05:50.249
As an Afro-Latina curator,
I'm one of very few.

00:05:51.344 --> 00:05:53.980
And bringing my whole self
into the professional realm

00:05:54.004 --> 00:05:56.488
can feel like an act of bravery,

00:05:56.512 --> 00:05:59.609
and I'll admit to you that I was
not always up for that challenge,

00:05:59.633 --> 00:06:02.829
whether from fear of rejection
or self-preservation.

00:06:04.615 --> 00:06:06.259
In meetings, I would only speak up

00:06:06.283 --> 00:06:08.873
when I had a fully developed
comment to share.

00:06:09.197 --> 00:06:11.950
No audible brainstorming
or riffing off of colleagues.

00:06:12.906 --> 00:06:14.057
For a long time,

00:06:14.081 --> 00:06:17.853
I denied myself the joy of wearing
my beloved hoop earrings

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:19.387
or nameplate necklace to work,

00:06:19.411 --> 00:06:23.072
thinking that they were too loud
or unscholarly or unprofessional.

00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:25.197
(Laughter)

00:06:25.221 --> 00:06:28.542
I wondered how people
would react to my natural hair,

00:06:28.566 --> 00:06:33.398
or if they viewed me as more acceptable
or less authentic when I straightened it.

00:06:34.008 --> 00:06:36.911
And anyone who has felt outside
of mainstream representations

00:06:36.935 --> 00:06:41.058
understands that there are basic elements
just of our everyday being

00:06:41.082 --> 00:06:43.063
that can make other people uncomfortable.

00:06:44.692 --> 00:06:46.382
But because I am passionate

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:49.874
about the everyday representation
of women as we are,

00:06:49.898 --> 00:06:54.787
I stopped presenting an inauthentic
representation of myself or my work.

00:06:55.694 --> 00:06:57.078
And I have been tested.

00:06:57.822 --> 00:07:00.358
This is me pointing
at my hoop earring in my office --

00:07:00.382 --> 00:07:01.477
(Laughter)

00:07:01.501 --> 00:07:04.921
Just last month, I was invited to keynote
a Latino Heritage Month event.

00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:09.161
The week of the presentation,
the organization expressed concerns.

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:12.472
They called my slides "activist,"

00:07:12.496 --> 00:07:14.075
and they meant that negatively.

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:17.779
(Laughter)

00:07:17.803 --> 00:07:22.485
(Applause)

00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:24.123
Two days before the presentation,

00:07:24.147 --> 00:07:28.807
they requested that I not show
a two-minute video affirming natural hair,

00:07:28.831 --> 00:07:31.594
because "it may create a barrier
to the learning process

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:33.418
for some of the participants."

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:34.857
(Laughter)

00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:39.667
That poem, "Hair," was written
and performed by Elizabeth Acevedo,

00:07:39.691 --> 00:07:43.388
a Dominican-American
2018 National Book Award winner,

00:07:43.412 --> 00:07:46.755
and it appeared in an award-winning
Smithsonian exhibit that I curated.

00:07:47.601 --> 00:07:48.943
I canceled the talk,

00:07:48.967 --> 00:07:54.086
explaining to them that their censorship
of me and my work made me uncomfortable.

00:07:54.110 --> 00:08:01.110
(Applause and cheers)

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:07.339
Respectability politics
and idealized femininity

00:08:07.363 --> 00:08:09.264
influence how we display women

00:08:09.288 --> 00:08:11.380
and which women we choose to display.

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:15.916
And that display has skewed
toward successful and extraordinary

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.640
and reputable and desirable,

00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:20.878
which maintains the systemic exclusion

00:08:20.902 --> 00:08:25.403
and marginalization of the everyday,
the regular, the underrepresented

00:08:25.427 --> 00:08:26.918
and usually, the nonwhite.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.739
As a museum curator, I am empowered
to change that narrative.

00:08:31.632 --> 00:08:35.155
I research, collect and interpret
objects and images of significance.

00:08:36.114 --> 00:08:38.000
Celia Cruz, the queen of Salsa --

00:08:38.024 --> 00:08:39.025
(Cheers)

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:40.875
yes -- is significant.

00:08:40.899 --> 00:08:42.519
And an Afro-Latina.

00:08:42.857 --> 00:08:46.560
The Smithsonian has collected
her costumes, her shoes,

00:08:46.584 --> 00:08:49.321
her portrait, her postage stamp

00:08:49.345 --> 00:08:50.670
and this reimagining ...

00:08:51.926 --> 00:08:53.615
by artist Tony Peralta.

00:08:54.023 --> 00:08:56.244
When I collected and displayed this work,

00:08:56.268 --> 00:08:58.745
it was a victory
for symbolic contradictions.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:02.160
Pride in displaying a dark-skinned Latina,

00:09:02.184 --> 00:09:03.691
a black woman,

00:09:03.715 --> 00:09:06.431
whose hair is in large rollers
which straighten your hair,

00:09:06.455 --> 00:09:08.621
perhaps a nod to white beauty standards.

00:09:08.645 --> 00:09:12.541
A refined, glamorous woman
in oversized, chunky gold jewelry.

00:09:13.728 --> 00:09:15.022
When this work was on view,

00:09:15.046 --> 00:09:17.047
it was one of our most
Instagrammed pieces,

00:09:17.071 --> 00:09:20.075
and visitors told me they connected
with the everyday elements

00:09:20.099 --> 00:09:22.927
of her brown skin or her rollers
or her jewelry.

00:09:24.227 --> 00:09:26.258
Our collections include Celia Cruz

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.772
and a rare portrait
of a young Harriet Tubman ...

00:09:31.981 --> 00:09:34.690
iconic clothing from
the incomparable Oprah Winfrey.

00:09:36.654 --> 00:09:38.372
But museums can literally change

00:09:38.396 --> 00:09:41.449
how hundreds of millions
of people see women

00:09:41.473 --> 00:09:42.804
and which women they see.

00:09:43.454 --> 00:09:47.094
So rather than always
the first or the famous,

00:09:47.118 --> 00:09:51.407
it's also our responsibility to show
a regular Saturday at the beauty salon,

00:09:52.575 --> 00:09:54.559
the art of door-knocker earrings ...

00:09:54.583 --> 00:09:56.014
(Laughter)

00:09:56.038 --> 00:09:57.695
fashionable sisterhood ...

00:09:57.719 --> 00:09:58.720
(Laughter)

00:09:58.744 --> 00:10:00.714
and cultural pride at all ages.

00:10:01.196 --> 00:10:02.905
Stories of everyday women

00:10:02.929 --> 00:10:06.836
whose stories have been knowingly omitted
from our national and global histories.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.663
And oftentimes in museums,
you see women represented by clothing

00:10:10.687 --> 00:10:12.786
or portraits or photography ...

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:18.028
but impactful, life-changing stories
from everyday women

00:10:18.052 --> 00:10:20.427
can also look like
this Esmeraldan boat seat.

00:10:21.764 --> 00:10:24.187
Esmeraldas, Ecuador
was a maroon community.

00:10:24.523 --> 00:10:28.226
Its dense rainforest protected
indigenous and African populations

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:29.783
from Spanish colonizers.

00:10:30.282 --> 00:10:31.432
There are roads now,

00:10:31.456 --> 00:10:34.957
but there are some parts inland
that are still only accessible by canoe.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.131
Débora Nazareno frequently traveled
those Ecuadorian waterways by canoe,

00:10:39.155 --> 00:10:40.695
so she had her own boat seat.

00:10:41.279 --> 00:10:44.372
Hers personalized
with a spiderweb and a spider,

00:10:44.396 --> 00:10:47.437
representing Anansi,
a character in West African folklore.

00:10:48.874 --> 00:10:52.906
Débora also sat on this seat at home,
telling stories to her grandson, Juan.

00:10:53.972 --> 00:10:56.140
And this intangible ritual of love

00:10:56.164 --> 00:10:58.568
in the form of
intergenerational storytelling

00:10:58.592 --> 00:11:01.499
is common in communities
across the African diaspora.

00:11:02.378 --> 00:11:06.303
And this everyday act sparked in Juan
the desire to collect and preserve

00:11:06.327 --> 00:11:10.182
over 50,000 documents related
to Afro-Indian culture.

00:11:11.566 --> 00:11:15.495
In 2005, Juan García Salazar,
Débora's grandson,

00:11:15.519 --> 00:11:19.009
and by now a world-renowned
Afro-Ecuadorian scholar,

00:11:19.033 --> 00:11:20.719
traveled to Washington, D.C.

00:11:21.621 --> 00:11:24.907
He met with Lonnie Bunch,
the director of the museum where I work,

00:11:24.931 --> 00:11:27.038
and toward the end of their conversation,

00:11:27.062 --> 00:11:30.872
Juan reached into his bag and said,
"I'd like to give you a present."

00:11:32.558 --> 00:11:36.247
On that day, Débora Nazareno's
humble wooden boat seat

00:11:36.271 --> 00:11:38.465
became the very first object donated

00:11:38.489 --> 00:11:42.037
to the Smithsonian National Museum
of African-American History and Culture.

00:11:42.865 --> 00:11:48.084
It is encased, displayed and has been seen
by almost five million visitors

00:11:48.108 --> 00:11:49.518
from all over the world.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.832
I will continue to collect
from extraordinary historymakers.

00:11:54.224 --> 00:11:55.747
Their stories are important.

00:11:56.607 --> 00:12:00.539
But what drives me to show up
today and every day

00:12:00.563 --> 00:12:04.192
is the simple passion to write
our names in history,

00:12:04.216 --> 00:12:07.332
display them publicly for millions to see

00:12:07.356 --> 00:12:10.406
and walk in the ever-present
light that is woman.

00:12:10.961 --> 00:12:12.112
Thank you.

00:12:12.136 --> 00:12:18.325
(Applause and cheers)
