00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.650
 

00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.260
Before we go into the actual
conflict of the Korean War,

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.830
let's try to get a sense of the
historical environment going

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.180
into the Korean War.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.650
So if you go all the way
back to the late 1800s,

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.750
early 1900s, the
Korean peninsula--

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.930
what we now consider both
North and South Korea-- they

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.740
were occupied by the
Japanese military.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.060
And then in 1910,
the Korean peninsula

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.500
is formally annexed into
the Japanese empire.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.790
So the Japanese are
essentially this colonial,

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.670
this imperialist power here.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.040
And they stay in power in the
Korean peninsula all the way

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.670
until the end of World War II.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.300
And it's probably
worth saying here--

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.716
and it's probably worth making
and doing a bunch of videos

00:00:42.716 --> 00:00:45.370
here-- that the Japanese
occupation was not

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.030
a pleasant occupation
for the Korean people.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.240
They subjugated the Korean
people in multiple ways.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.950
Forced labor,
forced prostitution.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.852
They tried to eradicate
the Korean language

00:00:57.852 --> 00:00:58.810
and the Korean culture.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.850
So this was not in any
way a pleasant occupation.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.820
They weren't pleasant
imperialists.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.720
But you fast forward
all the way to 1945,

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.340
we know that Japan
loses World War II.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.040
And the major two victors
on the Allied side,

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.380
that are kind of acting
in this part of the world,

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.640
are the United States
and the Soviet Union.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.270
And so in 1945, you have the
Soviets coming from above.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.920
 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.910
That's the Soviets,
coming from above.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.740
And eventually, you have the
Americans coming from below.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.360
They occupy Japan first.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.270
So this is the USA.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.300
And they essentially,
remember at this point,

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.220
even though this is kind of
the beginning of the Cold War,

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.230
at this point in World
War II, the United States

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.072
and the Soviet Union are allies.

00:01:44.072 --> 00:01:46.030
And so United States
tells us the Soviet Union,

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.300
hey, why don't we just
stop at the 38th parallel?

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.237
 

00:01:51.237 --> 00:01:52.820
The United States
actually didn't even

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.810
think that the Soviets
would stop there,

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:55.860
but they actually did.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.080
And from the Soviet's
point of view,

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.290
it's believed that
they stopped there,

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.230
because the United States didn't
get there at the same time.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.820
So there was no one to stop
them from going further South.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.570
But it's believed that
the Soviets wanted

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.730
to uphold their side
of the agreement

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.949
so that they would be a
trusted party to negotiations

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.420
in Europe, and maybe get
more in Europe, which

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.530
is what the Soviets
maybe cared about more.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.950
So what happens
after World War II

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.510
is that the North, what is
now North Korea essentially,

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.920
becomes under the
influence of the Soviets.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.690
Everything below
the 38th parallel

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.150
becomes under the influence
of the United States.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.730
The Soviets essentially install
this gentleman right over here

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.080
to lead North Korea-- Kim Il
Sung-- or the part of Korea

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.600
that is north of
the 38th parallel.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.100
At this point, this
was just kind of

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.250
viewed as a point where the
Soviets and the United States

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.040
should meet up.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.290
Where they would have to stop.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.859
It wasn't meant to be an actual
partition of the country.

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:49.400
But as we'll see,
it actually becomes

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.250
a partition of the country.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.180
But the Soviets
install Kim Il Sung.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.765
He sets up a
communist, essentially

00:02:54.765 --> 00:02:57.540
a communist dictatorship
in the North.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.410
And this is the current
leader of North Korea's dad.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.430
This is Kim Jong Il's dad.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.120
So he gets installed
in the North.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.360
And in the South, if you fast
forward a little bit to 1948,

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.090
there's an attempt at elections.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.940
But those elections
are seriously rigged.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.510
And this gentleman, Syngman
Rhee, comes to power.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.180
And although he might look
like a nice, pleasant man,

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.630
he was actually fairly ruthless.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.470
And he is unanimously
considered a strong man.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.540
And on both sides--
and so once again,

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.670
this is one of those
situations where you really

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.025
can't call either of these guys
good guys because both of them

00:03:32.025 --> 00:03:36.940
have done some pretty nasty,
nasty things to each other,

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.230
to soldiers on either side,
and to innocent civilians.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.520
But Syngman Rhee comes to power
in the south, and his, I guess,

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.120
most attractive feature
to the Americans

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.560
is that he is not a communist.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.440
And so you have this
situation setting up

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.970
communist North
above 38th parallel.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.460
Non-communist South,
controlled by Syngman Rhee,

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.330
supported by the United States.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.530
The other thing that
happens is that the Soviets

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.900
help build up the
North Korean military.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.190
The United States is
not as encouraging

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.820
of a strong South
Korean military.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.160
So you start having an
imbalance between the military

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.750
of the North and the South.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.980
And obviously, either one of
these parties, Kim Il Sung

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.380
wants to unite Korea under his
rule, under his communist rule.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.570
Syngman Rhee wants
to unite Korea

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.880
under his authoritarian rule.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.810
So they're both setting up
the troops along the border.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.870
And this whole time you
have skirmishes going on

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:36.620
across the border.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.161
And just to give you a context,
you're probably saying, wait,

00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:40.570
Korea is right next to China.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.160
What was going on there?

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.140
And if you go to China, in 1949,
the Communists come to power.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.950
There was a civil war
leading up to that

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.790
between the Communists
led by Mao Zedong,

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.750
and the Nationalists
led by Chiang Kai-shek.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.750
Mao Zedong comes to power.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.940
He wants to support the
communists in North Korea,

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.580
especially because some of
those communists in North Korea

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.380
actually helped fight
on the communist side

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.080
during the Chinese Civil War.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.830
So this is an important
factor right here.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.740
Mao Zedong is interested
in spreading Communism.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.270
He doesn't like the
Americans in South Korea,

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.140
and he feels some
type of allegiance

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.590
to the communists
in North Korea.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.590
So now you fast forward
to June 25, 1950.

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.470
And in the North, you
have a major event.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.290
The North Korean
army-- and it's not

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.270
called North Korea at this
point-- they both consider

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.300
themselves Korea, competing,
I guess, governments of Korea.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.170
The army in the North
is disproportionately

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.980
stronger than the South,
and so they invade.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.810
They view this as their chance
at unifying the peninsula.

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.750
And essentially, they're
able to almost just storm

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.870
through the Korean peninsula.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.375
Immediately, when that
happens, the UN, and especially

00:05:58.375 --> 00:06:01.210
the United States-- and this
is because at this point,

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.670
the Soviet Union was boycotting
the Security Council,

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.300
so they couldn't even veto
it-- the UN immediately

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.350
starts supplying naval and air
support for the South Koreans.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.550
But the disparity is so
big that the North Koreans

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.720
are able to just keep
marching forward.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.550
Within a few days,
literally by July 1,

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.106
the United States decides
to commit ground forces,

00:06:24.106 --> 00:06:25.480
because we had
substantial ground

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.100
forces in Japan, which
isn't that far away.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.944
Just to give you a
global perspective,

00:06:29.944 --> 00:06:31.610
this is the Korean
peninsula right here.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:32.420
And this is Japan.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.920
I know I could have probably
found a bigger picture of that.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.410
But America had military forces
in Japan that they could send,

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:43.010
and so the Americans enter
the battle in a major way,

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:44.310
very early on.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.300
But that doesn't stop the
North Koreans for some time.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.096
So the North Koreans
get all the way,

00:06:49.096 --> 00:06:51.220
they're able to occupy all
of the Korean peninsula,

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.710
except for the
northeastern corner.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.990
So they get around this far.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.620
Over here, you have
the city of Pusan.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.245
And this is called
the Pusan Perimeter.

00:06:59.245 --> 00:07:02.890
 

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.390
And it's at the Pusan
Perimeter that you

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:09.560
have a little bit of a, the
United States and Korean forces

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.480
combined are able to
halt the North Koreans.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.280
And you have a slight stalemate
for a couple of months here.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.220
But while that
stalemate is happening,

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.540
the United States is able
to-- and especially the UN,

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.050
but it's mainly
the United States--

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:26.590
is able to build up significant
troops within the Pusan

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:27.090
Perimeter.

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:32.060
But even more, and at this
point, the United States

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:36.890
and the UN forces, go under the
control of Douglas MacArthur,

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.150
General Douglas
MacArthur, who's a bit

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.510
of an interesting character.

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:45.770
Until this point, he was able
to rule Japan with an iron fist.

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:49.170
He's a hugely popular
war hero in America,

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.870
and the current
president, Truman, kind of

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:54.954
has a little trouble controlling
MacArthur, especially

00:07:54.954 --> 00:07:55.870
during the Korean War.

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:59.110
And we'll see that MacArthur
really oversteps his bounds

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:02.530
during the course of this war.

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:05.860
Now, at this point, you have the
South Koreans and the Americans

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.010
kind of cornered down here
inside of the Pusan Perimeter.

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:11.490
It looks like North Korea's
on the verge of victory.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.110
But the US is able
to build forces.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:15.250
And the Korean War
really just starts

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:16.574
becoming into a game of Risk.

00:08:16.574 --> 00:08:18.740
I don't know if you've ever
played the game of Risk,

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.241
but whenever it's
somebody's turn,

00:08:20.241 --> 00:08:21.740
they're able to
spread their forces.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.900
But then they get spread thin,
and then the other side's

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:24.750
able to come back.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.749
And what we'll see is the
rest of the Korean War

00:08:26.749 --> 00:08:29.810
is essentially a back and
forth between the Communists

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.640
in the North-- supported
by the Chinese,

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.580
although the Chinese aren't in
the war officially just yet--

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.390
and then the Americans
in the South.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:39.802
And the first really smart
thing that MacArthur does

00:08:39.802 --> 00:08:41.260
is he says, look,
instead of trying

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.520
to fight our way through
the Korean forces

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:51.660
that are over here, why don't
we just kind of outflank them?

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.880
And why don't we
use our navy to do

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.650
an amphibious landing
of an army at Incheon?

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:01.630
So on September 15, while you
have the stalemate over here,

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:04.316
the United States, they
have an amphibious landing.

00:09:04.316 --> 00:09:06.190
So they send troops from
all of these places.

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:08.140
They have an amphibious
landing at Incheon,

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:10.600
which is near Seoul.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.400
So they land right
over, they land

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.530
at Incheon, which is
roughly over there.

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:17.075
I'm not super accurate here.

00:09:17.075 --> 00:09:18.450
And what's
interesting about that

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.660
is, in any battle, all of
these Korean troops right here,

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:22.690
they have supply chains.

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:25.460
They have to get food and
supplies and fresh troops

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:26.320
from up here.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.630
And so the further in you
go into enemy territory,

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:30.660
the more spread out
your troops get.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:33.780
And the strategy here is instead
of fighting through this,

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.180
what if we outflank them
and are able to land

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.800
a significant force right
here, and immediately

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.380
disrupt the supply lines
of the North Koreans.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.280
And that's essentially
what the Americans did.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.910
And it was successful.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:48.190
So MacArthur looks like
a genius over here,

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:50.640
and he's able to retake Seoul.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.620
He's able to take what's kind
of the North Korean capital

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.640
at this point,
Pyongyang, and you

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.115
have the Americans
marching north.

00:09:57.115 --> 00:09:59.490
So all of a sudden, it started
off with the North Koreans

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.080
being able to roll
down, and now all

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.480
of a sudden the Americans
and the South Koreans

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.720
are able to roll up.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.170
And they're feeling pretty
good about themselves.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:09.040
And the whole time,
Truman's trying

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.030
to keep MacArthur under check.

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:12.000
MacArthur is excited.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.320
He's ultra confident.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.230
He thinks that the troops are
going to be home by Christmas.

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:21.305
He doesn't think China is
serious about supporting

00:10:21.305 --> 00:10:23.919
the North Koreans, and even
more, he almost, it seems,

00:10:23.919 --> 00:10:25.460
like wants to pick
a fight with China

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:29.861
because he wants to maybe
eliminate communism in China

00:10:29.861 --> 00:10:30.360
as well.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.170
He viewed it as
he's on this mission

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:34.970
to eliminate communism
from all of Asia.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:37.460
So Truman is saying limited war.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:41.790
Don't cross the Yalu
River, and be careful.

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:45.030
Don't start attacking Chinese
up here and enrage them,

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:47.830
and you're going to
have them enter the war.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:50.520
MacArthur doesn't take
that too seriously.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.430
And he also says, look, I
have to start bombing bombs

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:55.630
across the Yalu River so
that the Chinese won't

00:10:55.630 --> 00:11:00.520
be able to send troops and
supplies to aid the North

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:01.270
Koreans.

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:03.060
So he's marching
up, all confident,

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.770
going up against the Yalu River.

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:10.720
And this whole time, the
Chinese, under Mao Zedong,

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.412
are sending a pretty
substantial army.

00:11:12.412 --> 00:11:13.870
And they're able
to do it secretly.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:15.950
They're able to march
at night, and they even

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:18.690
have these policies where if
any surveillance planes go

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:21.850
overhead, all of the Chinese
soldiers have to freeze.

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:23.489
And if they don't
freeze, someone else

00:11:23.489 --> 00:11:24.530
is allowed to shoot them.

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:26.738
So everyone wants to freeze
so that no one can really

00:11:26.738 --> 00:11:28.480
see them from above.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.990
So it's this really
secret buildup

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:34.310
of troops across the Yalu River,
and this whole time MacArthur

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:36.770
is just ultra, ultra
confident about what's

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:38.010
happening over here.

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:40.316
But then you fast forward
until the end of October,

00:11:40.316 --> 00:11:42.190
the Americans think that
they're on the verge

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:44.242
of winning the Korean War.

00:11:44.242 --> 00:11:45.950
And all of a sudden,
you have the Chinese

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:47.090
cross the Yalu River.

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:48.580
And the Americans
didn't even know

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:51.794
that the Chinese had major
forces ready to cross.

00:11:51.794 --> 00:11:53.710
And once again, it's
just like a game of Risk.

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:55.179
Now you have the Chinese cross.

00:11:55.179 --> 00:11:56.720
They catch the
Americans unsuspected.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.909
They engage a few times.

00:11:57.909 --> 00:12:00.200
The Americans weren't sure
if the Chinese were serious.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.380
So they keep re-engaging
them, but it becomes clear,

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.770
yes the Chinese are serious.

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:08.412
And essentially the Chinese
are able to push back

00:12:08.412 --> 00:12:10.370
the Americans and the
South Koreans all the way

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:13.420
back so that they are
able to recapture Seoul.

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.760
But once again, like
any game of Risk,

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.060
now the Chinese are spread thin.

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.070
The Americans and
the South Koreans,

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:22.830
and all the other UN forces--
although the UN forces are

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:27.950
mainly the Americans--
are able to regroup.

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:31.200
And then, in March-- so
Seoul has changed hands

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.080
four times-- so
in March, they're

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:37.170
able to retake Seoul again.

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:41.350
And at this point, MacArthur
is ultra confident.

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.970
He's telling the Chinese,
you've essentially lost.

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:45.500
He's even trying
to get permissions

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:48.099
to use nuclear weapons
against the Chinese.

00:12:48.099 --> 00:12:49.640
To some degree, he
doesn't even think

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:52.650
he needs the permission
of Truman to stop.

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:56.310
It sounds like he's eager to
push the Chinese further back,

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:59.550
even though they surprised
him the first go around.

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:02.350
So Truman has enough
of this wild card

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:04.480
guy, who thinks that
he can call the shots

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.770
and use nuclear weapons if
he wants to, willy nilly.

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:14.490
And so Truman finally dismisses
MacArthur in April of 1951.

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:16.370
And at this point,
you start having

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:20.550
a stalemate near
the 38th parallel.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.950
So that you start having a
stalemate across this border

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:23.924
right over there.

00:13:23.924 --> 00:13:26.090
And both sides think the
end of the war is imminent.

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:28.490
They're like, OK, we're
back to where we both began.

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:29.880
We should both stop here.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.600
But the negotiations,
unfortunately,

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.620
took over two years.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:35.180
And there was a lot
of back and forth

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:38.430
about what to do with prisoners
of war and all of the rest.

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:43.005
But it finally took two years
so that on July 27, 1953,

00:13:43.005 --> 00:13:46.680
you have an armistice signed
between the two parties.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.189
And I want to make it clear,
an armistice agreement,

00:13:50.189 --> 00:13:51.230
it is not a peace treaty.

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:53.250
It is not saying
that we both agree

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:56.225
that this is the border
of our two new countries

00:13:56.225 --> 00:13:58.100
and that we are now at
peace with each other.

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.630
All an armistice means is that
we're going to stop fighting.

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:03.900
It is not a formal
end to the war.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:08.880
So in theory, North and South
Korea, even to this day,

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.480
are in a state of war.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.639
And to this day, I'm
recording this video in 2011.

00:14:12.639 --> 00:14:14.180
Maybe if you view
this in the future,

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:16.030
hopefully they won't be in
an official state of war.

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:18.590
But they're in an official
state of war under an armistice.

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:22.060
They've just agreed
to stop fighting.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:25.620
So all in all, you have
this hugely bloody battle

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.660
with all of these atrocities
going on on both sides.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.270
Syngman Rhee when he was,
the first time when the North

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:34.680
Korean troops were rolling in
to South Korea, he essentially,

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.400
beforehand, he was
imprisoning a bunch

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.234
of people who he suspected
to be communists.

00:14:39.234 --> 00:14:40.691
We're not talking
about people, I'm

00:14:40.691 --> 00:14:42.750
talking about whole
families sometimes.

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:45.530
And when he was
retreating, he essentially

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:48.960
allowed the massacre of a huge
number of people who were just

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.740
suspected of being communists.

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:52.690
These weren't just military men.

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:53.580
These were women.

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:54.440
These were children.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.760
These were entire families,
so he is guilty of that.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:00.940
And Kim Il Sung just as guilty
when the North Korean soldiers

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.660
infiltrated South
Korea in Seoul,

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:07.720
they committed atrocities
killing civil servants,

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:11.920
killing any of the established
intellectuals in the area.

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.300
So on both sides.

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.884
This hugely horrific war.

00:15:14.884 --> 00:15:16.800
And just to get a sense
of what was happening.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.200
Korea isn't a huge
country, but you

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.010
have within Korea,
the civilian deaths,

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:25.910
1.5 to 3 million civilian
deaths and the consensus

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:26.810
is at 2 million.

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:29.110
And this tells you how ugly
war is that you can't even

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:33.840
estimate how many people died
to the nearest 500,000 people.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.390
You just don't
know what happened.

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:40.620
Two million people died in a
country that's not too big.

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:46.910
All in all, you have about
40,000 American soldiers dying.

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:49.640
China loses on the order of,
depending on the estimates,

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:50.667
400,000 soldiers.

00:15:50.667 --> 00:15:52.500
I mean the estimates
are all over the place.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:56.300
North Korea loses, on the order,
same magnitude of soldiers.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:01.020
South Korea loses several
hundred thousand soldiers.

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:04.130
So you have this hugely bloody
battle, this hugely bloody

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:07.470
war, I should say, that really
ends with an outcome that

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:10.610
wasn't so different
from where it started.
