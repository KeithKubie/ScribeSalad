00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:01.100
STEVE: Look at this.

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.230
Ooh.

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.830
STEVE: My grandfather
made that for my mother

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.170
to ride on the boardwalk
in Ocean City, Maryland.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.430
So he made this?

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:09.670
Yeah.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.770
MIKE (VOICEOVER): Bicycling
was a very social event

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:12.970
around the turn of the century.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:14.730
There were a lot
of bicycling clubs.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.900
There were a lot of
innovations in bicycles.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.770
And a tandem back then
was the woman in front

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.030
and the man in the back.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.370
And it's what they called
the "steer from the rear."

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.430
So the man was actually
steering the handlebars

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.100
for the woman in front.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.230
They're beautiful bikes.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.070
But the side-by-side
tandems are very rare.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.470
There was a company called
Wolfe American around the turn

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.330
of the century that
made a social tandem,

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.470
they call these, where you
can sit next to each other.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.330
I want to say that this was
probably made in the '30s.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.170
And he probably patterned it
after one of those others.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.230
MIKE: The Wolfe American
side-by-side tandem

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.970
that was made during
the turn of the century

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.330
is an expensive bike.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.000
It's a very collectible bike.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.500
This bike that I'm looking
at is not that bike.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.700
So the fork looks like
it's off an English bike.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.200
Well, I love how he
did the rear hub.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.470
Look at that hub, Frank.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.130
Maybe his grandfather did
this to promote the shop.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.770
I started working
for a bike shop,

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.370
and I was basically in the
warehouse assembling bikes.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.500
And then I finally
moved up to working

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.130
on the sales floor of the shop.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.870
And then I owned my own
shop for a number of years.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:11.670
Wow.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.900
It was really pretty cool.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.070
It was like too old bike
guys talking to each other.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.200
I had my own shop.
MIKE: --Your own boss.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.700
--for a while, too.
MIKE: Oh, you did?

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.800
I did.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.130
I went to school at
UVA in Charlottesville.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.630
And when I went down there,
there were no bicycle shops.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.330
MIKE: You had a shop while
you were going to school?

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.430
STEVE: I did.
MIKE: Wow.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.030
STEVE: I went part
time, which is why it

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.300
took me 10 years to graduate.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.630
[laughs]

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.370
I can talk about collecting
bikes to a number of people.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.970
But it's not often
I run into somebody

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.700
that I can talk to
about the bicycle

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.000
business, the ins and outs.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.370
That was exciting to me.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.570
So what are you going to do
with this or the girls' bike?

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.830
STEVE: We have to get
rid of what's here.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:48.770
MIKE: Mm-hm.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.830
STEVE: I don't
have space for it.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.570
I'm starting to see more
and more girl collectors.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:53.870
- Really?
- When I started dat--

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.170
- Of bikes?
- Yeah.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.130
When I started buying old
bikes 25, 30 years ago, man,

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.800
there was hardly
any girl collectors.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.070
It's a girls bike.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.170
I don't really buy girls
bikes, but it's prewar.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.570
This is the best
part of the bike.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.470
It has a very rare
fender ornament.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.970
And the fact that it's got
original paint is great too.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.100
And then I noticed
underneath the shelving,

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.570
there is a road racing bike.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.930
I'm like, this is
going to be good.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.730
[grunts] Let me see here.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.330
Oh, yeah!

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.270
It's Raleigh International.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.430
That's my old bike.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.500
MIKE: That's your bike?

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.230
So you were riding in style.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.200
This was the type of bike that
I drooled over when I was a kid.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.200
That's a tall bike.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.900
STEVE: Yeah, it's
a 23-inch frame.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.070
MIKE (VOICEOVER):
Built of Reynolds

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.000
531 double-butted tubing.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.670
The butted tubes, you know
what that means, Frank?

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.270
Butted tubes, so
they go together?

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.400
No, the tube is actually
twice as thick here,

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.570
and it's drawn thinner.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:45.370
FRANK: OK.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.430
So it reduces the weight.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.570
It's got camp
Ignoble parts on.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.130
Camp Ignoble Italian components
were the top of the line.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.900
There was nothing
that touched them.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.100
Oh, it doesn't have the
Alfredo Binda straps.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.000
Uh, no.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.700
Yeah.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.970
[laughter]

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.530
STEVE: But you have
to understand--

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.800
Wow, look at this thing.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.370
In 1979, when the movie
"Breaking Away" came out,

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.970
it was a game
changer in my life.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.730
There was a young
guy in that movie

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.200
that was completely engulfed
in the European cycling world.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.700
You know, his heroes
were Eddy Merckx, Bernard

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.100
Hinault. I mean, when
I was 14 years old,

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.930
I knew who those guys were.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.730
I was riding around on
European racing bikes,

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.370
and not a lot of
people understood that.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.900
So what year do you this is?

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.530
STEVE: Probably '68
or '69, I'd say.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.130
Yeah, because it's got
the center pole brakes.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.200
Yeah.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.200
Doesn't have the
caliper brakes on it.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.630
Finding this Raleigh
International just

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.530
brings so much of
my childhood back.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.900
Now, these bikes, they're
getting collectible.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.070
They were expensive back
then, and they're still

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.100
expensive to this day, because
the guys that were riding them

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.330
they want to ride them again.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.670
Is this something you'd sell?

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.130
STEVE: I don't ride no mountain
bike these days, so yeah.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.600
How about 300 on this?

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:02.300
Um, the women's bike,
this, like, two bills.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.100
I mean, I-- this stuff
right here, it's easy for me

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.230
to gauge.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.300
But when you start
talking about the tandem--

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.230
Right.

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.370
I have no idea about that.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.270
MIKE: That's the thing
that probably has a lot

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.830
of sentimental value to it.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:12.970
STEVE (VOICEOVER):
When Mike first

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.900
looked at that
side-by-side tandem,

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.400
my mother used to
ride that bike.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.570
So I needed to think about it.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.870
I just-- it was tough.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.900
300 on the Raleigh
International and 200

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.100
on the Dayton.
- Good.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.530
MIKE: Can you do that?
STEVE: Works for me, yeah.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:29.700
- All right.
- Thank you.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.100
MIKE (VOICEOVER): We
decided to put the tandem

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.570
on the back burner for now.

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.430
But at least I was
able to cut a deal

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.430
on the Raleigh International
and the Dayton girls' bike.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.330
I mean, he was
passing the torch.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.030
This was his bike.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.530
And I think one of
the reasons he sold me

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.100
the bike is because I understood
the significance of it,

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.570
because no way he's
going to sell it

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.070
to somebody that didn't get it.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.070
So it was like
the perfect storm.
