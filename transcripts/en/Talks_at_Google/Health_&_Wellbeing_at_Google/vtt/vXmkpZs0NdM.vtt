[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.017 --> 00:00:07.100
MEL WELLS: My name is Mel.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.360
It's so lovely to meet you.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.201
It's so lovely to see so many
faces here at Google for me

00:00:11.201 --> 00:00:11.700
today.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.491
I was a little bit
nervous about this talk,

00:00:13.491 --> 00:00:16.880
so I'm really grateful
for a great turnout.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.010
So I'm an author,
and I'm a speaker.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.520
And I help women, primarily,
heal their relationships

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.210
with food so they can go on
and lead fulfilled and enriched

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.660
lives without waiting
to lose weight first.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.221
And it's mainly
women that I help.

00:00:31.221 --> 00:00:32.720
And I believe it's
mainly women that

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.520
struggle with their
relationship with food

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.310
because we tend to be
more sensitive to being

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.140
led by our emotions in general.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.580
We tend to be more
intuitive on a whole.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.491
That's generalizing, obviously.

00:00:45.491 --> 00:00:47.240
But you might not even
realize that you're

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.640
in a relationship
with food unless you

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.610
are in a really unhealthy
one that is taking

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.550
over your life in some way.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.350
But actually, your
relationship with food

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.790
is just as old as you are.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.220
So if you are 30 years old,
your relationship with food

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.050
is also 30 years old.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.570
And your relationship with
food is really made up

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.850
of all of your beliefs,
stories, memories around food

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.250
and your weight and
your body that you've

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.907
had your whole life, really.

00:01:14.907 --> 00:01:16.490
Could have been
something that someone

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.930
said to you one
day that triggered

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.384
a feeling or an emotion.

00:01:19.384 --> 00:01:21.050
Could have been
something that you read.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.710
Could have been the latest
diet magazine you picked up.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.730
And all of this constitutes
this huge relationship with food

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.379
that you have.

00:01:30.379 --> 00:01:32.420
And it probably doesn't
come as a surprise to you

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.140
to realize that the reason
that I got into doing this work

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.780
and helping women with
their relationship with food

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.580
and making peace with
food was because I

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.150
was in a really unhealthy, quite
abusive relationship with food

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.370
for a long period of my life.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.180
So I'll tell you a bit
about my story first.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.150
So I grew up never
really having any issues

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.460
around food or my weight.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.680
My mom was quite healthy,
let us have the odd treat.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.270
The household was very healthy.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.070
My mom never criticized
her body, so,

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.140
I knew that she never dieted.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.210
She was very much at peace.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.180
And I was quite a confident
kid, really loved my life,

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.790
was really happy at
school, had friends,

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.020
was in the sports teams.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.610
It felt like my
teachers liked me.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.730
And I really just
was very carefree.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.850
And I remember walking
across the playground once.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.150
And you know the
girls at school--

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.040
how bitchy that was?

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.220
Do you guys remember?

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.260
it was a very catty
kind of atmosphere.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.410
And I walked across
the playground.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.190
And a girl from one of
the years above me said--

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.310
not directly to me, but just
loud enough that I could hear--

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.100
she said, oh, that girl, Mel?

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.960
She loves herself.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.660
And I felt like someone had
punched me in the stomach.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.930
I felt like that is the worst
thing that anyone could have

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.990
ever said to me or about me.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.980
I love myself?

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.280
I was like, how dare I be
that girl that loves herself.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.380
No one wants to be that person.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.600
And at that age, you
really just want to fit in.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.110
You don't want to be
too loud or too big

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.370
because you just want to fit in.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.900
And at that point, I
remembered to think to myself,

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.700
I am not going to be the
girl that loves herself.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.450
Anyway, I was determined
to be an actress.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.110
And I left school and
went to college at 16

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.760
to do performing arts.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.620
And when I got there, it was
this really harsh industry

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.050
where it was really competitive.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.140
And you're basically
spending eight hours a day

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.210
in front of the
mirror, being taught

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.130
to look for flaws
and imperfections.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.270
It's a very
perfectionist industry.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.410
And I was already a natural,
high-achiever perfectionist,

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.560
which I'm sure probably
some of you are in here.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.750
And all the girls
around me at college

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.640
were pinching themselves in the
mirror, going on these diets.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.110
And I just really
wanted to fit in.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.920
So I basically started
dieting as a way

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.660
to fit in with the
girls around me

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.520
because I didn't want to be
the girl that loved herself.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.603
I didn't want to be the
one that was too confident

00:04:09.603 --> 00:04:11.580
and didn't need
to do any of that.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.270
So I basically started
dieting as a way to fit in.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.399
And it was in that era
of the size zero thing.

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:20.750
There was no Kim Kardashian.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.410
There was no big booties
and squats and any of this

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.150
that it is nowadays.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.330
That size zero thing
was really glamorized.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.660
And it was a really unhealthy
environment for teenage girls

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.940
and for women to be in.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.180
And I remember going
on the Special K diet.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.960
Does anyone remember
the Special K diet?

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.180
Anyone do it?

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.990
Oh, my God.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.850
Dreadful.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.600
So basically, the
Special K diet,

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.050
for anyone that
doesn't know, was a way

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.170
to lose a dress
size in two weeks.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.870
And basically, you got
a bowl of Special K

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.367
for breakfast, a bowl
of Special K for lunch,

00:04:56.367 --> 00:04:58.700
and then you got to have
whatever you wanted for dinner.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:59.990
Magic, right?

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.260
Except it wasn't a bowl of
Special K. It was a handful.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.200
It was like the smallest
handful you could imagine.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.130
And so I remember measuring
out this bowl of Special K

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.760
every morning.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.950
And it was literally
the smallest bowl

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.420
you could imagine.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.370
And Special K,
obviously, geniuses

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.930
because they realized
that if women

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.330
were going to believe that
Special K was their diet

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.550
food, then they
were going to end up

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.629
overeating and binging
on Special K, which

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:24.670
is exactly what happened.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.961
Before I knew it, I was
getting through boxes and boxes

00:05:26.961 --> 00:05:28.630
and boxes of Special K.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.510
So me being a
perfectionist and getting

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.350
into diet culture
at a very young age,

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.230
it wasn't long before I
took it to the extreme

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.580
and developed a full-blown
eating disorder.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.850
I lost a lot of
weight very fast.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.580
I restricted myself so
much that at one point,

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.290
I couldn't even
remember the last time

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.780
I had a proper solid meal.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.640
I was completely spaced out.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.370
I went to a really
dark place, isolated

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:55.560
all my friends and family.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.690
But for some reason, I
felt like I was in control.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.710
I felt like I was making
a success of this.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.130
I felt that I was doing
really well at this.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.090
And I do believe that
an eating disorder is

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.830
a form of addiction.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.290
And that is absolutely
how it felt.

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:15.610
So what happened next
was I got offered this TV

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.800
job, this acting
job, which sounded

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.530
like the most exciting thing
ever to me because I was 18.

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.430
And most of my friends were
going off to drama school

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.870
and uni and taking gap years.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.750
And I've just been offered this
TV job straight out the gate.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.390
And it should have
been a dream come true.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.670
I took my whole life
up to Liverpool,

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:35.380
moved out of my parents' house.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.730
I suddenly had this flat.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:37.810
I had money.

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.190
I was going out
to these parties.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.980
And I was getting to
act every day on set.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.950
It should have been the dream.

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.970
But you know when--

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:47.860
I'm sure you've heard
this story before--

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.690
everything should
have been great

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:53.110
and it looked on the outside
like it was really glamorous?

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:54.790
But on the inside, it was not.

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.460
It was that empty, sinking
feeling of, oh, my God.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:58.960
This is not it.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.470
And my eating swung from
barely eating anything

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.620
to suddenly excessive binging.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.880
And I'm talking like inhaling
food like I had never seen food

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.070
before in my whole life.

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:15.460
I was inhaling it
like it was oxygen.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.800
And I felt such guilt
and shame over this

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.245
and for gaining weight so
fast again that I would then--

00:07:21.245 --> 00:07:22.500
it swung into bulimia.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.020
And I would be making myself
sick or over-exercising,

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.880
taking all kinds of illegal
fat burners off the internet,

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.890
and just really
punishing myself so much

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:35.590
and then swearing to start
the next diet the next Monday

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:37.270
morning.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.570
And my producer actually called
me up to the office once.

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:43.630
And she sat me down
and said to me, Mel,

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.210
we really need to
talk about something.

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:48.640
Your weight-- it's
all over the place.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.240
On screen, one episode,
you're this size.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.810
The next episode,
you're this size.

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:56.350
The next episode, you're
back to this size.

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.597
Continuity doesn't really
know what to do with you.

00:07:58.597 --> 00:08:01.180
And the wardrobe department have
got all these different sizes

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.190
for you.

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:04.650
Do you need to talk to someone?

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.150
And I thought I had been doing
a really great job of keeping

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.150
it secret, but obviously not.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:12.520
And it was so embarrassing
to feel like everyone knew.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.950
And I was completely crushed.

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:18.520
And that night, I went
home, ran back to my flat,

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:22.780
got down, sat on the couch,
and picked up the phone.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:23.500
Hey.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.770
Yeah, it's Mel.

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:29.120
I got to order three
large pizzas, please.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.260
Yep, stuffed crust.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.780
And when the delivery guy
came, I opened the door.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.429
And he started laughing at me.

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:39.820
And he was like, these three
pizzas all for you, lady?

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.460
You know when someone's
joking but not?

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:46.710
So I closed the door, sat
down with these pizzas.

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:49.210
And one by one, I demolished
every single one of them

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:54.220
until I was in so much
physical pain I couldn't move.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:59.960
I've never felt so full and
yet so empty at the same time.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.540
And then I would,
of course, swear

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:05.200
to start this brand new diet
and fix myself the next day.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.410
Because diets are what
would fix this, right?

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:11.680
Now, you might have never
experienced an eating disorder

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.150
or disordered eating.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:15.940
But a lot of these
addictive patterns

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:18.630
show up in much
more subtle ways.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:20.380
How many of you guys
have ever gotten home

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:22.504
from a really stressful
day, and before you've even

00:09:22.504 --> 00:09:25.730
taken your shoes off, you're in
the fridge looking for answers,

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:28.300
looking for that
fix of something?

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.900
And I believe when we do this.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.550
It's not the food
that's the problem.

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:33.550
It's the symptom of
a much deeper problem

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:36.710
that we need to get to
the bottom of and heal.

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:38.950
You see, if your
relationship with food

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:41.920
was a relationship
with a partner,

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.230
what kind of relationship
would that be?

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:47.410
For me, it was a very abusive
relationship, not a loving one,

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:49.060
not a healthy one.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.710
Maybe your
relationship with food

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:53.680
is really stale
and really boring.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.530
Maybe it's really
strict during the week,

00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:01.720
and then it's just this crazy
party or binge on the weekend.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:07.330
Maybe it is really monotonous,
the same thing all the time.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.530
Maybe it needs a
bit of spicing up.

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:14.050
You see, food isn't just
nourishment anymore for us.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:14.950
It isn't just fuel.

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:17.530
We make it means so
many other things.

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:20.080
It's the closest
thing to us that feels

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.860
like a substitute for love.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.970
So it's really easy to
turn to it to control it

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:27.410
when we feel out of
control of our lives.

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:29.920
It's the easiest
thing to turn to it

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.420
when we're feeling
emotional or when

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.944
we're feeling any kind of
uncomfortable or painful

00:10:34.944 --> 00:10:36.610
feeling that we just
don't want to feel.

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:38.360
We want to escape.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:42.230
And us humans are wired to
seek pleasure and avoid pain.

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:44.710
So it's something that we're
all doing all the time.

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:46.600
And it's not
necessarily a bad thing.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.510
Seeking pleasure and
using food as comfort,

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:51.490
as reward, as love--

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:54.820
it might have saved us a
lot of pain and heartache.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.490
But actually, what it does
is it doesn't actually

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:58.420
take away the pain.

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.059
It just numbs it and
delays it for later on.

00:11:01.059 --> 00:11:03.100
And then we develop these
unhealthy relationships

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:07.280
with food and try and go on
diets trying to fix them.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.670
So if you imagine an iceberg--

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:11.860
and the tip of the
iceberg is the only part

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.570
that's above the surface.

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:16.900
The tip of the iceberg is
like what you're actually

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:20.650
eating day to day, what you're
actually putting in your mouth.

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:23.680
But the whole iceberg
underneath the surface--

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.860
that is your entire relationship
with food, the psychology

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:31.900
of why you eat, how you eat,
who you are as an eater, what

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:35.080
your identity is around
food, all of those beliefs,

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.690
all of those memories, and
all of your relationships,

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:42.040
your career, how fulfilled
you feel in your life.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.320
Because all of
that dictates what

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:48.170
you end up eating and your
behaviors around food.

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:51.580
So I kept thinking the
perfect diet will fix this.

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:53.810
I just need to find
the perfect diet.

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:56.680
When I found the perfect
diet, then I'll be healed.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.896
I'm sure that my food
combining is all off.

00:11:58.896 --> 00:12:00.895
Or I'm sure that I'm just
having too many carbs.

00:12:00.895 --> 00:12:03.370
Or I'm sure that I'm having
too much fruit or too many

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:04.930
good fats or
whatever it might be.

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:07.810
I'm sure that I'll
find the perfect diet.

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:10.540
And then what
happened was my dad

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.070
was given four months to live.

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:16.060
And he was diagnosed
with terminal cancer.

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.460
And obviously, this
completely shattered me

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:21.400
and completely shook my world.

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.610
And he started reading
books on cancer.

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:26.832
He was very intellectual
and read so many books.

00:12:26.832 --> 00:12:28.290
And he started
reading about cancer

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:30.200
knowing that he was dying.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.600
And I started doing same.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.890
And because I was already
obsessed with food,

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:38.050
the books that stood out to
me were cancer prevention,

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:39.850
lifestyle, diet.

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:42.670
And before I knew it,
I had been engulfed

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:47.560
in some books that told me
that veganism was the best

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.580
way to reduce your cancer risk.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:50.080
So?

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.320
I was like, oh, my God.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:51.910
This is it.

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:53.394
I found the perfect diet.

00:12:53.394 --> 00:12:54.310
This has got to be it.

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:55.960
This is my answer.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.750
And I felt so much
guilt and shame

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:03.520
that I had found what I thought
was the holy grail to late

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.750
to be able to save my dad.

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:10.621
My dad couldn't even keep
food down at that point.

00:13:10.621 --> 00:13:13.120
So after he died, I thought,
I've got to share this message.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.494
I've got to go
out into the world

00:13:14.494 --> 00:13:16.710
and tell everyone
about veganism.

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:18.820
And because I was
a perfectionist

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.936
and because I still
had disordered eating,

00:13:20.936 --> 00:13:22.060
I didn't do this by halves.

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:23.018
I didn't just go vegan.

00:13:23.018 --> 00:13:23.865
I went gluten free.

00:13:23.865 --> 00:13:24.830
I went fat free.

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:25.670
I went sugar free.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.219
I cut out caffeine, no alcohol.

00:13:28.219 --> 00:13:30.260
I pretty much cut everything
out until I was just

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:31.182
eating fruit and veg.

00:13:31.182 --> 00:13:32.390
And even then, I was worried.

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:34.640
Am I eating too many fruits?

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.470
Because it's sugar, isn't it?

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:39.110
So I still had this really
negative relationship

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:40.250
with food.

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:43.550
And I didn't even
realize until one day,

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:47.310
I discovered that I was binging
on a tub of almond butter

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:48.650
and dates.

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:50.660
And I realized that I
was still restricting

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:52.040
by going on juice cleanses.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.650
And I thought, yeah,
I haven't actually

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:56.690
fixed anything here, have I?

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:59.420
My eating disorder
just has another face.

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:02.095
And this is actually something
that I see is really common.

00:14:02.095 --> 00:14:05.180
And at the moment in
the wellness industry,

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.360
we take things a
step too far instead

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:12.710
of finding peace with
ourselves and peace with food.

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:14.180
So I realized this.

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:16.970
And me and my then
partner were having

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:20.510
talks about getting pregnant
and trying for a baby.

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:25.940
And the thought of this was
such a new thought for me.

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:27.350
And it completely shook me.

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:30.320
Because I remember looking
in the mirror at my body--

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:34.150
this body that I had
spent years at war with--

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:36.330
and thinking, OK.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:41.150
If I'm going to grow a human in
here, something has to change.

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:44.610
Because if I have to grow
a human baby in here,

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:47.780
I know that I can't keep
treating my body the way

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:48.680
that I am.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:49.790
I can't restrict.

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:51.020
I can't be binging.

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:55.100
I can't be using food
in these abusive ways.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.850
I need to find a peaceful place
with myself and with my body

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:01.370
and with food
because I can't grow

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:05.750
a human baby on juice cleanses
and fruits and vegetables.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:09.800
I can't grow a human baby if
I'm binging on the weekend

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.380
and then starving
myself in the week.

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:14.250
And then I thought, OK.

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:18.560
If I wouldn't do that for
a child that's imaginary,

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.260
why would I not do
that for myself?

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.830
Why have I not been doing that
for myself all these years?

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:27.222
And I thought to myself,
you're not ready.

00:15:27.222 --> 00:15:28.430
You're not ready for a child.

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:30.179
You need to focus on
loving and nourishing

00:15:30.179 --> 00:15:32.810
your body without child first.

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:35.180
And if you can do
that for a year,

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:37.530
then maybe we'll talk about it.

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:39.710
And so I went on this
journey of self love.

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:41.930
And I chucked away my scales.

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:46.310
And I basically started
inspecting my relationship

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:49.370
with food one belief at a time.

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:51.860
Every time I felt a
fear or anxiety come up

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.260
around a certain food, I
would question it and go,

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:55.760
where did this come from?

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.230
Is this truth?

00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:01.310
Is this a story or belief
that I want to keep believing

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:04.310
and want to keep
playing out in my life?

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:06.170
Because at that
time, my head was

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:10.160
so full of all of this
overwhelming information

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.850
about nutrition and about
which diet is the best.

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:16.220
And I was hearing this
person talk about veganism,

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:18.860
this person talk about paleo,
this person talking about

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:22.900
quitting sugar, this person
talking about the Dukan diet,

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.190
5:2, intermittent
fasting, all this stuff.

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:26.780
And I was like, oh, my God.

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:28.010
My brain is just full.

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:30.410
I just need to let it all go.

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:34.124
And it was just the most
liberating thing ever.

00:16:34.124 --> 00:16:36.290
So I want to just do a
little exercise with you guys

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:37.490
if you don't mind.

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:39.090
And it's about beliefs.

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:41.210
And it's about these kind
of diet culture beliefs

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:47.190
that we take on as truth and
then express ourselves with.

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:51.320
So I just want to
raise a show of hands

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.540
if any of these beliefs
ring true for you

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:56.202
or if you have ever believed
any of these to be true.

00:16:56.202 --> 00:16:58.160
And there's absolutely
no judgment, by the way,

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.990
because I believed
all of them are more.

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:06.650
So have you ever believed
that food is the enemy?

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:11.390
Have you believed that fat
in food will make you fat?

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:14.319
Have you believed that you
should count your calories

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:16.819
Monday to Friday, but on the
weekends, calories don't count?

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:23.490
How many of you believed
that sugar is evil?

00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:28.770
Carbs are terrible?

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:31.110
That one comes from the
Atkins diet, I think.

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:32.900
How many of you
guys have believed

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.595
that if you have one
bad food in the day,

00:17:35.595 --> 00:17:37.470
you may as well write
off the rest of the day

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:38.844
because it doesn't
matter, right?

00:17:38.844 --> 00:17:40.410
You just try again on Monday.

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:43.050
How many of you believe that
diets have to start on Monday?

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:45.330
There's no other day.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:46.650
Right.

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:52.650
So now, if you had a
little girl or a boy,

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:54.270
and they came up to
you and they said,

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:57.280
mom, diets have to
start on Monday.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.809
Or, mom, this food is bad.

00:17:58.809 --> 00:18:01.350
And if I eat it, I can just eat
all the rest of the bad foods

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:03.600
and then start again tomorrow.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.020
Or if they came up
to you and they said,

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:08.870
thin people are automatically
happier people--

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:12.455
that's another one-- would
you believe that is healthy

00:18:12.455 --> 00:18:13.080
for your child?

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.660
Would you want that for them?

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.550
Would you?

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:21.690
But we accept that for
ourselves all the time.

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:24.780
So my moment of
transformation came when

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:26.880
I thought about having a child.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:31.500
And suddenly, my picture
became bigger than just myself.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.240
Because when you
are really consumed

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.280
with food and diets
and weight loss,

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.040
it's a really tunnel
vision way to live.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.140
You don't see the big picture.

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:44.550
You just think you're only here
to lose weight and get down

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:45.330
to a number.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.454
And then your life
can magically begin.

00:18:47.454 --> 00:18:48.870
How many of you
guys have believed

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:51.060
that if you get to a
certain number on the scale,

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.830
suddenly you'll be happy
and confident and free

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:54.288
and all your dreams
will come true?

00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:57.870
I kept doing that.

00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:59.820
And I got down and
down and down and down,

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:01.110
and it never happened.

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:03.429
I was like, where
is this feeling?

00:19:03.429 --> 00:19:05.220
Where are all the
rainbows and butterflies?

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.553
I thought I was supposed to
feel amazing at this number,

00:19:07.553 --> 00:19:08.400
and I don't.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.230
I still feel empty.

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:12.270
And it was because
I hadn't really

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:15.750
addressed the problem, which
was I didn't love myself.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:19.080
So what that girl said to
me on the playground, that

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:22.470
is what I needed to do more than
anything-- was to actually love

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:23.520
myself.

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.040
And what I've discovered is
when you make peace with food

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.050
and go on that journey,
you're actually

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:29.820
making peace with yourself.

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:31.650
Because healing your
relationship with food

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:33.882
is healing your
relationship with yourself.

00:19:33.882 --> 00:19:35.340
Because your
relationship with food

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:39.950
is a reflection of your
relationship with you.

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:43.040
So these addictive
tendencies that we have--

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.730
they are not something that we
should be condemning at all.

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:49.070
Rather, these addictive
tendencies-- and that

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:51.320
could be emotional eating.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.900
That could be a glass of wine
at the end of a stressful day.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:57.150
That could be feeling
anxious, refreshing Instagram,

00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:00.425
which is something that I notice
that I do still, for sure.

00:20:00.425 --> 00:20:02.690
They're not something that
we should be condemning.

00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:04.940
But they are like
our teachers shining

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:08.300
a light on where we
maybe need to look at,

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.210
where our souls are actually
hungry for something

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:14.640
even deeper than what we're
trying to fill it up with.

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:19.430
So at the time of this
moment of realization for me,

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:22.340
I was in a relationship
that I didn't really

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:25.352
feel able to fully be myself in.

00:20:25.352 --> 00:20:29.750
It looked great on the outside,
but it didn't feel like me.

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:32.270
I was in a job that, again,
looked quite glamorous

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:33.410
on the outside.

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:37.560
But I didn't feel
like it was me.

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:41.482
And I was living in a city
that didn't inspire me.

00:20:41.482 --> 00:20:43.190
And all the friends
that I had in my life

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:46.980
didn't feel like real
deep friendships.

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:50.090
So I would say that I was
living a life that did not

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:52.580
feel completely fulfilled.

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:55.460
So I was turning to food
and these outside sources

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:58.760
to try and fill myself up
from the outside in instead

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.910
of filling myself up
from the inside out.

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:05.540
And when I went on this journey
of self-love, what I discovered

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:07.970
was it wasn't just about
me healing my relationship

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:08.520
with food.

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.790
It was actually about
me transforming my life.

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:12.800
Because then, I
developed such a sense

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:16.070
of self-love and self-worth
that I had the confidence

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:21.590
to do things like leave my
relationship, change my life.

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:24.660
And then I went on to help
other women do the same.

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:25.910
So then I wrote my book.

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:27.860
I started working with clients.

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:31.370
I wrote my online program,
started running retreats.

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:34.430
And it was all because
I decided to take back

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:38.580
my life when it came to food
and love and accept myself.

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:45.170
And around that time, my
ex's sister said to me, Mel,

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:48.260
I feel sorry for you because
you're just not satisfied

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.517
with a normal life, are you?

00:21:50.517 --> 00:21:52.100
And I was like, I'm
not sure if that's

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:53.959
an insult or a compliment.

00:21:53.959 --> 00:21:55.500
Yeah, you know, I
guess you're right.

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.870
I'm not satisfied
with a normal life.

00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:00.376
She said, you're
always hungry for more.

00:22:00.376 --> 00:22:02.630
And I was like, God
damn, you're right.

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:04.110
I am.

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:06.780
And I don't think
that's a bad thing.

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:09.320
And I don't think I was
ungrateful for what I had.

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:14.630
But I think if you feel like
your life is not filling you

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:17.000
up, if you feel like
you're living in a life

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.747
that you should be
really grateful for

00:22:18.747 --> 00:22:20.330
and everyone else
says, oh, you should

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:23.870
be so lucky and grateful, but
you don't feel like it's yours,

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:26.420
you feel like there's
more out there for you,

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:27.500
then that is your job.

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:30.170
That is your mission
to follow that voice.

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:33.830
That is your mission
to follow that calling.

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:35.412
So our addictions
are not something

00:22:35.412 --> 00:22:36.620
that we should be condemning.

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:37.370
They are teachers.

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:40.290
And they can help guide
us in the direction

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:41.540
of where we're supposed to go.

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:44.390
For example, if we can
get curious about them

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:47.210
and observe them, they can
teach us things about our life

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:50.060
where we are maybe
out of alignment.

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:53.000
So maybe, for
example, you get home

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.100
from a really
stressful day at work.

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:58.250
And on the way home,
you find yourself

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:01.710
in the newsagent's
grabbing a chocolate bar.

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:04.760
So maybe that's not that
you've got terrible willpower.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:09.270
Maybe, actually, the root
of that is stress at work.

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:12.050
So maybe that is I need to set
more boundaries around work.

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:14.120
Or I need to destress.

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.610
Or I need to meditate
in the mornings.

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:19.100
Or I need to decide to make
a decision that I'm not

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:23.120
going to work with this kind
of project or this person.

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.370
Or maybe it's a change
of job on a bigger level.

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:28.850
Maybe you're hungry for
change in your life.

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:32.990
Maybe if you notice that when
that guy doesn't call you back

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:35.720
or that guy doesn't
text you back,

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.480
it makes you want to
binge eat all of a sudden.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.940
Maybe that's not because
you were just greedy.

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.470
Maybe that's because
actually what

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:44.960
you're really hungry
for on a deeper level

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:48.470
is love, intimacy, connection.

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:51.950
So maybe that is actually a sign
that you need to give yourself

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:55.550
more love, that you need to
give yourself more time, more

00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:57.890
intimacy with you and
work on the relationship

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:00.200
you have with yourself,
which is obviously

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.530
the most important relationship
of our whole lives.

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:06.380
I was walking home
from a class of a day.

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.570
It was a 45-minute walk.

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:11.060
And I blame Google for
this because I literally

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:12.950
have no idea how to
walk anywhere in London

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:13.783
without Google Maps.

00:24:13.783 --> 00:24:15.920
I'm completely reliant on it.

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:19.670
And I came out of this
class, and I had to get home.

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:23.500
And my battery was on 1%.

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:24.920
And I started walking home.

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:27.044
And I literally had no idea
where I was going apart

00:24:27.044 --> 00:24:29.180
from with the Maps on.

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.150
And then my phone died.

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:34.400
And I instantly felt that
feeling of disconnection.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.140
And then I noticed my mind
go, oh, I'll go to [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:38.530
and get a chocolate bar.

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:39.859
And I was like, oh, my God.

00:24:39.859 --> 00:24:41.150
It's happening to me right now.

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:43.434
I just wrote a book on this.

00:24:43.434 --> 00:24:44.475
Practice what you preach.

00:24:44.475 --> 00:24:45.350
Practice what you preach.

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.860
OK.

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:47.990
This is teaching me
that I feel disconnected

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:49.820
when my phone dies.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:54.650
This is teaching me to find
a deeper connection offline.

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:56.150
So this is teaching
me that I need

00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:59.720
to find a deeper connection with
myself, with a higher power,

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.234
get into nature, meditate more.

00:25:02.234 --> 00:25:03.650
Things that I do
to feel connected

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:06.350
are journaling,
getting into nature,

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:10.700
going to the park with
a book, or praying.

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:14.150
And so I had a little
taste of my own lessons

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:17.370
there, which I found
really interesting.

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:20.840
So what is really
cool is addictions

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:24.510
are not necessarily bad.

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:27.080
It's really about a lack of
connection or fulfillment

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.620
that creates them.

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:32.510
So there was a study
done on rats in the '70s.

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:34.700
You might have heard of it.

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:38.210
And basically, one
rat was put alone

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:41.210
in a cage with two
bottles of water.

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:42.840
One was just water.

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.440
And one was water
laced with cocaine.

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.210
And every time they
ran this experiment--

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:48.711
which was about addiction--

00:25:48.711 --> 00:25:50.210
every time they ran
this experiment,

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:53.600
the rats would choose
the drugs, get addicted,

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.340
and eventually die.

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:57.350
But Professor Bruce
Alexander came along,

00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:59.720
saw this experiment, and
thought to himself, well,

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.690
the rat is alone in a cage.

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:05.810
But rats are social
creatures, just like humans.

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:10.430
And they thrive off interaction
and connection with other rats.

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:13.820
So he thought, if a human
was alone in a cage,

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:15.320
wouldn't the human
choose the drugs

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:18.780
if they were offered it
just for something to do?

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:21.500
So basically, he decided to
build this rat park, which

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.630
was like a haven for rats.

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:25.650
They had all their rat friends.

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:27.260
They had rat games.

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:28.860
They had rat food.

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:31.130
They had rat "Love
Island" on TV.

00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:33.792
They were living their
best lives, these rats.

00:26:33.792 --> 00:26:35.750
And then they put in
these two bottles of water

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:38.210
again, the one with
the water and the one

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:40.540
with the water
laced with cocaine.

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:43.520
Can you guess what happened?

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.700
They rejected the
drugs completely.

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:47.699
They chose just the water.

00:26:47.699 --> 00:26:49.990
And he concluded that this
was because they were living

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:51.160
fulfilled lives .

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.690
They felt connected.

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:54.400
They didn't feel isolated.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.340
They had a purpose
in their lives.

00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:58.960
So I think this is
just fascinating.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.870
And we can link this back to
food or alcohol or anything

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:05.530
else that we use as a drug
to numb our pain often.

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:07.120
So what this means
is when you're

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:10.150
feeling a lack of connection
or lack of fulfillment

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:12.640
somewhere in your life,
you're far more susceptible

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.380
to those addictive tendencies.

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:18.610
You're far more easily led to
go and grab that chocolate bar,

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:20.650
or go and have
that glass of wine,

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:25.580
or go and order that takeaway,
or whatever it might be.

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:27.520
And we all do this, right?

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:28.420
We all do this.

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:31.240
But it's just really interesting
to become aware of that

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.290
and just observe it.

00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:34.570
And hopefully, you can
then heal what it is

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:38.240
that you're really hungry for.

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:40.566
These food product
companies often use this

00:27:40.566 --> 00:27:41.690
to their advantage as well.

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:44.740
So they use our emotional
attachments to food

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:48.050
to market to us in
quite subtle ways.

00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:51.860
But when you are aware of it,
it really becomes obvious.

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:54.220
For example, have a break.

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:56.294
Have a Kit Kat,
basically saying,

00:27:56.294 --> 00:27:57.460
you're life is really tough.

00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:58.720
You deserve a break.

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.930
Go and take a break and reward
yourself with that Kit Kat.

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:05.650
Or Coca-Cola-- life tastes good.

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:07.240
Go and celebrate
your life by drinking

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.880
our carbonated sugary pop drink.

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:13.690
Or Pringles-- once you pop,
you can't stop, basically

00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:17.680
normalizing it to eat a
whole tub in one sitting.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.580
Or maybe the worst
culprit of them all,

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:22.750
McDonald's-- are your
kids misbehaving again?

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:24.475
Swing by and get
them a Happy Meal.

00:28:24.475 --> 00:28:26.090
That will put a
smile on their face

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:27.760
because it's a
Happy Meal, right?

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.920
So before we're
even six years old,

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.380
we've already got this
imprinted onto our brains.

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:35.800
The food is there to handle
our emotions, to make us happy,

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:40.340
to numb our pain, which I
just find really interesting.

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.550
So I want to do a little
exercise with you guys.

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:44.950
I'd like you to get into pairs.

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:49.170
Just partner up
and don't be shy.

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:52.960
And I just want you to
share with your partner what

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:57.360
that one go-to emotional
food is for you.

00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:02.670
It might be crisps or chocolate
or ice cream, chips, cheese,

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:03.760
whatever it might be.

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:05.170
What is that go-to food?

00:29:07.851 --> 00:29:08.350
OK.

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:10.570
Everyone done?

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:11.403
Everyone done?

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:16.300
OK.

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:17.050
Everyone finished?

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:21.250
Guys, just one food.

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:21.992
One food.

00:29:21.992 --> 00:29:23.200
Everyone's like, I like this.

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.037
I like chocolate.

00:29:24.037 --> 00:29:24.620
I like crisps.

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:25.570
I like ice cream.

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:27.620
I like pizza.

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:30.160
OK.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.140
By the way, my
go-to emotional food

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:35.870
when I was really an emotional
eater was always pick and mix.

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:38.380
You know the sweets that you
choose and put in the bag?

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:39.370
That was my thing.

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:40.870
I'm talking I would
go to the cinema

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:44.210
and spend extortionate
amounts on pick and mix

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:46.670
and not even care
about seeing the film.

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:47.170
OK.

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:48.700
So next part of the
exercise, I want

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:52.270
you to think about
what is the earliest

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:55.534
memory of you having that food.

00:29:55.534 --> 00:29:57.700
What is the earliest memory
of you having that food?

00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:58.991
And share it with your partner.

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:04.990
OK.

00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:05.750
Everyone done?

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:10.720
Everyone done?

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:11.700
OK.

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:15.390
So next, I want you
to just identify

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:18.810
what is the emotion
associated with that memory.

00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:22.080
What is the feeling
of that memory?

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.060
And share it with your partner.

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:27.870
Not now, but the feeling
associated in that environment

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:29.141
in that memory.

00:30:29.141 --> 00:30:30.390
So share it with your partner.

00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:39.770
Everyone got that?

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:42.410
OK.

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:44.420
OK.

00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:46.040
So I'll share mine.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:50.030
So my earliest memory
of pick and mix

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:54.510
was my mom and dad picking me
up from school on a Friday.

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:57.650
And if I was really good,
then I would get a pound

00:30:57.650 --> 00:30:59.630
to spend on pick and mix.

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:03.242
And so that was my favorite
time of the whole week.

00:31:03.242 --> 00:31:04.700
And I really looked
forward to that

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:07.550
because I was just so
excited to get that pound.

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:10.700
And so the feeling associated
for me with that memory

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:13.820
was reward and validation
for being good.

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:15.930
And it's a treat.

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:19.220
So in my adult life,
what I've noticed

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:22.340
that I started doing was any
time that I felt like I've been

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:25.340
good or deserved a
reward or a treat,

00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:28.220
I would go get
that pick and mix.

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:30.770
My partner, Rick-- his
go-to emotional food

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:32.960
was always Nutella.

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.741
And he used to come home
with a jar of Nutella

00:31:35.741 --> 00:31:36.740
when he'd had a bad day.

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:39.720
And I'd be like, do we
need to talk about this?

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.210
But his earliest
memory of Nutella

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:43.910
was eating it on
pancakes with his mom.

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:47.760
And so he associated that
with love and connection.

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:50.930
So when he felt like he
needed love and connection,

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:53.150
he would go get that
Nutella because food

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:54.710
feels like love, right?

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:56.840
So does anyone want to
share what those were?

00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:59.600
Just a couple of people?

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:00.190
Anyone?

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:00.690
Yeah.

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:09.120
AUDIENCE: Mine was
mac and cheese.

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:12.560
I remember eating it at home
with my mom, my brother,

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:17.300
and my sister just having a
good time, just a happy memory.

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:18.110
MEL WELLS: Yeah.

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:18.860
Yeah.

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:21.620
So then in your adult
life then, if you

00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:23.870
feel like you need to
go to a happy place,

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:25.496
that is the happy place.

00:32:25.496 --> 00:32:26.120
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:27.230
MEL WELLS: Yeah, awesome.

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:28.267
Thank you for sharing.

00:32:28.267 --> 00:32:29.350
Anyone else want to share?

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:37.330
Everyone's so shy.

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:37.880
Anyone else?

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:38.380
One more?

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:39.463
AUDIENCE: I can share one.

00:32:39.463 --> 00:32:40.956
You go because [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:47.710
AUDIENCE: Mine was sushi.

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:50.950
And I discovered it when
I was doing a year abroad

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:53.190
in New Orleans,
so when I was 20.

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:55.450
And it was just really
happier and felt really

00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:56.290
fun and carefree.

00:32:56.290 --> 00:32:57.920
And I ended up
eating it every day.

00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:00.610
And it become my cure for
everything-- hangovers.

00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:04.210
So it just became this
really joyful thing.

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:07.472
MEL WELLS: So it symbolized
joy, freedom, carefree?

00:33:07.472 --> 00:33:09.180
AUDIENCE: Yeah, having
a really fun year.

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:09.971
MEL WELLS: Awesome.

00:33:09.971 --> 00:33:11.140
Thank you for sharing.

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:13.890
Another really common thing
is if we weren't allowed it

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:17.140
at home as kids,
then when we grow up

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:19.360
and we're suddenly adults
and free and liberated,

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:20.770
we're like, oh, my God.

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:22.190
I can eat it now.

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:23.970
I'm allowed to eat
whatever I want.

00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:29.430
It symbolizes this rebellion and
this freedom and independence.

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:35.620
So food is parallel to our life.

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:37.660
So our relationship
with food can

00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:41.170
be this kind of comfort,
this emotional tool.

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:42.700
But it can also be pleasure.

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:45.460
And I think when we get
sucked into diet land,

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:47.230
we forget that we're
allowed to receive

00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:48.520
pleasure and joy from food.

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:53.740
It's allowed to be a completely
celebratory experience.

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:56.080
And a good question
to ask yourself

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:59.580
when you're turning to food is,
am I using this to celebrate?

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:02.170
Or am I using it to escape?

00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:06.010
Because often, we're actually
trying to push down a feeling.

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:08.710
So our relationship with
food is a reflection

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:10.210
of our relationship
with life, which

00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:12.639
means-- you know that saying,
how you do one thing is

00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:14.920
how you do everything?

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.889
So it's kind of like how you do
food is often how you do life.

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:20.409
So if you are a perfectionist
around your food,

00:34:20.409 --> 00:34:22.989
you're probably also a
perfectionist in your life.

00:34:22.989 --> 00:34:25.650
If you are controlling
around food,

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:28.030
you're probably also
controlling in life.

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:30.690
And who's an
all-or-nothing person?

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:32.810
Anyone here totally
all-or-nothing?

00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:35.100
So if you're
all-or-nothing with food,

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:37.270
you're probably
also all-or-nothing

00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:39.250
in your life, in
your relationships,

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:41.510
in your job or projects.

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:46.300
And who here would say
that they are a fast eater?

00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:46.851
everyone.

00:34:46.851 --> 00:34:47.350
Yeah.

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:48.310
This doesn't surprise me, right?

00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:50.090
Because you guys
are high achievers.

00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:51.539
So if you're a
fast eater, you're

00:34:51.539 --> 00:34:53.080
probably also going
through your life

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:56.350
quite fast, which is why
it's difficult to get people

00:34:56.350 --> 00:34:58.072
to slow down their eating.

00:34:58.072 --> 00:34:59.530
Because it's
basically like saying,

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:01.000
slow down your life pace.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.300
Do you also drive your car
quite fast if you drive?

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:07.150
Do you go through your life
quite fast in other areas?

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:08.200
Yeah.

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.940
So what this means
is when we are

00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:13.000
able to heal ourself with food,
we can also heal our life.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.610
And if we're able to enjoy a
more intuitive way of eating,

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:20.260
it means we're more
likely to enjoy

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:23.270
an intuitive way of living.

00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:25.630
So I always say intuitive
eating paves the way

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:27.010
for intuitive living.

00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:31.190
When I was able to learn how
to really listen to my body,

00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:34.150
I was also able to learn
how to listen to my gut.

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:36.610
I was able to learn how
to listen to my intuition.

00:35:36.610 --> 00:35:40.250
I realized that the
two went hand in hand.

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:41.687
So a lot of people
think that when

00:35:41.687 --> 00:35:43.270
they're going to
listen to their body,

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:45.020
they think that their
body is just telling

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:46.332
them to eat all kinds of junk.

00:35:46.332 --> 00:35:47.540
And it's simply not the case.

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:50.080
So I want to explain to
you guys-- just to finish--

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:53.560
the difference between
your real hunger

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:55.510
and your emotional cravings.

00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:58.690
So real hunger comes on
very gradually, slowly.

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:00.190
And you feel it here, right?

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:01.630
You feel it in the stomach.

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:04.720
And it gives you the
time and that patience

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.430
to go, what am I hungry for?

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:10.210
What am I going to choose
to nourish my body?

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:13.690
Whereas an emotional craving is
actually a psychological need.

00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:16.270
And it comes on very
fast in the mind.

00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:17.490
And it's that urge.

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:18.610
It's that impulse.

00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:22.150
And it usually fixates on
one particular kind of food.

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:24.350
So it comes on really fast.

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:27.265
And if you don't check yourself,
you kind of glaze over.

00:36:27.265 --> 00:36:28.640
And you become
this zombie state.

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:29.920
And before you know it,
you've eaten something.

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:31.725
And you don't even
know how you got there.

00:36:31.725 --> 00:36:33.100
If we were doing
that with drugs,

00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:34.766
it would be a pretty
big problem, right?

00:36:34.766 --> 00:36:36.910
But we do that with food a lot.

00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:40.389
So when we have those
psychological cravings,

00:36:40.389 --> 00:36:42.430
what we're actually craving
is something deeper--

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:45.220
usually love,
usually connection.

00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:48.610
And all of those things
that we are craving we

00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:49.960
can give to ourselves.

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:52.420
We can never truly
get those needs

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:57.400
met from someone else, a
food, a drink, a substance,

00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:00.430
social media, all of these
kind of external things.

00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:02.800
It's a way in which we
try to fill ourselves up

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:06.340
from the outside in rather
than filling ourselves

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:09.430
up from the inside
out in fulfillment

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:12.190
and living a truly full-up life.

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:13.460
So thank you.

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:16.390
I hope this has given
you some food for thought

00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:18.850
and that you will be able to
hopefully bring a little bit

00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:21.100
more awareness to your
relationship with food

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:22.830
and use it to your advantage.

00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:23.630
Thank you.

00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:27.331
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:27.331 --> 00:37:28.580
Do we have time for questions?

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:29.410
SPEAKER: So we
have time for Q&amp;A.

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:30.820
You have to speak into
this because we're

00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:31.944
recording this for YouTube.

00:37:31.944 --> 00:37:34.150
Does anyone have questions?

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:35.660
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:38.819
I think speaking for all of
us, we all really enjoyed that.

00:37:38.819 --> 00:37:40.360
I've got a question,
and I'm not sure

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:41.540
if you're going to
be able to answer it.

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:44.250
But it's to do with the whole
body positive intuitive eating

00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:45.101
movement.

00:37:45.101 --> 00:37:46.600
Me and a lot of my
friends-- we have

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:49.600
a lot of intolerances, which
really hinders our ability

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:51.070
to eat freely.

00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:55.000
And I often feel like that's
not taken into consideration

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.990
into the body positive and
intuitive eating movement.

00:37:57.990 --> 00:38:01.160
And I would just like to hear
your thoughts on it, really.

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.324
Gluten free, dairy
free-- things like that.

00:38:03.324 --> 00:38:04.240
MEL WELLS: Sure, sure.

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:05.110
Thank you so much.

00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:07.810
So first of all, I
would like to offer

00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:11.260
that the body positive
movement is a separate thing

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:12.640
from intuitive eating.

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:17.000
And you can do one without
the other and vice versa.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.290
So I would say that the
body positive movement

00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:21.850
is a movement in itself.

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:23.650
And the people that
started that have

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:26.470
their own definition
of what that is

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:28.130
and what they stand for.

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:32.020
But you can decide that for you
to be positive for your body,

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:34.780
for you to show your body
love, means to not have things

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:36.470
that don't agree with it.

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:39.850
So for example, I consider
myself to be body positive

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:43.270
because I do positive
things for my body,

00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:45.850
although I'm not a part,
necessarily, of that movement.

00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:48.370
And the roots of
it obviously were

00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:52.180
different from where I'm sat.

00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:55.270
But if doing a positive
thing for your body

00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:58.870
is not having certain foods
that don't agree with it,

00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:00.190
then that's absolutely great.

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:04.330
I don't think intuitive
eating is about just

00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:06.130
eating rubbish all the time.

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:09.140
I think it's about noticing what
feels good and what doesn't.

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:10.870
And that's definitely
something that I've

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:11.911
learned along my journey.

00:39:11.911 --> 00:39:14.230
Because I thought that
going into intuitive eating

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:16.510
would mean that I would
just gain loads of weight

00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:19.600
and would just sit around
eating donuts and ice cream

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.430
and all kinds of
cereal for dinner

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:22.910
and all this kind of stuff.

00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:24.290
And it's not what happened.

00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:26.800
I think initially, there
might be a boomerang phase

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.820
where you're just like
oh, my God, freedom.

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:30.736
But then after that,
what happens is you start

00:39:30.736 --> 00:39:32.970
to recognize what feels
good and what doesn't.

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:34.720
And you start to notice
that, actually, it

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:37.580
feels really good to have
this amount of vegetables.

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:40.010
And it feels really good to
have meat or to not have meat.

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:43.090
And it feels really good to have
gluten or to not have gluten.

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:46.480
And it's really about you taking
your power back around food

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:49.030
and not thinking that it
has to look a certain way.

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:51.964
It's about you becoming
the boss of your own body.

00:39:51.964 --> 00:39:53.130
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:55.620
That was good.

00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:58.440
SPEAKER: Any other questions?

00:39:58.440 --> 00:39:59.220
AUDIENCE: Hi, yes.

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:01.045
Thank you so much for the talk.

00:40:01.045 --> 00:40:02.670
I just wanted to know
a little bit more

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:05.430
if you're comfortable sharing.

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:07.895
You talked about your veganism
and your perfectionism

00:40:07.895 --> 00:40:09.510
to the state that you are now.

00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:16.360
We all know the path to whatever
kind of looks like this--

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:19.470
and if you had a few of these
tips or how you overcame those

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:21.854
and how you also got to the
state that you're in now.

00:40:21.854 --> 00:40:22.770
MEL WELLS: Yeah, sure.

00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:24.762
Do you mean from disordered
or from veganism--

00:40:24.762 --> 00:40:26.970
AUDIENCE: From just sort of
eating [INAUDIBLE] to how

00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:28.050
you are present.

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:29.140
MEL WELLS: Yeah, sure.

00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:31.590
So it was definitely a
bumpy road to begin with.

00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:38.250
Because when you are so
ingrained in that diet culture,

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:41.440
you feel like a lot of your
identity is wrapped up in it.

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:43.710
So I don't really know
who I was without a diet

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:45.840
because it consumed
so much of my life.

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:49.290
So giving myself that freedom
to break free from that

00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:51.180
felt like I was
rediscovering who I was

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:53.640
and almost creating a
new identity for myself.

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:55.590
Because it had taken
up so much head space

00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:57.850
that when I got rid of that,
I was like, oh, my God.

00:40:57.850 --> 00:41:00.510
I don't know what to
do with myself anymore.

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:02.920
It was like a full-time
job for me, dieting.

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:06.270
So coming out of that was
definitely a bumpy road.

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:11.200
But I just kept focusing on,
I'm getting my life back here.

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:13.620
So even though to begin
with I gained weight,

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:16.020
I also gained my life back,
which was so much more

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:17.730
important to me.

00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:20.511
But yeah, I definitely
had to figure out

00:41:20.511 --> 00:41:22.260
all of these different
beliefs and stories

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:25.439
that I was telling myself
around different diets and food

00:41:25.439 --> 00:41:26.730
and the people that I followed.

00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:28.140
I had to unfollow
a lot of people

00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:31.347
that were projecting their
beliefs out onto social media.

00:41:31.347 --> 00:41:33.055
And I was like, that's
not helpful for me

00:41:33.055 --> 00:41:34.290
for where I'm at right now.

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:37.296
I just need to be able to make
my own intuitive decisions

00:41:37.296 --> 00:41:38.670
around food rather
than listening

00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:40.530
to every single
expert that's got

00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:42.120
a different opinion on food.

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:44.332
I just needed to
block all that out

00:41:44.332 --> 00:41:45.540
to just come home to my body.

00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:47.010
And that really helped me.

00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:48.540
But for sure, it
was a bumpy road.

00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:51.900
And yeah, I realized
along that road

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:53.630
that veganism wasn't
for me anymore.

00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:56.880
And me deciding to be a vegan--

00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:00.450
my intention behind that
wasn't as it should have been.

00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:02.460
It was because I thought
it was the perfect diet

00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:04.860
and because I thought it
would heal me and make

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:07.689
me lose weight as opposed
to what actually feels good.

00:42:07.689 --> 00:42:09.480
And I have a lot of
friends that are vegan.

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:12.700
But they do it for much
more ethical reasons.

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:15.000
But personally,
for me, I feel good

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.210
when I have a bit of animal
products in my lifestyle.

00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:21.125
And I don't think anyone
should be shamed for that.

00:42:21.125 --> 00:42:23.000
SPEAKER: Well, thanks
again, Mel, for coming.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:23.390
MEL WELLS: Cool.

00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:24.264
Thanks for having me.

00:42:24.264 --> 00:42:27.200
