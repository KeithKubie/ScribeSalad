00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.080
Michel Foucault was a French 20th century philosopher and historian

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.460
who spent his career forensically criticizing the power

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.540
of the modern bourgeois capitalist state, including its

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.800
police, law courts, prisons, doctors and psychiatrists.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.340
His goal was to work out nothing less

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.780
than how power worked and then to change it in the direction

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.380
of a marxist-anarchist utopia. Though he spent most of his life in libraries and

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.900
seminar rooms,

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.740
he was a committedly revolutionary figure. He met with enormous popularity

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.960
in elite Parisien intellectual circles. Jean-Paul Sartre admired him deeply

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.460
and he still maintains a wide following among young people studying at university

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.240
in the prosperous corners of the world. His background,

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.300
which he was extremely reluctant ever to talk about and tried to prevent

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.860
journalists from investigating at all costs,

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.280
was very privileged. Both his parents were inordinately rich

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.420
coming from a long line of successful surgeons in Poitiers, in west central France.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.640
His father, Dr. Paul Foucault, came to represent

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.640
all that Michel would hate about bourgeois France.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.480
Michel had a standard upper class education.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.000
He went to elite Jesuit institutions, was an altar boy,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.900
and his parents hoped he would become a doctor. But Michel wasn't quite like other boys.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.580
He started self-harming and thinking constantly of suicide.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.720
At University, he decorated his bedroom with images of torture by Goya.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.180
When he was 22, he tried to commit suicide and was forced by his father,

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.180
against his will,

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.200
to see France's most famous psychiatrist, Jean Delay, at the HÃ´pital Sainte-Anne in Paris.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.940
The doctor wisely diagnosed that a lot of Michel's distress

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.740
came from having to keep his homosexuality and, in particular,

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.200
his interest in extreme sadomasochism away from a censorious society.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.260
Gradually, Foucault entered the underground gay scene in France,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.640
fell in love with a drug dealer and then took up with a transvestite.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.900
For long periods in his twenties, he went to live abroad in Sweden, Poland and Germany,

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.820
where he felt his sexuality would be less constrained.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.140
All the while, Foucault was progressing up the French academic ladder. The seismic event to his intellectual life

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.960
came in the summer of 1953, when Foucault was 27

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.460
and on holiday with a lover in Italy. There, he came across Nietzsche's book

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.800
"Untimely Meditations" which contains an essay called

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.740
"On the Uses and Abuses of History for Life".

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.240
In the essay, Nietzsche argued that academics had poisoned our sense of how history

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.240
should be read and talked.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.520
They made it seem as if one should read history in some sort of a disinterested way

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.220
in order to learn how it all was in the past.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.220
But Nietzsche rejected this with

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.880
sarcastic fury.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.660
There was no point learning about the past for its own sake,

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.420
the only reason to read and study history is to dig out from the past

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.820
ideas, concepts and examples which can help us to lead

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.460
a better life in our own times. This essay liberated Foucault intellectually

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.020
as nothing had until then. Immediately, he changed the direction of his work

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.000
and decided to become a particular kind of philosophical historian:

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.380
someone who could look back into the past to help to sort out the

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.640
urgent issues of his own time. Eight years later,

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.120
he was ready to publish what's recognizes as his first masterpiece:

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.720
"Madness and Civilization".

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.560
The standard view is that we now treat people with mental illness in so much more of a humane way

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.500
than we ever did in the past. After all, we put them in hospitals, give them drugs

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.200
and get them looked after by people with PhD's.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.940
But this was exactly the attitude that Foucault wished to demolish in "Madness and Civilization."

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.520
In the book, he argued that things way back in the Renaissance

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.940
were actually far better for the mad, than they subsequently became.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.560
In the Renaissance,  the mad were felt to be different

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.020
rather than crazy. They were thought to possess a kind of wisdom

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.260
because they demonstrated the limits of reason.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
They were revered in many circles

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.680
and were allowed to wander freely.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.760
But then, as Foucault's historical researches showed him,

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.020
in the mid 17th century, a new attitude was born that relentlessly medicalized

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.100
and institutionalized mentally ill people. No longer were they allowed to live alongside

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.180
the so-called sane,

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.800
they were taken away from their families and locked up in asylums and seen as people

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.200
one should try to cure

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.540
rather than tolerate for just being different.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.280
You can recognize a very similar, underlying philosophy

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.800
in Foucault's next great book: "The Birth of The Clinic."

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.080
His target here was medicine more broadly.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.760
He systematically attacked the view that medicine had become more humane with time.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.240
He conceded that, of course, we have better drugs and treatments now

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.420
but he believed that in the 18th century the professional doctor was born

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.500
and that he was a sinister figure who would look at the patient always with,

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.820
what Foucault called, the "medical gaze,"

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.500
denoting a dehumanizing attitude;

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.380
that looked at a patient just as a set of organs, not a person.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.900
One was, under the medical gaze, merely a malfunctioning

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.440
kidney or liver, not a person to be considered as a whole entity.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.840
Next in Foucault's oeuvre came: "Discipline and Punish."

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.240
Here, Foucault did his standard thing on state punishment.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.700
Again, the normal view is that the prison and punishing systems of the modern world

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.620
are so much more humane than they were in the days when people just used to be

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.060
hung in public squares. Not so, argued Foucault.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.820
The problem, he said, is the power now looks kind

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.400
but isn't, whereas in the past it clearly wasn't kind

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.740
and therefore could encourage open rebellion in protest.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.980
Foucault noted that in the past, in an execution, a convict's body

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.180
could become a focus of sympathy and admiration, and the executioner

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.280
rather than the convict, could become the locus of shame.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.860
Also, public executions often led to riots in support of the prisoner,

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.500
but, with the invention of the modern prison system, everything happened in

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.320
private, behind locked gates;

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.740
one could no longer see and, therefore resist, state power.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.900
That's what made the modern system of punishment so barbaric

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.900
and properly primitive in Foucault's eyes.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.420
Foucault's last work was the multi-volume

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.440
"History of Sexuality."

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.540
In the manoeuvres he performed in relation to sex

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.780
are again very familiar. Foucault rebelled against the view

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.880
that we're all now deeply libarated and at ease with sex.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.860
He argued that since the 18th century, we have relentlessly

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.300
medicalized sex, handing it over to professional sex researchers and scientists.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.720
We live in an age of what Foucault called "scientia sexualis" ("science of sexuality")

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.480
But Foucault looked back with considerable nostalgia

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.980
to the cultures of Rome, China and Japan,

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.480
where he detected the rule of, what he called, an "ars erotica"

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.480
("erotic art"),

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.940
where the whole focus was on how to increase the pleasure of sex

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.840
rather than merely understand and label it.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.440
Once again, modernity was blamed for pretending there'd been progress when there was in fact

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.040
just the loss of spontaneity and imagination.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.540
Foucault wrote the last volume of this work while dying of AIDS,

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.240
that he had contracted in a San Francisco gay bar.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.080
He died in 1984, age 58.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.840
Foucault's lasting contribution is to the way we look at history.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.420
There are lots of things in the modern world that we're constantly being told

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.820
are "fantastic," and were apparently very bad in the past; for example

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.660
education or the media or our communication systems.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.360
Foucault encourages us to breakaway from optimistic smugness

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.620
about now and to go back and see in history many ways of doing things

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.080
which were perhaps superior. Foucault wasn't trying to get us to be

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.280
nostalgic, he wanted us to pick up some lessons of way back

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.820
in order to improve how we live now. Academic historians

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.060
have tended to hate Foucault's work.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.580
They think it inaccurate and keep pointing out things

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.920
he hadn't quite understood in some document or other,

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.820
but Foucault didn't care for total historical accuracy.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.120
History for him was just a storehouse of good ideas,

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.800
and he wanted to raid it rather than keep it pristine and untouched.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.800
We should use Foucault as an inspiration to look at the dominant ideas and

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.800
institutions of our times,

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.460
and to question them by looking at their histories and evolutions.

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:58.240
Foucault did something remarkable: he made history life-enhancing

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.500
and philosophically rich again. He can be an inspiring figure

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.900
for our own projects.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.900
