know there's been an instance that I
 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.460
know there's been an instance that I
read about on of ball lightning like

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470
read about on of ball lightning like
 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.380
read about on of ball lightning like
there's been several instances of ball

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390
there's been several instances of ball
 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.330

this is ball lightning yeah yeah I could
believe it would be ball lightning kiss

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620
believe it would be ball lightning kiss
 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.200
believe it would be ball lightning kiss
ball lightning can has weird properties

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210
ball lightning can has weird properties
 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.110
ball lightning can has weird properties
yeah look look at that just disappeared

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120
yeah look look at that just disappeared
 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.760
yeah look look at that just disappeared
it's a federal role and it sweet writer

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770
it's a federal role and it sweet writer
