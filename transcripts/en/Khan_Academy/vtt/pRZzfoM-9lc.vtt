00:00:00.121 --> 00:00:02.110
- Do you want to evaluate
the definite integral

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.624
from three to three, of F of X, D X.

00:00:05.624 --> 00:00:07.733
And we're given the graph of F of X,

00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:09.681
and of Y equals F of X,

00:00:09.681 --> 00:00:12.077
and the area between F of X,

00:00:12.077 --> 00:00:15.747
and the X-axis over different intervals.

00:00:15.747 --> 00:00:17.218
Well when you look at this,

00:00:17.218 --> 00:00:18.368
you actually don't even have to look

00:00:18.368 --> 00:00:19.507
at this graph over here,

00:00:19.507 --> 00:00:22.030
because in general, if I
have the definite integral

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.135
of any function F of X, D X,

00:00:25.135 --> 00:00:27.933
from let's say, A to the same value,

00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.320
from one value to the same value,

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.928
this is always going to be equal to zero.

00:00:32.928 --> 00:00:34.410
We're going from three to three.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.592
We could be going from
negative pi to negative pi.

00:00:36.592 --> 00:00:38.224
It's always going to be zero.

00:00:38.224 --> 00:00:39.057
One way to think about it,

00:00:39.057 --> 00:00:40.747
we're starting and stopping here at three,

00:00:40.747 --> 00:00:43.614
so we're not capturing any area.

00:00:43.614 --> 00:00:45.399
Let's do another one.

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.102
So here, we want to find
the definite integral

00:00:49.102 --> 00:00:52.019
from seven to four, of F of X, D X.

00:00:55.421 --> 00:00:58.178
So we want to go from seven to four.

00:00:58.178 --> 00:01:01.245
So we want to go from seven to four.

00:01:01.245 --> 00:01:02.642
Now you might be tempted to say,

00:01:02.642 --> 00:01:06.689
okay well look, the area
between F of X and X, is two,

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.039
so maybe this thing is two.

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:12.370
But the key realization
is, this area only applies

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.923
when you have the lower
bound as the lower bound,

00:01:15.923 --> 00:01:19.576
and the higher value as the higher bound.

00:01:19.576 --> 00:01:22.872
So the integral from four to seven

00:01:22.872 --> 00:01:25.122
of F of X, D X, this thing.

00:01:26.865 --> 00:01:28.856
This thing is equal to two.

00:01:28.856 --> 00:01:32.547
This thing is depicting
that area right over there.

00:01:32.547 --> 00:01:34.434
So what about this,
where we've switched it?

00:01:34.434 --> 00:01:35.598
Instead of going from four to seven,

00:01:35.598 --> 00:01:37.125
we're going from seven to four.

00:01:37.125 --> 00:01:40.567
Well the key realization is,
is if you switch the bounds,

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:43.076
this is a key definite integral property,

00:01:43.076 --> 00:01:45.667
that's going to give
you the negative value.

00:01:45.667 --> 00:01:48.593
So this is going to be equal
to the negative of the integral

00:01:48.593 --> 00:01:51.510
from four to seven, of F of X, D X.

00:01:54.286 --> 00:01:57.029
And so this is going to be negative,

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:59.372
and we just figured out the
integral from four to seven

00:01:59.372 --> 00:02:02.041
of F of X, D X, well
now that is this area.

00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:03.846
F of X is above the X-axis.

00:02:03.846 --> 00:02:05.122
It's a positive area.

00:02:05.122 --> 00:02:07.128
So it is going to be,

00:02:07.128 --> 00:02:10.074
so this thing right over
here is going to evaluate

00:02:10.074 --> 00:02:12.921
to positive two, but we have
that negative out front,

00:02:12.921 --> 00:02:17.088
so our original expression
would evaluate to negative two.
