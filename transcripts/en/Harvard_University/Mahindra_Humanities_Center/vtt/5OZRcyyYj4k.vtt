00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.970
Good evening, friends.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.190
I'm Homi Bhabha.

And I'm delighted to
have you here today

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:32.640
in the company of four
extremely interesting analysts

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.600
who will take up this issue
of democracy in distress.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.490
Sreenivasan Jain, who is our
featured speaker and visitor

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.780
at the Humanities Center
is Managing Editor

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.150
of the New Delhi Television,
NDTV, India's most respected 24

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.190
hour news and current
affairs broadcaster.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.900
He anchors an award winning
weekly ground reportage

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.610
and investigative show
called "Truth Versus Hype"

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.480
which focuses on political
corruption, conflict zones,

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.350
and untold stories
of social tensions

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.930
and economic inequalities.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.730
He also anchors a daily show
called "Reality Check" which

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:26.580
aims at debunking official
myths and government propaganda.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.190
He has been with NDTV since 1995
during which he has done stints

NDTV's business channel

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.300
and as head of NDTV Mumbai
bureau for eight years.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.560
Welcome, Vasu.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.520
Sugata Bose is Gardner Professor

and other Visions of
Nationhood and His

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.050
And Majesty's opponent,
Subas Chandra Bose,

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.530
and India's struggle
against empire.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.470
Welcome, Sugata.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.240
Rohit De is a lawyer

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.280
of History at Yale.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.880
His book, A People's
Constitution The Everyday Life

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.030
of Law in the Indian
Republic, explores

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.660
how the Indian Constitution
came to permeate everyday life

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.320
and imagination in India
during its transition

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.310
from a colonial state to
a democratic republic.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.810
Ayesha Jalal is Mary
Richardson Professor of History

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.960
and Director of the South
Asian and Indian Ocean Studies

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.280
at Tufts.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.160
Her books include The
Struggle for Pakistan:

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.550
A Muslim Homeland
and Global Politics

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.550
and The Pity of
Partition Manto's Life,

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:02.200
Times and Works Across
the India-Pakistan Divide.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.180
Now, skeptical as I am
of global descriptions

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.520
and global prescriptions,
I feel somehow

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.590
that the term
democracy in distress

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.710
has a resonance across
several countries

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.150
and indeed continents.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.060
We usually spoke of
democracy in distress

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.660
with an Utopian eye
and a Utopian vision.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.090
The distresses of democracy
were its deficits.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.680
And we often felt that through
political organization,

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.620
legal reformation, we would
be able to actually overcome

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.980
these democratic deficits.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.070
Even though that
might be a very a way.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:05.470
But it was part of a certain
progressive vision that we had,

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.970
what Derrida once called
the democracy to come.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.650
It was an aspiration.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.930
Today, it seems to me, that
various democratic practices

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:26.440
and institutions have somehow
turned against themselves.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.110
Are confronted with a
strange alienating vision

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.640
of the democratic
process as if they

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.250
are struck with a kind
of autoimmune disease.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.950
As if the beast and the body
is being consumed from within.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.000
The democratic body has
turned against itself.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:57.320
As we know that as we bemoan
many anti-democratic movements,

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.480
these are movements that
have been instituted

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.290
through democratic
voting patterns

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.090
and through democratic
institutions.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.630
Whether or not they have
been subject to corruption

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.180
or subject to manipulation
or nepotism is an issue.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.240
But this notion of
an autoimmunity kind

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.710
of a devouring from
within, strikes me

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.060
as this particular
kind of distress

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.327
that we're witnessing now.

00:05:28.327 --> 00:05:30.160
And of course, there
have been other moments

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.320
such as the interwar
period in Europe

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.570
where something very
similar was happening.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.540
But of course today,
this autoimmune disease

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:45.970
afflicts the US, India,
Turkey, Pakistan, Venezuela,

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.840
Philippines.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.450
Of course in each case,
in its different ways.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.060
But I want to
emphasize that this

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.600
is a kind of global condition.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.560
But of course to make the
global a critical hermeneutic,

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.560
we can't simply
rest on comparisons.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.410
We have to talk about
systemic differences

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.380
and structural issues.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.380
There is, we believe, a
crisis in certain voting

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.960
practices and patterns.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.250
A crisis in political volition.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.210
A crisis in
constitutional issues.

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.360
A crisis in
demographic situations.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.480
And a crisis of a kind
and civil society.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.660
What I'm calling the
autoimmune condition,

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.560
the destruction from
within, reminds me

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.880
as I was jotting down
these notes of a statement

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:48.670
by Theodore Adorno
in Minima Moralia.

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:52.660
Well Adorno says
that he was less

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:58.510
threatened by the frank
face, the frank visible face

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:03.100
of fascism than
he was threatened

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:11.180
by the fascistic elements
within social democracy.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:18.540
And it is with this rise of this
peculiar hybrid monster which

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:22.260
has reared its head before
of a democratic process

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:26.266
and a despotic
tyrannical politics

00:07:26.266 --> 00:07:30.860
that I believe we should
concern ourselves today,

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:35.110
this doubly articulated world.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:39.210
One of the issues that
brings me to Basu's

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:44.250
important contribution
today of forms

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:48.720
of democratic
distraction, the forms

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.970
of the perversions
and disfiguring

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:56.430
of what we call free speech and
free expression in the media

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.000
itself.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.940
It seems to me as if there is a
continual speeding up, an over

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:08.910
talking, which produces a kind
of a dialectic of deletion.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:14.880
That the more you hear the
continual facts, the news

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:20.950
cycle as such, that it's very
difficult actually to grasp

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:23.770
a thread, to grasp
an argument, to grasp

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:27.695
a particular direction.

00:08:27.695 --> 00:08:33.000
You know, Gramsci once said,
again very relevantly I think,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.220
the whole question of
hegemonic discourse

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:42.510
should be understood
in media terms

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:46.520
like turning up the
volume of a radio.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:51.210
So the hegemony
creates for itself this

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:54.100
dominating soundscape.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:58.080
And in many democratic
countries initially,

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:04.140
although perhaps not at the end
of the process, voices emerge.

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.590
Voices become fainter,
and fainter, and fainter.

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.890
The effort for representation
becomes more dangerous

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:12.670
and more difficult.

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:17.240
And suddenly, when
we least expect it,

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:23.820
the sounding of the
state is so loud

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.650
that all other
voices are stilled.

00:09:28.185 --> 00:09:34.370
Basu's contribution
has been valiant.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:39.980
In a context in India
where one gets addicted,

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:47.610
it is indeed I am addicted, to
late night political programs.

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:50.430
Where the voices and
the contending voices

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:56.550
are so overwhelming that
you'll hear nothing.

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:59.230
Nobody listens to each other.

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:02.640
But he does have a
kind of weird sedative

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.300
like effect, certainly on me.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.330
I listen to some of these
channels for a while,

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.940
because you feel that there's
going to be some ferment

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:15.040
of discussion, which
of course there isn't.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:19.110
And then you listen to
Basu and others like him

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:25.020
who really try and keep
the sanity of conversation.

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:25.590
The sanity.

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:27.540
Not just the rationality
of conversation,

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:30.930
because Basu is as
interested in political

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:35.230
affect as he is in
political rationality.

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:38.520
But keeping this going
gives you a sense

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:44.850
of the politics you are living
in every day in different ways.

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:49.980
A kind of everyday
encounter with what

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:54.290
is both constitutional and
what is not constitutional.

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.520
It is in this sense
then that I want

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.110
to welcome you to
what I'm sure will

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:04.630
be a remarkable set of
speakers and discussions.

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:09.210
We will try to be energetic
in our engagements

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.010
without erasing each other.

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:17.450
And I hope at the end of
the speakers' contributions,

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:21.930
you will enter wholeheartedly
into the discussion.

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:26.610
Let us mark today
as a day where we

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:29.730
analyze the distresses
of democracy

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:32.310
without adding to them.

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:35.320
Thank you very much
for being with us.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.340
Basu will now speak
for about 30 minutes.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.030
We will then bring up our panel.

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:45.450
And after their contributions
and interventions,

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:49.360
we will ask you to join us
in a larger conversation.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.633
Thank you very much.

00:11:50.633 --> 00:11:54.084
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:15.776 --> 00:12:18.170
Can we just close
that for a sec or?

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:24.180
Thanks.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.340
Thank you, Homi.

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:33.550
Thanks to the Mahindra
Humanities Center,

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:36.200
as well, for inviting me.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.400
It's the dream of every Indian,
or perhaps every South Asian

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.680
to say, I am Harvard returned.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:46.750
So thanks for making
that dream come true.

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:49.720
I can now go back and say, I've
been to Harvard, with of course

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.450
the tiniest footnote for a week.

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.180
But in case anyone
gets in touch,

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.910
do keep the details fuzzy.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:00.520
Because as we know, perception
matters more than reality

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.790
these days.

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:05.080
Now it's tempting when
you are sharing a platform

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.050
with such renowned
academics to try

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:10.840
and sound more knowledgeable
than you actually are.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.390
But I'll stick to
what I know best,

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:15.570
and to which Homi referred.

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:17.590
Which is to describe
to you how we

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:20.740
are trying to use the tools
of everyday journalism

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:24.370
to report on the new
threats to Indian democracy.

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:29.506
And the consequences of that
reportage to us as a media.

00:13:29.506 --> 00:13:31.510
Now one of the
problems we face when

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:36.220
we talk about a crisis of
democracy in South Asia

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:41.300
is that democracy is perpetually
in crisis in South Asia.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:45.880
So that makes it hard to
capture the particular nature

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:49.180
of the present crisis
without running

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:53.080
into what in social media
is called What Aboutry.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.990
You criticize the age of
Modi, and you're immediately

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:58.450
pointed to the excesses
of Indira Gandhi.

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:01.270
In India we've already gone
back to the era of Nehru.

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:04.240
Nehru used to stifle dissent.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.190
This is a global phenomenon.

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:08.547
I'm sure it's very much
the same case here.

00:14:08.547 --> 00:14:10.630
The moment you talk about
how things have worsened

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:12.850
under Trump, you're
immediately referred

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:16.780
to how, well, there was a
huge spike in drone attacks

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:19.550
under Obama and so on.

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:22.390
Now this dilemma came
home more sharply in India

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:26.620
in the fall of 2015 when after
the particularly brutal mob

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:30.280
killing of a Muslim man in Uttar
Pradesh, a province in North

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:34.410
India, on allegations that
he was slaughtering a cow.

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:37.750
And after the shooting to
death of a dissenting scholar,

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:42.850
M. M. Kalburgi in Karnataka, a
large number of Indian writers,

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:45.760
academics, scholars,
and playwrights

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.340
returned their
government awards.

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:51.090
This included the writer,
Nayantara Sahgal, the poet,

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:53.560
Ashok Vajpeyi, and so on.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.750
They claim they were
protesting a growing

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:57.220
climate of intolerance.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:00.160
Or as one of them put
it, an assault on freedom

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.470
of life and expression.

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:04.630
They were immediately
mocked for this

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:07.300
by the establishment
and its supporters

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.820
for making vague protestations.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:12.430
Vigilantism, they
said, is not new.

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:14.530
And dissent has
had a long history

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:18.070
of being stifled in
the Indian Republic.

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:21.310
Which are on the face
of it valid assertions.

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:25.090
Well, thanks to reporting
by us and others,

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:29.140
we now have a fairly powerful
evidence, a mix of data

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:32.050
and anecdotal
reportage, that allows

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:34.660
us to argue that some
things have demonstrably

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:37.480
worsened under this government.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.910
And also why these
new threats are

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:43.130
harder to characterize
than in the past.

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.020
In my view, one
of the reasons is

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:48.860
that the reference points
when we speak about democracy

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:52.600
in distress, about shocks
to Indian democracy,

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.772
tend to be singular
catastrophic events.

00:15:55.772 --> 00:15:57.540
So when we think
about an assault

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:00.030
against democratic
checks and balances,

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:03.660
we immediately think of
The Emergency of 1975.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:07.830
Right, so I think the
point I was trying to make

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:13.440
is that the older patterns
of conceiving of shocks

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:17.850
to Indian democracy in these
singular apocalyptic terms

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:18.450
has changed.

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:21.090
As I mentioned when we
talked about threats

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:23.610
to the institutions
of democracy,

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:25.410
we think of the emergency.

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:28.740
When we think about
threats to India's secular

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.680
fabric, the idea of India
as a liberal democracy,

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.400
we think of the Ayodhya
Movement, the Babri Masjid

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:39.880
Demolition, the Gujarat
Riots of 2002 more recently.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:44.160
Today what we have is a
gradual everyday poisoning

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:48.090
of the collective well
of a million daily regime

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:51.030
backed mutinies, if you will.

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:55.170
Those in positions of authority
are enabling the mainstreaming

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:58.920
at an unprecedented level of
the movements and conspiracy

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.740
theories of the Hindu right.

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:04.950
So instead of a single dramatic
statement of sectarianism

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:09.359
by a big leader like L. K.
Advani during the Ram Temple

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:12.480
Movement, hate speech
has been outsourced

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.150
to countless
subordinates who keep up

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:18.690
a litany of near
daily provocations.

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:20.490
What are some of these
fringe obsessions

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:22.319
that are being amplified?

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:24.930
As we know, the high pitched
noise around cow protection,

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:26.400
for instance.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:30.540
Possibly as a result of that,
instead of a single epic Hindu

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:34.650
Muslim riot, like
Gujarat, we have a series

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:37.620
of smaller conflagrations
where the targets end up

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:38.760
being Muslims.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.640
But these are what the
writer Mukul Kesvan described

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.060
as boutique executions.

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:45.340
What else?

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:47.580
We're seeing the
rapid metastasis

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:49.680
of the idea of Love Jihad.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:54.030
Until recently a largely ignored
virulent right wing conspiracy

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:57.270
about Muslim men wooing
and converting Hindu women

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:59.610
on false pretenses.

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:02.920
Similarly, instead of the
promestra of emergency.

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:05.840
Promestra being a mythological
term, an equivalent

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.960
to a sort of nuclear button.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:11.340
Use the method of
1,000 cuts to wear down

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.200
the institutions of democracy.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.930
Be it the judiciary, the
investigative agencies,

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:19.650
parliament, the courts,
and of course the one

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:22.080
for which I work, the media.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.780
Now all this is no
longer liberal paranoia

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:27.500
unmoored from facts.

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.350
We have, as I mentioned, been
doing considerable amount

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:32.010
of reportage around this.

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.500
And I think of this
as counting hate.

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:39.020
Or to be a little more dramatic,
counting political evil.

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:42.320
In April this year, we set out
to tabulate hateful comments

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:46.310
made by high ranking Indian
political figures, ministers,

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:50.870
governors, chief ministers of
Indian provincial assemblies,

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:54.200
members of parliament, members
of legislative assemblies,

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.290
party bosses and so on.

00:18:56.290 --> 00:19:00.320
By hate speech we meant comments
that are directly bigoted

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.960
or use dog whistles,
target minorities,

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.670
and call for violence.

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:06.590
These were sourced
from the public domain

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:09.530
by scrolling through
thousands of entries.

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:12.770
This phenomenon, and let's
now put up the first slide,

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:15.350
we call it VIP
Hate Speech, which

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:17.710
is not new in Indian politics.

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:21.330
But has risen dramatically
under the Modi government.

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:25.640
520% increase in the
past 4 and 1/2 years

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:29.870
compared to the previous
years under the Congress.

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:31.790
From May 2014 to
the present, there

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:36.230
have been 131 instances of
VIP Hate Speech compared to 21

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:38.480
instances under the Congress.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.090
If you could just
change the slide.

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:45.470
Now 90% of the
hateful comments made

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:47.840
during this
particular government

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:52.020
under the government's watch are
by the BJP and its politicians.

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:55.010
In only 6 cases, 5%
of all instances,

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:57.230
is there evidence
of a politician

00:19:57.230 --> 00:20:01.140
being reprimanded or cautioned
or issuing a public apology.

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:06.890
95% percent of the time, the
VIP hater faced no consequence.

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:10.090
Far from it, we found
VIP haters get promoted.

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:13.880
And that a significant number
of them are multiple offenders.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.850
Not surprisingly, a
significant number

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:20.750
of those hateful comments
are about threats

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:21.680
to the Indian cow.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.410
Let me play you a little
clip, the entire program

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:25.910
that we aired was
an hour long, I'll

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:28.240
just play you a
short clip from it

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.370
of some of the key
excerpts that will give you

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:35.920
a sense of the sort of
comments that are being made.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:36.465
All right.

00:20:36.465 --> 00:20:39.440
And further proof that
hate has no consequences,

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:44.670
in 21 cases the VIP hater
has been a repeat offender.

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:47.030
Here are the most
notorious repeat offenders

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:49.430
starting with a BJP [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.660
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:21:51.485 --> 00:21:53.710
Now, a significant number
of instances of hate speech

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:56.380
also invoked the rhetoric
of cow protection, something

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.840
that has gained currency
under this government.

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:02.680
Elected leaders, including MPs,
MLAs, and even Chief Ministers,

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.660
have used the
language of vigilantes

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:07.450
while calling for violence
against those who kill cows.

00:22:13.807 --> 00:22:17.450
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:54.330
Another popular
theme of VIP haters

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:57.510
was repeated attempts to
delegitimize the Muslim faith,

00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:00.600
urging Muslims to accept
their Hindu ancestry,

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.150
and inciting fears
of a Muslim takeover

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:06.625
by playing on fears of
their excessive fertility.

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.130
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:29.580
Subramanian Swamy also tweeting
on this again and again

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.754
about how Muslims should
accept that they're Hindu.

00:23:31.754 --> 00:23:33.920
Too many Tweets for us to
list all of them, but here

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:34.740
is just a sampling.

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:41.757
And also Sorendea Singh,
BJP MLA about Muslims

00:23:41.757 --> 00:23:43.340
having to assimilate
into the country.

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:46.690
Those who are free
[INAUDIBLE] are free to leave.

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:49.190
Another BJP MP,
don't try to tell us.

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:51.310
We won't tolerate
insults to the community.

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:53.510
Let's decide a date and
take call on the Muslims.

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:54.260
And what have you.

00:24:00.486 --> 00:24:05.200
OK, so you can imagine
that was just a sampling.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.870
This is a volcano
of hate speech,

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:11.511
provocative speech by leading
politicians and establishment

00:24:11.511 --> 00:24:12.010
figures.

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:13.390
These are not fringe elements.

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:17.530
As I said, we only selected
those who hold high office.

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:19.750
And if I was trying
to characterize

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:21.250
what has changed,
again, coming back

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:23.920
to the dilemma of these
award returning intellectuals

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.230
who are trying to give
voice to their anxiety.

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:27.920
That intolerance
was on the rise.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.550
This is what actually
has spiked dramatically.

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:34.870
This kind of high level
bigotry and this kind

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:38.240
of high level
legitimizing of hate.

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.390
Now we conducted
a similar exercise

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:44.040
in counting vigilante attacks
in the name of the cow.

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.030
If I can just play
you the next clip,

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:51.280
these are just a
sampling of the videos

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:54.760
that are made of these attacks.

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.610
And these are videos that are
often made on cell phones.

00:24:57.610 --> 00:24:59.350
If we can just play
that for a second?

00:25:02.786 --> 00:25:06.070
So for those who may not be
familiar with this phenomenon,

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:10.512
these are mostly Muslims who are
often beaten to death, mostly

00:25:10.512 --> 00:25:12.220
by Hindu mobs on the
pretext that they're

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:13.990
slaughtering cows
or transporting

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:15.970
cows for slaughter.

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:21.140
These are incidents that are
happening all over India.

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:24.652
The beatings often take place
in a very leisurely way.

00:25:24.652 --> 00:25:26.110
There seems to be
no great pressure

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:28.990
of any kind of intervention
from the police.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.670
According to the research--

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:40.110
If we can just go
back to a slides.

00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:41.960
So right.

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.800
Now, when we counted we
found that these sorts

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.800
of attacks, vigilante attacks,
have also dramatically risen.

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.160
They've gone up almost
9,000% under the life

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:55.520
of this government compared
to the previous Congress

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:56.350
government.

00:25:56.350 --> 00:26:00.020
35 have been killed
in the past 4.5 years.

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:03.220
None that we could
find under UPA2.

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:06.200
90% of those that are
killed are Muslim.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.210
So that's an average
of one Muslim that's

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:11.930
been killed every two
months under the watch

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:13.760
of the present government.

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.070
Just to point out that
this is open source data

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:19.015
collection done by
us and by IndiaSpend,

00:26:19.015 --> 00:26:20.390
which is a fact
checking website.

00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:22.370
But this is by no
means comprehensive,

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:23.936
as with the hate tracker.

00:26:23.936 --> 00:26:25.310
And we've left it
open for people

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:26.643
to come in and make suggestions.

00:26:26.643 --> 00:26:30.390
But so far, these figures
have not been challenged.

00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:31.730
Is there another slide?

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:32.300
Right, sorry.

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:35.120
This is just more
on similar lines.

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:38.450
Now moving on to the
government's response.

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:41.420
The response tends to
be, this is terrible.

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:43.670
But the regime has
nothing to do with it.

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:46.280
We the government condemn
violence and order

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.950
that all offenders
be brought to book.

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:52.910
But we just heard from
the establishment itself

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:58.070
how they, in a sense, legitimize
this kind of violence.

00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:59.360
I'll give you more examples.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:01.170
I'm going to now
play for you a clip.

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:02.870
This was a hidden
camera investigation

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:05.030
we did into a lynching
that happened this year

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:06.210
in Uttar Pravesh.

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:10.550
The accused in so many
cases walk out on bail.

00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:12.080
Because the courts
say the police

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.690
failed to provide
convincing evidence.

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:16.880
We sent a team armed
with a hidden camera

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:21.080
to talk to some of the accused,
posing as sympathizers.

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:24.750
Just listen to how confidently
they both admit to the crime,

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:28.454
and also to the
tasset of open support

00:27:28.454 --> 00:27:29.870
they're receiving
from the police.

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.790
Doing field research on
[INAUDIBLE] and Hindutva

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:42.200
outfit, we asked Rakesh
that whether he was

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.510
pleased with what he had done.

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:47.120
Rakesh not only
admitted that he did

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:51.180
play a role in the lynching,
but also that it was very much

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:52.650
related to cow slaughter.

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:54.590
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:19.720
He said, even while in
jail for five weeks,

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:24.060
he proudly declared what he had
done before jail authorities.

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:50.020
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:54.280
He says he was released from
bail to a hero's welcome, which

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:58.955
has only added to the numbers
of what he calls his mini army.

00:28:58.955 --> 00:29:00.520
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:33.830
The only mistake he claims is
that his boys made cell phone

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:35.070
videos.

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:36.690
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:59.050
He also said that the
police was in their favor,

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:01.290
unlike in the earlier regime.

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:33.342
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:30:33.342 --> 00:30:36.250
In the video, Qadim
badly wounded,

00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:39.960
a bystander is hurt, asking
for him to be given water.

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.350
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:47.140
This is Rakesh's
chilling response.

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:49.370
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:16.050
So there is--

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:18.950
I know that was a very
distressing video.

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:22.220
But there has been some
sort of positive outcome

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:24.800
of this, at least on paper.

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.336
The police have
said that they've

00:31:26.336 --> 00:31:27.710
taken this thing
that we've done,

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:31.490
we did it to a few other
cases as well, as evidence.

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:33.380
There is a provision
under the Indian law

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:36.410
in which they can admit this
as extrajudicial confession.

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:38.270
And they've moved the
court to try and see

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:39.890
if they can rearrest these men.

00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:42.470
But we'll have to wait
and see if that happens.

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:45.230
The Supreme Court has
also opened an inquiry

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:49.250
into the absence of an
effective prosecution of this

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:53.180
and some of the other
vigilante cases by the police.

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:56.450
The third element, which I
mentioned, before I wrap up

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:58.100
with of course, Love Jihad.

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:01.760
Now this is not something which
is easy to compile data on.

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:04.850
But there is a mass
of anecdotal evidence

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:08.630
of how the BJP leadership,
local as well as national,

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:11.240
in many cases have
created a noise.

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:15.020
In some cases, almost
enabling a near riot situation

00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:17.756
over bogus claims of Love Jihad.

00:32:17.756 --> 00:32:19.130
I'm going to play
you next a clip

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:23.310
from a particular egregious
example from Meerut

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:26.180
in Uttar Pradesh in 2014.

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:30.410
Where right wing groups led
by local BJP politicians

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:36.260
claim that a young Hindu woman
had been seduced by a Muslim,

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:40.640
gang raped in a madrassa,
which is a Muslim seminary.

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:43.190
Including by a
maulana or a cleric.

00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:48.350
Impregnated, converted to Islam,
and then her baby was aborted.

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:50.040
This was the claim.

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.230
Based on the young
woman's testimony,

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:54.390
the police arrested a
number of local Muslims

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:57.330
and there was a near
riot in that area.

00:32:57.330 --> 00:33:00.450
When we went down there,
we found multiple anomalies

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:02.940
in the version that the
right wing had claimed,

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:06.360
as well as which the girl
had been coerced to repeat.

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.105
It was a case, as many
of these cases are,

00:33:09.105 --> 00:33:12.060
of simply criminalizing
and politicizing

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:14.010
an interfaith relationship.

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:19.110
Now, the entire video of the
entire unraveling of the story

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:20.850
was over a much
longer documentary.

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:22.440
But in the interest
of time, we're

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:23.940
just going to play
you a short clip.

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:37.520
In the village of Aurangabad,
and out from Meerat,

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:42.280
a VHP village meeting to warn
of a Love Jihad epidemic.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:34:02.430
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:04.890
Not too many in the
audience have heard of it.

00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:12.150
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:14.489
Which is why the
constant repetition

00:34:14.489 --> 00:34:15.900
of the merit episode.

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:17.810
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:32.460
The stakes so high
that the young woman

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.400
at the heart of the storm
has been pushed into making

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:37.340
her own defense public.

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:48.300
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:50.190
But the police see it
right from the start.

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:52.610
There have been inconsistencies.

00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:55.409
In the FIR registered
on the 3rd of August,

00:34:55.409 --> 00:34:58.860
she says the abduction took
place on the 23rd of July

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:02.590
and the rape occurred on the
same day in a madrassa in Hapur

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:05.010
by Nawab and four unnamed men.

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:10.050
But in her medical
examination on the same day,

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:13.380
she told the doctor the rape
occurred on the 29th of June

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:14.970
in an open field.

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:17.580
Two days later in a
more detailed statement

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:19.770
before the magistrate,
she goes back

00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:22.610
to saying that the rape
occurred in the Hapur madrassa.

00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:26.940
But the rapists were two men,
Nawab and a boy called Shanu.

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:30.790
Sanaullah, she says, molested
but did not rape her.

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:48.270
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:51.240
In the village, they claimed
the answers to the mystery lie

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:53.855
with a young man from
a neighboring village.

00:35:53.855 --> 00:35:55.800
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:19.410
In the Meerat
government hospital

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:22.050
where her surgery was
performed, the papers

00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:25.980
are signed by a Kaleem posing as
her husband, a signature which

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:27.520
has led to his arrest.

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:30.000
Actually, there was no
female attending with her.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.150
And there were two
guys with the herd.

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:36.216
Out of them, one was
presenting as her husband.

00:36:36.216 --> 00:36:38.340
And I don't know whether
he was her husband or not.

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:40.620
And she came as
an emergency case,

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:43.560
as a case of ruptured
ectopic pregnancy.

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:46.410
And at that time, it was
not a highlighted case.

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:48.750
She came to us as
a simple patient.

00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:51.360
And for that,
emergency laparotomy

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:53.720
has to be done to save her life.

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:57.740
But in her statement, she
names Shanu not Kaleem.

00:36:57.740 --> 00:36:59.920
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:29.070
Sima Mischa works
with a group that

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:31.710
has had couples who
faced risks for having

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:33.960
broken family taboos.

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:37.600
To her, the Meerat incident
follows a familiar pattern.

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:42.960
What I find is very common
is adult men and women get

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:47.280
into relationships and when
the families don't like it,

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:49.090
then all hell breaks loose.

00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:51.390
And they go off and file a
whole lot of criminal cases

00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:52.920
against the boy.

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:54.700
And the police then forces them.

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:56.610
It's a typical
pattern that we've

00:37:56.610 --> 00:37:59.079
been working in the Uttar
Pradesh for the last 10 years

00:37:59.079 --> 00:38:00.120
I've seen this happening.

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:03.720
And there's so much pressure on
the girl to take the girl back.

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:04.830
Let me say this.

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:07.590
This is not about
discrediting the testimony

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:09.030
of a rape survivor.

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:11.910
We know how difficult it
is for women to speak up

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:13.350
about sexual violence.

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:15.600
But here's the problem
with the Meerat case.

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:18.960
That the [INAUDIBLE] has
already pronounced its verdict

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.960
without factoring in any
of these inconsistencies.

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:25.110
Even while the investigation
is at a nascent stage.

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:28.140
Now this places the
individuals at the heart of it

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:29.320
at great risk.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:32.435
But also has incendiary
social repercussions.

00:38:32.435 --> 00:38:37.720
And hence the need to look
closely at the Meerat episode.

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:41.080
Right, let's just pull
up that last image.

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:44.800
So this was an instance
where actually there

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:47.200
was a happy ending.

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:50.050
This is the young woman
that we just interviewed.

00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:53.590
So she finally came out in the
open, along with her partner

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:55.660
Kaleem, the person
whose identity

00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:57.160
she was hiding throughout.

00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:00.280
And who she had actually
named as an accomplice.

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.230
So they couldn't control--

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:04.720
they couldn't contain
the emotions anymore.

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:07.116
And they broke against
the family taboo.

00:39:07.116 --> 00:39:08.740
They broke against
the kind of pressure

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:12.040
that was being placed by
the political forces that

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:13.090
had got involved.

00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:14.430
And they got married.

00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:17.980
And for a while, they
lived in police custody--

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:20.380
not in police custody, but
under police protection.

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:23.070
But finally, now, they're
able to come out of that

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:25.050
and they are united.

00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:27.400
But it just gives
you one more example

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:32.140
of how just ordinary
interfaith relationships get

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:34.180
criminalized and politicized.

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:38.750
And that really is the
story of how this Love Jihad

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:40.720
myth has been built up.

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:43.060
So in conclusion, I'll
say there are more video.

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:44.620
But we're running short of time.

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:49.420
So I'll wrap up and then we
can take more of these aspects

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:50.610
into the discussion.

00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:54.130
That it could be argued that
the slow poisoning of the well,

00:39:54.130 --> 00:40:00.100
or the air, is as if not more
toxic than egregious shocks

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:03.070
and the egregious crimes
on Indian democracy

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:04.570
by past political regimes.

00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:05.734
Thank you very much.

00:40:05.734 --> 00:40:09.052
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:12.130
Thanks.

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:13.380
Thanks a lot.

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:15.891
And thank you so much,
Julia, for gamely

00:40:15.891 --> 00:40:16.890
playing all those clips.

00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:18.736
Thanks very much, indeed.

00:40:18.736 --> 00:40:20.566
Thank you so much, Basu.

00:40:20.566 --> 00:40:26.112
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:40:37.656 --> 00:40:39.120
Basu, thank you so much.

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:41.600
That is really quite--

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:45.270
I mean, for those of us who've
been in India frequently,

00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:50.640
it both rings true, but
it also rings horrific.

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:52.550
Let me start with Ayesha.

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:55.320
Ayesha, your comments
and reflections.

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:59.132
I've asked everybody to speak
between 8 and 10 minutes,

00:40:59.132 --> 00:41:00.090
and then we'll open up.

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:00.900
So please.

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:02.879
I mean, what's not
clear is whether we're

00:41:02.879 --> 00:41:04.170
supposed to respond to him or--

00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:05.400
You're supposed to
respond and you're

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:07.310
supposed to say whatever
you have in mind.

00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:09.440
So you can do both things.

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:12.950
Well, thank you very much,
Homi, for inviting me

00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:16.410
to the Humanities
Center at Harvard.

00:41:16.410 --> 00:41:19.500
I mean, the subject
is obviously has--

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:21.750
one can approach
it at many levels.

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:26.400
But I do want to say that
democracy as you pointed out,

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.980
has been in distress
in South Asia.

00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:31.126
Certainly in Pakistan.

00:41:31.126 --> 00:41:33.590
And many years
ago, I wrote a book

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:37.740
talking about the stresses and
strains of postcolonial nation

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:40.080
states with particular
reference to South Asia.

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:42.750
And I made the
point that neither

00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:47.550
was democracy the
antithetical entity,

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:50.130
opposite to authoritarianism,
but they were implicated.

00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:52.410
And it was about
dominance and resistance

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:53.740
and it's an ongoing struggle.

00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:57.600
And my only comment
to the presentation

00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.760
here is that while--

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:01.350
none of this surprised me.

00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:05.850
I of course, recognize that
this is happening quite broadly

00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:07.700
in South Asia.

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:10.500
And I do think that the
media is being targeted.

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:13.560
But the media is also
part of the problem

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:16.160
in terms of the way in which
this is being reported.

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:18.940
I'm not really talking about
your media, your house.

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:22.830
But certainly I think
that what I'm referring to

00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:25.410
is not simply democracy
in numbers here.

00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:27.120
I'm talking about narratives.

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:28.920
I'm talking about
national narratives.

00:42:31.530 --> 00:42:35.400
Unquestioned ones, certainly
in India, about the Muslim,

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:37.260
about partition, about Pakistan.

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:40.110
All these factors
play a role, which

00:42:40.110 --> 00:42:44.010
give these elements that you
speak about so eloquently,

00:42:44.010 --> 00:42:47.970
the opportunity to carry out
whatever they are carrying out.

00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:49.980
So the complicity
of those who are

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:53.130
the great upholders of democracy
must be called into question

00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:54.020
here, as well.

00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:57.730
Because without that complicity,
none of this is possible.

00:42:57.730 --> 00:43:00.180
So whilst you talk about
the role of the state

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:03.250
quite eloquently and clearly,
this is only possible in India,

00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:05.446
because the state tolerates it.

00:43:05.446 --> 00:43:08.250
But I can sort of say a
many things about Pakistan

00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:10.110
from which I think
India could learn.

00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:12.370
Because Pakistan
has a head start

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:16.640
in how to control our
democracy, muzzle it completely.

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:19.020
So let me just say a few
things about Pakistan

00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:21.360
so that might sort of
be indicative of where

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:23.340
you're going.

00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:26.310
We recently had an election,
I happened to be watching it.

00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:29.230
There were many theories
about this election,

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:30.300
what was going on.

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:34.940
The most interesting thing was,
of course, the pre-electoral,

00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:37.260
the run up to the election
and the narratives that

00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:40.770
were dominant at that stage,
the unquestioned narratives

00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:44.460
that you were referring to,
as well, in the case of India.

00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:47.750
And it was clear that these
were quite orchestrated.

00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:49.590
These were not just
happening, they

00:43:49.590 --> 00:43:51.590
were orchestrated narratives.

00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:54.090
So there were various theories
about what was going on.

00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:57.300
Everybody was talking about
election being manipulated.

00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:00.120
And I won't bore you with
the details from the census

00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:03.030
to the constituency
delimitation.

00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:05.760
But I will talk
about the narratives

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:07.080
that preceded the election.

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:09.810
Of course, there had
been a soft coup the year

00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:13.020
before that some of you
probably never noticed in July.

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:16.550
When a prime minister was
simply removed by the judiciary.

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:18.690
But in the case of the
run up to the election,

00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:19.980
it was not just manipulated.

00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:22.770
But there was an extraordinary
buy-in of one channel

00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:24.000
after the other.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.590
Every channel was behind
it barring one or two.

00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:30.620
They fell in line, too,
after the election.

00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:32.370
So what I'm trying
to say is that in

00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:35.010
this great democratic tradition
what you are witnessing

00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:38.970
is a great consensus building by
the media, which then generates

00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:45.800
the kind of atmosphere for these
sorts of outrageous egregious

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:47.850
behavior.

00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:49.290
I can recount all of that.

00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:53.090
But it also lends legitimacy
to certain actions that are--

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:56.110
by giving it the
narrative of religiosity.

00:44:56.110 --> 00:44:58.800
Now what you described to
me for the last half hour

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:01.890
is nothing but politics.

00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:04.380
But what you have thrown
in are Hindus and Muslims

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:06.630
and it gets some
religiosity involved here.

00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:07.930
But this is politics.

00:45:07.930 --> 00:45:11.760
This is electoral manipulation,
electoral mobilization.

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:14.480
The same thing
happens in Pakistan.

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:17.940
But in Pakistan's
case, the theory

00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:19.440
about what happened
in the election

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:21.589
was what has always
happened, what's new?

00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:22.130
The minister.

00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:22.730
What's new?

00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:25.760
The military has all--
the military establishment

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:27.300
always intervenes.

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:28.535
So this is the same.

00:45:28.535 --> 00:45:31.220
The second theory
was that, no, this

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:34.100
is a time when there is
a push back from society.

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:36.360
So they're working extra
hard to manipulate.

00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:38.420
This is a sign that
why are they going

00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:40.400
so hard against social media.

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.285
This is because people
are going to be--

00:45:42.285 --> 00:45:43.149
it's effective.

00:45:43.149 --> 00:45:44.690
And people are
beginning to challenge

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:49.160
the authoritarian strains
of the Pakistani state.

00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:52.700
The third, which I think
actually explains the first two

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:55.720
and brings them together,
is the role of the media.

00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:59.060
Now the Pakistani
establishment by which

00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:03.470
we refer to the non-elected
institutions, the military,

00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:05.692
the bureaucracy, the judiciary.

00:46:05.692 --> 00:46:10.880
The establishment
has for a long time

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:13.850
played a role in
elections, of course.

00:46:13.850 --> 00:46:19.100
But this time around, I think
the role was more direct.

00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:22.190
In this instance, it was the
judiciary working hand in glove

00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:26.090
with the military to
get the positive result

00:46:26.090 --> 00:46:28.920
that they wanted with
the media playing a role.

00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:31.970
And so this time what was
surprising for me in Pakistan

00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:34.070
was the attack on the media.

00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:38.360
The main media houses,
GO followed by Dawn,

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:41.720
clearly the military now wants
to dominate the narrative.

00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:44.510
But as is always the
case with attempts

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:48.710
at domination and control,
there's always a slippage.

00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:50.960
Historically we have
seen, and I think

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:54.620
I saw my friend
[INAUDIBLE] sitting here.

00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:59.780
Turkey and [INAUDIBLE] what they
tried to do, I mean, it sort of

00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:01.070
backfired on them.

00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:03.530
You can only do so
much controlling

00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:05.240
to get positive results.

00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:07.840
Because in the case
of the Evren period,

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:10.190
the youth utilization
of right wing

00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:12.110
against left wing,
which then comes

00:47:12.110 --> 00:47:15.467
to haunt them in the form of the
variety of right wing parties

00:47:15.467 --> 00:47:16.550
that they have to control.

00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:21.260
I think this is where I feel
that the correction sets in

00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:23.750
for such attempts.

00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:28.100
I think that the real joker in
the pack in Pakistan is going

00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:31.730
to prove to be governance, which
I think cannot be controlled.

00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:34.370
You can put anybody in
place, but the real beauty

00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:38.180
of the whole system in
terms of the results

00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:39.912
will lie of who can deliver.

00:47:39.912 --> 00:47:41.870
And there's a big question
mark whether anybody

00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:45.950
can deliver, which I think is
the real issue of distracting

00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:49.170
people with cow slaughter,
with this, that, or the other.

00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:52.070
Which you were also referring
to the distractive politics,

00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:54.320
the disassociating politics.

00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:57.350
I think this is what is
the distress of democracy.

00:47:57.350 --> 00:47:59.270
But my lot-- Am I at 10 minutes?

00:47:59.270 --> 00:48:01.820
My last comment is that
in Pakistan at least

00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:04.190
it's been foisted upon
the people of Pakistan

00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:08.319
by the non-elected institutions,
notably the military.

00:48:08.319 --> 00:48:09.860
There've been military
interventions.

00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:12.890
But I think the worry for India
is that Indians themselves

00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:14.770
are doing this to themselves.

00:48:14.770 --> 00:48:16.670
They are electing
such governments.

00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:19.710
So I think therein lies
the challenge for India.

00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:23.540
Whether you do, in fact, have
people with the right mind

00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:26.030
and boldness to speak
up and fight back.

00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:28.550
In Pakistan, Pakistanis
are fighting military rule

00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:29.970
as best as they can.

00:48:29.970 --> 00:48:33.130
And even governments that
the military puts up.

00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:35.030
But that story is continuing.

00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:37.460
But what is worrying
is the gap that

00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:40.160
seems to be increasing
between how much people

00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:42.810
are becoming complicit
just without realizing.

00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:43.310
Thank you.

00:48:43.310 --> 00:48:44.930
Thank you very much, Ayesha.

00:48:44.930 --> 00:48:47.480
I think this whole
issue of complicity

00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:50.000
creates a kind of fine
echo and resonance

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.460
between the two accounts.

00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:54.950
Ayesha did bring in the
issue of the military.

00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:56.700
Of course, it's a
different kind of state,

00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:59.390
but I think that's a very
important distinction to make.

00:48:59.390 --> 00:49:02.180
But also the relationship
between the media

00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:03.180
and judiciary.

00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:06.770
I just want to mark that, your
idea of judiciary and the media

00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:07.670
was a new issue.

00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:10.790
I talked about distraction
in the earlier--

00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:12.270
in my introductory remarks.

00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:14.870
But I did not talk about
the judiciary nor did you.

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:17.060
And rather than the
military, we seem

00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:19.690
to see the arm of the
police being used.

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:21.860
So I think police
versus military,

00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:23.360
question of judiciary.

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:26.820
These are questions that
Ayesha has put on the table.

00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:27.760
Thank you very much.

00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:28.259
Sugata.

00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:33.490
Thank you very much.

00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:42.840
Since Basu focused on this
awful spectacle of lynchings,

00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:51.180
let me begin by reading a
short passage from a book that

00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:56.510
was published over 100 years
ago by Rabindranath Tagore.

00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:59.850
And towards the
end of that book,

00:49:59.850 --> 00:50:05.370
in an essay titled
"Nationalism in India",

00:50:05.370 --> 00:50:09.600
Tagore said a few things
both about the United States

00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:14.880
and India that sound like
an uncanny foretelling

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:19.990
of the crises that both
our countries face today.

00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:23.340
So Tagore criticized the
anti-Asiatic agitations

00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:26.940
in America for depriving
the aliens of their right

00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:30.270
to earn their honest
living on these shores.

00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:33.180
Either you shut your
doors against the aliens

00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:38.400
or reduce them into slavery,
Tagore said in his rebuke.

00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:40.110
And he had something
even more perceptive

00:50:40.110 --> 00:50:44.160
and far sighted to say about the
tyranny of social restrictions

00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:45.780
in India.

00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:48.330
The social habit
of mind, he wrote,

00:50:48.330 --> 00:50:52.230
which impels us to make the life
of our fellow beings a burden

00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:55.200
to them, where they
differ from us even

00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:57.720
in such a thing as
their choice of food,

00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:00.960
is sure to persist in our
political organizatio.

00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:04.260
And result in creating
engines of coercion

00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:06.750
to crush every rational
difference, which

00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:08.580
is the sign of life.

00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:13.530
And tyranny will only add to the
inevitable lies and hypocrisy

00:51:13.530 --> 00:51:16.050
in our political life.

00:51:16.050 --> 00:51:24.910
Now I entered Parliament
on an unhappy day,

00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:29.300
the 16th of May 2014.

00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:32.880
That was the day
that Narendra Modi

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:39.940
led BJP won a clear majority
in India's Parliament.

00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:46.650
And one of the features
of Modi's campaign

00:51:46.650 --> 00:51:52.740
was the tendency to use
the language of citizenship

00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:59.400
to mask a discrimination along
lines of religion, language,

00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:00.970
and ethnicity.

00:52:00.970 --> 00:52:04.080
So during the
campaign, he had said

00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:07.470
that on the 16th of
May 2014, he would

00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:12.510
drive all illegal
immigrants across the border

00:52:12.510 --> 00:52:14.560
of Bangladesh.

00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:19.140
Modi had spoken about
illegal immigrants

00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:23.880
two years before Trump did
more or less the same thing

00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:28.560
during his campaign in 2016.

00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:32.610
I gave my first
speech in Parliament

00:52:32.610 --> 00:52:35.670
on the same day
as Narendra Modi.

00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:40.720
And that was noted by the
media, including Basu's NDTV.

00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:43.470
And towards the
end of that speech,

00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:47.910
I made reference to
perhaps what could

00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:52.050
be regarded as the first
lynching of the Modi era.

00:52:52.050 --> 00:52:55.410
This one was not directly
related to Karl vigilantism.

00:52:55.410 --> 00:52:57.810
But this is what happened.

00:52:57.810 --> 00:53:00.720
As I said, we mourn the
death of Mohsin Shaikh

00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:03.450
the young computer
engineer in Pune.

00:53:03.450 --> 00:53:06.180
He belonged to the
so-called aspirational class

00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:09.690
whose dreams for the future
had been fired by the election

00:53:09.690 --> 00:53:11.940
campaign of the ruling party.

00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:14.130
He did not live to
see the [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:53:14.130 --> 00:53:17.340
the good times which this
government promises to usher

00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:18.180
in.

00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:22.440
His only fault was that he wore
his identity in his headgear

00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:27.120
and attire as he returned home
after praying to the almighty.

00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:29.700
Hockey sticks that had
once done our nation

00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:32.100
proud in the world
of sports were

00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:38.280
used as weapons to bludgeon
the expression of diversity.

00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:42.570
Now after that, of course, there
were several other incidents

00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:44.340
of lynching.

00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:52.800
And what I would say is that the
one that was not specifically

00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:57.270
mentioned by Basu
was the killing

00:53:57.270 --> 00:54:00.450
of Muhammad Akhlaq
on the suspicion

00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:04.200
that he had stored beef
in his refrigerator.

00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:08.400
And it was in the aftermath
of that kind of killing

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:12.120
and the return of awards
by writers and scholars

00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:15.180
and so on that there was
a debate in Parliament

00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:18.720
on quote unquote "growing
intolerance in India."

00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:21.340
And the term intolerance
is, of course,

00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:26.100
just a euphemism for a wave
of unreason and humanity

00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:28.710
that was sweeping the country.

00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:33.900
On that occasion, I decided to
consult my young friend Rohit

00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:38.940
De and spoke mostly about
constitutional morality.

00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:41.190
The way in which
Ambedkar had spoken

00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:45.930
about it and other members
of the constituent assembly.

00:54:45.930 --> 00:54:48.600
But even in that
speech towards the end,

00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:51.330
I again had to mourn a death.

00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:55.260
And I said I had mourned
the death of Mohsin Shaikh,

00:54:55.260 --> 00:54:57.480
the computer engineer in Pune.

00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:00.450
This happened days after the
new government took power.

00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:03.660
Today I mourn the death of
Muhammad Akhlaq and others

00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:06.660
who have been victims in
recent months of the poison

00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:09.390
of religious hatred.

00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:11.490
In the name of
bygone generations

00:55:11.490 --> 00:55:14.190
that have welded the Indian
people into a nation,

00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:17.640
I invoke the noble meaning
of the word Akhlaq.

00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:19.530
What does Akhlaq mean?

00:55:19.530 --> 00:55:21.120
It means ethics.

00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:24.300
And I urge those who hold the
reins of power in our country

00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:27.990
today, especially our Prime
Minister and our Home Minister,

00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:31.200
to uphold the fundamental right
to life and liberty of all

00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:34.300
our citizens and
abide by Akhlaq,

00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:37.500
the ethics of good governance
that have informed the very

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:43.600
best of Indian political thought
and practice through the ages.

00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:48.760
Now in addition to the
kind of hate speech

00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:54.060
that you heard played by people
holding important offices,

00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:58.830
there is something else that
also needs to be underlined.

00:55:58.830 --> 00:56:06.300
And that is the feeblest of
disavowels or disapprovals

00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:11.250
coming from those occupying the
top most echelons of government

00:56:11.250 --> 00:56:16.890
when these kinds of horrendous
lynchings have taken place.

00:56:16.890 --> 00:56:21.600
And you know, Modi has
been typically very late

00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:24.390
and then he has not
been unambiguous

00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:25.900
in the condemnation.

00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:32.540
And so this is in some
ways a part of a strategy.

00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:37.830
It is in some ways more
insidious than bigger riots

00:56:37.830 --> 00:56:42.870
or even pogroms of the sort
that we saw in Gujarat in 2002.

00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:45.660
You simply have to
make a spectacle

00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:48.900
of killing one person or two.

00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:55.180
And doing so you can then
terrify an entire community.

00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:58.830
And this is what is being
done to the Muslims and Dalits

00:56:58.830 --> 00:57:00.190
in our country today.

00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:04.290
So it is very much a
part of the strategy that

00:57:04.290 --> 00:57:10.560
has been adopted by those
who basically confuse

00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:18.000
religious majoritarianism with
democracy and deliberately so.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:22.010
So I think I'll stop my
initial comments here,

00:57:22.010 --> 00:57:26.550
excepting that I did want to
say a few words about what

00:57:26.550 --> 00:57:31.050
has happened in terms of
another kind of institution

00:57:31.050 --> 00:57:33.530
that has been
under grave threat.

00:57:33.530 --> 00:57:37.020
And I can speak about it
in question and answer.

00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:41.010
And this is what has been done
to the institutions of higher

00:57:41.010 --> 00:57:43.540
education in our country.

00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:45.750
And once again, there
was a major debate

00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:51.510
in February of 2016 on
the current situation

00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:53.950
in universities in our country.

00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:56.340
This happened soon
after the suicide

00:57:56.340 --> 00:58:01.030
of Rohith Vemula of
Hyderabad Central University.

00:58:01.030 --> 00:58:03.330
And what has happened
in our country

00:58:03.330 --> 00:58:08.070
is that people from
marginalized backgrounds

00:58:08.070 --> 00:58:11.680
have been given access
to our universities,

00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:14.070
including our
central universities.

00:58:14.070 --> 00:58:20.340
But they have not really been
included as equal citizens.

00:58:20.340 --> 00:58:24.630
So there was neglect
before, but now there

00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:27.840
is direct onslaught
by the state forces.

00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:31.320
And soon after the
Hyderabad incident,

00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:33.480
and I spoke about
Rohith Vemula suicide

00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:36.780
in the course of
my speech, there

00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:39.980
was the crisis in
Jawaharlal Nehru University.

00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:42.580
And students, including the
President of the Jawaharlal

00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:48.270
Nehru Students Union,
was arrested and charged

00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:50.530
with sedition.

00:58:50.530 --> 00:58:54.570
And after the
arrested students were

00:58:54.570 --> 00:58:59.280
brought to the court premises
of Patiala House in New Delhi,

00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:02.580
the storm troopers, the
black coated storm troopers

00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:06.030
of the ruling party,
attacked teachers

00:59:06.030 --> 00:59:10.740
and students and journalists
within the premises

00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:13.200
of the judiciary.

00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:16.650
And there's been a
systematic attack on higher

00:59:16.650 --> 00:59:19.330
educational institutions.

00:59:19.330 --> 00:59:25.560
And there is almost
a deliberate policy

00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:32.760
to demoralize our best public
institutions of higher learning

00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:35.990
through the drafting of a new
higher education commission

00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.770
bill.

00:59:36.770 --> 00:59:38.930
Which is, of course,
being resisted.

00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:43.610
And also there has not been a
single major central or state

00:59:43.610 --> 00:59:45.680
university that
has been included

00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:49.640
on the list of institutions
of eminence chosen

00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:54.830
by a committee appointed by
Prime Minister Narendra Modi,

00:59:54.830 --> 01:00:00.230
even though a non-existent
university to be established

01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:03.500
by India's leading
industrialist has been

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.430
given that particular label.

01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:08.930
So of course, the media
has been under attack

01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:10.670
and there have been
other institutions

01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:13.100
that have been under siege.

01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:16.520
But we, sitting at a
university, must also

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:21.560
consider what is happening in
the domain of higher education

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:26.870
in India in this atmosphere
of democratic authoritarianism

01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:30.140
using a strategy of
religious majoritarianism

01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:34.160
to win majorities in
India's Parliament.

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:34.670
Thank you.

01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:36.080
Thank you very much, Sugata.

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:40.190
The question of complicity
that both of you brought up

01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:42.050
is certainly a
thread that is moving

01:00:42.050 --> 01:00:46.440
through the various comments.

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:51.000
In addition to the media
and governance and the law,

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.250
which we had, I think the
issue of higher education

01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:59.030
now emerges as another
topic, another item

01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:00.180
for our discussion.

01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:02.910
But with it, I think
also the concern

01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:06.170
not only for higher education,
but for education more

01:01:06.170 --> 01:01:07.340
generally.

01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:10.620
The rewriting and the
tampering of school books,

01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:13.550
which we know about.

01:01:13.550 --> 01:01:19.460
And also the infestation
of these ideas of exclusion

01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:22.397
at the level of
school education.

01:01:22.397 --> 01:01:24.230
I think this is something
we should look at.

01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:28.160
But turning to you, Rohit in the
context of these conversations.

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:31.290
Of course, very keen to
see what you have to say.

01:01:31.290 --> 01:01:34.280
But one issue that
was just brought up,

01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:36.950
which I think is
something that I would

01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:40.760
love to hear you speaking
about, is the use

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:42.830
of the language of
citizenship certainly

01:01:42.830 --> 01:01:48.130
out of constitutional
discourse to actually justify

01:01:48.130 --> 01:01:53.020
the complicitors' notions
of discrimination.

01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:56.510
And beyond discrimination
also degradation.

01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:58.340
And they're not the same thing.

01:01:58.340 --> 01:01:59.810
They can come together.

01:01:59.810 --> 01:02:04.010
Very often discrimination
is thought of within a kind

01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:05.420
of legal imaginary.

01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:09.890
But with the right politics
and with the right agitation

01:02:09.890 --> 01:02:12.210
and if we move to
the law, the law

01:02:12.210 --> 01:02:14.460
can get rid of discrimination.

01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:17.570
And weak people can be given
the rights of citizenship.

01:02:17.570 --> 01:02:21.190
But now the language
of denigration,

01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:24.220
the embodied language
of denigration,

01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:31.280
impurity, criminality, rape
both in the United States

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:32.960
as well as in India.

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:38.060
The language of denigration,
the dedignified language

01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:43.490
of denigration is now taking
on a power beyond any appeal

01:02:43.490 --> 01:02:45.710
to the citizen and
the non-citizen.

01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:48.050
And this is why I think
the migrant or the refugee

01:02:48.050 --> 01:02:51.985
becomes such a problematic
flashpoint in this discourse.

01:02:51.985 --> 01:02:54.110
As the president of the
ruling party recently said,

01:02:54.110 --> 01:02:56.151
we have a billion termites
in our country who are

01:02:56.151 --> 01:02:57.920
sort of hollowing it through.

01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:00.290
So I will address the
question of constitutionalism.

01:03:00.290 --> 01:03:05.840
I just wanted to respond briefly
to Sreenivason's presentation.

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:07.640
There's a moment when
they're interviewing

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:10.550
the accused of
the one who's sort

01:03:10.550 --> 01:03:11.990
of admitting to the killing.

01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:14.690
He talks-- there was a
mistake that we recorded this

01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:16.610
on our phone camera.

01:03:16.610 --> 01:03:18.570
The young boys, they
didn't know any better.

01:03:18.570 --> 01:03:19.529
They were enthusiastic.

01:03:19.529 --> 01:03:21.278
They were minors, it
was their first time,

01:03:21.278 --> 01:03:22.590
they won't do it again.

01:03:22.590 --> 01:03:25.100
And the sort of constant image
that was circulating here

01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:26.310
was very difficult to watch.

01:03:26.310 --> 01:03:28.610
But if you are on social
media, open the television,

01:03:28.610 --> 01:03:31.490
these images almost
stylized images of lynchings

01:03:31.490 --> 01:03:32.815
are circulating very widely.

01:03:32.815 --> 01:03:34.190
And that's sort
of actually pause

01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:38.120
to question what our complicity
is in sort of playing it

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:39.856
and watching it.

01:03:39.856 --> 01:03:42.230
It is important to remember
that these incidents happened

01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:43.880
and it's important to
remember the names of people

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:44.810
who were killed.

01:03:44.810 --> 01:03:48.140
But these images are being
watched by some of us

01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:49.250
with shock and horror.

01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:51.290
But they're being produced
as an act of victory,

01:03:51.290 --> 01:03:52.580
an act of celebration.

01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:55.024
And they're being circulated
as an act of celebration.

01:03:55.024 --> 01:03:56.690
And if you look at
the YouTube comments,

01:03:56.690 --> 01:03:58.970
perhaps that's a sort
of terrible place

01:03:58.970 --> 01:04:00.630
to go to at any point of time.

01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:03.046
The YouTube comments and many
of these news stories, which

01:04:03.046 --> 01:04:05.150
are pointing this out as
this is a terrible thing.

01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:06.650
The YouTube comments
show people who

01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:09.500
are watching it are consuming
it as a celebratory spectacle.

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:11.000
So we're actually
transforming what

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.090
was-- it's sort of if you take
the lynching postcard of the US

01:04:14.090 --> 01:04:17.090
South and we sort of put it
in [INAUDIBLE] national media

01:04:17.090 --> 01:04:18.390
to say it's a bad thing.

01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:21.020
But everyone sort of
watches it and reacts to it

01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:24.470
with a certain kind
of visceral pleasure.

01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:25.970
So I'm going to
talk a little bit

01:04:25.970 --> 01:04:28.261
about the kind of tortured
history of constitutionalism

01:04:28.261 --> 01:04:30.624
in South Asia and
particularly today.

01:04:30.624 --> 01:04:33.040
Some people would argue that
South Asia is not a good site

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:34.540
to study constitutionalism.

01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:37.150
Indeed, while India,
Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri

01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:39.880
Lanka all enact constitutions
with certain degree

01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:42.790
of popular representation
in 915 in India

01:04:42.790 --> 01:04:45.580
and 71 in Pakistan,
Bangladesh, 77 in Sri Lanka.

01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:48.010
These are not liberal
documents by any measure.

01:04:48.010 --> 01:04:51.520
They are documents that have
heavily circumscribed rights

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:53.410
and in certain cases
reinforce a kind

01:04:53.410 --> 01:04:55.780
of ethnic majoritarian
view of politics.

01:04:55.780 --> 01:04:58.660
However as I want to argue
very briefly, over the years

01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:00.514
they have come to
act as a constraint

01:05:00.514 --> 01:05:01.930
in a variety of
ways, all of which

01:05:01.930 --> 01:05:03.712
has been unraveled very sharply.

01:05:03.712 --> 01:05:05.920
Not just in India, but in
the neighboring South Asian

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:08.000
countries over the
last five years.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.160
So if you think of constitutions
as the text for the governments

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:14.920
of the one party state
in India and Sri Lanka

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:17.920
and the military regimes
in Pakistan and Bangladesh.

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:20.360
The Constitution was just
sort of a road map of power.

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:21.610
Something that was convenient.

01:05:21.610 --> 01:05:23.040
Something that was malleable.

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:24.790
So if the Constitution
worked against you,

01:05:24.790 --> 01:05:26.920
you would just change
the Constitution itself

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:29.540
or amend the particular
provision that is problematic.

01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:32.410
It wasn't conceived of as
a restraint to authority.

01:05:32.410 --> 01:05:33.670
But it became one.

01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:35.950
First to the work of
lawyers and judges,

01:05:35.950 --> 01:05:37.660
who created a series
of conventions

01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:41.290
from the 1950s onwards, which
restrained government power.

01:05:41.290 --> 01:05:43.360
So just to give you
a couple of examples.

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:46.900
In the Indian case, we see a
broadening of judicial power

01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:48.280
over judicial appointments.

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:51.730
So we edged out the executive's
role in appointing judges

01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:53.800
and tried to at least
create to some extent

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:57.550
a non-political party
affiliated judiciary.

01:05:57.550 --> 01:05:59.551
We also saw the rise of
regulatory authorities,

01:05:59.551 --> 01:06:02.050
independent bodies under the
Constitution being the Election

01:06:02.050 --> 01:06:04.580
Commission, or the Office
of the Comptroller Auditor

01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:07.960
General, which exercised powers
in checking the government.

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:11.890
We saw the emergence
of challenges

01:06:11.890 --> 01:06:13.780
to the powers of
constitutional amendment,

01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:16.840
as well as increasing
challenges to military coups.

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:19.450
So even when military coups
was eventually justified,

01:06:19.450 --> 01:06:22.096
there were safeguards put in
place and circumscribed powers

01:06:22.096 --> 01:06:23.470
through which they
would operate.

01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:25.870
We saw attempts at crude
force to remove the Chief

01:06:25.870 --> 01:06:30.110
Justice in Sri Lanka, to remove
the Chief Justice in Pakistan

01:06:30.110 --> 01:06:32.830
were met with a popular uprising
of professionals, particularly

01:06:32.830 --> 01:06:35.140
lawyers, who took to
the streets and argued

01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:37.570
the language of the law to
restore judicial authority.

01:06:37.570 --> 01:06:38.600
That has mixed results.

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:40.670
And we can get to
that in the Q&amp;A.

01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:42.760
The second kind of movement
of constitutionalism

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:44.800
is constitutionalism as
imagined by the people.

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:47.635
People who are often excluded by
the Constitution who don't have

01:06:47.635 --> 01:06:49.780
sort of guaranteed
rights in the document,

01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:51.857
but strive to make it so.

01:06:51.857 --> 01:06:53.440
We see this most
dramatically in India

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:55.810
with the use of-- with the
number of social movements

01:06:55.810 --> 01:06:58.357
in 1990s arguing for
the right to education,

01:06:58.357 --> 01:07:00.190
the right to information,
the right to food.

01:07:00.190 --> 01:07:02.770
Which, through a series of
first judicial activism and then

01:07:02.770 --> 01:07:05.650
legislative interventions
get translated into reality.

01:07:05.650 --> 01:07:08.170
And in some ways, the first
decade of the 21st century

01:07:08.170 --> 01:07:11.350
sees for the first time a
creation of a skeletal welfare

01:07:11.350 --> 01:07:14.050
state in India as a result
of social movement engagement

01:07:14.050 --> 01:07:15.764
with constitutionalism.

01:07:15.764 --> 01:07:17.680
There is an entire
language of anti-corruption

01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:19.554
that leads to a rise of
a new political party

01:07:19.554 --> 01:07:21.460
and the demand for an
independent ombudsman.

01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:24.990
But also a rise for, and this
again has interesting legacies,

01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:28.450
a kind of media allied
rise of popular justice.

01:07:28.450 --> 01:07:29.950
Perhaps the earliest
example of this

01:07:29.950 --> 01:07:32.750
was the Jessica Alal case,
in which [INAUDIBLE] channel

01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:33.940
played an important role.

01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:35.320
Which convinced the
judiciary to sort

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:37.780
of step in to what was obviously
a corrupt criminal justice

01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:40.390
process and enact a kind
of corrective trial.

01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:42.580
But it required citizens
to turn to the media

01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:45.850
and turn the media into a kind
of a supralegal courtroom that

01:07:45.850 --> 01:07:49.140
would sort of decide
on these questions.

01:07:49.140 --> 01:07:51.220
As I mentioned earlier,
constitutionalism has not

01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:52.900
had an easy run in South Asia.

01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:54.490
And it comes through
most dramatically

01:07:54.490 --> 01:07:56.800
in the emergencies that
are taking place in India

01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:58.347
and in its
neighboring countries.

01:07:58.347 --> 01:08:00.430
However, in the emergency,
there was a requirement

01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:02.410
of the government
to act through law.

01:08:02.410 --> 01:08:04.120
So the Parliament
or the President

01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:06.730
would declare emergency and
the forms of the emergency

01:08:06.730 --> 01:08:07.571
would be observed.

01:08:07.571 --> 01:08:09.070
There would be a
law that would then

01:08:09.070 --> 01:08:10.420
strip people of their rights.

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:12.628
But it would have to be done
through a legal process.

01:08:12.628 --> 01:08:16.060
And this sounds almost as
if I'm sort of turning what

01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:17.770
is a sham exercise into virtue.

01:08:17.770 --> 01:08:19.501
But when you sort of--

01:08:19.501 --> 01:08:22.000
it's only moments like these
that you realize the importance

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.080
of hypocrisy in some ways.

01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:25.189
Because you need to have
standards to hold people up to.

01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:27.380
If people don't subscribe to
the channels in the first place,

01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:29.546
it becomes very difficult
to sort of make claims.

01:08:29.546 --> 01:08:31.420
What's happening today
in India in particular

01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:36.550
is a kind of, as Sreenivasan
mentioned, death by 1,000 cuts.

01:08:36.550 --> 01:08:39.399
There are no effective attempts
to sort of change legislation.

01:08:39.399 --> 01:08:41.529
But what happens is a
kind of circumvention

01:08:41.529 --> 01:08:43.149
of long established procedures.

01:08:43.149 --> 01:08:45.357
And I'm just going to run
through the rest of my time

01:08:45.357 --> 01:08:48.126
a kind of listing of the
nature of these changes.

01:08:48.126 --> 01:08:49.750
First, if you imagine
constitutionalism

01:08:49.750 --> 01:08:52.390
to be a question of balance,
the Indian Constitution

01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:54.490
struck a balance between
different institutions.

01:08:54.490 --> 01:08:56.080
The Judiciary
Election Commission,

01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:58.450
the Army and Independent
Bureaucracy and media.

01:08:58.450 --> 01:09:00.310
All of which is getting
circumvented today

01:09:00.310 --> 01:09:04.540
either because of
entirely ignoring

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:05.914
many of the institutions.

01:09:05.914 --> 01:09:08.080
People have not been appointed
to several positions.

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:10.701
For example, this Parliament
does not have an official

01:09:10.701 --> 01:09:13.200
leader of the opposition, which
means several decisions that

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:15.796
need to be taken which require
oppositions attendance cannot

01:09:15.796 --> 01:09:17.920
be taken or can be done by
circumventing opposition

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:18.670
parties.

01:09:18.670 --> 01:09:20.590
They have not
appointed people to be

01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:22.856
in charge, until recently,
to be the information

01:09:22.856 --> 01:09:24.939
commissioner, who would
bring the Prime Minister's

01:09:24.939 --> 01:09:27.010
office under the
Right Information Act.

01:09:27.010 --> 01:09:29.060
Key appointments in
investigative bodies

01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:30.020
have been delayed.

01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:31.644
Positions have just
been left vacant.

01:09:31.644 --> 01:09:34.310
It's almost as if you're letting
institutions die by just decay,

01:09:34.310 --> 01:09:35.939
by not filling them up.

01:09:35.939 --> 01:09:39.402
Secondly and very
troublingly, members

01:09:39.402 --> 01:09:40.860
of these independent
authorities be

01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:43.580
it the bureaucracy, the
army, or the judiciary

01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:46.370
have been given poster time and
positions that are very closely

01:09:46.370 --> 01:09:48.319
allied to the government.

01:09:48.319 --> 01:09:51.620
Be it ministers in the
cabinet or post of governors.

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:54.080
Secondly, the other big
balancing act in constitution

01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:55.370
does through what's
kind of provision

01:09:55.370 --> 01:09:57.370
of affirmative action,
and the kind of vagaries,

01:09:57.370 --> 01:09:59.780
that go past the
system, is to create

01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:03.950
a representative parliament
that represents a wide diversity

01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:05.540
of constituencies.

01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:07.040
The success of
India's democracy,

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:08.602
according to
Christopher [INAUDIBLE]

01:10:08.602 --> 01:10:10.310
and other political
scientists has really

01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:12.920
been the empowerment of
groups that were formerly

01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:15.320
seen as backward who achieved
the political dominance

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:17.190
in legislatures in the 1970s.

01:10:17.190 --> 01:10:19.509
However, this Parliament has
the highest representation

01:10:19.509 --> 01:10:21.800
of upper castes, one of the
highest since independence.

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:24.350
It has the lowest representation
of Muslims since independence.

01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:26.240
And if you actually take out
the members of Parliament

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:27.740
of West Bengal,
there would be very

01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:29.840
few Muslim MPs in
Parliament to begin with.

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:32.180
We have fewer Muslim--

01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:34.580
I suspect we have fewer
Muslim MPs than Britain does,

01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:36.757
despite the differences
in population.

01:10:36.757 --> 01:10:38.840
The third kind of balance
the Constitution strikes

01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:40.845
is between the center
and the regions.

01:10:40.845 --> 01:10:43.430
This was of course
through the early decades

01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:45.140
of independence,
one that was heavily

01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:46.570
skewed towards the center.

01:10:46.570 --> 01:10:48.980
Until the 1980s, we often
saw the central government

01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:52.200
intervening very strongly
in provincial autonomy.

01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:54.020
However, over the
last 20 years, there

01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:57.020
was a sense that especially with
the growth of regional parties,

01:10:57.020 --> 01:10:59.330
states were protected,
states' rights were protected.

01:10:59.330 --> 01:11:01.660
And indeed, the BJP
in the early 2000s

01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:04.220
spoke in the language of
cooperative federalism.

01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:06.740
However, we see a greater
centralization of power.

01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:09.210
And most troublingly,
in sort of territories

01:11:09.210 --> 01:11:11.090
that were ruled by
opposition governments,

01:11:11.090 --> 01:11:12.500
we see interventionist
governors,

01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:14.166
most strikingly in
the union territories

01:11:14.166 --> 01:11:15.650
of Delhi and Pondicherry.

01:11:15.650 --> 01:11:19.460
We see differences in
funding between opposition

01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:20.850
and government ruled states.

01:11:20.850 --> 01:11:23.000
And in some cases,
caste segregation

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.070
of entire populations
of people who have not

01:11:25.070 --> 01:11:26.660
voted for the ruling party.

01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:29.799
Which sort of troubles the
links that tie India together.

01:11:29.799 --> 01:11:31.340
Third is of course
citizenship, which

01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:32.990
is the very basis
of our participation

01:11:32.990 --> 01:11:34.430
in constitutional democracy.

01:11:34.430 --> 01:11:36.200
There are two
developments that are

01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:37.920
urgent and important to note.

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:39.590
The first is the long
simmering problem

01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:43.020
of the national citizenship
register in Assam.

01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:45.290
Around the 1970s,
there was a compromise

01:11:45.290 --> 01:11:46.970
given the kind of
movement of people

01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:50.210
across the border in South Asia
to have a register of citizens

01:11:50.210 --> 01:11:54.680
which would sort of count
and fix citizenship of people

01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:56.410
who reside in [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:56.410 --> 01:11:58.160
Political compromise
had left this process

01:11:58.160 --> 01:11:59.300
open for many years.

01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:02.690
But recently, it was spurred
on by PIL to be completed.

01:12:02.690 --> 01:12:04.790
And a couple of months
ago, they came out

01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:07.250
with a register, a list of
citizens, which left out

01:12:07.250 --> 01:12:08.950
large chunks of the population.

01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:10.940
While the government
has agreed that there

01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:13.500
will be procedures to
challenge and correct the list,

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:14.840
the idea is very clear.

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:17.536
There will now be an official
list that would count citizens.

01:12:17.536 --> 01:12:19.160
And there are demands
to replicate this

01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:20.680
list in other states.

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:22.950
The people who tend
to get excluded here

01:12:22.950 --> 01:12:24.530
are Bengali speaking
populations who

01:12:24.530 --> 01:12:26.180
live in Northeast
India who are always

01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:28.802
suspected of being Bangladeshi
or being foreigners.

01:12:28.802 --> 01:12:31.010
And it strikes at the very
core of Indian citizenship

01:12:31.010 --> 01:12:32.884
principles, which is
basically not determined

01:12:32.884 --> 01:12:34.550
by blood or by religion.

01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:37.100
But basically
determined by your birth

01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:38.810
in a particular territory.

01:12:38.810 --> 01:12:40.430
The second troubling
situation here

01:12:40.430 --> 01:12:42.715
is the passing of the
Citizenship Amendment Bill.

01:12:42.715 --> 01:12:45.740
Indian citizenship, and this is
greatly debated in the 1940s,

01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:48.950
was fixed to your
parents being born

01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:52.010
in the territory that became
India before a certain date.

01:12:52.010 --> 01:12:54.710
It wasn't tied to your religion
or tied to your ethnicity

01:12:54.710 --> 01:12:55.880
or tied to blood.

01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:58.520
However, this amendment
bill allows for citizenship

01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:01.220
to be granted to Hindus,
Sikhs, and Buddhists

01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:04.790
from Pakistan and Bangladesh who
apply for citizenship to India.

01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:06.380
At one level, this
sounds very benign.

01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:08.060
You're helping
persecuted minorities

01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:09.600
get permanent status.

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:11.360
However, the persecuted
minority category

01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:15.860
does not extend to other groups
who could face persecution.

01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:20.600
Be it Shias, Ahmadis,
women, LGBT populations.

01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:24.770
But focuses on non-Muslim
groups, non-Abrahamic faith

01:13:24.770 --> 01:13:26.390
groups in South Asia.

01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:28.130
And tries to turn
Indian citizenship

01:13:28.130 --> 01:13:30.930
into a sort of birthright
citizenship of all Hindus,

01:13:30.930 --> 01:13:32.267
Sikhs, and Buddhists.

01:13:32.267 --> 01:13:34.100
And poses a profound
challenge to the nature

01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:36.570
of citizenship in South Asia.

01:13:36.570 --> 01:13:38.780
So just to flag a
couple of other things,

01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:40.490
the most remarkable
thing that happened

01:13:40.490 --> 01:13:41.930
at the beginning
of this year was

01:13:41.930 --> 01:13:45.410
a kind of unprecedented
television conference given

01:13:45.410 --> 01:13:49.280
by four of the five senior most
judges of the Supreme Court

01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:51.770
who came out in the public
and virtually alleged,

01:13:51.770 --> 01:13:53.467
and I have to be
careful of what I say,

01:13:53.467 --> 01:13:55.550
because there are powerful
contempt laws in India,

01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:58.370
suggested that there was
political interference

01:13:58.370 --> 01:14:02.150
in the decision making in
the court about which judges

01:14:02.150 --> 01:14:04.040
would get to hear what cases.

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:06.380
Assignments of cases were
taken away from certain judges

01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:07.610
and given to other judges.

01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:09.320
The Indian court
does not sit on bank.

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:10.610
They sit in groups of judges.

01:14:10.610 --> 01:14:12.660
The Chief Justice has
discretionary powers

01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:14.810
to a lot of cases
of different judges.

01:14:14.810 --> 01:14:17.150
There were also a
considerable suspicion

01:14:17.150 --> 01:14:19.970
of accusations of corruption
against certain figures

01:14:19.970 --> 01:14:21.770
in the judiciary
who were believed

01:14:21.770 --> 01:14:23.640
to be complicit in this.

01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:26.240
There was also a
pointing out of the fact

01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:28.760
that despite a long
established precedent

01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:31.967
that the Supreme Court has the
final say in appointing judges.

01:14:31.967 --> 01:14:34.300
The government was slow in
acting on the Supreme Court's

01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:35.890
recommendations.

01:14:35.890 --> 01:14:37.700
And it is perhaps
not a coincidence

01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:41.190
that many of the judges who
were not being appointed

01:14:41.190 --> 01:14:43.190
belong to communities
that were not the majority

01:14:43.190 --> 01:14:44.857
community in South Asia.

01:14:44.857 --> 01:14:46.940
There seems to have been
some backtracking on this

01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:47.780
the last few months.

01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:49.760
And some of these appointments
have been made late.

01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:51.350
But the way in which
the judiciary works,

01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:52.880
it also means that
late appointments

01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:54.588
would mean that they
are unlikely to rise

01:14:54.588 --> 01:14:58.860
to certain decision making
powers within the judiciary.

01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:01.020
I could sort of go
on on this, but I

01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:04.580
do want to just briefly try
to be optimistic and suggest

01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:08.720
what are possibly a few
hopeful areas of opposition.

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:11.270
The first is that I think
for a lot of people,

01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:14.060
I hope it becomes
clear why forms matter,

01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:15.930
why conventions matter.

01:15:15.930 --> 01:15:19.010
We can always say that these
are authoritarian states working

01:15:19.010 --> 01:15:21.140
through shadowy
forms of legality.

01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:23.210
But these forms matter
in that you can at least

01:15:23.210 --> 01:15:24.810
hold states accountable.

01:15:24.810 --> 01:15:28.130
And I think there is increasing,
at least in statements

01:15:28.130 --> 01:15:30.409
of political parties,
the use of the language

01:15:30.409 --> 01:15:32.450
of the Constitution to
rally around and challenge

01:15:32.450 --> 01:15:33.156
the government.

01:15:33.156 --> 01:15:35.780
Particularly in the absence of
a charismatic sort of opposition

01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:37.400
figure, the
Constitution can emerge

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:39.984
as a kind of charismatic
set of opposition.

01:15:39.984 --> 01:15:42.150
The second is an interesting
sort of local histories

01:15:42.150 --> 01:15:43.740
the Constitution is taking.

01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:45.890
For example, in the
forested regions of

01:15:45.890 --> 01:15:48.830
[INAUDIBLE] there is a
movement by tribal communities

01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:50.820
which are basically
using the Constitution,

01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:52.520
a physical structure
of the Constitution

01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:54.959
to assert tribal
sovereignty over the areas.

01:15:54.959 --> 01:15:56.750
They reproduce sections
of the Constitution

01:15:56.750 --> 01:16:00.920
that allow for tribal control
of those particular areas.

01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:05.060
Are strikingly breaking with
long history of compliants.

01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:08.330
BJP's Dalit MPs have come
out publicly in opposition

01:16:08.330 --> 01:16:11.360
to perceptions that the
BJP government might dilute

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:12.920
or do away with reservations.

01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:15.410
The Supreme Court judgment
diluting the prevention

01:16:15.410 --> 01:16:18.170
of atrocities on [INAUDIBLE]
a kind of civil rights

01:16:18.170 --> 01:16:20.600
legislation and the
fact that the government

01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:23.150
didn't do enough to sort of
fall back on it was called out.

01:16:23.150 --> 01:16:26.330
It is clear that affirmative
action provisions and the kind

01:16:26.330 --> 01:16:30.260
of requirements forecast
justice in the Constitution

01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:32.390
are taken seriously by
members of the community who

01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:34.580
will fight to defend it.

01:16:34.580 --> 01:16:36.636
And finally, I think
it's important for us

01:16:36.636 --> 01:16:39.260
to acknowledge that this kind of
breakdown of constitutionalism

01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:42.050
might be new for
most people in India.

01:16:42.050 --> 01:16:45.110
But existent pockets across
the country over all times.

01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:47.750
So if you were growing up in
Kashmir, Northeast or Southern

01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:49.880
districts in
Chhattisgarh, the idea

01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:52.130
that there is that
Constitution acts as a check

01:16:52.130 --> 01:16:53.540
is almost seen as a myth.

01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:55.367
And it almost seems
that our inability

01:16:55.367 --> 01:16:57.200
to respond to what
happened in these regions

01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:58.610
is coming to haunt us today.

01:16:58.610 --> 01:17:00.890
Because we are all
experiencing what

01:17:00.890 --> 01:17:05.120
this spirit of
tolerated emergency is.

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:05.960
Rohit, I must--

01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:07.070
I will stop at this point.

01:17:07.070 --> 01:17:08.600
Call you to order.

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:12.350
In the best
parliamentary tradition.

01:17:12.350 --> 01:17:16.230
Very interesting, the notion
of ethno-majoritarian--

01:17:18.734 --> 01:17:20.150
Ethno-majoritarianism
is something

01:17:20.150 --> 01:17:23.870
that you have raised in these
reflections on questions

01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:25.550
of constitution and citizenship.

01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:28.310
And of course one of the
issues that it relates to

01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:31.640
is under the ethnos,
what is the place

01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:34.190
of the language of religion
or the language of faith.

01:17:34.190 --> 01:17:38.320
How is it being manipulated,
but also effectively powerful.

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:39.680
It's not all manipulation.

01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:41.440
People identify with it.

01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:42.815
Through the ethnos,
they identify

01:17:42.815 --> 01:17:44.690
through religious ideas.

01:17:44.690 --> 01:17:51.220
I think the idea of the
media as a supralegal body,

01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:55.040
as a supralegal agency, is
actually quite interesting.

01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:57.510
Where there is democracy
in distress and breakdown,

01:17:57.510 --> 01:18:00.620
then it is your kind of
investigative reporting

01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:04.010
that plays a role
of governance almost

01:18:04.010 --> 01:18:07.610
or a protogovernance issue.

01:18:07.610 --> 01:18:10.820
I would also think that
the question of education

01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:14.390
that was brought up
raises the issue of how

01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:18.920
the Constitution gets
mediated or translated

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:22.430
in a more ubiquitous form, given
that you are interested in form

01:18:22.430 --> 01:18:23.900
like I am, too.

01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:27.230
Not simply in the content, but
in the form of these things

01:18:27.230 --> 01:18:28.970
and the institutional form.

01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:33.590
How would these constitutional,
progressive constitutional

01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:37.130
ideas that hold the country
to account, how do they

01:18:37.130 --> 01:18:41.300
get mediated and translated
into, as I said, the ubiquitous

01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:46.040
or the everyday understanding of
one's status or one's position

01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:47.660
or one's mutuality.

01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:49.550
These are important questions.

01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:54.680
I now want to
actually turn to Basu,

01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:58.870
if you'd like to respond
to any of these issues now.

01:18:58.870 --> 01:19:01.850
After which I want
to turn to the panel

01:19:01.850 --> 01:19:06.260
and ask them whether any of
them are to quote you Rohit,

01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:09.000
even briefly optimistic.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.300
I think the brevity of
optimism is obviously

01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:13.370
a very important issue here.

01:19:13.370 --> 01:19:15.980
How long can you hold your
breath and be optimistic?

01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:17.620
Or maybe you take a
deep breath and you

01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:19.006
are optimistic for longer.

01:19:19.006 --> 01:19:20.630
I want to deal with
that after which we

01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:24.280
can open up to the audience.

01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:28.130
I think what I do, Homi,
is with your permission,

01:19:28.130 --> 01:19:32.260
because it's very
sort of broad points

01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:34.784
were made by the panelists.

01:19:34.784 --> 01:19:37.450
Which if I get into each of them
will take a considerable amount

01:19:37.450 --> 01:19:38.500
of time.

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:41.110
What I did during
my presentation

01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:44.320
was to give you one
arc of the two arcs

01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:46.210
which I described have worsened.

01:19:46.210 --> 01:19:48.580
One is that I said
the idea of India

01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:51.370
as a secular liberal society.

01:19:51.370 --> 01:19:53.590
And the attempt was to
try and characterize

01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:56.080
what exactly is it
that has worsened

01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:57.550
and why it's hard to capture it.

01:19:57.550 --> 01:19:59.980
So now as I tried to point
out in my presentation,

01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:00.820
we have some idea.

01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:02.770
What are the things that
have worsened, right?

01:20:02.770 --> 01:20:09.510
We've seen there's a worsening
of the sort of language,

01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:11.760
the discourse of high
political figures.

01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:14.110
That is distinctly worsened.

01:20:14.110 --> 01:20:17.350
There's a clear
worsening of the attacks

01:20:17.350 --> 01:20:23.440
on minorities using this prism
of cow protection and so on.

01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:28.480
When it comes to the worsening
of democratic institutions,

01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:31.340
some of which
Rohit listed, again

01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:33.970
this business of doing it
through the method of 1,000

01:20:33.970 --> 01:20:37.000
cuts makes it that much
more harder to capture

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.310
and that much harder to resist.

01:20:39.310 --> 01:20:44.470
So I think this whole
business of normalizing

01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:46.810
these sorts of
assaults, and that's

01:20:46.810 --> 01:20:49.400
something I suspect is happening
in other parts of the world

01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:52.192
including here in America, is
something that deeply concerns

01:20:52.192 --> 01:20:53.650
me as a journalist
and is something

01:20:53.650 --> 01:20:56.050
that I've tried to report on.

01:20:56.050 --> 01:20:57.719
I didn't spend too
much time on that

01:20:57.719 --> 01:20:59.260
because there was
a shortage of time.

01:20:59.260 --> 01:21:02.320
And I didn't particularly
talk about the media

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:04.510
because what has been
happening with the media again

01:21:04.510 --> 01:21:05.590
is very interesting.

01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:07.660
And it's also happening
using the same modus

01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:12.130
operandi of trying to bleed
us through 1,000 cuts.

01:21:12.130 --> 01:21:15.580
So we have a very large
and diverse media.

01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:19.340
We have 400 registered
news channels.

01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:22.210
OK, just digest that
number for a minute.

01:21:22.210 --> 01:21:25.510
And about 100,000
licensed newspapers.

01:21:25.510 --> 01:21:28.200
And I'm not even
counting now digital.

01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:33.190
What has been remarkable is
how this diverse, crappy,

01:21:33.190 --> 01:21:36.340
fragmented,
rambunctious media has

01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:40.930
been brought to heel largely
without firing a single shot.

01:21:40.930 --> 01:21:45.970
It's not as if journalists
are not being killed in India.

01:21:45.970 --> 01:21:47.005
They are.

01:21:47.005 --> 01:21:49.420
It's not as if we don't
have retrograde laws that

01:21:49.420 --> 01:21:50.470
govern the media.

01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:51.800
We do have those laws.

01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:54.310
It's not as if we've not
slipped in the media freedom

01:21:54.310 --> 01:21:57.340
index in the past
year from 136 to 138

01:21:57.340 --> 01:22:00.010
compiled by the Reporters
Without Borders.

01:22:00.010 --> 01:22:02.170
But that's not the real crisis.

01:22:02.170 --> 01:22:06.460
The real crisis is how
newsroom after newsroom

01:22:06.460 --> 01:22:09.790
is witnessing a sort
of internal coup.

01:22:09.790 --> 01:22:11.410
It's the enemy within.

01:22:11.410 --> 01:22:14.560
Proprietors, owners,
publishers, because

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:18.370
of real or imagined threats
are choking any kind

01:22:18.370 --> 01:22:20.230
of uncomfortable journalism.

01:22:20.230 --> 01:22:22.634
And that actually is
much harder to fight,

01:22:22.634 --> 01:22:24.550
because it's like a tree
falling in the night.

01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:26.740
You've not been
able to understand

01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:28.560
exactly what's happened.

01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:30.550
And I'll give you a
small example, Homi,

01:22:30.550 --> 01:22:33.640
with your permission of
what happened with one

01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:35.260
of India's leading newspapers.

01:22:35.260 --> 01:22:37.340
This is a very
middle of the road,

01:22:37.340 --> 01:22:41.020
you know, playing it safe daily.

01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:43.630
Brings in an editor from
the Wall Street Journal.

01:22:43.630 --> 01:22:45.170
What's the name of the paper?

01:22:45.170 --> 01:22:49.010
Well, Homi, this is all
being telecast live.

01:22:49.010 --> 01:22:50.280
And I'll be indemnified.

01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:52.580
OK, it's not a secret to
at least those in the know.

01:22:52.580 --> 01:22:56.200
So if you insist, it's
the Hindustan Times.

01:22:56.200 --> 01:23:00.086
They bring in an editor.

01:23:00.086 --> 01:23:02.400
Under his watch,
a hate tracker is

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:04.344
launched, which
counts hate crimes

01:23:04.344 --> 01:23:06.510
and you know, sort of similar
to what we were doing.

01:23:06.510 --> 01:23:10.350
This creates a bit of a stir.

01:23:10.350 --> 01:23:13.560
Within a few months,
the editor is sacked.

01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:16.320
And on the last
day that he comes

01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:18.180
to office or just a
day or two after that,

01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:20.780
the tracker vanishes
from its website.

01:23:20.780 --> 01:23:21.480
OK?

01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:23.670
No explanation is given
either for the sacking

01:23:23.670 --> 01:23:27.110
or the taking down
of the hate tracker.

01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:31.590
It turns out, and this was sort
of widely discussed in Delhi,

01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:35.110
that the newspaper holds
an annual summit where

01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:36.360
they call the high and mighty.

01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:38.651
And that year, they wanted
to invite the Prime Minister

01:23:38.651 --> 01:23:39.540
as the chief guest.

01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:43.800
And the quid pro quo was that
if you want the Prime Minister,

01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:46.580
you have to sack the editor
and take down the hate record.

01:23:46.580 --> 01:23:49.639
So sure enough a few months
later, they hold a summit

01:23:49.639 --> 01:23:51.180
and low and behold
the Prime Minister

01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:53.370
is there as the
chief guest, right?

01:23:53.370 --> 01:23:56.520
But as I said, this is all
a matter of conjecture.

01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:59.890
We don't know for a fact
exactly how it played out.

01:23:59.890 --> 01:24:02.820
But I can list example
after example to you

01:24:02.820 --> 01:24:06.690
as to how journalists
and journalism

01:24:06.690 --> 01:24:09.630
of the provocative kind, of the
kind that speaks truth to power

01:24:09.630 --> 01:24:13.200
is being kneecapped
on a regular basis.

01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:16.620
Editor after editor,
anchor after anchor

01:24:16.620 --> 01:24:20.490
is taken out of circulation and
the organization falls in line.

01:24:20.490 --> 01:24:23.550
That's the whole idea, that
you have to somehow bring

01:24:23.550 --> 01:24:25.050
everybody in line.

01:24:25.050 --> 01:24:29.430
And I think Pakistan, again,
and other parts of South Asia

01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:31.120
are seeing this.

01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:34.410
This has to do with structural
issues of the ownership

01:24:34.410 --> 01:24:36.890
of the media, how
the media is funded,

01:24:36.890 --> 01:24:39.900
of the kind of financial
pressures and constraints

01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:42.100
that legacy media faces
for a number of reasons.

01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:44.080
Again, too many to list here.

01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:46.270
But it's important to
acknowledge this and remember

01:24:46.270 --> 01:24:46.770
this.

01:24:46.770 --> 01:24:48.600
Because all too often
we think of threats

01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:51.240
to the media as external.

01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:54.330
We think of online harassment.

01:24:54.330 --> 01:24:55.944
We think of censorship laws.

01:24:55.944 --> 01:24:57.360
We think of
government crackdowns.

01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:59.140
We think of, say,
for example what

01:24:59.140 --> 01:25:00.390
Erdogan is doing in Turkey.

01:25:00.390 --> 01:25:02.490
Or what's happening to
journalists in Russia.

01:25:02.490 --> 01:25:05.352
But this is also
part of the problem.

01:25:05.352 --> 01:25:07.560
And I think it's time that
we start acknowledging it.

01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:09.930
It's time we start
confronting some

01:25:09.930 --> 01:25:13.500
of these weak kneed proprietors
and publishers and editors.

01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:16.320
And start involving them in
these sorts of discussions

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:20.040
if we really want to see a
shift in the kind of distortion

01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:22.410
that is happening to the
media narrative in India.

01:25:22.410 --> 01:25:23.550
Thank you so much.

01:25:23.550 --> 01:25:27.000
It's interesting that
unconsciously you

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.980
use the word saying journalism
of a provocative kind.

01:25:30.980 --> 01:25:31.980
You're not provocative.

01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:34.102
It's only that you're
perceived to be provocative.

01:25:34.102 --> 01:25:37.920
You're doing exactly what
you're supposed to do.

01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:38.440
Absolutely.

01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:41.210
Now it seemed to
be a provocation.

01:25:41.210 --> 01:25:41.850
No, absolutely.

01:25:41.850 --> 01:25:44.506
In fact, I said this
quoting somebody.

01:25:44.506 --> 01:25:46.380
I'm not sure who, someone
more famous than I.

01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:50.670
That just speaking the truth in
India has become revolutionary.

01:25:50.670 --> 01:25:51.930
You know?

01:25:51.930 --> 01:25:53.800
So you're absolutely right.

01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:56.870
This is just being targeted
for doing one's job.

01:25:56.870 --> 01:26:00.180
Optimism about the end of
hatred and this sort of tendency

01:26:00.180 --> 01:26:01.620
in India and Pakistan.

01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:05.180
Optimism through this whole
process, what do you see?

01:26:05.180 --> 01:26:06.890
What makes you optimistic?

01:26:06.890 --> 01:26:09.480
I think things in India
will get much worse

01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:10.710
before they get better.

01:26:10.710 --> 01:26:14.036
Well, that is optimism by
another kind of definition.

01:26:14.036 --> 01:26:17.460
As for Pakistan, I'm very--

01:26:17.460 --> 01:26:19.530
I mean, I lack optimism.

01:26:19.530 --> 01:26:24.780
Because I think there we've
just witnessed a regression.

01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:27.600
And I think a consolidation
of authoritarianism

01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:29.250
in a new guise.

01:26:29.250 --> 01:26:32.940
Which we have to wait and
see how it will pan out.

01:26:32.940 --> 01:26:37.320
But as I said, the key issue
here is delivery governance.

01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:38.700
And I have grave doubts.

01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:41.040
But my bigger doubt, and I
think this is something that

01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:43.470
is across the board
in South Asia,

01:26:43.470 --> 01:26:45.810
and why I don't have
optimism, is that I really

01:26:45.810 --> 01:26:50.610
believe that in what I
call the decolonization

01:26:50.610 --> 01:26:52.800
of the mind in 70 years.

01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:58.020
And I think that we are
retrograde rather than

01:26:58.020 --> 01:27:00.930
progressive in the way
that we have utilized

01:27:00.930 --> 01:27:05.370
the need for the decolonization
of many of our value systems.

01:27:05.370 --> 01:27:08.940
The way in which we classify,
the way in which we perceive

01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:13.920
and see all of them are really
from the colonial period.

01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:16.740
When can we sit down
together and discuss

01:27:16.740 --> 01:27:19.310
what is in our best interest?

01:27:19.310 --> 01:27:22.060
But I should-- let
me ask you this.

01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:26.880
How much do you think that these
categories, and I completely

01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:28.830
agree with you, they
inherited categories

01:27:28.830 --> 01:27:32.100
and we want to make them, you
know, in a utilitarian way,

01:27:32.100 --> 01:27:33.140
work better.

01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:36.780
We want them to function
better, but they fail.

01:27:36.780 --> 01:27:41.580
How much of this is also
due to global pressures

01:27:41.580 --> 01:27:46.890
of various kinds in which
nations in South Asia

01:27:46.890 --> 01:27:51.090
have been treated with this
kind of seduce and abandon

01:27:51.090 --> 01:27:53.430
foreign policies of
powerful nations.

01:27:53.430 --> 01:27:54.570
How much is this--

01:27:54.570 --> 01:27:57.390
you think there has been a
freedom to reconceptualize

01:27:57.390 --> 01:27:58.860
these pedigrees.

01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:01.510
There has never been any
justice in the world,

01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:04.110
nor is there going to be.

01:28:04.110 --> 01:28:06.895
We are going to just have
to continue fighting.

01:28:06.895 --> 01:28:10.330
And that's what I mean about
democracy and authoritarianism.

01:28:10.330 --> 01:28:12.540
These are not sort of one
as opposed to the other.

01:28:12.540 --> 01:28:15.430
They are really two ends
of the same spectrum.

01:28:15.430 --> 01:28:19.030
And it depends on the particular
balance between dominance

01:28:19.030 --> 01:28:21.950
and resistance where you are.

01:28:21.950 --> 01:28:23.330
So I think that's important.

01:28:23.330 --> 01:28:25.930
But I suppose what I would
like to say about India

01:28:25.930 --> 01:28:28.930
is that in this
democratic process,

01:28:28.930 --> 01:28:33.690
there's a real danger of
losing the capacity to resist.

01:28:33.690 --> 01:28:36.610
In Pakistan, the problem
is that because of years

01:28:36.610 --> 01:28:40.360
of authoritarianism, nobody
really believes the government.

01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:42.880
In India, I think there's
too much of a buy in that

01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:45.790
needs to be corrected.

01:28:45.790 --> 01:28:48.500
My optimism is very, very
cautious, I'm afraid.

01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:49.000
Quite right.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.080
And as I said in my
opening comment, what we--

01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:56.710
the real issue was what are the
factors within democracy that

01:28:56.710 --> 01:28:58.540
are justified and
then can make you

01:28:58.540 --> 01:29:00.910
complicit to the growth
of a certain kind

01:29:00.910 --> 01:29:01.870
of authoritarianism.

01:29:01.870 --> 01:29:05.020
Sugata, what makes
you optimistic even

01:29:05.020 --> 01:29:07.390
for a fleeting moment?

01:29:07.390 --> 01:29:12.640
Before I answer your are
you optimistic question,

01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:16.450
may I just raise a question
to bring Basu and Rohit

01:29:16.450 --> 01:29:18.520
into dialogue?

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:20.770
I think it was very
important that Basu

01:29:20.770 --> 01:29:23.560
did that [INAUDIBLE] operation.

01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:30.160
Because the main perpetrator had
got out of jail, claiming that

01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:31.791
he wasn't there on the scene.

01:29:31.791 --> 01:29:32.290
Yes.

01:29:32.290 --> 01:29:35.230
What's more, that
incident was initially

01:29:35.230 --> 01:29:40.570
being described as a lynching
all right, but an incident

01:29:40.570 --> 01:29:43.900
of road rage rather than
linked to cow vigilantism.

01:29:43.900 --> 01:29:45.100
Yes.

01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:51.010
All that, those lies were
exposed in your sting.

01:29:51.010 --> 01:29:56.530
And then the Supreme
Court recently

01:29:56.530 --> 01:30:01.350
said that there ought to be a
new central law, a federal law,

01:30:01.350 --> 01:30:02.710
on lynching.

01:30:02.710 --> 01:30:05.170
And of course the
government did exactly what

01:30:05.170 --> 01:30:08.275
our colonial masters
had taught us to do.

01:30:08.275 --> 01:30:10.580
They have formed a
committee to look

01:30:10.580 --> 01:30:15.190
into the framing of a new law.

01:30:15.190 --> 01:30:19.000
And I'd like to ask Rohit
whether a law would help.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:22.210
If you look at United
States history,

01:30:22.210 --> 01:30:25.990
all the attempts to have an
anti-lynching law since about

01:30:25.990 --> 01:30:32.320
1918 were defeated in
the Senate by a group

01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:35.200
of conservative
southern democrats.

01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:38.020
And only this year
on the 30th of June,

01:30:38.020 --> 01:30:41.530
Kamala Harris and Cory
Booker and one other senator

01:30:41.530 --> 01:30:47.940
introduced a bill, which
will be really symbolic.

01:30:47.940 --> 01:30:50.620
As is evident that
there were lynchings

01:30:50.620 --> 01:30:55.570
of many kinds in America, but
more than 75% of the victims

01:30:55.570 --> 01:30:57.760
were African Americans.

01:30:57.760 --> 01:31:03.830
Just as close to 90% of the
victims in India are Muslims.

01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:06.460
So you know, would
a lynching law

01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:09.280
help or should something
be done urgently?

01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:11.350
Or will we in India
be in a position

01:31:11.350 --> 01:31:14.440
several decades later to
do what the US Senate did

01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:17.890
in 2005, apologize
for lynchings that

01:31:17.890 --> 01:31:19.780
have taken place in the past?

01:31:19.780 --> 01:31:25.620
So what can, you know, the
legal system, the judiciary do.

01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:29.320
Or what can Parliament
do to address what

01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:31.510
is an urgent problem today?

01:31:31.510 --> 01:31:37.180
In terms of optimism,
I can be analytic.

01:31:37.180 --> 01:31:41.680
But I can also
speak as someone who

01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:44.650
tried to provide a principled
voice in opposition

01:31:44.650 --> 01:31:49.450
ever since 2014 and
even before Modi

01:31:49.450 --> 01:31:52.120
got elected as Prime Minister.

01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:58.430
I think optimism is in some ways
a pragmatic necessity for us.

01:31:58.430 --> 01:32:02.800
Pessimism, it will be so
terribly self-defeating.

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:06.730
And so even on the day that
I first spoke in Parliament,

01:32:06.730 --> 01:32:11.260
I was trying to somehow
lift the pall of gloom that

01:32:11.260 --> 01:32:13.540
had descended on us.

01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:17.500
And saying things like, how
unrepresentative the 16th Lok

01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:18.480
Sabha is.

01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:23.200
If you looked at UP,
there were 80 MPs

01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:26.020
in a state with a 20%
Muslim population.

01:32:26.020 --> 01:32:29.230
And there was not one Muslim
MP elected from that state.

01:32:29.230 --> 01:32:31.060
Only very recently
in a bi-election,

01:32:31.060 --> 01:32:34.820
a Muslim woman has been elected.

01:32:34.820 --> 01:32:37.240
And then also, I think
it's very important

01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:41.416
to take on the votaries of
religious majoritarianism.

01:32:41.416 --> 01:32:45.010
Narendra Modi began to
claim from August 2017

01:32:45.010 --> 01:32:48.760
that the next five
years, 2017 to 2022,

01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:53.600
will be as transformative
as the years 1942 to 1947.

01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:55.870
This is what he
claimed in a speech

01:32:55.870 --> 01:32:58.630
that he made in
Parliament on the occasion

01:32:58.630 --> 01:33:03.500
of the 75th anniversary of
the Quit India movement.

01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:05.540
And he wanted to dominate.

01:33:05.540 --> 01:33:08.570
He wanted to see if there
will be transformation.

01:33:08.570 --> 01:33:11.900
Because the top constitutional
posts, all three of them,

01:33:11.900 --> 01:33:15.470
are now held by those who
subscribe to the same ideology,

01:33:15.470 --> 01:33:17.360
i.e. the ideology of Hindutva.

01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:19.070
So the inference
was clear, we are

01:33:19.070 --> 01:33:22.040
going to see a Hindu Astra
on the 75th anniversary

01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:23.150
of independence.

01:33:23.150 --> 01:33:24.950
And in that kind
of a scenario, it

01:33:24.950 --> 01:33:26.990
was very important
to come to pose

01:33:26.990 --> 01:33:30.740
a different vision of India,
from the vision of a new India

01:33:30.740 --> 01:33:33.140
that was being
projected by Modi.

01:33:33.140 --> 01:33:35.660
That in place of the
untrammeled dominance

01:33:35.660 --> 01:33:38.740
of one religious community
and one language,

01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:44.590
there can in fact be an
alternative vision of an India

01:33:44.590 --> 01:33:49.640
which is based on the cultural
intimacy of India's very

01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:51.600
many diverse communities.

01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:55.340
So in that sense, I think
that if the fight back

01:33:55.340 --> 01:33:59.960
is to take place as Ayesha
wants, then we have no option

01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:05.360
but to be optimistic, even
if we find numerous failings

01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:08.540
among opposition
parties and politicians.

01:34:08.540 --> 01:34:11.780
Who have as yet been
unable to articulate

01:34:11.780 --> 01:34:17.540
a credible national alternative
that people can trust.

01:34:17.540 --> 01:34:18.290
Thank you, Sugata.

01:34:18.290 --> 01:34:20.330
I just want to say something.

01:34:20.330 --> 01:34:28.370
You know, of course the spate of
the killing of young black men

01:34:28.370 --> 01:34:31.470
is not a lynching.

01:34:31.470 --> 01:34:35.260
But it is-- there
is a kind of family

01:34:35.260 --> 01:34:37.960
resemblance between them.

01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:40.450
That the killing
of young black men

01:34:40.450 --> 01:34:44.700
by the police for various
reasons as [INAUDIBLE]

01:34:44.700 --> 01:34:47.290
put it beautifully.

01:34:47.290 --> 01:34:50.080
One person was killed
because he had a hoodie on.

01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:52.300
Another person, another
black person kid

01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:54.880
was killed because he was
listening to the wrong music.

01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:58.850
A third one was scared when
the police car came and he ran.

01:34:58.850 --> 01:35:04.390
You know, these are not
lynchings in the old tradition.

01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:07.540
But they are lynchings
in our tradition.

01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:09.730
There are lynchings
in our lives now.

01:35:09.730 --> 01:35:17.200
And so I think the symbolic
Kamala Harris and Cory Booker

01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:21.010
proposition is indeed speaks
very closely to the world

01:35:21.010 --> 01:35:22.140
we are in.

01:35:22.140 --> 01:35:25.129
Rohit, I want you
to range across.

01:35:25.129 --> 01:35:26.170
And then we will open up.

01:35:26.170 --> 01:35:27.610
But I do want to ask you.

01:35:27.610 --> 01:35:32.770
Whether the progressive nature
of our constitution, people

01:35:32.770 --> 01:35:36.670
describe it because of
[INAUDIBLE] presence

01:35:36.670 --> 01:35:39.370
that it is a minoritarian
constitution,

01:35:39.370 --> 01:35:40.720
it's a progressive.

01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:43.510
Do you think that
there is some optimism

01:35:43.510 --> 01:35:49.600
to be found there by
returning to the Constitution,

01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:52.420
rather like Justice Scalia?

01:35:52.420 --> 01:35:54.260
This is a joke, by the way.

01:35:54.260 --> 01:35:55.810
Anyway.

01:35:55.810 --> 01:35:58.900
So maybe I'll answer your
last question first and then

01:35:58.900 --> 01:36:02.340
get to optimism and the law.

01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:06.010
No, and I would not recommend
originalism for any society.

01:36:06.010 --> 01:36:08.980
Certainly not the United States.

01:36:08.980 --> 01:36:11.380
I mean, the
Constitution is an act

01:36:11.380 --> 01:36:13.120
of political compromise
accommodating

01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:14.560
numerous interests.

01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:16.590
What makes it progressive
is not its authors,

01:36:16.590 --> 01:36:18.730
though they were all
men and women who

01:36:18.730 --> 01:36:21.280
managed to work together
to forge this consensus.

01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:22.870
But really what
makes it progressive

01:36:22.870 --> 01:36:24.640
is the fact that
progressive groups

01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:26.440
and progressive
individuals have been

01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:30.120
able to harness it and push it
towards a certain direction.

01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:33.130
And I would not suggest that
the Constitution be set in stone

01:36:33.130 --> 01:36:35.220
and nothing be ever changed.

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:40.360
I know, but I felt like
I needed to clarify it.

01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:42.260
Some jokes fall flat.

01:36:42.260 --> 01:36:43.990
There was a great
deal of inheritance

01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:47.350
in terms of the clauses of
the 1955 Government of India

01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:48.895
Act in the Constitution.

01:36:48.895 --> 01:36:50.960
It's not the document that is--

01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:52.470
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:36:52.470 --> 01:36:54.220
But many people,
including several judges,

01:36:54.220 --> 01:36:55.720
are advocating
originalism in India.

01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:57.650
And I thought it's good to
sort of put that on the ground.

01:36:57.650 --> 01:36:58.470
Thank you.

01:36:58.470 --> 01:36:59.700
The second is about optimism.

01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:01.450
And you know, ironically
it's because I've

01:37:01.450 --> 01:37:04.300
read Professor Jalad's work
that I am more optimistic.

01:37:04.300 --> 01:37:07.870
I think what your work shows
is that it's at some level

01:37:07.870 --> 01:37:12.190
structurally not possible to
govern societies in South Asia

01:37:12.190 --> 01:37:14.007
through Maximalist
authoritarian measures.

01:37:14.007 --> 01:37:15.340
At some point, they crack apart.

01:37:15.340 --> 01:37:18.160
And the real question
is who has to suffer

01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:20.960
to wait till that point where
it cracks and it gives up.

01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:23.860
So the second thing
in the Indian context

01:37:23.860 --> 01:37:26.212
that gives me
optimism is the one

01:37:26.212 --> 01:37:27.670
remarkable feature
of any democracy

01:37:27.670 --> 01:37:29.620
has been expansion of franchise.

01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:33.580
Unlike the US, where there
is vast exclusion of people

01:37:33.580 --> 01:37:36.430
from franchise, often from
marginalized and poor sections

01:37:36.430 --> 01:37:37.450
in India.

01:37:37.450 --> 01:37:39.430
At least till now,
these have been

01:37:39.430 --> 01:37:41.260
groups that have got
franchise and have

01:37:41.260 --> 01:37:43.390
participated in it heavily.

01:37:43.390 --> 01:37:47.320
And that has been, at some
level, the kind of thing

01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:49.270
that upsets the apple cart.

01:37:49.270 --> 01:37:52.840
I remember 2004 and the election
results were unexpected.

01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:54.970
And people talk about
the 1977 results.

01:37:54.970 --> 01:37:57.010
And I'm hoping
that to that extent

01:37:57.010 --> 01:37:59.410
those kinds of electoral
connections can happen.

01:37:59.410 --> 01:38:03.220
Lastly, I mean one, I'm very
appreciative of the sting

01:38:03.220 --> 01:38:05.415
operation that [INAUDIBLE]
and I wanted to just--

01:38:05.415 --> 01:38:06.790
when I was referring
to videos, I

01:38:06.790 --> 01:38:08.790
was talking about the
videos of the actual crime

01:38:08.790 --> 01:38:10.810
itself that are circulating.

01:38:10.810 --> 01:38:13.750
I think an anti-lynching law
would have symbolic benefits,

01:38:13.750 --> 01:38:15.830
but it's not going
to stop anything.

01:38:15.830 --> 01:38:19.310
Partly because the regular, old
fashioned colonial [INAUDIBLE]

01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:21.190
record has enough
and more provisions

01:38:21.190 --> 01:38:22.300
to deal with lynching.

01:38:22.300 --> 01:38:23.841
The fact that they
don't deal with it

01:38:23.841 --> 01:38:27.070
is either lack of political
independence and will

01:38:27.070 --> 01:38:30.220
or the fact that we have a
widely unrepresentative police

01:38:30.220 --> 01:38:32.794
force, which does not reflect
the demographics of society

01:38:32.794 --> 01:38:33.460
that it governs.

01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:36.050
So unless those two
things are changed--

01:38:36.050 --> 01:38:38.920
Which is also true of
the colonial army, which

01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:40.630
was also very unrepresentative.

01:38:40.630 --> 01:38:43.660
Which is interesting to see
how these things repeat.

01:38:43.660 --> 01:38:48.370
Well, it's important for
a Humanities Center event

01:38:48.370 --> 01:38:52.090
to show how interpretations
can be creative

01:38:52.090 --> 01:38:56.110
and that my friend
Ayesha Jalal's pessimism,

01:38:56.110 --> 01:38:57.670
with which I have
a great sympathy,

01:38:57.670 --> 01:39:00.360
was now turned into
optimism by you.

01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:02.050
Rohit, I think this is lovely.

01:39:02.050 --> 01:39:04.960
I think this is exactly the way
in which discussions should go

01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:06.940
and negotiations should happen.

01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:08.800
I just want to end
before I open it up

01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:14.080
to the audience
with the idea, and I

01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:16.320
don't know why Adorno keeps
coming to my mind today.

01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:20.920
Adorno said the only way to
live with political situations

01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:26.190
and resistance is to live in
a state of disappointed hope.

01:39:26.190 --> 01:39:28.720
And I think that's
exactly where we are now,

01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:31.440
a state of disappointed,
the best you can get.

01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:33.090
I completely agree.

01:39:33.090 --> 01:39:33.970
Absolutely.

01:39:33.970 --> 01:39:36.150
And I want a hand
of applause for

01:39:36.150 --> 01:39:37.796
these wonderful presentations.

01:39:37.796 --> 01:39:39.245
Thank you.

01:39:39.245 --> 01:39:42.150
[APPLAUSE]

01:39:42.150 --> 01:39:43.300
Right.

01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:48.140
Questions from the audience?

01:39:48.140 --> 01:39:50.350
And please introduce yourselves.

01:39:50.350 --> 01:39:52.390
The man in red.

01:39:52.390 --> 01:39:54.310
Please introduce yourself.

01:39:54.310 --> 01:39:55.270
Hi.

01:39:55.270 --> 01:39:57.910
So I am a recent graduate
from Carnegie Mellon.

01:39:57.910 --> 01:40:00.750
I just came to Boston for work.

01:40:00.750 --> 01:40:05.680
So I might be sort of a
black sheep in the room.

01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:07.300
You are a black
sheep in the room?

01:40:07.300 --> 01:40:10.030
Yes, I think so.

01:40:10.030 --> 01:40:13.180
So this particular
session I think

01:40:13.180 --> 01:40:17.920
is exactly like a manifestation
of a social media ecochamber

01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:22.180
wherein I would
most closely agree

01:40:22.180 --> 01:40:25.060
with Mrs. Ayesha,
wherein she says there's

01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:27.390
a lot of narrative building.

01:40:27.390 --> 01:40:31.750
And although I'm not definitely
the individual instances

01:40:31.750 --> 01:40:34.810
of lynchings and all of that
are definitely real issues.

01:40:34.810 --> 01:40:37.910
I think they can be a counter.

01:40:37.910 --> 01:40:39.910
To a lot of the broader
she was mentioned there,

01:40:39.910 --> 01:40:43.870
and I think it's
important to have people

01:40:43.870 --> 01:40:46.344
from the other side,
too, because there

01:40:46.344 --> 01:40:48.010
are legitimate voices
on the other side.

01:40:48.010 --> 01:40:49.120
And that's why--

01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:54.410
It's not like one side is
the only self-righteous side.

01:40:54.410 --> 01:40:59.110
So I think such discussion
sessions should have or include

01:40:59.110 --> 01:41:01.720
people from the other
side so that we actually

01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:07.300
come to some conclusions
and we proceed

01:41:07.300 --> 01:41:09.470
towards a progressive society.

01:41:09.470 --> 01:41:11.030
So you're from the other side.

01:41:11.030 --> 01:41:12.640
So please give us
some point of view.

01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:13.450
I'm not.

01:41:13.450 --> 01:41:18.210
No, give us some sense of what
a counter narrative would be.

01:41:18.210 --> 01:41:19.530
Well, just on--

01:41:19.530 --> 01:41:21.580
I mean, your criticism is taken.

01:41:21.580 --> 01:41:24.610
I wanted to explore this notion
of democracy in distress.

01:41:24.610 --> 01:41:28.972
But let us hear from you what
the counter narrative would be.

01:41:28.972 --> 01:41:30.430
But also let me respond to this.

01:41:30.430 --> 01:41:32.390
Well, let me first hear
the counter narrative.

01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:34.348
Let's hear the counter
narrative, which I think

01:41:34.348 --> 01:41:35.800
is a legitimate issue.

01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:40.990
Firstly, I think
a lot of why we've

01:41:40.990 --> 01:41:46.180
seen a lot of the instances
in the past five years

01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:51.820
is a lot of it has to do
with the rise of social media

01:41:51.820 --> 01:41:52.480
by itself.

01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:55.030
We didn't have the
sort of environment

01:41:55.030 --> 01:41:58.120
on the internet like
seven, eight years back.

01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:00.250
A lot of it is because
of that and it's

01:42:00.250 --> 01:42:01.650
amplified because of that.

01:42:01.650 --> 01:42:06.010
So well, I'm not a
scholar on this issue.

01:42:06.010 --> 01:42:08.530
But I'm just saying
from an outsider,

01:42:08.530 --> 01:42:10.600
from a layman's
perspective, from what I've

01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:11.890
heard on the internet,
there are obviously

01:42:11.890 --> 01:42:12.910
two sides to the coin.

01:42:12.910 --> 01:42:17.050
And in this room, I heard
only one side, which is fine.

01:42:17.050 --> 01:42:22.450
But it's not exactly, it doesn't
lead to like specific solutions

01:42:22.450 --> 01:42:23.500
or conclusions.

01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:24.640
No.

01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:25.390
You're right.

01:42:25.390 --> 01:42:28.070
It doesn't lead to
specific conclusions.

01:42:28.070 --> 01:42:31.070
And I think you're also--

01:42:31.070 --> 01:42:32.590
Let us first be
properly lynched,

01:42:32.590 --> 01:42:34.960
and then we will
rise and respond.

01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:37.480
But I also think you're
right that we did not

01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:41.800
include somebody here
from the RSS or the BJP.

01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:44.500
You're absolutely
right, we didn't do it.

01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:47.410
But the question of the
other narrative, and there's

01:42:47.410 --> 01:42:48.790
a large audience here.

01:42:48.790 --> 01:42:51.910
Nobody has directed people
not to appear in the audience

01:42:51.910 --> 01:42:53.920
and ask any questions
as you've done.

01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:56.300
You've done very usefully.

01:42:56.300 --> 01:43:00.040
The social media issue, and
I'm going to hand over to you,

01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:01.940
is not the only issue here.

01:43:01.940 --> 01:43:08.530
The issue is when the government
itself does not in any way

01:43:08.530 --> 01:43:13.600
punish or castigate its
senior office holders

01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:15.940
when they spew the kind of--

01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:16.990
I agree with that point.

01:43:16.990 --> 01:43:19.540
That is the
important issue here.

01:43:19.540 --> 01:43:22.240
And that's one of the things we
wanted to bring to the table.

01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:25.630
Because if you go to India,
as you said and you've

01:43:25.630 --> 01:43:30.430
said too, largely in the
media, there is no voice.

01:43:30.430 --> 01:43:31.689
It is not possible to talk.

01:43:31.689 --> 01:43:32.230
Yeah, I know.

01:43:32.230 --> 01:43:33.880
Some of the points
are definitely valid.

01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:34.150
Thank you.

01:43:34.150 --> 01:43:34.649
Anyway--

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:43:36.340 --> 01:43:39.190
I just want to quickly
respond to this idea of sides,

01:43:39.190 --> 01:43:41.510
that there's only people
from one side here.

01:43:41.510 --> 01:43:44.320
So just to make it
clear that I don't

01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:46.780
think I represent any side.

01:43:46.780 --> 01:43:49.620
The only side that ideally
journalists should be on

01:43:49.620 --> 01:43:51.190
is on the side of facts.

01:43:51.190 --> 01:43:52.930
But unfortunately
what has happened

01:43:52.930 --> 01:43:54.820
is that facts
themselves have become

01:43:54.820 --> 01:43:58.420
contested and are being seen
now through the prism of left

01:43:58.420 --> 01:43:59.230
or right.

01:43:59.230 --> 01:44:05.260
While there is something as
clearly an established truth.

01:44:05.260 --> 01:44:07.990
So I don't think that
reporting any of this

01:44:07.990 --> 01:44:11.050
puts you in one
or the other side.

01:44:11.050 --> 01:44:14.590
We reported on the "egregious
crimes", quote unquote,

01:44:14.590 --> 01:44:16.510
of previous
governments, as well.

01:44:16.510 --> 01:44:19.060
But if there is something
which has characteristically

01:44:19.060 --> 01:44:20.880
worsened under the
present regime,

01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:22.900
it is the duty to bring it out.

01:44:22.900 --> 01:44:25.330
So the idea of actually
doing it in this form

01:44:25.330 --> 01:44:28.210
was so that it insulates it
from this kind of criticism

01:44:28.210 --> 01:44:29.950
that oh, you've shown one side.

01:44:29.950 --> 01:44:31.090
There's another side.

01:44:31.090 --> 01:44:32.710
What other side is there?

01:44:32.710 --> 01:44:36.920
If hate speech has gone up
500%, it's gone up 500%.

01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:38.470
You can't dispute that.

01:44:38.470 --> 01:44:41.230
So I think let's not
reduce everything

01:44:41.230 --> 01:44:44.410
to these easy social
media binaries.

01:44:44.410 --> 01:44:48.670
Let's try to look at things,
you know, truths or facts,

01:44:48.670 --> 01:44:50.720
as they are on
their own standing.

01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:52.600
So I mean, I really urge that.

01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:53.390
Thank you.

01:44:53.390 --> 01:44:55.750
Let's hear about two
or three questions

01:44:55.750 --> 01:44:57.890
and then bring it to the panel.

01:44:57.890 --> 01:45:01.590
Right, so there's somebody here.

01:45:01.590 --> 01:45:02.650
Yes?

01:45:02.650 --> 01:45:03.830
There at the back.

01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:06.740
One, two, three, four.

01:45:06.740 --> 01:45:08.680
Let's do this little
sector and then

01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:10.600
we'll move to that
end of the room.

01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:11.440
Hopefully.

01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:13.810
Hi, my name is Vishnuvi.

01:45:13.810 --> 01:45:17.410
I'm a student at the Harvard
Graduate School of Design.

01:45:17.410 --> 01:45:19.750
And I just started.

01:45:19.750 --> 01:45:23.470
So I'm taking a lot
of courses in politics

01:45:23.470 --> 01:45:25.960
in the Department of Public
Administration Politics

01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:26.920
and Religion.

01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:29.080
And just recently
completed a paper,

01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:32.560
we're just talking about the
American economy and the effect

01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:34.390
of politics on religion.

01:45:34.390 --> 01:45:36.460
And that made me think
about all those theories

01:45:36.460 --> 01:45:37.690
within the Indian context.

01:45:37.690 --> 01:45:41.610
And you know, I was sort
of reflecting on that.

01:45:41.610 --> 01:45:45.510
And I sort of agree
with Ayesha here a lot.

01:45:45.510 --> 01:45:50.490
Because knowing that we come
from a secular constitution

01:45:50.490 --> 01:45:54.790
where we don't have a state
religion and on the other side,

01:45:54.790 --> 01:45:57.440
as a country that is
extremely democratic.

01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:00.730
How do you really understand
the scenario or the phenomenon

01:46:00.730 --> 01:46:05.740
where a state itself
elects a religious head

01:46:05.740 --> 01:46:07.720
to sort of govern
the whole thing.

01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:09.640
I mean, [INAUDIBLE],,
as a monk who

01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:14.290
is now a religious
leader in politics

01:46:14.290 --> 01:46:16.140
affecting the whole thing.

01:46:16.140 --> 01:46:19.480
And then talking about optimism
and that's the second point,

01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:20.710
I was just thinking about it.

01:46:20.710 --> 01:46:22.450
What happened to
the Catholic church

01:46:22.450 --> 01:46:26.500
was people started having
their own interpretations

01:46:26.500 --> 01:46:29.380
and sort of derived new
religions out of that.

01:46:29.380 --> 01:46:31.360
So you had the
Catholic Christianity,

01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:33.940
then you have the Protestants,
you have the Reformists.

01:46:33.940 --> 01:46:37.870
And it kept on reviving itself
through newer interpretations

01:46:37.870 --> 01:46:39.910
or creation of new religions.

01:46:39.910 --> 01:46:41.860
Whereas I see what's
happening inside

01:46:41.860 --> 01:46:43.242
and I'm politically undeclared.

01:46:43.242 --> 01:46:44.200
I'm not even religious.

01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:49.000
But just there's two ways I
think where things can change.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:52.540
One is it's either a
new religion, which

01:46:52.540 --> 01:46:54.910
is like you're talking
about revival in religion.

01:46:54.910 --> 01:46:58.720
Or the second is a
revolt. And that's

01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:00.430
where I think where
Pakistan comes from

01:47:00.430 --> 01:47:01.630
is a state of revolt.

01:47:01.630 --> 01:47:03.520
But I mean, I don't know
where we are headed.

01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:04.420
Thank you.

01:47:04.420 --> 01:47:05.791
Thank you very much.

01:47:05.791 --> 01:47:07.540
That was a comment
rather than a question.

01:47:07.540 --> 01:47:11.150
But let's move
here to these here.

01:47:11.150 --> 01:47:14.940
And then to the
lady in the white.

01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:17.899
In the back.

01:47:17.899 --> 01:47:18.440
Good evening.

01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:20.439
My name is Sudashana, and
I'm a graduate student

01:47:20.439 --> 01:47:22.720
in the Department of History.

01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:26.180
My question comes from a
space of disappointed hope

01:47:26.180 --> 01:47:29.020
and draws upon some of the
ideas that you put forward

01:47:29.020 --> 01:47:33.700
about resistance, about media,
about there being narratives

01:47:33.700 --> 01:47:36.070
in different sides.

01:47:36.070 --> 01:47:39.390
Because we've been talking
about social media as well,

01:47:39.390 --> 01:47:43.180
there has been recently a lot
of WhatsApp groups and fake news

01:47:43.180 --> 01:47:47.920
circulating on the
WhatsApp medium.

01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:49.720
Which have been
successful in converting

01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:54.790
a lot of people who are more
or less skeptical still.

01:47:54.790 --> 01:47:57.400
What do we do about
that kind of fake news?

01:47:57.400 --> 01:47:59.500
OK, what do we do about
fake news in social media?

01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:01.630
Thank you very much.

01:48:01.630 --> 01:48:03.280
Question, yeah.

01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:05.570
Please, everybody take
note of these questions.

01:48:05.570 --> 01:48:06.070
Thank you.

01:48:06.070 --> 01:48:06.880
Diana Eck.

01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:10.480
And I teach a little bit about
some of these things here.

01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:12.770
But this has been a
really informative panel.

01:48:12.770 --> 01:48:16.750
And I think the issue of being
afraid to speak the truth

01:48:16.750 --> 01:48:19.690
or speaking the truth
being revolutionary

01:48:19.690 --> 01:48:22.960
is something I've heard
from friends in India.

01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:27.310
It's not a sort of society
these days in which people feel

01:48:27.310 --> 01:48:29.700
comfortable just speaking out.

01:48:29.700 --> 01:48:33.850
And you know, that's a
very disturbing thing.

01:48:33.850 --> 01:48:36.080
And I know that there are
voices on the other side.

01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:37.600
I know they're
not-- people think

01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:41.410
this cow killing thing is absurd
and let's just call it that.

01:48:41.410 --> 01:48:44.380
And the ways in which
people have been lynched

01:48:44.380 --> 01:48:48.730
and even including
figures like Swami Agnive,

01:48:48.730 --> 01:48:51.350
she was beaten up rather badly.

01:48:51.350 --> 01:48:56.710
But I think there are people
who are sort of speaking out

01:48:56.710 --> 01:49:00.980
and not having a good
time of it there.

01:49:00.980 --> 01:49:09.220
So it's that sense of the
cowing of the populace of people

01:49:09.220 --> 01:49:16.150
who, whether in
universities or in public,

01:49:16.150 --> 01:49:17.560
just are afraid to speak.

01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:18.080
Thank you.

01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:20.380
And of course, we
must raise this issue,

01:49:20.380 --> 01:49:22.280
that people are harrassed.

01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:25.630
There is a huge
harassment of people.

01:49:25.630 --> 01:49:27.730
They are harassed
legally, they're

01:49:27.730 --> 01:49:31.530
harassed in terms of
their own security.

01:49:31.530 --> 01:49:36.220
So I think that we really need
to have these issues where

01:49:36.220 --> 01:49:38.630
we are relatively safe.

01:49:38.630 --> 01:49:41.200
Yes, a question
here please and then

01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:44.530
we can return to the panel.

01:49:44.530 --> 01:49:45.270
Hi.

01:49:45.270 --> 01:49:47.367
I'm a research fellow at MIT.

01:49:47.367 --> 01:49:48.700
I have a really simple question.

01:49:48.700 --> 01:49:53.150
So in 2014, the BJP won over 70%
of the seats in the Parliament

01:49:53.150 --> 01:49:56.382
with a little over 30%
of the popular vote.

01:49:56.382 --> 01:49:58.090
And there was some
talk of how the Indian

01:49:58.090 --> 01:50:00.340
Parliament is no
longer representative

01:50:00.340 --> 01:50:01.480
of the electorate.

01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:05.560
Is first past the post
unsuitable for our country

01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:08.230
or is untenable in 2014?

01:50:08.230 --> 01:50:11.167
Excellent, let's
turn now to Ayesha.

01:50:11.167 --> 01:50:12.250
Yeah, we will come to you.

01:50:12.250 --> 01:50:12.749
No, no.

01:50:12.749 --> 01:50:13.330
Hang on.

01:50:13.330 --> 01:50:13.960
Hang on.

01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:15.670
Hang on.

01:50:15.670 --> 01:50:19.240
This is democracy in operation.

01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:21.150
Not democracy in distress.

01:50:21.150 --> 01:50:22.909
So you choose as you please.

01:50:22.909 --> 01:50:23.450
That's right.

01:50:23.450 --> 01:50:25.780
I'd like to respond to
the fake news question.

01:50:25.780 --> 01:50:28.990
What to do with fake news
I think is to ignore it.

01:50:28.990 --> 01:50:31.990
I think far too much
importance is placed

01:50:31.990 --> 01:50:33.710
in circulating fake news.

01:50:33.710 --> 01:50:36.610
I think the whole
ethos of social media

01:50:36.610 --> 01:50:39.820
needs to be sought by young
people and not so young people.

01:50:39.820 --> 01:50:42.670
I think this tendency
to just forward things

01:50:42.670 --> 01:50:45.560
and just shoot things
off has to stop.

01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:47.410
i mean, you need to
control yourself.

01:50:47.410 --> 01:50:51.364
This is a civil
society out of control.

01:50:51.364 --> 01:50:54.210
That's what I think.

01:50:54.210 --> 01:50:57.060
Then I think I don't know
anything else to respond to.

01:50:57.060 --> 01:51:00.120
But you know, just to
support, in this very room,

01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:03.000
in this very room
we once had a very

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:07.080
fine presidential
historian who had written

01:51:07.080 --> 01:51:09.360
a blog which had gone viral.

01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:13.500
And my colleague,
Steve, said to me,

01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:15.060
you know maybe we
should have her.

01:51:15.060 --> 01:51:17.340
So we had her on a very
distinguished panel.

01:51:17.340 --> 01:51:19.890
And well, the story she told
us so much, [INAUDIBLE]..

01:51:19.890 --> 01:51:23.970
She said I was writing a
rather dull academic article

01:51:23.970 --> 01:51:28.110
and then some thought came
to me and I wrote a blog.

01:51:28.110 --> 01:51:31.140
I posted it and I
went out to dinner.

01:51:31.140 --> 01:51:34.890
And I came back to find
that 2,000 people or 300

01:51:34.890 --> 01:51:36.910
people or 600 people
had responded to it.

01:51:36.910 --> 01:51:41.580
She said in retrospect, I
don't think it was very good.

01:51:41.580 --> 01:51:45.510
But once the
virality carries on,

01:51:45.510 --> 01:51:47.580
then opinion gets to be formed.

01:51:47.580 --> 01:51:50.310
We've got to be very careful
about public opinion.

01:51:50.310 --> 01:51:51.870
Well, you form public opinion.

01:51:51.870 --> 01:51:53.790
But don't send things
that are dubious.

01:51:53.790 --> 01:51:55.740
I do think a lot
of people do that.

01:51:55.740 --> 01:51:56.860
People will do that.

01:51:56.860 --> 01:52:00.080
Homi, sorry, can I just
on the fake news point.

01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:03.340
While I agree that
self-regulation is important,

01:52:03.340 --> 01:52:07.740
but at the same time it's not as
if you can just let claims also

01:52:07.740 --> 01:52:08.910
go uncontested.

01:52:08.910 --> 01:52:12.270
For instance, what you
just saw was an example

01:52:12.270 --> 01:52:14.960
of busting of fake news as in
the case of the Meerat Love

01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:15.900
Jihad case, right?

01:52:15.900 --> 01:52:19.860
So something like that, a
completely manufactured fiction

01:52:19.860 --> 01:52:22.830
about gang rape and
maulanas and so on has

01:52:22.830 --> 01:52:25.480
the potential to create
social unrest, which it did.

01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:28.620
And the busting of it
does help in some cases

01:52:28.620 --> 01:52:29.550
to cool things down.

01:52:29.550 --> 01:52:34.030
So I don't think it's
about ignoring fake news.

01:52:34.030 --> 01:52:36.510
It's about what fake news
is that you choose to bust.

01:52:36.510 --> 01:52:39.900
If you want to sit and go after
every single WhatsApp forward,

01:52:39.900 --> 01:52:40.920
there is no end to it.

01:52:40.920 --> 01:52:43.780
But certainly the most
egregious examples,

01:52:43.780 --> 01:52:46.680
especially when the state lies
or the state is putting out

01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:53.520
false claims or propaganda or of
this kind of incendiary stuff,

01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:56.860
I think there it's important
to actually come out and do it.

01:52:56.860 --> 01:52:59.850
And to your point as to what
should be done, as you probably

01:52:59.850 --> 01:53:02.190
know in the Indian context
and the world over,

01:53:02.190 --> 01:53:04.470
increasingly news
organizations are

01:53:04.470 --> 01:53:09.400
investing huge amounts of
resources to busting fake news.

01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:11.941
So that's already
organically happening.

01:53:11.941 --> 01:53:13.440
There are mainstream
media doing it,

01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:15.930
there are all sorts of
websites and portals doing it.

01:53:15.930 --> 01:53:18.530
And you know, I think
that's a good thing.

01:53:18.530 --> 01:53:20.250
Except because that
fake news seems

01:53:20.250 --> 01:53:24.870
to be more attractive
than factual news.

01:53:24.870 --> 01:53:26.182
People love fake news.

01:53:26.182 --> 01:53:27.390
I mean, it's not for nothing.

01:53:27.390 --> 01:53:28.110
It's more entertaining.

01:53:28.110 --> 01:53:29.068
It's more entertaining.

01:53:29.068 --> 01:53:32.380
It's not for nothing that
Satan is the real hero

01:53:32.380 --> 01:53:34.050
of Milton's Paradise Lost.

01:53:34.050 --> 01:53:36.270
By the time God
comes there, nobody's

01:53:36.270 --> 01:53:37.830
interested in
reading any further.

01:53:37.830 --> 01:53:39.190
Sugata.

01:53:39.190 --> 01:53:41.850
I'd like to respond to
the religion question,

01:53:41.850 --> 01:53:43.680
if I may briefly.

01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:47.700
And here I'm really
borrowing from Ayesha

01:53:47.700 --> 01:53:51.450
to say that we really
need to make sure that we

01:53:51.450 --> 01:53:55.160
don't make religion our enemy.

01:53:55.160 --> 01:53:59.310
And what we need to target
is religious bigotry,

01:53:59.310 --> 01:54:01.830
religious prejudice.

01:54:01.830 --> 01:54:06.930
And you know, most people
in our subcontinent,

01:54:06.930 --> 01:54:09.640
whether it's India,
Pakistan, or Bangladesh,

01:54:09.640 --> 01:54:11.670
have religious faith.

01:54:11.670 --> 01:54:13.920
They are God
fearing in some way.

01:54:13.920 --> 01:54:17.130
But I also think that
an overwhelming majority

01:54:17.130 --> 01:54:23.970
among them are not harboring
prejudice against members

01:54:23.970 --> 01:54:28.060
of another community.

01:54:28.060 --> 01:54:30.460
So that, I think, is
extremely important.

01:54:30.460 --> 01:54:38.370
And that's why I've argued for
a rethinking of secularism.

01:54:38.370 --> 01:54:41.370
That you know, those of us
who were bred in the Nehruvian

01:54:41.370 --> 01:54:49.290
secular tradition had to
reflect a bit, particularly

01:54:49.290 --> 01:54:54.390
after the [INAUDIBLE] movement,
the Babri Masjid demolition,

01:54:54.390 --> 01:54:58.250
and even more so of late.

01:54:58.250 --> 01:55:01.710
So I think if we are
able to desegregate

01:55:01.710 --> 01:55:05.760
this category of religion,
then we would understand

01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:08.160
that a lot of what
is going on is really

01:55:08.160 --> 01:55:17.880
about politics with religious
bigotry thrown into this mix.

01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:22.680
And also, I just wanted to
say that here is a panel where

01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:26.880
we have a journalist who
is trying to report truth

01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:29.620
and is trying to
bring down the hype.

01:55:29.620 --> 01:55:31.810
And there are three
historians who

01:55:31.810 --> 01:55:36.210
were asked to comment on what
he had to say and also provide

01:55:36.210 --> 01:55:39.090
broader context.

01:55:39.090 --> 01:55:41.460
That is what we have been doing.

01:55:41.460 --> 01:55:44.960
But we all have
multiple identities.

01:55:44.960 --> 01:55:49.410
So a few days ago, I spoke in
a faculty seminar organized

01:55:49.410 --> 01:55:52.080
by my colleague Jamal
Kafadar under the rubric

01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:54.700
the historian as
public intellectual.

01:55:54.700 --> 01:55:59.010
And my role in India
since 2014 has really

01:55:59.010 --> 01:56:03.780
been that of a historian, as
a public intellectual, who

01:56:03.780 --> 01:56:11.610
had chosen the Indian Parliament
as a venue to express my views.

01:56:11.610 --> 01:56:14.910
And there, I have
to say, one had

01:56:14.910 --> 01:56:21.480
to face a solid phalanx of 330
members of the ruling party.

01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:25.260
That included Yogi Adityanath
until he became Chief Minister

01:56:25.260 --> 01:56:27.015
of Uttar Pradesh.

01:56:30.500 --> 01:56:33.510
But even under
those circumstances,

01:56:33.510 --> 01:56:40.210
it's important to be able
to articulate one's views.

01:56:40.210 --> 01:56:40.980
So I'm not--

01:56:43.980 --> 01:56:47.190
I don't feel too badly
about the composition

01:56:47.190 --> 01:56:50.340
of this particular panel.

01:56:50.340 --> 01:56:52.800
And what I had to do,
of course, and I've

01:56:52.800 --> 01:56:58.200
got some respect from even
those whom I excoriate day in

01:56:58.200 --> 01:56:59.340
and day out.

01:56:59.340 --> 01:57:02.460
And in a particular
debate that I

01:57:02.460 --> 01:57:05.280
was mentioning on the occasion
of the 75th anniversary

01:57:05.280 --> 01:57:08.200
of the Quit India movement,
I had to call upon them.

01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:10.440
They were all there,
led by Narendra Modi.

01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:14.880
And I basically said that I know
that you have your own gurugies

01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:16.230
whom you revere.

01:57:16.230 --> 01:57:20.520
But since we are commemorating a
movement led by Mahatma Gandhi,

01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:25.200
may I invite you to come over
to our side for the next five

01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:29.340
years and follow the path
lit up by the halo of Mahatma

01:57:29.340 --> 01:57:32.280
Gandhi, who's 150th birth
anniversary has just

01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:34.230
started by the way.

01:57:34.230 --> 01:57:39.180
So I think numbers
don't matter that much.

01:57:39.180 --> 01:57:42.240
And I think you just simply
need a civil atmosphere

01:57:42.240 --> 01:57:46.600
within which you can express
your views and without fear.

01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:49.590
And that's why what Diana,
Professor Diana Eck is saying

01:57:49.590 --> 01:57:53.310
is so important, that there is
an atmosphere of intimidation.

01:57:53.310 --> 01:57:56.390
And that has to change.

01:57:56.390 --> 01:58:01.680
Did you also ask the opposition
to join that very eminent

01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:03.900
prophet in Calcutta, Karl Marx?

01:58:03.900 --> 01:58:05.970
[LAUGHTER]

01:58:05.970 --> 01:58:07.396
Yes.

01:58:07.396 --> 01:58:09.520
I'm sorry, the gentleman,
I didn't catch your name.

01:58:09.520 --> 01:58:11.395
I want to respond to
you and then in relation

01:58:11.395 --> 01:58:13.410
to that, Professor Eck.

01:58:13.410 --> 01:58:16.780
It's really going back to
this question of sides.

01:58:16.780 --> 01:58:19.789
So one is I would partly
blame television channels

01:58:19.789 --> 01:58:20.580
for this narrative.

01:58:20.580 --> 01:58:22.205
Because there is this
argument that you

01:58:22.205 --> 01:58:24.300
have to create a diverse panel.

01:58:24.300 --> 01:58:26.310
So you produce
people who represent

01:58:26.310 --> 01:58:29.250
all possible points of view,
even though in some cases

01:58:29.250 --> 01:58:31.370
the points of view or
even the person's ability

01:58:31.370 --> 01:58:35.370
to represent that point
of view is highly dubious.

01:58:35.370 --> 01:58:37.140
And it is interesting
that this would not

01:58:37.140 --> 01:58:39.015
happen in the case of
discussions in science,

01:58:39.015 --> 01:58:40.120
for example.

01:58:40.120 --> 01:58:43.930
If you had someone discussing
effects of climate change,

01:58:43.930 --> 01:58:46.530
would the television channel
bring in a climate change

01:58:46.530 --> 01:58:47.310
denier?

01:58:47.310 --> 01:58:51.635
Or if you have a conversation
around the kind of Mars

01:58:51.635 --> 01:58:53.760
mission, would you have
someone who says, actually,

01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:57.047
Mars is inhabited by little
green men who might--

01:58:57.047 --> 01:58:59.130
So I think there is something
about social science

01:58:59.130 --> 01:59:01.440
that argues that social
science is not scientific.

01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:03.910
You don't speak from expertise,
you speak from opinion.

01:59:03.910 --> 01:59:06.690
And I would sort of
request and gesture

01:59:06.690 --> 01:59:09.310
that we need to treat some
of this more seriously.

01:59:09.310 --> 01:59:10.750
So for example,
there are two ways

01:59:10.750 --> 01:59:15.237
one can say the government after
2014 is not representative.

01:59:15.237 --> 01:59:17.320
One is that it doesn't
represent my point of view.

01:59:17.320 --> 01:59:19.440
And that's not the
argument I was making.

01:59:19.440 --> 01:59:21.060
The other is that
statistically if you

01:59:21.060 --> 01:59:23.160
look at how the
ethnic composition

01:59:23.160 --> 01:59:24.630
of previous
parliaments have been,

01:59:24.630 --> 01:59:28.020
compared with this parliament,
while it gets 31% of the vote,

01:59:28.020 --> 01:59:31.330
does not represent all those
groups in similar proportions.

01:59:31.330 --> 01:59:33.180
And this goes back
to the comment

01:59:33.180 --> 01:59:35.550
that Professor Eck raised
about the inability of people

01:59:35.550 --> 01:59:36.450
to speak up.

01:59:36.450 --> 01:59:38.220
I'm always surprised
by how much,

01:59:38.220 --> 01:59:42.300
and I think the Pakistan example
is always optimistic to read,

01:59:42.300 --> 01:59:45.720
that even in worse situations
many people are brave.

01:59:45.720 --> 01:59:46.350
They speak up.

01:59:46.350 --> 01:59:48.840
They act in areas without
the glare of the media.

01:59:48.840 --> 01:59:51.190
And they face attacks
in India, for example,

01:59:51.190 --> 01:59:53.400
recently a whole slate of
civil liberties lawyers

01:59:53.400 --> 01:59:54.192
have been arrested.

01:59:54.192 --> 01:59:56.024
And again, it's seen
as a question of sides.

01:59:56.024 --> 01:59:58.330
These are lawyers from the
left and they were arrested.

01:59:58.330 --> 02:00:00.597
But we forget, and I
think it's embarrassing

02:00:00.597 --> 02:00:02.430
that it's changed, that
some of the greatest

02:00:02.430 --> 02:00:04.770
civil liberties lawyers
in their time today

02:00:04.770 --> 02:00:06.120
serve in the government.

02:00:06.120 --> 02:00:09.150
In the 1970s, Arun Jaitley was
involved in the People's Union

02:00:09.150 --> 02:00:10.262
for Civil Liberties.

02:00:10.262 --> 02:00:11.970
Sushma Swaraj represented
people who were

02:00:11.970 --> 02:00:13.521
detained during the emergency.

02:00:13.521 --> 02:00:15.770
Ravi Shankar Prasad was going
on fact finding missions

02:00:15.770 --> 02:00:17.310
with the [INAUDIBLE]
in the '80s.

02:00:17.310 --> 02:00:19.140
And civil liberties
in India was started

02:00:19.140 --> 02:00:23.440
by the president of the
Hindu Mahasabha in the 1950s.

02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:26.310
And one of the first clients
he represented in the Supreme

02:00:26.310 --> 02:00:28.740
Court was someone who
was a communist who

02:00:28.740 --> 02:00:32.010
was accused of spreading
sedition and acting

02:00:32.010 --> 02:00:32.760
against the state.

02:00:32.760 --> 02:00:35.135
So there was a time in India
where the right and the left

02:00:35.135 --> 02:00:36.930
could come together
on civil liberties.

02:00:36.930 --> 02:00:39.180
But the right seems to
abandon the civil liberties

02:00:39.180 --> 02:00:40.920
and the Constitution
as resources

02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:43.060
and left it to the
other side to take over.

02:00:43.060 --> 02:00:46.590
And I think in some way,
the endeavor to move towards

02:00:46.590 --> 02:00:49.470
should be to embrace that
at least common conception

02:00:49.470 --> 02:00:51.060
of civility and legal forms.

02:00:51.060 --> 02:00:53.130
That is an excellent
point to end,

02:00:53.130 --> 02:00:56.340
except that I have
given the nod.

02:00:56.340 --> 02:00:59.480
I want just one,
just a little longer

02:00:59.480 --> 02:01:02.340
and we will be able
to have a drink.

02:01:02.340 --> 02:01:03.550
Let me just--

02:01:03.550 --> 02:01:06.780
Yeah, but I'm only going
to choose one, two,

02:01:06.780 --> 02:01:09.510
and that gentleman
in the white shirt.

02:01:09.510 --> 02:01:10.960
But I want questions.

02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:12.300
I do not want comments.

02:01:12.300 --> 02:01:13.260
Question.

02:01:13.260 --> 02:01:15.840
A little sentence with a
question mark at the end.

02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:17.100
No long comments.

02:01:17.100 --> 02:01:18.210
OK, start.

02:01:18.210 --> 02:01:18.750
Thank you.

02:01:18.750 --> 02:01:21.810
My name is Shamir and I'm doing
a Master's in Global Health

02:01:21.810 --> 02:01:24.210
Delivery Program
at medical school.

02:01:24.210 --> 02:01:25.590
I'm from Kerala.

02:01:25.590 --> 02:01:27.900
And we have issues in India.

02:01:27.900 --> 02:01:31.030
We have issues in subcontinent
and [INAUDIBLE] Bangladesh

02:01:31.030 --> 02:01:33.108
as well.

02:01:33.108 --> 02:01:36.330
Can Kerala be a model
for in there, India,

02:01:36.330 --> 02:01:39.510
in terms of dealing
these issues?

02:01:39.510 --> 02:01:41.610
Yes or no?

02:01:41.610 --> 02:01:42.860
Yes.

02:01:42.860 --> 02:01:44.010
We'll go through that, yes.

02:01:44.010 --> 02:01:45.442
And the second
and then the third

02:01:45.442 --> 02:01:47.400
with the gentleman with
the specs in the white.

02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:49.920
Hi, my name is Asar Pariyo,
and I'm from Pakistan.

02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:52.530
I'm a medical area student
at Harvard Kennedy School.

02:01:52.530 --> 02:01:55.350
I must commend you for
your terrific reporting.

02:01:55.350 --> 02:01:57.750
Because in Pakistan, we
don't find an equivalent

02:01:57.750 --> 02:02:01.006
on the airwaves in any
of the media outlets.

02:02:01.006 --> 02:02:02.640
[INAUDIBLE]

02:02:03.860 --> 02:02:05.340
And everybody
knows who they are.

02:02:05.340 --> 02:02:08.880
But nobody has
the courage to go.

02:02:08.880 --> 02:02:10.890
So my question is about
the human side of it.

02:02:10.890 --> 02:02:13.860
What kind of personal
sacrifices do you

02:02:13.860 --> 02:02:15.660
have to make to
speak truth to power?

02:02:15.660 --> 02:02:16.760
Thank you.

02:02:16.760 --> 02:02:18.440
Thank you.

02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:22.500
And the final question
better be a really good one.

02:02:22.500 --> 02:02:24.440
A lot of pressure on you.

02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:26.160
Professor, my name
is Shah Vassal.

02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:26.910
I'm from Kashmir.

02:02:26.910 --> 02:02:29.670
And I'm a graduate student
at the Kennedy School.

02:02:29.670 --> 02:02:32.850
So my question is in
response to your comment

02:02:32.850 --> 02:02:34.680
on disappointed hope.

02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:37.270
So if you look at India and
you look at the last 50 years,

02:02:37.270 --> 02:02:39.690
we have seen a series
of militant insurgencies

02:02:39.690 --> 02:02:42.270
or resistance
movements which worked

02:02:42.270 --> 02:02:45.180
around the denial of political
or socioeconomic rights.

02:02:45.180 --> 02:02:47.190
So we saw an
insurgency in Kashmir.

02:02:47.190 --> 02:02:48.150
We saw in Punjab.

02:02:48.150 --> 02:02:50.690
We saw something of
that sort in Tamil Nadu.

02:02:50.690 --> 02:02:53.340
We have a very thriving
[INAUDIBLE] insurgency.

02:02:53.340 --> 02:02:55.020
So my specific
question is that what

02:02:55.020 --> 02:02:58.560
does it mean for India to
have around 200 million people

02:02:58.560 --> 02:03:02.490
disenfranchised in
the next 20 years?

02:03:02.490 --> 02:03:05.610
Thank you, thank you,
thank you all very much.

02:03:05.610 --> 02:03:10.160
Let's just have a
quick whip around here.

02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:14.220
The first question is
can Kerala be the model

02:03:14.220 --> 02:03:15.310
for the rest of India.

02:03:15.310 --> 02:03:18.540
This is a sort of a
regional foundation list

02:03:18.540 --> 02:03:21.590
and fundamentalist perspective.

02:03:21.590 --> 02:03:24.990
Which we should all
applaud for its courage.

02:03:24.990 --> 02:03:26.730
But let's get to it.

02:03:26.730 --> 02:03:27.840
Yes or no?

02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:29.740
Yes.

02:03:29.740 --> 02:03:30.470
OK.

02:03:30.470 --> 02:03:31.230
Maybe.

02:03:31.230 --> 02:03:33.140
What price?

02:03:33.140 --> 02:03:36.270
A hefty price in the sense
that I think more than myself,

02:03:36.270 --> 02:03:38.490
because I'm not a
human rights activist.

02:03:38.490 --> 02:03:39.560
I'm an academic.

02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:42.300
And I write mainly in
English, which nobody reads

02:03:42.300 --> 02:03:44.710
in Pakistan or very few do.

02:03:44.710 --> 02:03:47.575
And so the military
establishment,

02:03:47.575 --> 02:03:49.200
with all due respect
to them, I suppose

02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:50.720
don't really care what I say.

02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:52.020
I am nobody.

02:03:52.020 --> 02:03:55.390
But the people who have
sacrificed are amongst,

02:03:55.390 --> 02:03:57.990
one that I would like to
mention is Asma Jahangir,

02:03:57.990 --> 02:03:59.430
whom we lost earlier this year.

02:03:59.430 --> 02:04:03.450
Who has expended together
with a wonderful team

02:04:03.450 --> 02:04:07.080
all their energies in
fighting for the minorities,

02:04:07.080 --> 02:04:08.980
the vulnerable minorities.

02:04:08.980 --> 02:04:11.020
And the price is very high.

02:04:11.020 --> 02:04:14.880
Your life is completely
wrapped up here.

02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:16.950
You can't really
lead a normal life

02:04:16.950 --> 02:04:22.730
once you become an advocate
for suppressed minorities.

02:04:22.730 --> 02:04:26.220
As she puts it, Asma, that
it's not human rights,

02:04:26.220 --> 02:04:28.510
it's not a profession.

02:04:28.510 --> 02:04:29.870
It's a conviction.

02:04:29.870 --> 02:04:31.680
And you pay a
heavy price for it.

02:04:31.680 --> 02:04:34.470
I just want to also respond
to that question, which

02:04:34.470 --> 02:04:36.990
the friend from Pakistan
raised about the price.

02:04:36.990 --> 02:04:40.110
So just to give you an idea
of our own organization.

02:04:40.110 --> 02:04:43.470
So in the past 4 and 1/2 years,
we now have cases against us

02:04:43.470 --> 02:04:46.570
from every investigating
agency in India.

02:04:46.570 --> 02:04:49.650
There's the CBI, which is the
federal investigating agency.

02:04:49.650 --> 02:04:51.170
Income tax cases.

02:04:51.170 --> 02:04:53.850
Cases by the enforcement
directorate, which

02:04:53.850 --> 02:04:56.340
investigates financial fraud.

02:04:56.340 --> 02:04:58.260
These are completely
manufactured cases

02:04:58.260 --> 02:05:00.060
and we're fighting
them in court.

02:05:00.060 --> 02:05:03.940
But what it does is that it
dents your operational ability.

02:05:03.940 --> 02:05:04.440
Right?

02:05:04.440 --> 02:05:06.750
So when investors,
when advertisers

02:05:06.750 --> 02:05:09.234
see that you're facing
corruption cases,

02:05:09.234 --> 02:05:11.400
you're facing this kind of
heat from the government,

02:05:11.400 --> 02:05:13.122
they start to pull back.

02:05:13.122 --> 02:05:14.580
In addition to
that, the government

02:05:14.580 --> 02:05:17.190
has actually taken
to calling up some

02:05:17.190 --> 02:05:20.730
of our sponsors and advertisers
and actually threatening them.

02:05:20.730 --> 02:05:24.000
You know, in not so subtle
ways, that if you go ahead

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:25.470
and you want to
fund this channel,

02:05:25.470 --> 02:05:27.850
then there will be consequences.

02:05:27.850 --> 02:05:30.930
So this leads you
into a downward spiral

02:05:30.930 --> 02:05:32.730
of operational ability.

02:05:32.730 --> 02:05:34.380
As your funds come
down, you have

02:05:34.380 --> 02:05:35.790
to start laying people off.

02:05:35.790 --> 02:05:37.860
Your news resources are
not able to go and do

02:05:37.860 --> 02:05:40.110
the kind of journalism that
you've seen comes down.

02:05:40.110 --> 02:05:41.280
Your ratings fall.

02:05:41.280 --> 02:05:42.180
Your revenue falls.

02:05:42.180 --> 02:05:43.805
And then you're on
that downward cycle.

02:05:43.805 --> 02:05:48.590
So actually you do pay a price
for this kind of journalism.

02:05:48.590 --> 02:05:50.490
But that's then up
to each organization

02:05:50.490 --> 02:05:52.948
to think whether they want to
continue with it or they want

02:05:52.948 --> 02:05:53.790
to fall in line.

02:05:53.790 --> 02:05:56.400
But this is not just
the case of NDTV alone.

02:05:56.400 --> 02:06:00.330
If you speak to the few islands
of journalism and journalists

02:06:00.330 --> 02:06:02.040
who are doing this
kind of work, they

02:06:02.040 --> 02:06:05.160
will all have similar
stories to tell

02:06:05.160 --> 02:06:07.600
in one degree or the other.

02:06:07.600 --> 02:06:10.170
Let's take up the question of
Kashmir, if you don't mind.

02:06:10.170 --> 02:06:12.790
Because I think that is
an important question.

02:06:12.790 --> 02:06:17.355
We have to call to this
very interesting discussion

02:06:17.355 --> 02:06:18.770
to a close.

02:06:18.770 --> 02:06:20.530
Let's go with you.

02:06:20.530 --> 02:06:22.810
How would you respond to
that Kashmir question?

02:06:22.810 --> 02:06:25.392
So I think Sreenivasan would
actually be a better person

02:06:25.392 --> 02:06:26.850
to give the answer,
given that he's

02:06:26.850 --> 02:06:33.830
been in the unenviable position
of facing voices in Kashmir

02:06:33.830 --> 02:06:36.320
on one side and facing voices
within the rest of the Indian

02:06:36.320 --> 02:06:37.630
Republic on the other side.

02:06:37.630 --> 02:06:39.595
And knows how to
negotiate this better.

02:06:39.595 --> 02:06:42.470
I'd just like to-- there's a
brief moment in [INAUDIBLE]

02:06:42.470 --> 02:06:44.510
book where he says,
the first time

02:06:44.510 --> 02:06:46.150
he realizes there
is a different India

02:06:46.150 --> 02:06:49.640
is when he's on a train going
from Srinagar to Aligarh.

02:06:49.640 --> 02:06:52.430
And a couple of army men
get on and sit on the seat.

02:06:52.430 --> 02:06:55.837
And the other Indians are
like, do you have a ticket.

02:06:55.837 --> 02:06:57.920
And the soldiers were like,
no but we're soldiers.

02:06:57.920 --> 02:06:58.610
We're going home.

02:06:58.610 --> 02:07:00.670
And they're like, if you don't
have a ticket, get out of here.

02:07:00.670 --> 02:07:03.253
And he says, I realize there is
an India outside Kashmir where

02:07:03.253 --> 02:07:04.250
this happens.

02:07:04.250 --> 02:07:08.086
And I think I am increasingly
concerned that I think

02:07:08.086 --> 02:07:09.710
that India outside
Kashmir is beginning

02:07:09.710 --> 02:07:13.552
to look a lot more like
what happens inside Kashmir.

02:07:13.552 --> 02:07:15.860
And I think in some
ways, we are paying

02:07:15.860 --> 02:07:18.680
for not responding to
these territories that

02:07:18.680 --> 02:07:21.550
exist within the Indian Republic
because of exceptions early on.

02:07:21.550 --> 02:07:24.350
And we can't solve what
happens in the rest of India

02:07:24.350 --> 02:07:27.470
without addressing sort
of deep illegalities

02:07:27.470 --> 02:07:29.240
that happen in many
parts of India.

02:07:29.240 --> 02:07:31.400
And this is also an
interesting echo with you.

02:07:31.400 --> 02:07:34.430
Because Kashmir is one part of
the country where the military

02:07:34.430 --> 02:07:36.810
really rule the roost.

02:07:36.810 --> 02:07:38.690
So I think that's
an interesting issue

02:07:38.690 --> 02:07:41.210
of having a bit of
the Pakistan problem

02:07:41.210 --> 02:07:45.560
right in the center,
right at the borders.

02:07:45.560 --> 02:07:47.910
Sugata, the last word for you.

02:07:47.910 --> 02:07:52.115
On the Kerala question,
there is no yes or no answer.

02:07:52.115 --> 02:07:55.770
It's yes when it comes to
access to health and education.

02:07:55.770 --> 02:08:00.350
No when it comes to political
violence of the sort

02:08:00.350 --> 02:08:02.570
that is taking place
in [INAUDIBLE]..

02:08:02.570 --> 02:08:05.420
There is a
journalist, Ule Kempi,

02:08:05.420 --> 02:08:09.500
who has written a very
good book on that topic.

02:08:09.500 --> 02:08:12.270
I would like to address
the question on Kashmir,

02:08:12.270 --> 02:08:17.120
but also the 200 million
sort of disenfranchised.

02:08:17.120 --> 02:08:18.380
And they are of two kinds.

02:08:18.380 --> 02:08:20.550
In the tribal
heartland of course

02:08:20.550 --> 02:08:23.990
you have those who
are mired in poverty.

02:08:23.990 --> 02:08:26.870
They are excluded and
there is a government

02:08:26.870 --> 02:08:31.190
in alliance with
big business who

02:08:31.190 --> 02:08:36.350
want to allow them to take
away the minerals and forest

02:08:36.350 --> 02:08:38.370
resources and so forth.

02:08:38.370 --> 02:08:41.760
So you see one kind
of insurgency there.

02:08:41.760 --> 02:08:45.440
And the hunger index, by
the way, is very high.

02:08:45.440 --> 02:08:47.810
Particularly in
those parts of India.

02:08:47.810 --> 02:08:51.290
And then there are the other
regions, Kashmir of course,

02:08:51.290 --> 02:08:56.330
but also much of the
Northeast where historically

02:08:56.330 --> 02:08:59.630
over the decades
since independence,

02:08:59.630 --> 02:09:01.830
there has been a
denial of democracy

02:09:01.830 --> 02:09:05.890
and a negation of
federal autonomy.

02:09:05.890 --> 02:09:08.690
And I agree with
Rohit that I think

02:09:08.690 --> 02:09:13.090
there are many citizens
of India in other parts

02:09:13.090 --> 02:09:18.290
outside of these regions who are
now paying the price for having

02:09:18.290 --> 02:09:21.510
been silent for so long.

02:09:21.510 --> 02:09:25.490
When these atrocities have
taken place in certain quote

02:09:25.490 --> 02:09:30.240
unquote "peripheral
regions of India."

02:09:30.240 --> 02:09:34.670
So I think that we
really must in the future

02:09:34.670 --> 02:09:37.610
think of one
standard of democracy

02:09:37.610 --> 02:09:41.510
for the whole
country, particularly

02:09:41.510 --> 02:09:45.890
those which are claimed as
integral parts of the Indian

02:09:45.890 --> 02:09:46.610
Union.

02:09:46.610 --> 02:09:50.540
And also, we need to recognize
that Indian unity has only

02:09:50.540 --> 02:09:56.900
worked when it has been
of a genuine federal type.

02:09:56.900 --> 02:10:01.790
We must learn how to give a
sense of belonging to people

02:10:01.790 --> 02:10:06.020
living in regions where
they have been denied rights

02:10:06.020 --> 02:10:08.990
for very long.

02:10:08.990 --> 02:10:17.150
And that will mean rethinking
our concept of sovereignty,

02:10:17.150 --> 02:10:21.340
altering some of the
structures of our state.

02:10:21.340 --> 02:10:25.430
So if we don't
address these issues,

02:10:25.430 --> 02:10:29.660
then I think we face
a very bleak future.

02:10:29.660 --> 02:10:33.080
But if they can be addressed
and if the current phase

02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:35.120
of religious
majoritarianism results

02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:40.340
in a new kind of politics, a
new kind of democratic politics,

02:10:40.340 --> 02:10:42.740
and a new federalism in India.

02:10:42.740 --> 02:10:45.760
Then perhaps we
can be optimistic,

02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:49.400
as I think our
chairman would like.

02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:51.900
With a touch of disappointment.

02:10:51.900 --> 02:10:53.150
To keep us sharp.

02:10:53.150 --> 02:10:57.200
Perhaps the disappointments
will recede and hope will rise.

02:10:57.200 --> 02:10:58.710
Well, thank you so much.

02:10:58.710 --> 02:11:00.125
I want to thank Basu.

02:11:00.125 --> 02:11:03.740
Basu for being here and
giving us this occasion

02:11:03.740 --> 02:11:05.730
for having this discussion.

02:11:05.730 --> 02:11:06.810
Thank you.

02:11:06.810 --> 02:11:11.460
And all my panelists for
a wonderful participation.

02:11:11.460 --> 02:11:14.310
I think we were not of one mind.

02:11:14.310 --> 02:11:17.030
But I think we did what
universities could best do,

02:11:17.030 --> 02:11:19.730
which is have moments
of convergence.

02:11:19.730 --> 02:11:21.230
We come from
different places, we

02:11:21.230 --> 02:11:23.570
may go to other
places or other ideas.

02:11:23.570 --> 02:11:26.570
But these convergent moments,
these consulations are I

02:11:26.570 --> 02:11:28.460
think extremely important.

02:11:28.460 --> 02:11:33.110
And we will try as best we can
to keep this discussion going.

02:11:33.110 --> 02:11:36.040
Because the country,
our countries here,

02:11:36.040 --> 02:11:38.870
are precious to us.

02:11:38.870 --> 02:11:40.970
They're inspirational to us.

02:11:40.970 --> 02:11:44.320
And yet, they are in extremis.

02:11:44.320 --> 02:11:47.570
And I think we need to speak
from wherever we happen to be.

02:11:47.570 --> 02:11:48.380
Thank you.

02:11:48.380 --> 02:11:50.190
Thank you very much
for being here.

02:11:50.190 --> 02:11:53.540
