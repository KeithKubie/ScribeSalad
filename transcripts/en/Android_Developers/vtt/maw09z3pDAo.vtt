ROMAN NURIK: All right.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.490
Hello, everybody, and welcome
back to "Android Design in

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.680
Action." My name
is Roman Nurik.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.475
And with me here today
is Adam Koch--

00:00:09.475 --> 00:00:09.770
ADAM KOCH: Hey, guys.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.511
ROMAN NURIK: --and
Nick Butcher.

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:12.380
NICK BUTCHER: Hello.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.080
ROMAN NURIK: So today, we're
going to be talking about

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.550
shopping list apps and the
contextual action bar.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.930
And before we jump in, I just
want to remind everybody what

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.640
this show is all about.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.890
So on "Android Design in
Action," we take a look at

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.570
apps that have been previously
reviewed on "The App Clinic,"

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.040
which is on Fridays.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.990
And we take a look at how we
can improve some of the

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.670
screens, some of the visual
designs in the screens of

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.350
those apps.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.110
And then, more recently,
we've been diving

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.940
into specific topics.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.090
For example, a few weeks ago,
we did responsive design,

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.870
meaning designing for tablets
and phones and basically any

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.860
screen size on a spectrum
of devices.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.340
And today, like I said, we're
going to be talking about the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.010
contextual action bar.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.300
So let's jump in with the very
first app that we'll look at

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.480
which was reviewed last week on
"The App Clinic." And that

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.640
app is Grocery IQ.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.310
So before we jump into the
redesign, let's talk about

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.730
what this app does.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.040
And so this app basically lets
you manage a number of

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.090
different lists, or
shopping lists.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.840
So let's say you have a favorite
bakery nearby or a

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.530
favorite supermarket nearby.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.660
And you know that they sell
certain products.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.570
So what you can do is you can
actually create a shopping

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.710
list and create or add items to
your list that are broken

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.700
up by the different stores in
which you would buy them.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.680
So the bakery may have
breads and cereals

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.120
and things like that.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.500
And the grocery store
or supermarket

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.310
may have other things.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.890
So one of the key differences
between this app and other

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.580
shopping list apps is the
ability to kind of break

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.440
things up in that way.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.720
Also, it lets you-- let's just
zoom into the screens here.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.300
It lets you look at some
coupons for, I guess,

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.260
different products that you
may want to buy, maybe

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.830
contextually relevant or not.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.000
It lets you store favorites.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.120
It lets you do a lot of
different types of things.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.300
So it's basically a shopping
list that lets you neatly

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.750
categorize your different items
and lets you also look

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.150
at coupons as well.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.212
Before we jump in, have you
guys used this app at all?

00:02:20.212 --> 00:02:25.690
Or do you have any other
thoughts on the initial

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.790
background on this app?

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:29.510
NICK BUTCHER: No.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.820
ADAM KOCH: Not really.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.660
Actually, I did try it
a little while back.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.680
And unfortunately for me, when
I see the design looked kind

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.355
of dated like this, I usually go
and just sort of uninstall

00:02:39.355 --> 00:02:40.050
it immediately.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.430
So I didn't get to try it out
too much, unfortunately.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.280
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.060
And this app, to be fair, is
using some of the older

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.940
patterns, some of the
Gingerbread styling with the

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.580
tabs, actually.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.500
About a year or so ago,
they'd probably-- or

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.970
maybe two years ago--

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.990
those would be perfectly
normal tabs.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.410
They're actually using the
correct guidelines for the

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.500
icons and so on and
so forth for tabs.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.090
But it's really just
kind of dated.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.700
That's exactly how I'd put it.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.985
ADAM KOCH: And then, of course,
the Menu button, the

00:03:08.985 --> 00:03:11.220
button of shame down the bottom
that the guys from "The

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.430
App Clinic" mentioned as well.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.450
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, the legacy
Menu button is something that

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:15.510
should really just go away.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.710
And we have a solution
for that, anyway.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.900
And the other issue here is that
it's using some of the

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.070
gradients that you'd find on
other platforms, kind of those

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.980
stark gradients, and
also these kind of

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.430
one-pixel text shadows.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.840
This is something we haven't
talked about

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.500
before in this show.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.410
But another thing that
developers do a lot aside from

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.020
gradients and things like that
is adding these tiny little

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.530
shadows to kind of give a sense
of depth to your text.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.960
And in Android, that's
perfectly fine to do.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.010
You can do it in a lot of cases,
but oftentimes it's

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.310
done without real thought
as to why.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.550
Is there a reason
for doing this?

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.930
And I think, in this case, it
works fairly well because it's

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.260
very subtle.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.360
But if you were to move over
to the Holo visual styling,

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.290
the new modern Android UI look
and feel, you should try to

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.420
avoid things like that, those
things that add a

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.290
subtle sense of depth.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.690
It's almost unnecessary.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.839
But again, it's totally fine
if the rest of your visual

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:20.019
design matches with that.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.710
And the other thing that
we like to point out is

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.730
right-facing carets.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.430
Actually, on the screen,
touching the list items here

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.410
doesn't really do anything.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.740
It actually does nothing.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.390
But to get into the details,
you actually have to touch

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.790
this secondary action or
the secondary touch

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.090
area on the list item.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.060
And then to check the item, you
just touch this check box.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.280
So some of these things
make sense, some

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.100
of them not so much.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.330
So we wanted to kind of rethink
how you could approach

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.240
this screen and this
app in general.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.600
So let's jump into the
redesign screen.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.860
Hopefully, let's get to 100%.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:55.950
OK.

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.720
So let's jump into the
redesign screen.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.860
So as we always do, we've added
a proper action bar.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.180
We've added some iconography,
some branding on the top left.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.690
We added a single checkout
action button.

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.860
And if you'll notice back here,
checkout is something

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.440
that after you check the items
that you've purchased, you can

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.180
press Checkout.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.480
And it moves those items into
your history, so that then

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.900
next time you're shopping or
such, you can just bring

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.410
things into your list directly
from your history.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.090
So it's kind of a neat
little feature.

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.970
And we decided to move that
as a primary action

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.520
in the action bar.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.510
We also added spinner navigation
at the top.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.370
And we'll show details
on that in a second.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:41.810
But basically, it lets
you switch between

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:42.960
the different stores.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.870
And you'll see later, it lets
you manage stores and things

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.570
like that, as well.

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:53.250
And then, for the actual list
itself, we've presented the

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.920
same old list.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.580
But to actually jump into the
details, you just touch once

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.640
on the text here.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.050
And just as before, you can
check the box to the left to

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.380
mark it as complete.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.620
But it doesn't actually move it
into a completely separate

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.040
area once it's checked.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.310
It stays put, which is probably
a safer interaction,

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.750
a more consistent interaction.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.420
The other thing I should mention
is that we've also

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:20.770
brought up coupons.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.020
This is one thing I wanted
to talk about.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.440
And it seems like coupons in
this app-- and I think the

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.130
developer is coupons.com--

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.030
seems like coupons are a fairly
important part of

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.640
either the business model, or
maybe it's revenue driving.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.140
I don't really know.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.690
But coupons seemed fairly
important, but they weren't

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:36.820
immediately visible.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.780
So one way in which we tried to
bring that out more is to

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.990
make it more contextually
relevant.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:46.790
So if there's a coupon for one
of the items in your list--

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.820
let's say at a store nearby
there's a coupon for it--

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.330
it'll show up as a secondary
action here with the number of

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.270
coupons found.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:55.580
And then touching that
takes you to the

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.840
coupon detail screen.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.620
And we also decided, why not
make coupons a secondary

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.650
section at the bottom?

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.170
Let's say I have
no list items.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.090
I have nothing on my
shopping list.

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:10.380
Why not just show coupons?

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:13.830
Hey, I forgot to get soup
the other week.

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:14.960
And there's a coupon for soup.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.710
So let me just pop that
into my shopping list.

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:22.030
But also, if you do have lots
of shopping list items, then

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.730
you're probably not so much
worried about other products.

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:26.840
You probably want to just get
rid of those products and buy

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.210
those, and not worry about
anything else.

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.750
And so coupons moves all the
way to the bottom of that.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:35.720
And then we used a different
visual indicator, this kind of

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.950
almost faux torn edge.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.350
And this is borderline
skeuomorphic, but it doesn't

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:42.570
really matter.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:48.520
It's this secondary part of the
screen that shows you that

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.360
this is clearly a different
part of the app and a

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.520
different set of items.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.440
So it's a clear visual
delineation.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.970
And then we've also used this
blue accent color throughout

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:02.940
to indicate that this
is a coupon.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:07.780
Kind of like on google.com, you
see the text ads in search

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.350
results on a yellow
background.

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:10.420
This would be kind of similar.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:14.830
So you present a visual theme
throughout that says, hey,

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:17.760
blue is advertising,
or blue is coupons.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.440
And green is your stuff.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.220
So it's kind of one of the
ways to think about that.

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.570
And the last thing I want to
point out on this screen

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:25.680
before-- if you guys
want to chime in--

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.240
is this bar at the top.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.920
And this is something that
Adam and I talked about

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.720
beforehand, and Nick
as well, I believe.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:35.200
Is really how do you present
adding items or

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.870
searching for stuff?

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:38.780
And in this case, searching and
adding is really part of

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.280
the same flow.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.730
And we decided to make it kind
of a first-class citizen

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:44.300
rather than an action button.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:49.200
We've put it in line at the
very top of the list.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.000
So that's all I want
to mention.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.860
Adam, I remember you had
thoughts on search and add.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:55.050
You want to talk about
some alternatives?

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:55.850
ADAM KOCH: Yeah.

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:59.860
I guess one thing I wanted to
talk about was you can always

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:01.010
have an action item.

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:03.360
But if the action is really
important, you can put it in

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.980
line like Roman has
shown here.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.820
But I guess if you did want to,
you could move that Add or

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.770
Search box back into the action
bar as an action item,

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:15.430
and maybe trigger the sort of
contextual search that shows

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.880
directly in the action
bar itself.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.020
So that's just an alternative,
totally up to the designer of

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.310
the app as to how they
actually want

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:23.020
to implement this.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:25.260
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, almost an
expanding search view.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.986
But maybe it's an expanding
add view.

00:09:27.986 --> 00:09:30.350
ADAM KOCH: An interesting
approach.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:32.920
ROMAN NURIK: In one of the later
apps, Nick will talk

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:37.100
about some similar ways in which
he approached this in

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.040
Out of Milk.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.710
But anyway, let's move on to
the next screen, in the

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:41.560
interest of time.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.130
So the next screen-- again,
since this is about the

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:46.580
contextual action bar, this is
just briefly showing that--

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.750
let's say I wanted to
immediately take action on

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:51.100
three or four of those items.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.865
I can just long press
to start selection.

00:09:53.865 --> 00:09:55.380
And that pops up the contextual

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:56.960
action bar at the top.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.750
And then keep single touching
different items in my list to

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.040
add or remove from
the selection.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.180
And then take action on
that entire selection.

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.200
So in this case, I've selected
Hoegaarden and Macallan.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.330
Hopefully I've spelled
Macallan right--

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:11.320
Hoegaarden and Macallan.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.970
And then let's say I've gone
ahead and bought those items

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:14.770
at the store.

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:18.600
I could just select both and
press Mark Purchased.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.800
to take action immediately
on those two items.

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:27.380
In the next screen, this is an
example of that dropdown.

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:28.440
And this is kind
of interesting.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:33.660
This is something that we took
a few liberties with.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.320
Dropdown/Spinner navigation--

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:39.160
usually, you just see the items
which you're switching

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.370
between, right?

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:43.740
So in a normal case, you'd see
Grocery Store, Bakery, or Any

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.400
Store, meaning all
of the above.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:52.330
But in this case, since this
is the single place where

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.980
users see their list
of stores--

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:58.220
this is the most visible place
in the app where they see

00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:59.520
their list of stores.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:04.060
Let's make it easy to also then
take action on that list,

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:07.010
to then maybe add a store to
that list right from here.

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:09.735
This is something that Ian
mentioned last week on "The

00:11:09.735 --> 00:11:13.450
App Clinic." It's a missed
opportunity if you see a list

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:16.280
of things, and you know want to
add one, but you then can't

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:16.970
figure out how to do it.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:19.090
So this way, it makes
it very obvious.

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:23.150
It's a slight deviation from
the standard pattern, but I

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:27.130
personally feel that it's a
fairly reasonable deviation.

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:29.590
And then the other thing is that
there's also Favorites

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:30.420
and History.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.470
And to navigate to those items--
and again, they're

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:35.810
still lists of tasks, really,
at the end of the day--

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:38.190
you can jump into Favorites and
History right from here

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:41.150
with this separate section.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:44.335
So any criticisms or thoughts
or alternatives?

00:11:44.335 --> 00:11:48.351
ADAM KOCH: Well, why don't we
throw it over to Nick quickly?

00:11:48.351 --> 00:11:49.540
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:52.000
For me, looking at the original
design, it just

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.835
screamed Gingerbread to me.

00:11:54.835 --> 00:11:58.400
I think the refresh that you've
given it makes it look

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:02.350
much more modern, much more at
home on my device running

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:05.460
Jelly Bean or whatever the
latest OS everyone is running.

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.340
And also, it feels
easier to use.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.420
Because the standard iconography
and the standard

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:12.520
controls from the modern
palette just are

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.140
very familiar to me.

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.110
So I think this is a really
lovely redesign.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:17.480
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, thank you.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.655
And one other thing that we
should probably talk about at

00:12:19.655 --> 00:12:21.290
the end is the difference
between

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:22.970
selection and check boxes.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:24.790
And there's lots of different
ways you can go about this.

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:29.630
And I think, Nick, you tried an
alternative in Out of Milk.

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:31.680
But we should definitely talk
about at the very end if we

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:32.440
have some time.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:35.710
Since that's something that
specifically with task list

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:40.060
apps, or list apps, that can
be confusing in some cases.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.840
So the last screen that
we have here is

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.850
with editing a store.

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:45.630
And then we'll jump over
to Out of Milk.

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:47.880
So when editing a store, you
have the option to edit the

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:48.800
store name.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:52.260
And then if you'll notice here,
you can add or reorder

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.990
aisles, as well as
hide aisles.

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:57.260
But it seems like in this
case, this is really a

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.120
sub-dashboard pattern.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.090
Rather than giving you the
content immediately--

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:02.220
the list of aisles--

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.280
it just gives you the options
in which you can

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.250
take on that list.

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:09.910
So rather than doing that, we
felt that it would be just a

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:14.760
better user experience to
show everything at once.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:19.060
So you can immediately edit the
name, as well as reorder

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:21.430
and hide aisles.

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:23.690
And we're also using
the Done, Discard

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:24.990
pattern at the very top.

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:28.190
So rather than seeing a Save
button or anything like that,

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:32.750
we see very clear options to
either cancel what we just did

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:35.590
or save by pressing
the Done button.

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:37.650
And then here, you'll notice
that we used these subtle drag

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.480
handles to allow you
to reorder items.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:45.440
And then the entire rest of that
touch area is a single

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.030
touch target to show or hide.

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:50.600
So touching it basically
toggles its visibility.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:54.080
And you'll notice that there
isn't a separator between this

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.720
visibility marker and the
rest of the list item.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.990
And that's to indicate that it's
a single touch target,

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:02.160
not two separate targets.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.360
And then obviously, you can add
an aisle by pressing the

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.360
Plus button there.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:09.490
And of course, if you long
touch, maybe there should be a

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:10.820
contextual action bar
there as well.

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.770
Haven't really mocked
it up, but yeah.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.550
So anyway-- parting thoughts
for Grocery IQ, guys?

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:18.790
NICK BUTCHER: I think the direct
manipulation is much

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:20.460
better than having to go
through each level.

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.920
I think the same way you set
these coupons up to a high

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:26.030
level, it makes it easier to use
if you don't have to pogo

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:29.580
stick, as they say, in and
out of different screens.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.920
ADAM KOCH: I also like that
coupons tear-off that you have

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:32.640
at the bottom there.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.450
Just because as you say, it's
probably important to their

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:38.300
business, as the company itself
is called Coupons.

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:41.950
But also, it sort of dynamically
grows and shrinks

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:44.835
based on what the real content
is on that particular screen.

00:14:44.835 --> 00:14:46.510
So I think it's a nice
way of showing

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:47.840
everything on one screen.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:51.410
ROMAN NURIK: The other thing is
that if you have an empty

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:54.710
list, if you have no items in
that list, then naturally, you

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:57.300
think, oh, let's just show no
items in this list text.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.340
And that's it, right?

00:14:58.340 --> 00:14:59.690
So the user opens up the app.

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.230
And they immediately
see an empty list.

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:05.680
And so showing coupons is
another way of presenting more

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.210
useful information without
having to fill the space with

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:10.820
useless stuff.

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:13.190
ADAM KOCH: Likewise, if the list
is really, really long,

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:15.550
those coupons aren't going to
get directly in your way.

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:17.030
They're going to get pushed
down off the screen.

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:20.700
And the content is still going
to be seen there at the front.

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:24.080
ROMAN NURIK: And worst case, if
you find that users don't

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.260
interact with coupons as much
because of that, then you can

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.440
always have an overflow item
or something else in the

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:33.140
action bar or something that
leads you to that screen.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:36.340
So let's jump into
Out of Milk.

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:37.580
How much time do we have?

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.070
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, we're good.

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:40.790
ROMAN NURIK: OK, so let's
jump into Out of Milk.

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:42.186
Nick, do you want to talk
about Out of Milk?

00:15:42.186 --> 00:15:42.980
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:47.040
So Out of Milk is a to-do list
type application, but very

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.390
focused on shopping lists.

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:51.810
So when you come in, it gives
you free ready-made list

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:54.060
selections like a shopping
list, a to-do list, and

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:55.990
something else I forget.

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:57.650
So it's quite focused on that.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.250
There's a slight twist on
the regular to-do list.

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:04.960
It's got some extra
functionality in there.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:08.160
So you can see here in the
action bar, you have the

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.800
ability to use a barcode
scanner,

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:10.610
which is kind of cool.

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:11.940
So you can add items to it.

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:16.290
And you also have the option
to add some metadata around

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:17.770
each of the items
in your list.

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:18.810
So for example, you
can see milk here.

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:19.860
You can give it a price.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.480
And then you can get a summary
of the total price remaining

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.060
in your basket of goods to
pick up at the bottom.

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.275
You come in a dashboard path.

00:16:30.275 --> 00:16:33.125
And I've dived into one of the
main screens, managing, like

00:16:33.125 --> 00:16:33.940
viewing a list.

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:36.070
And you have this kind of
spinner navigation for

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:38.250
flitting between the two.

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:40.540
I think when I look at this
screen, the first thing that

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:44.820
stands out to me is that despite
the fact they're using

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:48.460
an action bar and have an
overflow button there.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:52.080
They also have the button of
shame, as we're calling it,

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:55.420
the emulated menu button
down at the bottom.

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.000
And so this is kind of
perplexing to me that they

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.080
have both, especially because
the emulated button doesn't

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.260
really do anything down
at the bottom.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.385
They're just setting a target
SDK of 10, I believe, even

00:17:05.385 --> 00:17:07.910
though they're providing
styles and using

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:11.215
ActionBarSherlock, I believe,
to have an action bar on the

00:17:11.215 --> 00:17:13.060
platforms that support it.

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:14.440
There's a few issues as well.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.630
If you take a look at
their action bar--

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:18.890
I think, to speak to some of the
points that Roman's made

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:20.790
in the past, about if you're
going to use an action bar,

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:22.970
kind of really try and follow
the standard patterns to it

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:26.890
and don't deviate
away from it.

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:29.610
So first up with the action
bar-- say the overflow button

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:32.410
is too heavy styled,
if you look at the

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:33.840
normal action bars.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:36.240
The overflow is slightly
less prominent.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:39.980
It's got a 50% opacity in order
to de-emphasize the

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:42.890
secondary tasks compared
to the primary actions.

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:44.360
And also some of the
icons don't already

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.900
have the hollow styling.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.210
And if you look at the spinner,
the spinner isn't

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:49.180
really attached to the
shopping list.

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:52.600
It's off and over, across
to the side.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:53.750
which is especially
bad in tablets.

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:56.815
When if you're in landscape in
a tablet, it's kind of 3/4 of

00:17:56.815 --> 00:18:00.320
the screen away from the thing
it's supposed to be marking up

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.490
as being clickable.

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:05.420
There's some delimiters
between the icons.

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:08.320
And on top of that, there's
also a fair amount of

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:14.110
skeuomorphic style and really
non-Holo, non-native platform

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:16.960
styling in the application.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.270
Any other thoughts on the apps
from you guys before we dive

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:20.562
into what we've done with it?

00:18:20.562 --> 00:18:22.080
ADAM KOCH: It's like they've
gone halfway with the

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.000
skeuomorphic thing, but not all
the way, which is almost

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.836
worse than just going all
the m if you ask me.

00:18:27.836 --> 00:18:30.090
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, it's
kind of tough.

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:33.390
I think you guys are right
that it's a bit too

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:34.880
skeuomorphic.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.020
But at the same time, I feel
like following the

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:37.940
interactions--

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:40.420
to me personally--

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:41.840
is first and foremost.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:48.470
And to me, the greater
issue here is with

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:50.790
the legacy Menu button.

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:54.060
Things like that just
fundamentally break some of

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:56.640
the expectations that
users have.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.550
But yeah, I do agree that
the skeuomorphism--

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:00.500
there's a spectrum, right?

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:07.380
There's pure minimalism, and
then pure skeuomorphism or

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.120
realism, whatever.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:13.500
And I feel like they chose a
place on that spectrum that's

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.596
a little further to the right.

00:19:15.596 --> 00:19:17.980
NICK BUTCHER: Now, before we go
into the redesign, just a

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:19.540
few words on the interaction
design here.

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:23.820
So the way the app currently
works, if you single tap on an

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:27.230
item in the list, it then pops
up an old-style quick action

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:30.330
bar, which lets you do things
like edit it or mark it as

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:31.650
done, for example.

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:35.260
And if you long press on an
item, it then puts a score

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:36.690
through it and moves
it to the bottom,

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:37.800
denoting that it's done.

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.830
So you kind of have
these two levels.

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:42.410
So if it's an item on the list,
then you can have it

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:43.270
scored through.

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:44.720
Or then you can actually
delete it to

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.940
totally remove it.

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.580
There's many permutations of
state which an item can be in.

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.290
And because of this-- if you
just close the Overflow menu.

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:53.940
I don't think we've got a
screenshot of it here.

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:56.680
But if you do, there is a
plethora of options there.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.620
You actually have to scroll
it on a Galaxy Nexus.

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:02.947
There's that many overflow
options, which I found to be a

00:20:02.947 --> 00:20:04.438
bit-- kind of overloaded me.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.450
ROMAN NURIK: This is kind of
against the concept of direct

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:14.400
manipulation, which is one of
the design principles in a

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.730
design guide.

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:17.180
Items should be manipulable.

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:19.940
You should be able to touch
them, to interact with them.

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:23.850
Rather than choosing actions
somewhere else to do things

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:27.490
like trigger selection, or
Select All, Deselect All.

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:31.550
Anything like that should really
be more contextual.

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:34.550
And in general, if you look at
just for long press, I think

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:37.980
that's particularly egregious
in this case, where we've

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:40.840
tried to standardize on
what long press means.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.880
And really, it means
selection.

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:46.370
It triggers selection and then
potentially showing actions on

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:47.500
your selection.

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:52.450
So using it for anything else
like marking an item as

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:56.330
complete, it's kind of beyond
what the standards are.

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:58.970
And it's just another thing
that users have to learn.

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:01.450
One other thing that we use
for long press is when you

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:04.820
long press on an action button,
on an icon-only

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:06.710
button, it shows you
a little tool tip.

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:09.090
But that's a secondary
use for it.

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:11.530
It's not as important
a use as selection.

00:21:15.192 --> 00:21:18.510
Nick, I just wanted to mention
that I've been showing your

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:20.870
redesign already by accident.

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:22.960
So unfortunately, we don't
have a big reveal.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:27.520
But go ahead and jump in.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.750
NICK BUTCHER: OK, so if we do
take a look at the redesign

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:33.300
that you've been looking at for
all this time, then we can

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:36.900
see we've applied some
Holo styling to it.

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.920
So we've used some familiar
language--

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.800
visual language-- in the
application to make it a bit

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:41.470
easier to see.

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:43.235
It's actually quite interesting
that Roman and I

00:21:43.235 --> 00:21:45.940
did our redesigns in isolation
and have used some quite

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:48.620
similar metaphors, like the
drag handles, and so on,

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:49.790
throughout.

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:52.680
But I guess that's why they're
standard, right?

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.910
But the other thing I didn't
really mention there's some

00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:57.520
really cool information and cool
actions you can do buried

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.535
in the overflow menu
on the original.

00:21:59.535 --> 00:22:01.260
Such as to share this
list with someone

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.060
else, or send it to--

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:06.430
using the Android Sharing with
intents, which is kind of lost

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:08.950
in all the noise in the Overflow
menu, I thought.

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:10.410
So one of the main things--

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:13.600
apart from applying Holo styling
to the look and feel--

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:17.500
is I've promoted Add to being
this permanent in-line action,

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:18.350
similar to--

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:20.060
and Roman did with the
Search and Add.

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:23.880
So you have this bar there,
which breaks out of the

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.430
standard [? ribbon ?] of the
rest of the page in order to

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:28.260
make it more prominent.

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.270
And I've also broken down--

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:32.220
using the microphone or
the barcode as kind of

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:33.740
sub-actions of adding.

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:36.480
They're different kind
of ways of adding an

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.370
item to your list.

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:39.510
So they belong together
rather than having

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:43.030
separate action items.

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:46.930
So by bringing Add into the
page itself, it's given me

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:51.320
some room in the action bar to
promote some of the unique and

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:54.810
very, very cool functionality
that this application offers.

00:22:54.810 --> 00:23:00.560
And then tuck the less used
and much smaller set of

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:03.230
alternative actions under
the Overflow.

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:05.520
So we've also changed up the
interaction a little

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:06.260
bit here, as well.

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:10.640
You can see I've placed some
check boxes next to the items,

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:14.980
which allow you to go into
a selection mode.

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:17.230
So I've actually kind of flipped
the concept or changed

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:20.700
the concept a little bit and
got rid of the idea of a

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:23.750
semi-struck-through done state,
and just gone straight

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:24.850
to a dismissed state.

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:28.420
So I decided to use the Swipe
to Dismiss pattern that's

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:32.510
we're seeing gaining traction
these days as the way

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:33.170
to mark items off.

00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:35.590
So this is speaking to Roman's
point about direct

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:37.930
manipulation of your data being
much more satisfying.

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:39.260
So what you can actually do--

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:40.460
yeah, here we go-- is
you can swipe--

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:42.040
ROMAN NURIK: This is like Swipe
to Complete, rather than

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:42.660
Swipe to Delete.

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:45.240
I wrote Swipe to Delete here,
but it's like Swipe to mark as

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:46.230
completed, basically, right?

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:47.790
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:50.080
So this is a bit of a change
to the pattern.

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:53.335
Because I guess in the old way,
you would long press it.

00:23:53.335 --> 00:23:55.240
It'd be struck through, so it'd
still be able to get it

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:55.710
back quickly.

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:58.660
So it's a way to give you that
safety net, that way to easily

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:01.450
recover any data that you've
marked as complete.

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:02.890
We've also used a
new pattern--

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:05.130
an emerging pattern--
of the Undo.

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:09.360
So when you swipe away an item
to say it's done, we actually

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.690
temporarily showed this Undo
option in line where it was.

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:15.320
The idea here being that until
you interact with the screen

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.110
again, this will stay there.

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:20.880
So it gives you this chance to
say, oh, actually I checked

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.930
the wrong item, whatever.

00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:24.730
But the minute you start
scrolling or touching another

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:27.730
item, the idea is that
this would close up.

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:34.230
ROMAN NURIK: The next one-- the
quick return-- you want to

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:35.015
talk about that?

00:24:35.015 --> 00:24:37.310
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:40.070
So this is to go with the idea
that we've made Add this

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:41.200
really prominent item.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:45.440
But we wanted to cope with the
case that you might be having

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.390
too many layers of
items at the top.

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:48.280
You have an action bar.

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.045
Sometimes you might have
tabs, if you had an

00:24:50.045 --> 00:24:51.570
in-line program action.

00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:53.335
You end up running out of room,
especially if you're in,

00:24:53.335 --> 00:24:56.170
say, landscape view, where you
have less vertical space.

00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:59.330
So I'm using here a pattern
which we've been dubbing Quick

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:02.780
Return, which I think is a
really, really cool way too

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:03.970
handle that problem.

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:05.900
So the idea here is if you
had a lot of items--

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.640
so here I'm making lasagna.

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:11.300
And I've got a lot of
items in my list.

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:15.590
As they scroll away, the Add
button, the horizontal bar,

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:17.160
will scroll out of view.

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:20.440
But the minute they start
dragging back down, it'll jump

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.330
right back in and be
this floating item.

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:25.600
So what this really does, it
lets you maximize the amount

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.840
of space you have to play with
in the screen and show the

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:29.430
items on the list.

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:30.820
So if you're searching through
the list, looking for a

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:33.970
particular item to check off,
then it gives you the maximum

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:34.850
space to present that.

00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:38.015
But it makes adding a new item
super simple and always very

00:25:38.015 --> 00:25:39.060
convenient to do.

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:41.300
ROMAN NURIK: This is similar to
like you mentioned, Google

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:44.500
Now and also Google+
has this, right?

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:49.160
So Google+, if you're in the
stream and if you scroll down,

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.760
the buttons that let you post
to the stream scroll off.

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:56.140
But then as soon as you start
slowly inching up again, it

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.390
pops those back in.

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:05.505
So should we move on to
contextual actions?

00:26:05.505 --> 00:26:09.740
NICK BUTCHER: So the next thing
I wanted to cover here--

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:11.602
so in the old application, if
you touch an item, you get

00:26:11.602 --> 00:26:14.090
this quick bar which lets you
perform a number of actions

00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:16.230
upon a single item.

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:19.400
So the new way of doing this
really is using the contextual

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:20.005
action bar.

00:26:20.005 --> 00:26:24.610
So here, if you long press or
tap on the check mark, you go

00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:25.980
into this contextual
selection mode.

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.620
So here, we selected one item.

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:32.020
And using the contextual action
bar, you can edit.

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:34.500
Or the second icon on the action
bar there is you can

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:36.740
move it to another list
or delete the item

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:38.830
straight from there.

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:40.640
The power of using the
contextual action bar, I

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:44.430
believe, is not only this very
consistent with the platform

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:46.250
way of handling selection.

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:48.330
But it's also great for dealing
with multi-select.

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:51.010
So here you can see the
[INAUDIBLE] which says one

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:53.290
item selected is actually
a dropdown.

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:54.920
So right here, I could
just close that.

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.640
And you might get options
to Select All.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.980
Or in this example
here, I've tapped

00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:59.960
another item on the list.

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.720
And it's letting me do
contextual actions.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:04.000
So here you can see because
I'm dealing with two

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.750
selections rather than one,
we've actually refined the

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:07.280
selections.

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:09.380
So we said that Edit
might not be

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:11.700
applicable to multiple items.

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:13.930
And it's refined it down to
using two actions here.

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:17.130
So it's a very neat way of
performing quite powerful

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:18.230
selection actions.

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:20.730
ROMAN NURIK: So unless you
have a batch edit mode or

00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:25.000
something where you batch apply
a tag or something, then

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.538
removing that Edit
icon makes sense.

00:27:28.538 --> 00:27:29.370
NICK BUTCHER: Cool.

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:32.720
And just for fun to stick with
the metaphor we've been using,

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:35.110
of using the swipe to mark
something that's completed.

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:36.590
We thought we'd keep if
[? where if you ?] are

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:39.600
selecting multiple items at
once, you could then still

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.820
swipe across on one
of these items.

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:43.585
And it would mark each
of them as completed.

00:27:43.585 --> 00:27:44.770
ROMAN NURIK: That's cool.

00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:47.640
I've never seen that done
before, but that looks like it

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.180
might work really,
really well.

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:50.376
It's very cool.

00:27:50.376 --> 00:27:51.700
NICK BUTCHER: Just a fun idea.

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:54.250
ADAM KOCH: It'd be kind of cool
to hint that you can do

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:57.300
that by when the user selects
the actual contextual action

00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.520
item, you could have the
animation play, and have the

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.430
Undo in place still.

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:03.190
And that way they know next
time, they could probably just

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:04.120
go and swipe themselves.

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:04.510
I like that.

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:04.770
That's cool.

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:06.210
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, this might
be one of those cases we

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:10.630
talked about in the showcase
view last week where if there

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:13.030
isn't something completely
apparent by what's on screen

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:15.320
like a gesture you
have to perform.

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.850
I think it's OK to hint that the
first time the user sees

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:21.000
it that you could show some
kind of animation saying--

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:21.670
because it's [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:24.000
to do this, to mark
something as done.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.240
I think it wouldn't be too
egregious to show it on the

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:30.680
first run and teach the
user something.

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.050
ROMAN NURIK: I also just
wanted to point out--

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:34.930
that's a great thing that you've
pointed out-- is that

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:38.140
showing an animation
hints at a gesture.

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:41.430
So for example, when you have
a tab, or tabs with a

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:45.280
ViewPager, when you switch tabs,
you call page or that

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:46.520
set current item.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:50.190
But calling that actually
slides the contents.

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:53.700
So it's a subtle hint that you
can actually then throw your

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:56.560
finger on the glass and
start swiping across

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:57.710
the different tabs.

00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:01.050
So that's definitely a good way
to hint at a gesture, is

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:03.980
to show an animation that
replays the gesture basically

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:06.460
without the user interacting.

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:07.130
All right.

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:10.250
So let's jump into a few other
examples of the contextual

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:11.600
action bar, since we wanted
to talk about it.

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:18.150
Before we jump into
all the details--

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:19.660
oh wow, we're super
low on time.

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:21.570
So we're going to have
to fly through this.

00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:24.450
Contextual action bar basically
lets you show

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:25.880
multiple actions
on a selection.

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:31.520
Or it enters a mode, basically,
where you can take

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:34.220
action on selections.

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:35.861
Anybody else have anything to
add on contextual action bars?

00:29:35.861 --> 00:29:36.322
ADAM KOCH: And we're done.

00:29:36.322 --> 00:29:38.630
ROMAN NURIK: Because we're
running super low on time.

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.900
OK, you know what?

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:40.130
Rather than do that,
let's just fly

00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:40.790
through some of these.

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:43.010
These are just some examples
of apps that use it.

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:46.500
So the gallery lets you take
actions on multiple photos.

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:50.390
Gmail lets you take action
on multiple items.

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:52.640
And then this is an open source
example, a Google I/O

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.260
app, which basically
lets you--

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:59.070
it shows a contextual action
bar for this master detail

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:00.190
flow on a tablet.

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:02.410
So if you select multiple
items-- even if you're looking

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:05.300
at one, or a different one,
you can take action items

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:08.630
without even looking at them.

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:11.970
And this is another example of
an app called Tasks, by Team

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:16.870
Tasks, that lets you take
actions like Indent or

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:19.870
Unindent, I guess, different
items within a

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:21.150
task list all at once.

00:30:24.245 --> 00:30:26.390
NICK BUTCHER: On the contextual
action bar, I'd say

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:27.760
you might've guessed that
we're huge fans

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:28.140
of the action bar.

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:32.550
Because it's familiar and very
powerful and very flexible.

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:36.380
So using contextual action bar
lets you have the same power

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:38.310
of the action bar but to do
these contextual actions.

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:39.600
So you can still do things
like have the

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:40.260
split action bar.

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:42.630
So Gmail on phones, for example,
has a plethora of

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:44.560
options which [INAUDIBLE]
you can do on an email.

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.700
So you could still use that
split action bar to offer up

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:50.366
all those different things,
so I'm a big fan of it.

00:30:50.366 --> 00:30:52.020
ROMAN NURIK: Definitely
use it if you can.

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:53.810
And I believe ActionBarSherlock
also

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:55.160
supports the contextual
action bar.

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.010
So you don't have to worry about
backwards compatibility

00:30:57.010 --> 00:30:58.310
and things with that.

00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:59.980
Anyway, let's fly through.

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:01.170
Next week--

00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:03.480
that's it for the content for
the show today-- actually, I

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.450
guess we have design
news in a bit.

00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:07.960
Next week, we're going to be
doing a Google+ Hangout.

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.220
And we'd like to invite
you all to join.

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:13.870
So if you're interested in
talking to us live on this

00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:18.570
show at this same time, and if
you want to ask us questions.

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:21.840
Or if you want to show some of
your work by screen sharing,

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:24.260
or if you just want to rant
about Android design, please

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:26.200
let us know if you can join.

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.990
If you can make it, let us
know in the comments--

00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:30.130
pretty much anywhere--

00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:33.360
and we'll invite you next week,
maybe about 10 or 15

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.540
minutes before the show airs.

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:36.820
And then we'll have a 30-minute
Hangout to discuss.

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:38.910
And we may be announcing
giveaways or

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:39.550
anything like that.

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:42.070
So you may want to tune in.

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:44.430
And definitely, like I said, let
us know if you can join.

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:46.490
But let's fly through
Android design news.

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:48.000
We don't have that much.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.472
Nick, do you want to talk about
your live redesign?

00:31:50.472 --> 00:31:53.320
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, I think I
mentioned last week that I was

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:56.030
visiting Berlin for
a DevFest event.

00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:59.280
And I'd gone onstage to do
a live app redesign.

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:03.180
So I was looking at a pretty
cool app, actually, to control

00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:06.150
the lights in the building we
were in, which had an API.

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:08.250
But it was a kind of
thrown-together demo where it

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:11.370
didn't really have the best,
most modern Android UI.

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:14.290
So I was live talking through
some things we could change.

00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:16.300
Well, a very talented
designer, Marie--

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.220
pretty regularly I've mentioned
on this show--

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:22.180
was using her awesome
Illustrator skills to throw

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:23.360
together these designs.

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:27.230
So this-- as you can see, where
I've just zoomed in on--

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:30.420
25 minutes' work, we managed
to throw together a pretty

00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:31.590
cool-looking redesign.

00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:35.820
So yeah, you can follow the QR
code to see a recording of

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:36.600
that talk if you're
interested.

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:37.200
ROMAN NURIK: Very well done.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.560
It was super fast.

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:41.140
She works super fast
in Illustrator.

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:42.110
It's crazy.

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:43.240
NICK BUTCHER: Actually, while
we're talking about Marie--

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:44.720
one more plug for her.

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:47.530
She's just opened up an Etsy
shop, so she has these amazing

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:48.490
paintings of Androids.

00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:52.571
So if you're a fan of fan art
for Android, then look her up

00:32:52.571 --> 00:32:53.453
on Google+.

00:32:53.453 --> 00:32:57.225
And find her Etsy shop and
buy a Droid [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:57.225 --> 00:33:00.750
ROMAN NURIK: And I think the
last news item is there's a

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:04.620
blog post recently that talks
about the different units used

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:05.170
in Android.

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:07.690
So DIPs, Density Independent
Pixels.

00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:10.210
Also SP units, Scale
Independent Pixels.

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:12.450
If you're still confused about
the difference between pixels

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:16.040
and DIPs and SPs and all those
different things, and density,

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:16.930
read this blog post.

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:18.520
It's a fairly good primer.

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:20.410
We also have good documentation
on it, but this

00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:23.610
may be a simpler way of
looking at things.

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:26.070
And that was by Edwin
Evans, who I've

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:26.770
never heard of before.

00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:29.660
But thanks, Edwin, for the
awesome blog post.

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:33.850
All right, so that's it for this
week on "Android Design

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:36.300
and Action." Thanks for tuning
in, and sorry we ran

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:37.970
a little bit late.

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:40.190
Unfortunately, we had
too much content.

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:42.190
That's always a good problem
to have, too much content.

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:44.400
NICK BUTCHER: We just
talk too much.

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:45.320
ROMAN NURIK: OK, well.

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.170
Anyway, thanks again
for joining.

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:48.550
As always, I'm Roman Nurik.

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:50.200
ADAM KOCH: Adam Koch.

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:50.920
NICK BUTCHER: Nick Butcher.

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:51.600
ADAM KOCH: See you
guys next week.

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:52.500
ROMAN NURIK: See you guys.

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:54.300
NICK BUTCHER: Bye.

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:58.867
