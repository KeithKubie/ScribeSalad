00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.250
Snakes, why did it have to be snakes?

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.389
Because they’re AWESOME

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:10.420
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.519
While some people are absolutely terrified
of snakes, I actually really love them.

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.860
They are some of the most fascinating animals
on this planet, I mean just how do they get

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.390
about without any legs?

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.220
Well to answer that we first have to understand
a little bit more about their evolutionary

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.490
history.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.160
Snakes appear on every continent and almost
every country except famously Ireland.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.410
A study published in the Journal of Vertebrate
Paleontology found that snakes probably evolved

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.090
from a four-legged lizard, which another study
suggests happened sometime during the Jurassic

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.190
Period around 150 million years ago.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.710
Researchers believe that they probably lost
their legs to adapt to moving in narrow underground

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.950
burrows, it’s thought that legs simply got
in the way.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.719
Recently the journal Science found a so-called
“missing link” between lizards and snakes.

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.260
Tetrapodophis amplectus hails from what’s
now South America and lived during the cretaceous

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.260
period.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.639
These creatures are supposed to be distant
cousins of what we know to be snakes.

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:08.410
They had a long body, a small tail, and four
little limbs that were used for grasping prey.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.850
To this day you can actually still see vestigial
leg bones in some snakes like pythons and

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.400
boa constrictors.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.390
Without legs snakes evolved a few clever ways
to move.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.050
A study published in the journal Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences found

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.250
that snake scales are for more than just good
looks.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.100
Scales act like a kind of hook to help snakes
slither across surfaces.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.570
Researchers previously assumed that scales
help snakes move across rough surfaces like

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.680
rocks and tree bark.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.850
But their scales can even grasp onto smooth
surfaces and fine grains of sand.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.920
Some snakes can move using just their belly
scales alone.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.020
Big snakes like pythons and boa constrictors,
can move in a straight line just by lifting

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.320
up their undersides enough to grip and push
off the ground using their scales.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.780
This is called rectilinear locomotion.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.240
But for other types of snakes, it takes more
that just a few scales to get from point A

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.700
to point B. Snakes have segmented muscles
that are made for slithering, allowing them

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.770
to glide over a surface in a twisting or oscillating
motion.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.429
The typical snake slither you’re familiar
with is called Lateral Undulation, where they

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.909
move their segmented muscles in a specific,
sequential pattern.

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:16.640
This wave-like motion propels the snake forward
in an s shape, when the snake’s body contacts

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.450
some sort of fixed point, like a rock or depression
in the ground.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.980
The snake actually uses THIS fixed point,
to kind of push off and move forward.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.950
If the environment is lacking these kinds
of resistance points, a snake might use a

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.510
sidewinding motion, like the creatively named
sidewinder.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.370
This movement is similar to lateral undulation,
except well, it’s sideways.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.689
And only two points of the snake’s body
are touching the ground at anytime, so it’s

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:41.090
an incredibly fast way to get around.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.659
In fact it’s reported that a sidewinder
can reach up to 18mph.

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:49.719
Snakes can also climb trees, using what’s
called Concertina locomotion.

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:54.700
They stretch out their heads and scrunch up
their bodies behind them kind of like an accordion.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.830
Unlike lateral undulation, their muscles are
moved all at once, rather than in a sequence.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.069
While most snakes use more than one of these
forms of movement, the coolest example of

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.709
a snake is Chrysopelea, also known as, the
flying snake.

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.919
These snakes are not only able to climb trees
but can jump from branch to branch.

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:14.499
According to a study published in the journal
Integrative and Comparative Biology,

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:19.409
when Chrysopelea readies itself for take-off,
it contorts its body into a J-shape, before

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:21.700
it thrusts up from the branch to become airborne.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.060
In the air it uses lateral undulating motion
to stabilize itself and glide gracefully before

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.060
landing.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.050
So rather than being afraid of snakes, just
marvel at HOW FREAKING COOL FLYING SNAKES

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.050
ARE.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.980
Even though many snakes are harmless to humans,
our fear of them remains strong.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.010
Why are we all so afraid of snakes?

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.199
