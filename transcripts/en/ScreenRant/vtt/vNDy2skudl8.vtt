00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.010
When you watch an animated movie you usually
expect to see some fun characters starring

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.850
in a colorful and usually kid-friendly world.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.650
While it is true that all of the movies on
our list were designed for kids, the filmmakers

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.000
definitely had some fun including some sneaky
adult jokes for the more mature audience members

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.100
in the room to enjoy.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.310
For this video we are taking a look at some
of the more mature jokes hidden in your favorite

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.310
animated movies.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.380
When you are done watching this video be sure
to go check out the list our friends over

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.059
at CBR just put out highlighting some of the
dirtiest jokes from animated kids flics.

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:42.440
For now, sit back, relax and enjoy our list
of 10 Adult Jokes Hidden In Popular Animated

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.440
Movies

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.440
The Road To El Dorado
The Road To El Dorado follows the epically

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.440
fun adventure of conquistadors Tulio and Miguel
on their journey to El Dorado and all of the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.440
trouble they get up to.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.440
The movie is pretty innocent, except for one
moment that presents potentially the most

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.440
dirty animated movie moment of all time.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.440
In this dirty moment, we see that Tulio and
Chel have been hooking up and because it is

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.440
a kids movie we assume that they were just
kissing.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.440
But, when you take a closer, more adult look,
you can totally see that the two animated

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.440
stars were not just smooching as the placement
of Chel�s head is a few feet lower down

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.440
from Tulio�s face.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.440
The Incredibles
This one actually comes from a deleted scene

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.460
where we see Syndrome in a discussion about
the �S� on with Jack-Jack�s babysitter,

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.370
who he is of course trying to trick.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.250
He claims that the S on his chest stands for
�Sitter� and then he says that is is actually

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.280
short for �Babysitter� but that he couldn�t
be walking around with a giant BS on his chest.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.380
This is a joke that likely slipped by a lot
of kids in the audiences but would have been

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.610
very clear to any adults present.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.040
This is exactly the type of clever dirty joke
that Disney loves to slip into their films

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.920
to keep adults in the room.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.200
Osmosis Jones
Osmosis Jones is a very cool animated movie

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.840
and if you haven�t seen it, we high recommended.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.470
The film journeys inside the human body for
an adventure like no other and the comedy

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.689
that comes from this premises definitely packs
a punch.

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.480
While most of the jokes are designed for the
whole family, there are definitely some moments

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.420
specifically geared towards more mature audience.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.310
In one scene there is a statue marked �The
Founder� and it is pretty clearly supposed

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.840
to be a sperm cell.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.950
This joke, while somewhat dirty, is actually
just mostly very clever and was likely appreciated

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.950
by any and all adults in the room.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.869
Robots
Back in 2005, 20th Century Fox put out a pretty

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.200
great animated movie called Robots that took
audiences to a world of robots to tell their

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.200
story.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.760
The film is a lot of fun and all of the clever
�Robert versions� of things from the human

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.650
world were definitely appreciated by fans.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.200
One of these robot versions was more adult
that all the others and that was �The Baby-Making

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.200
Kit� reference.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.930
The movie suggests that baby robots are made
from kits, but the adult moment comes when

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.760
the female robot says to her husband that
the fun part is making the baby.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.319
This is a very funny double entendre because
while people think of sex, the screen shows

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.879
the innocent �make your own baby� kit.

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.030
Ice Age
Although it is actually made by Fox, the Ice

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.099
Age movie franchise has given us some pretty
amazing stories and unforgettable characters.

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.610
The prehistoric films have also delivered
their fair share of sneaky adult jokes and

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.800
just like a lot of famous Disney movies, they
made sure to include a joke about penis size.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.920
In the original 2002 Ice Age movie Manny is
talking to a crowd and exclaims: "If my trunk

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.349
was that small, I wouldn't call attention
to myself, pal."

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.769
In this particularly mature moment, Manny
is pretty clearly substituting �trunk�

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.630
for another similarly shaped male body part.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.450
Ice Age may be for kids, but this moment definitely
is not!

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.610
Madagascar
In Madagascar, we get to meet some of the

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.590
most hilarious animated animals of all time
and although they seem to be very smart and

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.590
mature, they keep most of their jokes very
PG.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.879
However, there is a very sneaky adult moment
from the original film that we are guessing

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:39.830
only adults caught on to.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.480
This joke comes when Alex the Lion and Marty
the Zebra reunite on the beach.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.620
Marty realizes that Alex is angry and he turns
around to react but instead of actually swearing

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.980
he says, "Oh, sugar, honey, iced tea".

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.040
Adult viewers will pretty easily realizing
what the first letter of all those words spell

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.040
out.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.209
This is a very fun and creative way of slipping
some swearing into a kid�s movie.

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.170
Bambi
Bambi is a Disney classic and it�s probably

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.629
best remembered for the heartbreaking scene
where we have to watch Bambi�s mother die.

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.630
While audiences were busy wiping their tears
away, they may have missed the very funny

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.480
adult joke that the filmmakers slipped into
the film.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.610
In a moment when the two skunks finally kiss,
the male skunk stiffens all the way up and

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.280
starts to turn red.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.750
This hardening is clearly a dirty reference
to what happens to the male anatomy when it

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:31.750
is aroused.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.960
This moment was probably just funny for kids
but we are guessing that adults were probably

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.949
taken aback by this mature joke.

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:42.420
Beauty and The Beast
In the original animated version of Beauty

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.910
and The Beast, Gaston is a total jerk and
we are guessing that the upcoming live action

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.139
adaptation will deliver a very similar character
as well.

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.139
We have to wonder, though, if they will also
keep the weirdly adult moment that Gaston

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.400
shared with the audience when he explained
that he�s never even heard of shaving his

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.090
chest� or anything else.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.501
In the animated film Gaston says �every
last inch of me�s covered with hair� which

00:05:05.501 --> 00:05:09.490
could sound harmless if it wasn�t for the
super creepy wink that he adds in at the end

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:10.720
of this sentence.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:18.250
We have to hope that Luke Evans will not be
saying this bizarre line in the 2017 film.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.480
Toy Story 3
When Mr. Potato Head says �Hey, nobody takes

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:28.820
my wife�s mouth but me.� This is actually
probably one of the dirtiest and most clever

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.430
adult Disney joke of all time as it is extremely
clear to adults but would likely go right

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.100
over the head of any and all kids.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.790
This moment is also a very funny double entendre
that plays off the running joke of the Potato

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.820
Head characters constantly losing their body
parts.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.680
We have to think that the writers that came
up with this gaffe were probably very proud

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:59.229
of it and were likely giggling as they presented
it 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:31.630
to 
the producers.

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.530
Shrek
Near the beginning of the classic animated

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:39.229
film Shrek, the titular green ogre and his
side kick donkey are walking into the castle

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:44.300
of Duloc to file some complaints, when out
of nowhere Shrek drops one of the best adult

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.430
jokes of all time.

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:50.669
While the tow characters marvel at the absolutely
enormous castle, Shrek suggests to Donkey

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:55.460
that Lord Farquaad may be compensating for
something.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.320
While kids probably didn�t understand this
at all or maybe thought that Shrek was talking

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.419
about Farquaad height, mature audiences would
have pretty easily understood this as the

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:06.160
small penis joke that it was intended to be.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.389
This joke is great and if you want to see
some even dirtier jokes from Shrek make sure
