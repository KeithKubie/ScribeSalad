[Captions by Mary V. at Y Translator]

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:06.680
That works.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.780
Show us how it's really done.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.480
All right, Garrett. That was awesome.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.520
Tell us about this whip you were using.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.340
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So this is a six and half foot
kangaroo hide bullwhip,

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.500
and it has a shot loaded core
with a four plait belly,

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.020
cowhide bolster and a 12 plait overlay,

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.290
and we're gonna be making that today.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.220
&gt;&gt; All right. I don't know what
most of those things mean

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.680
but it sounds cool
and we're gonna learn about it.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.660
And so this kangaroo leather whip is
made from this kangaroo leather strips.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.340
Among some other things right ?
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.440
&gt;&gt; How do we get to this
from a kangaroo hide?

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.220
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.760
So, the biggest kangaroo hide you ever
gonna find is gonna be about this big.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.880
So that obviously is not gonna
get very long thin strips.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.940
So we have to cut circles around
the circumference of the kangaroo hide

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.460
in order to get the length of
leather lace that we need.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.440
In order to do that,

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.060
we make a lace cutter, which makes
it easy to cut the leather laces.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.940
&gt;&gt; All right, very cool.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.480
So we're going to
spiral cut a kangaroo hide,

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.400
and what we need to do is build
the little mechanism that lets us do that.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.980
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.040
&gt;&gt; Very cool.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.940
Here's the basic idea.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.960
We're going to take a piece of scrap wood,

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.360
a couple of razor blades
and some hardware

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.980
to assemble an adjustable lace cutter

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.610
used for making strips of leather that
can then be woven into a leather bullwhip.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.260
To get started on our lace cutter,
what are the supplies that we need?

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.420
&gt;&gt; We're gonna need just
a piece of scrap wood,

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.920
some razor blades in order
to actually cut the leather,

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.740
some wing nuts and some washers to
kind of hold the entire apparatus together,

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.680
and we're gonna need some threaded rod.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.360
&gt;&gt; To start out, we need to cut
a couple of pieces out of our board,

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.900
and to decide the size of that,

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.860
we're just gonna figure out what
seems like it'll be easy to hold on to.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.280
Let's see so...

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.220
&gt;&gt; Yeah, to fit easily in my hand,
give me a good grip.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.580
Do a little over 2 inches wide,
or go for about two and a quarter,

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.280
and then let's go for maybe five and half.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.040
[Music]

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.560
And then the second piece
that we need to cut

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.140
is actually going to sit on top of this one,

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.040
and I think we're gonna try and make
that length the same as this one's width.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.880
So we're just gonna keep
that cut going for-- I don't know,

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.430
about inch and a quarter--
inch and half something like that.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.560
It's it's pretty loose.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.100
And then we just need it wide enough
that we can fit our washer on top of it.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.840
Okay we got briefly distracted by
a sudden and fairly intense hailstorm

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.940
so I might still be a little bit wet 'cause
I felt I needed to run around in that.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:47.700
&gt;&gt; Worth it!

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.140
&gt;&gt; But we're back and it's time
to continue with our build.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.000
So we've got our pieces measured out,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.960
and we're gonna cut
those out using a band saw.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.380
If you don't have a band saw,

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.319
any other kind of saw will work pretty well.

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.320
It's just convenient for what we're doing.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:16.780
[Music]

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.960
So at this point we've got
our two pieces and...

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.580
Let me know if I've got this right.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.220
The idea of how this is going to work.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.040
So we're planning to put all 
thread right here.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.280
The blade is gonna come up
somewhere around right here, probably?

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.980
In our block?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, about that, yeah.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.420
And then our smaller block is going to
have sort of ellipse shaped hole cut into it.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.820
That's gonna be a sloppy drawing.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.060
But that whole be cut out,
and it will fit around the all thread.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.380
So the all thread will go
right here through this block,

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.700
and it'll be able to slide back and forth

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.200
until we fix it down in
place with the wing nut.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.560
So we've got 5/16 inch threaded rod,

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.170
and what we want is for that rod
to be in this block super tight

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.170
so it's never gonna come out.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.140
So we're gonna drill our hole
using an even smaller drill bit.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.740
This is a 1 quarter inch drill bit.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.780
1/4 is 4/16, the rod is 5/16,

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.150
that makes the rod a tiny
bit larger than the drill bit.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.140
So it should be in there really tight.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.000
So we need to drill a hole
into the block right here,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.360
and we need to drill a
hole in the block right here.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:23.640
[Music]

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.860
So it'll hold our razor blade in place.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.220
We're gonna cut a slit down
through part of this block.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.320
We're not gonna go all the way down.

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:32.900
We're not removing a piece,
but we're just making a slot

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.639
that our razor blade can fit into.

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.160
We've got our band saw
and we've got this jig setup

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.960
that will hopefully let us cut
perfectly straight into our block.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.240
Now, we don't want to cut
the whole piece all the way off.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:45.720
How far down?

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.380
&gt;&gt; About--

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.620
&gt;&gt; Like that, you think?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.120
Yeah.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.840
A little over twice as much
as the distance right there.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:58.500
[Music]

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.620
This mark was my first
estimate of where to go.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.960
Garrett suggested we go
a little bit farther than that

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.560
because this is basically our hinge.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.480
It's gonna be tightening down
right where we drilled our hole,

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.440
and the razor blade is gonna
be secured above that.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.940
So if we've got a little bit more space,

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.100
we've got a little bit more
leverage against our hinge,

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.680
and we can clamp it down
nice and really tight.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.900
Now at this point if we put our all
thread into this hole that we've drilled,

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.100
it would be really stuck and we wouldn't
really be able to squeeze this down

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.160
to pinch our razor blade, would we?
&gt;&gt; No.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.280
&gt;&gt; Okay. So we'll use a 5/16 inch drill bit
to open up this front portion of the hole

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.680
so that we can clamp down
on the razor blade,

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.560
and then it will move freely on the all thread
rather than being locked onto it.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.940
So you can't see too well inside
this hole to know what's going on.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.419
But here's the basic idea.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.900
We drilled a hole that goes all the
way down through the block,

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.140
about like that.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.140
It's 1/4 of an inch wide.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.160
But because we don't want the
all thread to bind on this part,

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.600
we then drilled a larger hole that
goes wider than that one quarter.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.860
This is our 5/16 inch hole.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.800
So we have a wider hole
through this portion,

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.930
and then it narrows down
to 1/4 inch for this portion.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.599
This means the all thread should
bind really well to the wood here.

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:11.569
But float in the drill hole
on this portion up here.

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:12.920
It won't be attached to it,

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.840
which is good because we need
this to move just slightly in and out.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:21.060
So now this piece we need to drill this
long, oval-shaped hole sort of thing.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.060
And once again this is something
we don't want to bind to the all thread.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.660
We want it to be able to
float and slide back and forth.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.000
So, let's keep using
the 5/16 inch drill bit for this,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.800
and what we're just gonna
do is set up a sort of brace,

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.080
and then we're just gonna
drill holes down in sequence

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.100
making sort of a tunnel through the wood,

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.300
and we'll clean it up
with a file if we need to.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.480
[Music]

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.080
All right we've got that hole cut out.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.700
It seems to slide pretty
nicely on our all thread without--

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.800
It doesn't have a ton of wiggle room
it just, it moves pretty easily.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.060
Now we need some all thread.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.560
We need all thread cut to fit
into this hole and into that one.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.080
All right we can take our drill bit
that fits down into the hole.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.080
We can measure,

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.500
see if if we do it through the block,

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.680
we can see it should
come to here to be level.

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:05.920
Let's add on about half an inch to it.

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.600
So we can just measure like that
about how long we want this to go.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:31.460
[Music]

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.940
&gt;&gt; So I like to just put a little
bit of superglue inside the hole.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.900
That just helps to lock it
in place even more.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.080
&gt;&gt; Extra binding, sounds like a plan.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.160
All right, so it can take a little bit of effort

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.620
to get that hole to bind
onto the edge of the all thread,

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.560
but just push harder.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.220
And you're gonna wanna use
some pliers to grab onto the all thread,

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.460
and just twist it onto the wood.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.820
My arm's getting tired.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.840
&gt;&gt; Want me to take a turn?

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.340
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:00.740
I'm so strong.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.720
&gt;&gt; See now.
Someone else is doing the work.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.820
That's the key.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.620
[Music]

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.320
Probably getting near the bottom there.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:14.560
[Music]

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.200
All right.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.540
Now we can slide this back and forth.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.420
And cinch it down using
our all thread and the wing nut.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.400
And it stays firmly in place.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.200
Brilliant!

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.740
Same thing on the other side.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.960
[Music]

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.320
So now we've got two adjustable points.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.140
We can loosen and tighten
this piece of the wood,

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.920
and then when we loosen this,

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.260
our little block on the top
just slides back and forth.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.260
What do we still need to do?

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:42.840
&gt;&gt; We need to put a blade in it.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.020
&gt;&gt; We need to put a blade in it.

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.460
&gt;&gt; I usually like to use
about an inch of blade.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.160
So it has enough to nicely grip inside the--

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.480
&gt;&gt; So I've got too much here?

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.180
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.380
So we need to break off?

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.740
That's what's nice about these blades
is you can break them off to

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.460
whatever size you want.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:56.980
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.560
&gt;&gt; Sometimes razor blades go flying.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:03.520
&gt;&gt; Got our blade and we wanna drop
this down until most of it is hidden.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.840
We only want like a little
bit kind of sticking up the top.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.380
It's maybe a quarter of an inch.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.040
Maybe just over that, right?

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.620
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the longest [inaudible].

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:14.460
&gt;&gt; All right, and now we
just twist here on the side,

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:18.280
and that will pinch down on
the blade holding it firmly in place.

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.740
We can adjust how thick
we want our lace cutter to cut

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.780
by moving this piece in and out.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.820
Garrett, is there anything
else we want to do to this,

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.720
to really make it work just right?

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.940
&gt;&gt; So there's one more optional
thing that we can do.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.360
We can take off this corner here.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.640
Because as the leather
is running by the lace cutter,

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.220
sometimes it gets caught on this corner.

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.860
So if we just cut this corner
off at a 45 degree angle,

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.940
it'll help to cut the leather
a little smoother.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:49.680
[Music]

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.680
Cool.
&gt;&gt; Looks beautiful.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.580
&gt;&gt; Can we test it out?

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:52.500
&gt;&gt; Yep. Time to test it out.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.240
&gt;&gt; Let's test it out.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.600
Why are we using Kangaroo hide
for our whip making?

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.580
&gt;&gt; Kangaroo hide is the strongest
leather in existence.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:03.220
There is basically no other leather that's
gonna be stronger than kangaroo hide.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.500
Okay so we're gonna be cutting
around the circumference of the hide.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:11.040
But as you can see, it doesn't have a very
very smooth outline around the hide.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.940
So we're gonna need to do is trim it.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:16.080
So we have a very smooth
curvature around the entire hide.

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.080
Which makes it easy to cut the lace.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.840
&gt;&gt; These little points, if we tried
to pass that through our lace cutter,

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.060
we can't really turn a sharp angle.

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.770
We just need it to be
like a smooth transition.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:27.720
So we're going to lose these
little pointy bits on the edges.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:32.580
&gt;&gt; I'm taking off these legs because
the legs are usually pretty stretchy,

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:35.360
and it's not the optimal leather to use.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:41.280
[Music]

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.290
Do we want to try and get any
lace off of this piece you just cut?

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:46.100
Or do we want to go
straight into the circle?

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.740
&gt;&gt; We need to--
we want to keep these scraps

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:51.200
because we'll use them for a little
kind of rinky-dink things along the way,

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.160
but uh we're not gonna...
&gt;&gt; So don't throw this away,

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.280
but don't use it right now.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah so we're not gonna
get very good lace out of that

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.520
but we can still get
some good use out of it.

00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.100
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.220
&gt;&gt; Okay so now that we have
the kangaroo hide trimmed up,

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:05.660
we have a very nice curve
around the entire kangaroo hide.

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:07.840
We can now begin to cut the lace.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.180
I like to cut lace on the corner
of like a table or a work bench

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:11.920
or something like that.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.340
So I have the kangaroo hide
well braced on the table,

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.540
but I can have the edge
of I'm working with free,

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:17.980
and I don't have a table on my way.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.780
So to start cutting, we're just
gonna start on an edge here,

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.380
and we're gonna take our blade,

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.520
and just kind of slowly push it in.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.900
And we're gonna start
just kind of a little bit of a taper,

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:28.740
and get wider and wider and wider

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:31.480
until we reach the full width
that we've had it set to.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.580
So right there.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.980
Now as we start cutting,

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.760
it's really important to be holding
the lace that you're pulling through,

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.740
and pulling at a little bit of an angle.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.920
Pulling at an angle helps to keep
tension on the lace cutter and the blade

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.470
so you get a more straight cut.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.180
You have to be careful with fresh blades

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:49.980
because they cut through
the leather like butter,

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.260
and if you get excited,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.400
you'll just pull right through the leather in

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.900
and end your strand too early.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.220
Wanna give a try?

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:56.720
&gt;&gt; Sure!

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.520
I like to put my thumb kind of
on top to help keep it flush.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.780
[Music]

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:07.095
Do I do anything special when
I get back to the starting point,

00:12:07.095 --> 00:12:09.100
or do I just kind of keep circling through?

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah, just kind
of keep circling through.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:14.050
That kind of notch will get taken away
when you resize the strand.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:16.000
&gt;&gt; So it feels like I could go a lot faster,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.660
and you're recommending
I really don't do that

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:19.760
because I'll probably end up
accidentally just pulling the blade

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.100
right through the edge of the leather.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:21.680
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:25.340
It actually kind of gets a little bit
easier as the blade dulls just a little bit,

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:26.880
and you get a little bit of resistance.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.020
That makes it easier
to go a little bit faster

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.920
without worrying about
cutting through your strand.

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:36.060
It's better to err on the side of
cutting a little bit too thick.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.040
Because we can make it smaller.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.400
We can't make it bigger.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.460
&gt;&gt; Okay I think I made it
all the way around once.

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:45.440
Very cool. Very cool.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.760
This lace cutter seems like
it is working really well.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:51.000
It's gliding through
this leather super nicely,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.660
and it's pretty easy to keep
a uniform width on it,

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:55.840
and that is something that is
going to be very important

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:59.300
as we try and turn this
lace into a functional whip.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.760
In our next video,
Garrett's gonna be showing us

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:05.500
how to turn this leather lace
into a fully functional whip.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.000
So make sure you come back for that.

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.480
