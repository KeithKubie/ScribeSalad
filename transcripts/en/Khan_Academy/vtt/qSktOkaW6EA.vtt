00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.305
The graph of the function 
f is shown below.

00:00:04.305 --> 00:00:07.727
What is the input value
other than negative five

00:00:07.727 --> 00:00:12.254
for which f of x is equal
to f of negative five?

00:00:12.254 --> 00:00:15.240
So, we have our x axis,
we have our y axis.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.742
And then in blue, they've 
graphed y equals f of x.

00:00:19.742 --> 00:00:23.663
So for example when 
x is equal to one, f of x,

00:00:23.663 --> 00:00:28.005
when y is going to be equal 
to f of x --that's what this graph is--

00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:30.143
f of x is equal to one.

00:00:30.143 --> 00:00:36.418
When x is equal to seven, 
f of seven, we see, is equal to five.

00:00:36.418 --> 00:00:41.580
When x is equal to nine, we see
that f of nine is equal to six.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.299
So what is the input value
other than negative five

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:47.760
for which f of x is equal to
f of negative five?

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.764
So, let's see.

00:00:48.764 --> 00:00:53.648
If x is equal to negative five,
f of negative five is...

00:00:53.648 --> 00:00:55.850
-- we move up here to the graph--

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.043
It is equal to four.

00:00:57.043 --> 00:01:00.954
Cause this, once again, is the 
graph y is equal to f of x.

00:01:00.954 --> 00:01:02.453
So the y coordinate here,

00:01:02.453 --> 00:01:06.568
this is what f of x, this is what 
five of negative five is equal to.

00:01:06.568 --> 00:01:08.640
So f of negative five is equal to four.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.529
So where else does that happen?

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:11.339
So let's see.

00:01:11.339 --> 00:01:13.983
Let's just move horizontally to the right.

00:01:13.983 --> 00:01:16.598
That happens here as well.

00:01:16.598 --> 00:01:18.630
So what input do we have to give?

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.572
What's the x coordinate here to get

00:01:20.572 --> 00:01:25.573
y is equal to f of x or f of x is
equal to four right over here?

00:01:25.573 --> 00:01:27.946
Well, we see the x 
coordinate is also four.

00:01:27.946 --> 00:01:31.728
So this tells us that f of four
is equal to four,

00:01:31.728 --> 00:01:35.084
which is the same thing as
f of negative five.

00:01:35.084 --> 00:01:39.521
So when x is four, the function
takes on the same value

00:01:39.521 --> 00:01:42.530
as when x is negative five.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.009
So x equals four. And we are done.
