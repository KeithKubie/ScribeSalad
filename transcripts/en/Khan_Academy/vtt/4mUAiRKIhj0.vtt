00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.080
All right, let's see,
we're on page 471.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.670
We'll start with
section 6 now.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.630
So let's do the first problem,
and I will do it in magenta.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.620
Problem number one.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:22.840
3 plus diamond over 2 is
equal to 7 and 1/2.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.580
And they say, what number,
when used in the place of

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.870
diamond above, makes
the statement true?

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.320
Well, they're just making the
diamond a variable, right?

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.210
So we could just say 3 plus
x over 2-- [? instead ?]

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.790
of an x instead of the diamond,
because that's what

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.960
we're used to-- is equal to--
well, we could write this as a

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.210
decimal if we want, 7.5.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.870
Multiply both sides by
2, so you get 3 plus

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.790
x is equal to 15.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.200
x is equal to 12.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.360
So that's choice D.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.380
Or we could say diamond is equal
to x is equal to 12.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.640
OK, problem number two.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.010
They have this thing drawn.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.860
Let me draw what they drew.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.590
I'll do it in a different
color.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.840
They have, like, a transversal
here, and then they have one

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.090
line that goes like this.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.040
And then they have another
line that goes

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.070
something like this.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.290
And then, let's see, they
wrote a bunch of stuff.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:34.500
They wrote, this is angle 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and these

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.360
are lines l and lines m.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.115
And they say in the figure
above, l is parallel to m.

00:01:43.115 --> 00:01:46.036
All right, parallel lines.

00:01:46.036 --> 00:01:49.900
If l is parallel to m, the sum
of the measures of angles 2

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:56.390
and 4 must equal the sum of the
measures of which of the

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.450
following pairs of angles?

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.325
So the sum of 2 and 4.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.480
And actually, we know
another thing.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.539
We know that 2 and 4 are equal
to each other, right?

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.505
Because they're opposite
angles.

00:02:11.505 --> 00:02:15.360
But anyway, what angles would
be the same as 2 plus 4?

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.730
Well, we can just do what we
learned in geometry class

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.960
about corresponding angles.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.770
We know that this angle is the
same thing as this angle.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.520
And we actually know that that
angle is also the same thing

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.970
as this angle, because
they're opposite.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.290
And that first one, we know that
they are because they're

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.270
corresponding.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.670
That angle's the same
as this one.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.650
So 2 plus 4 should be the
same thing as 6 plus 8.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.720
And all we used is corresponding
angles to say,

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.870
well, 4 is going to
be the same as 8.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:41.930
2 is the same as 6.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.680
And we also know that 6 and
8 are the same, and 2

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.030
and 4 are the same.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.820
So it's choice D.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.645
Problem number three.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.860
Let me draw this table, because
it looks like we'll

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.260
have to use it.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.950
So I have a box here and then
we draw four lines.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.570
All right, soon. almost there.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:32.170
And then they say, Men,
Women, Total,

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:39.490
Employed, Unemployed, Total.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:46.320
And they wrote in the numbers
27,000-- those are 0's--

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:57.590
48,000, 21,500, and 50,500.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.370
In the table above, describing
the Preston City workforce--

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.360
the table is partially filled
in-- based on the information

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.640
in the table, how many women in
the Preston city workforce

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.310
are unemployed?

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.440
So we want to figure out women
that are unemployed.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.980
We need to figure
out this box.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.420
So how do we do that?

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.050
Well, first we can figure out
the women that are employed

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:24.020
because there's 48,000
workers.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.990
27,000 are men.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.745
So we just subtract 27,000 from
48,000, so there's going

00:04:29.745 --> 00:04:34.540
to be 21,000 women.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.090
And then if there's 21,000
women-- I just subtracted--

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.270
and-- no, sorry, there's 21,000
employed women, because

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.140
we're in the Employed column--
and there are

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.500
21,500 total women.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.380
Well, then we just
subtract again.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.960
21,500 minus 21,000.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.610
There must be 500 unemployed
women in Preston City, and

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.210
that's choice A.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.830
OK, problem number four.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.900
And I will switch from
this kind of

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.320
nauseating color, I think.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.370
A group of students washed
cars to raise money.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:24.230
The net amount, A, in dollars
raised by washing k cars, is

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.750
given by the function-- oh,
well, they tell us, A of k.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.310
So this is how much you've made
after washing k cars, is

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.580
4k minus 30.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.980
If the group washed 15
cars, what is the

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.300
net amount they raised?

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.000
Well, this seems unbelievably
easy, because they tell you

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:57.800
that k is 15, so A of 15 is
equal to 4 times 15, minus 30.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.000
4 times 15 is 60, minus 30.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.410
That just equals 30.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.200
They raised $30.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.860
That's choice E.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.560
If I was taking the SAT, I would
have paused, just to

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.060
make sure I didn't
miss something.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.240
I'm actually pausing
now to make sure I

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.950
didn't miss a trick.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:12.810
But I think that's it.

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.250
That's kind of one of those
freebie quick questions.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.802
OK, problem number five.

00:06:18.802 --> 00:06:22.110
And I'll switch colors
for variety.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:35.650
If xr is equal to v, and v is
equal to kr, and we also know

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:39.010
that rv does not equal 0,
which also tells us that

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.560
neither you of these numbers
can equal 0, which of the

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.740
following is equal to k?

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.710
And all of the choices have
just x's and some numbers.

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:52.016
So we want to write
k in terms of x.

00:06:52.016 --> 00:06:55.006
So xr is equal to v, and
v is equal to kr.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:09.190
So we know that xr is equal to
kr, and since we know that r

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:13.990
does not equal 0, we can divide
both sides of this

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.285
equation by r and
they cancel out.

00:07:16.285 --> 00:07:20.060
And we get x is equal to
k, or k is equal to x.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.080
So that is choice D.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.690
Well, they're giving us a lot
of quick problems, but I

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:26.150
that's good.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:29.300
I can fit a lot into
one video.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.550
OK, problem number six.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.780
The eggs in a certain basket
are either white or brown.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:42.690
If the ratio of white eggs to
brown eggs-- I should probably

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:46.410
do it in those colors, but I'm
not to confuse you-- the ratio

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:53.190
of white to brown is
equal to 2 over 3.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:56.670
Each of the following could be
the number of eggs in the

00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:00.440
basket, except-- so this
is a tricky one.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:05.150
So the ratio of white to
brown is 2:3, right?

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:12.025
White to brown is equal
to 2 over 3.

00:08:12.025 --> 00:08:18.740
Or another way we could say it
is, white is equal to 2/3

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:22.790
times the brown eggs.

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:26.590
And so the total eggs in the
basket are going to be white

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:27.840
plus brown.

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:36.714
And so we could write, this w,
it as 2/3 of the number of

00:08:36.714 --> 00:08:38.590
brown eggs is the white eggs--
that's what we figured out

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:42.030
here-- plus the brown eggs.

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:44.720
So the total number of baskets
is-- let's see, what's 2/3

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.140
plus-- 1 is the same thing
is 3/3, right?

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.680
The total number of baskets
is 5/3 times the

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:51.930
number of brown eggs.

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:57.540
We know we can't have a
fractional number of eggs, so

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.065
we know that this has to
be a whole number.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:13.420
If we said 5/3B, this is the
first choice is equal to 10,

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.290
could that be a choice?

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:22.370
Let's see, B would have to be
3/5 times 10, which would be--

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:26.330
this cancels out-- that
works, right?

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.270
Because then B would be
6, so that could work.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.250
Well, I think we already
know, right?

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:38.790
The total number of baskets
has to be divisible by 5.

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:44.660
Because B is equal to the total
number times 3 over 5.

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.010
I just used this equation, 5/3B
is equal to the total.

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:48.980
Multiply both sides
[? by the ?]

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.230
reciprocal, you get this.

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:55.630
And the only choice that's not
divisible by 5 is choice B.

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:57.980
Hope I didn't rush it, but I had
to finish under the wire.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.420
I'll see
