00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So the way this is working,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
it does build heap, which we said was Î¸n

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
or more simply Î¸n (logn).

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Then what we're doing is nx.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We're doing remove.mn, which is a (logn) operation,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
so we get n (logn) for this loop

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
plus (L) for the build heap.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It's just n(logn).

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It's pretty cool.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
There's only a couple of well-known sorting algorithms that give us such a good

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
running time bound.
