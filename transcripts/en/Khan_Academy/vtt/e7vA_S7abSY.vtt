00:00:00.103 --> 00:00:02.285
- [Voiceover] Let's see if we
can simplify this expression

00:00:02.285 --> 00:00:06.663
and like always, pause the
video and have a go at it.

00:00:06.663 --> 00:00:07.694
Now this one is interesting

00:00:07.694 --> 00:00:09.496
because it involves two variables,

00:00:09.496 --> 00:00:11.755
but it's really the same
ideas that we've done

00:00:11.755 --> 00:00:14.207
when we factored things with one variable.

00:00:14.207 --> 00:00:15.942
So, for example, up here in the numerator,

00:00:15.942 --> 00:00:19.029
while I never liked having
a non-one coefficient

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:20.730
on the second degree term here,

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.485
I mean, sometimes you have to,

00:00:22.485 --> 00:00:25.899
but it looks like every term
here is divisible by five,

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:27.521
so let's factor out of five first.

00:00:27.521 --> 00:00:29.827
So the numerator, I can rewrite

00:00:29.827 --> 00:00:33.557
as five times,

00:00:33.557 --> 00:00:37.216
five times, you factor out of
five here, you get x squared.

00:00:37.216 --> 00:00:41.416
Factor out of five
here, you get plus four.

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:44.207
Actually, I'm gonna rewrite it as four y x

00:00:44.207 --> 00:00:46.579
and you'll see in a
second why I'm doing that.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:47.710
Actually, I'll tell you why.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.222
I'll tell you why I'm
doing that right now,

00:00:49.222 --> 00:00:51.173
why I'm writing the y there

00:00:51.173 --> 00:00:53.304
is that this way, it seems to,

00:00:53.304 --> 00:00:55.775
it seems to hit the pattern

00:00:55.775 --> 00:00:58.577
of how we're used to seeing quadratics.

00:00:58.577 --> 00:01:00.919
So let's see. So you have
x squared plus four y x,

00:01:00.919 --> 00:01:02.871
you can view the four y's a coefficient

00:01:02.871 --> 00:01:05.182
on the first degree in x term,

00:01:05.182 --> 00:01:07.233
on the x term right over there,

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:11.274
plus four y squared

00:01:11.274 --> 00:01:14.255
and it's gonna be over,

00:01:14.255 --> 00:01:16.423
over.

00:01:16.423 --> 00:01:19.515
Now, the denominator here,
can we factor this out?

00:01:19.515 --> 00:01:21.037
Well, let's just think about it.

00:01:21.037 --> 00:01:25.309
Do we know two numbers,
or I guess we would say,

00:01:25.309 --> 00:01:29.361
do we know two expressions
that when you multiply,

00:01:29.361 --> 00:01:31.802
you get negative six y squared

00:01:31.802 --> 00:01:33.153
and then when you add them,

00:01:33.153 --> 00:01:37.204
you get negative x y.

00:01:37.204 --> 00:01:39.136
Sorry, when you add
them, you get negative y.

00:01:39.136 --> 00:01:40.973
That's actually why I like
to write and get like this.

00:01:40.973 --> 00:01:42.219
Actually, let me rewrite this.

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:45.196
This is the same thing as negative y x.

00:01:45.196 --> 00:01:48.670
And so you can view the
coefficient here as negative y.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.617
And so when you think of two
numbers or two expressions,

00:01:51.617 --> 00:01:56.159
a times b, that is equal
to negative six y squared

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.027
and when I add them, a plus b,

00:01:59.027 --> 00:02:02.107
that is equal to negative y.

00:02:02.107 --> 00:02:03.859
And so you can imagine, both of them

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:05.850
are going to be expressions,

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.262
a and b are gonna be
expressions that involve y.

00:02:09.262 --> 00:02:12.554
And so, let's see, if this
was just a negative one

00:02:12.554 --> 00:02:15.986
and if this was just a
negative six, what we would do,

00:02:15.986 --> 00:02:20.913
we would do negative
three and positive two.

00:02:20.913 --> 00:02:23.985
Now let's see. If we did negative three y

00:02:23.985 --> 00:02:26.933
and positive two y, that indeed

00:02:26.933 --> 00:02:29.793
is going to be equal to
negative six y squared

00:02:29.793 --> 00:02:32.952
and negative three y plus two y

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:35.024
does indeed equal negative y.

00:02:35.024 --> 00:02:36.966
So that's our a and b right there.

00:02:36.966 --> 00:02:38.248
And it seems a little mysterious.

00:02:38.248 --> 00:02:41.537
How did Sal just all of a
sudden get negative two y,

00:02:41.537 --> 00:02:44.186
or negative three y and positive two y?

00:02:44.186 --> 00:02:47.978
Let me write an analogous quadratic here

00:02:47.978 --> 00:02:49.335
that only has one variable.

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:53.820
If I were to write x
squared minus x minus six

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.412
and I were to ask you to factor that out,

00:02:55.412 --> 00:02:57.136
you say, "Oh, okay."

00:02:57.136 --> 00:02:58.258
I have negative two.

00:02:58.258 --> 00:03:00.517
I have negative three times
negative two is negative six

00:03:00.517 --> 00:03:03.270
and if I add them, well that's
going to be negative one.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.099
So you'd say, "Well that's going to be

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:10.857
"x minus three times x plus two."

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:13.793
And so the only difference
between this and that

00:03:13.793 --> 00:03:15.315
is instead of having just a negative one,

00:03:15.315 --> 00:03:18.054
you have a negative one y.

00:03:18.054 --> 00:03:19.416
Instead of having just
a negative six here,

00:03:19.416 --> 00:03:21.958
you have a negative six y squared.

00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.770
And so you could just think of this

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.792
instead of just negative
three and positive two,

00:03:25.792 --> 00:03:28.715
negative three y and positive two y.

00:03:28.715 --> 00:03:30.513
Hopefully that makes
sense and if it doesn't,

00:03:30.513 --> 00:03:33.106
I encourage you to kind
of play around with this,

00:03:33.106 --> 00:03:34.358
multiply these out a little bit,

00:03:34.358 --> 00:03:37.750
get a little bit more familiar with this.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.810
But now that we know that
it can factored like this,

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:41.801
let's rewrite this.

00:03:41.801 --> 00:03:46.801
This is going to be x minus three y

00:03:47.463 --> 00:03:51.555
times x plus two y.

00:03:51.555 --> 00:03:54.701
And nothing seems to
simplify out just yet,

00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:56.726
but it looks like what
we have in magenta here

00:03:56.726 --> 00:03:58.317
can be simplified further.

00:03:58.317 --> 00:03:59.729
We're gonna do a very similar exercise

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:01.610
to what we did just now.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.249
What two expressions if I multiply,

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:05.111
I'm gonna get four y squared

00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:07.953
and if I add them, I get four y?

00:04:07.953 --> 00:04:10.236
It looks like two y would do the trick.

00:04:10.236 --> 00:04:14.053
So it seems like we can
rewrite the numerator.

00:04:14.053 --> 00:04:15.722
This is going to be.

00:04:15.722 --> 00:04:18.601
So let me draw a little
line here to make it clear

00:04:18.601 --> 00:04:19.722
that this is,

00:04:19.722 --> 00:04:22.895
this is going to be equal to five

00:04:22.895 --> 00:04:25.128
times

00:04:25.128 --> 00:04:28.818
x plus two y times,

00:04:28.818 --> 00:04:30.630
I could say this is x plus two y squared

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.041
or I could just say x plus
two y times x plus two y.

00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:37.470
Once again, two y times
two y is four y squared.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.956
Two y plus two y is four y.

00:04:40.956 --> 00:04:45.956
And that's all going to be over,

00:04:46.216 --> 00:04:48.964
that is all going to be over

00:04:48.964 --> 00:04:53.604
x minus three y

00:04:53.604 --> 00:04:57.236
times x plus two y.

00:04:57.236 --> 00:05:00.366
And so now, I have a
common factor, x plus two y

00:05:00.366 --> 00:05:02.925
in both the numerator and the denominator,

00:05:02.925 --> 00:05:06.806
so I can handle x plus two
y divided by x plus two y,

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:08.895
well that's just going to be one

00:05:08.895 --> 00:05:12.782
if we assume that x plus
two y does not equal zero.

00:05:12.782 --> 00:05:14.644
And that's actually an
important constraint

00:05:14.644 --> 00:05:17.550
because once we cancel this
out, you lose that information.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.529
If you want this to be
algebraically equivalent,

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:24.120
we could say that x plus two
y cannot be equal to zero

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.064
or another way you could say it

00:05:25.064 --> 00:05:28.327
is that x cannot be equal to,

00:05:28.327 --> 00:05:30.663
cannot be equal to negative two y.

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:33.242
I just subtracted two y
from both sides there.

00:05:33.242 --> 00:05:34.133
And so what you're left with,

00:05:34.133 --> 00:05:35.495
and we can redistribute this five

00:05:35.495 --> 00:05:38.027
if we wanna write it out in expanded form.

00:05:38.027 --> 00:05:39.128
We could rewrite it as,

00:05:39.128 --> 00:05:41.623
the numerator would be five x.

00:05:41.623 --> 00:05:43.309
Let me write it over here.

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:47.535
Five x plus 10 y.

00:05:47.535 --> 00:05:51.748
And the denominator is x minus three y.

00:05:51.748 --> 00:05:52.919
But once again, if we want it

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:54.284
to be algebraically equivalent,

00:05:54.284 --> 00:05:57.360
we would have to say x cannot be equal to,

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.560
x cannot be equal to negative two y.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.290
And now this is algebraically equivalent

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:05.581
to what we had up here

00:06:05.581 --> 00:06:09.571
and you can argue that
it's a little bit simpler.
