00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.470
SUBJECT 1: Get a good picture?


00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.930
He wanted my machine gun team and
myself, the four of us,

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.190
to run across this rice paddy.


00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.940
Then we're going to
give us some cover fire

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.140
to get to a certain point
way down there so we can put

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.870
a field of fire in front of
us-- a big field of fire--

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.830
to try to get them across.


00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:35.330
And I didn't go for it.


00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.300 position:97%
 


00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.570
I says to the captain, I
said, sir, I'm not doing that.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.460 position:97%
 


00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.390
He says, I could
have you shot.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.810
I said, no you can't.


00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.240
EAMON FOLEY: War is something
that is higher energy.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.540
War is beyond us.


00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.360
War is beyond my understanding.


00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.930
And so with that I'm hoping to
tell this Vietnam War story.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.670 position:97%
 


00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.630
I'm Eamon Foley.


00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.570
I'm a senior in the anthropology
department, Class of 2015.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.220
I'm getting a
certificate in theater,

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.220
and I'm from New Canaan,
Connecticut, originally.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.500 position:97%
 


00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.700
OK, so it all started
with dance originally.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.950
It's the classic story--
I saw the Nutcracker when

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.230
I was six years old and
was just so enamored.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.060
And I was like I want
to be the prince, Mom,

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.060
I want to be the prince.


00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.150
And she was like oh, OK
soccer, and baseball, and all

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.960
right, but OK.


00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.100
It was just kind of
a scary prospect.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.890
After begging and
begging and begging

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.580
I finally got into dance class.


00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.040
I fell in love with
it immediately.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.710
So it started off with
Gypsy when I was nine.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.900
And then when I was 10,
as Gypsy was closing,

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.820
I went into Assassins, which was
another Stephen Sondheim show.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.080
And then I went on to do
two productions of How

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.200
The Grinch Stole Christmas.


00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.390
Then after that I did
13, and then my last show

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.570
was Everyday Rapture,
which was amazing.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.490
In my time at the
anthropology department

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.000
I spent a lot of time
studying ethnography

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.440
and the idea of gathering
information through interview.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.350
And it kind of reminded
me of the Laramie Project

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.720
and all this great
theater that's

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.910
been created from ethnography.


00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.890
And I thought this would be
a great way to look at where

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.540
and anthropology
and theater meet.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.140
Over the summer I put
out some Craigslist ads.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.900
I talked to some family members
who knew some Vietnam War vets.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.780
I talked to my agent who was
related to a Vietnam War vet.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.080
I talked to my dad, who
was working with one.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.530
And I was able to just
have lunches with them

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.370
and just meet them
over the city,

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.580
and just talk about their
experience in the war.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.500
And it was incredible.


00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.430 position:97%
 


00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.650
I'm trying to work through
these and find actual lines,

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.630
actual words that
these amazing vets said

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.060
to me that can both
inform the piece

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.560
and could actually be monologue
that could actually come out

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.820
and just be straight-up
put into the show.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.510
So right now I don't have a
script, I don't have choreo,

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.860
I don't have a cast, but I have
a lot of great ideas bouncing

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.360
around my


00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.160
head and I'm really excited
to start fine-tuning them

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.520
and turning them into
physical products.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:24.330 position:97%
 


00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.290
So what's really
hard for me right now

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.850
is getting words on the page.


00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.220
But I was on this roll before.


00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.170
I just felt like things
were coming out of me

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.010
and it was awesome.


00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.550
And I was putting a lot
of time into the script

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.290
and taking a seven-
day break because you

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.450
have to write two
anthropology essays

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.680
and you have to work on this
other anthropology thesis

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.480
is-- it really kills the flow.


00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.840
So I'm trying to
get back on that.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.010 position:97%
 


00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.510
Did you guys ever
seen in my history

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.850
that I wanted to be a
director or a choreographer?

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.540
BRENDAN FOLEY: Yes, I did.


00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.320
I remember, when I was
studying for the SATs--

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.110
I was probably 16, you
were 14-- we were studying

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.520
and you were tap dancing
down the hallway.

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.910
I was so angry.


00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:18.870
[LAUGHTER]


00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.750
ROBIN FOLEY: I remember when you
were taking dance classes that

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.740
you turned to me--at
I think age 7--

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.470
and said I wish I had more
dancers in this class,

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.280
and that they were better
dancers so they could do what I

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.550
have in my mind.


00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.670
And that was seven years old.


00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.810
So you had been
one to choreograph

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.070
for a long, long time.


00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.780
EAMON FOLEY (VOICEOVER):
My greatest fear

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.970
would be that I couldn't live
up to the ideas in my head.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.250
That this big visual feast
that I'm trying to create,

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.270
this big intense
production, would not

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.240
reach that intensity that
I'm holding it to right now.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:02.780
[MUSIC PLAYING]


00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.320
EAMON FOLEY: This
audition experience

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.050
was so hectic and incredible.


00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.050
It was really stressful
because I wasn't sure

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.720
if I was going to get
the cast I wanted.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.260
On the first day-- I split it
into three days and a callback.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.890
So I'm Eamon.


00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:23.600
I'm directing and choreographing
this little ditty.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.270
And I'm--


00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.460
When the men showed up,
I only got five guys.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.510
Only five boys showed up.


00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:29.810
And they were all incredible.


00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:30.740
I cast all of them.


00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.330
They're all dear
friends of mine.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.850 position:97%
 


00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.430
And then the next
day were the girls.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.930
And oh my god, the girls-- the
female dancers on this campus

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:42.950
are amazing.


00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.490
And we had 16 girls show up,
which is kind of bittersweet.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.340
It's great that I had
the cream of the crop

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.620
to choose from already.


00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.870
But also it's going to mean
cutting a lot of friends--

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:52.980
I cut a lot of friends.


00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.630
I have to send out nos.


00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.430
I'm waiting for confirmation
for all my yeses,

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:58.610
but then I'm going to have
send out some nos, which

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:59.400
is going to be sad.


00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:05.010 position:97%
 


00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.950
So I cast Alex
Quetell as Claude,

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:12.530
who is this kind of lost
boy character who's thrown

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.340
into the war-- who's drafted.


00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.100
And he finds this
love for it there.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.230
He's kind of lacking passion,
but then in this highly intense

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.910
place finds this manhood in
him that is exciting and scary.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:31.710
This animal that he is-- there's
that addictive quality of war

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.210
that he really falls into.


00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.600
And also, in this strange,
highly intense place,

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.250
he develops a relationship
with Tony, who

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.290
I cast Colby Hyland in the role.


00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:48.410
And Tony is this poet soul.


00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.780
Beautiful guy--he's removed
himself from the ra-ra nature

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:53.910
of the Marines.


00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.050
He hasn't quite given
into it because, I think,

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.490
he's always felt like an outsider.


00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:58.870
He's a closeted homosexual.


00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.460 position:97%
 


00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.720
However, they're on a mission
together, and in that world

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.340
he's able to experiment
with that side of himself.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.710
This is a high-stakes situation.


00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:16.040
He mutilated her.


00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.690
We're supposed to be
protecting these people.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.690
We don't even see
them as people.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.610
EEAMON FOLEY: But at home
he has this girlfriend,

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:30.840
this incredibly passionate
hippie queen organizer,

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.090
public speaker, Sheila.


00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.190
I've cast Kamber Hart
to play the role.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.110
And she's so wonderful
because she also-- she

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.980 position:59%
has aerial experience, more than I do.


00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.920
She's incredible on the silks.


00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.150
So I'm really excited to
see her play the Red Angel

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:50.070
and come down on those giant red
silks and just rock that role.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:53.430
EAMON FOLEY: Yeah, so this is a
work in progress on the script.

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:56.000
This is, I think, third
draft of the script so far.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.120
This will be the first time
I'm actually hearing it

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.650
out loud with actors.


00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:02.450
So again, I'm very excited
to learn something from this.

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.540
Today I'm doing the
first reading the script.

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.090
And I have a bunch
actor friends coming in.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.570
And this is the first time I'm
going to hear it out loud.

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:13.570
So I'm honestly really
nervous to hear these words

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:16.380
because I'm the biggest
critic of my own work.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.790
Because you hear the
minor flaws in your lines

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:21.560
and the little
extra tidbits that

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.110
can bring a little monologue
down or bring a line down.

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:25.640
And you just hate
it so much rather

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.380
than just being able to
bounce over it and move on.

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.350
So I'm nervous about just
cringing for the next two

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:33.550
hours of this reading
but also very,

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:35.300
very excited to hear
it for the first time

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:36.820
and learn about
the next directions

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.540
for where the show has to go.


00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:39.860
SUBJECT 2: What's going on?


00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.150
SUBJECT 3: I've waited for
this day my whole life, son.

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:43.980
The day you become a man.


00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.540
SUBJECT 4: We love
you so much honey.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.110
SUBJECT 3: You're going
to make us so proud.

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:50.530
EAMON FOLEY: So
all together, it's

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.120
a huge cast for a
show at this school.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.090
It's 23 people.


00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:58.670
Which is a lot of people who
are already very, very busy.

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:00.050
And they're going
to be giving me

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:04.340
a lot of their time, which is
both awesome and generous--

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.420
and I'm very excited about
it-- but a little scary

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.510
because I know it's going
to be a lot of conflicts

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:10.150
we're having to work around.


00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.730
Especially that tech week when
I need all 23 people in a room,

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:15.330
and all 23 people already
have their own schedules.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:16.590
It's going to be interesting.


00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.360
It's going to be a challenge.


00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.130
I don't know, is it worth it?


00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:23.670
I've talked so much of this show
without Kristin here so far.

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:24.910
I wonder if it might just
be better to just pretend

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:25.830
she's not in the show.


00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.940 position:97%
 


00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.900
It ruins all of our pyramids.


00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.320
I cast 16 so that all
these things could happen.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.380
All these stage pictures.


00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:37.230
Ah, I hate this.


00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:38.860
God, casting this is rough.


00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.560
I sent out a feeler
for a lead singer.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.920
I asked him if he wanted to do
a work session with Vince and I.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.400
And I got back, Hey Eamon,
thank you for considering me

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.010
for this, exclamation point!


00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:51.550
Unfortunately , I'm incredibly
behind on my own thesis at this

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.780
moment, so I can't take
on any more commitments.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.230
I've gotten this email
back a million times.

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:57.600
I do appreciate
the offer though,

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.930
and would love to work
with you in the future

00:09:58.930 --> 00:09:59.680
if you ever need a singer.


00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:00.160
In the future?


00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.330
I'm done here, this is it,
this is the last chance.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.660
Hope the show goes well, and
can't wait to see you then.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:06.020
Best, Casey.


00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.500
Thank you Casey.


00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.480
That's the end of Casey.


00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:09.980
OK.


00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:10.480
Who's next?


00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:17.570
[MUSIC PLAYING]


00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:19.440
SUZANNE AGINS: One of the things
that Eamon is really

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:24.490
struggling with right now
is his vision is enormous,

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:27.160
and ambitious, and exciting.


00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:32.250
And there is no way that
we at the Lewis Center

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:35.030
can spend a half
a million dollars

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.440
to give Eamon all the
bells and whistles

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.780
that he has dreamed up.


00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.970
Every amazing thing
he's ever seen he

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:44.770
wants to include in this event.


00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:47.710
And it's simply not feasible.


00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:50.690
So one of, I think,
Eamon's major challenges

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:54.550
is going to be
how he can realize

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:57.510
this incredibly ambitious,
wildly creative,

00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:01.380
idea without going over budget.


00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.590
We cannot accommodate
every request.

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:10.160
There is a lot of contemporary
stuff in the play.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.390
Like there's a lot
of anachronism.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:14.800
That makes me
think-- that I keep

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.890
going, Wait are we in Vietnam?


00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:18.780
I'm pretty sure
we're in Vietnam.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:21.470
And then I'll hit something
else and be like, Wait,

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:23.280
is it the '80s?


00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.800
So what I would
say is, if you're

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:30.920
thinking about re-naming
them, look up common names.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:31.710
EAMON FOLEY: I did.


00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:33.230
I did '50s names last night.


00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:35.870
Where I’m at right
now is Phoebe for Sheila.

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:36.760
I don't know.


00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:37.810
I looked up hippie
names, because I

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:39.810
imagined that her mom was
a little ahead of time

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:41.240
for the '50s.


00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.460
Um, yeah.


00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.670
SUZANNE AGINS: So then I
would look up the hundred least

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:45.630
common names in 1953.


00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:47.090
EAMON FOLEY: Ok,
so that's a good--

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:48.000
SUZANNE AGINS: Do
you know what I mean?

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.410
They don't have to be
the top hundred names,

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:54.300
but they have to exist.


00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:56.170
EAMON FOLEY: Claude and
Sheila has to change.

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:58.630
So I have to find some names.


00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.140
Which is hard because they've
been Claude and Sheila

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.680
for a year now.


00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.200
And so I'm still doing a lot
of rewrites in the script

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:10.100
and I'm working on a
fourth draft right now.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:15.750
[MUSIC PLAYING]


00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:17.670
So this is the
Matthews Acting Studio

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:20.970
in 185 Nassau, the
Lewis Center's building.

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:25.800
And this is my favorite
space on campus.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.130
I'm excited to really
climb around, really

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:29.710
turn it into a jungle gym.


00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:38.310
But keep it in this kind of
shiny, black, sexy, still rock

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:40.230
and roll world.


00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:42.840
And then have the
Vietnam come from that,

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.100
rather than go from the
Vietnam world into the rock

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:45.720
and roll world.


00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.890
And then other cool aspects
that we're looking to do

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:49.590
is, right in the
center of this space

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:52.910
we're looking to
have a fly system.

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:54.560
So then it goes up and down.


00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:57.350
So that way we can connect
other-- when it comes down it's

00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:59.300
easy to connect
other aerial equipment to it.

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:03.090
But also, you run with it
and it just lifts off-- boom

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:04.970
then you're flying
all around space.

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:07.100
And you have this
full circular motion

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.000
without having to
worry about the ground.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.310
You just kind of float.


00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:13.030
There are some points
that exist in this ceiling

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:16.320
already for aerial capabilities
and aerial equipment.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.860
And what I would like-- I don't
know exactly where they are--

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:20.750
but I would like
to have definitely

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:22.430
four points for ropes.


00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:24.610
Like a one, and two,
and a three, and a four.

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:27.810
Kind of like a square
around that center point.

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:31.760 position:97%
 


00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:32.770
Boop, and perfect.


00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:34.230
Yeah why don't you
just try it low.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.650
Then you won't
really go anywhere.

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:38.180 position:97%
 


00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:40.650
So yeah, just feel it out,
how you're going to roll.

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:43.640
One, two, land.


00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:49.980
So the Matthews is not
compatible for aerial dance.

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.930
That is-- and we're
going to work through it.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:55.900
It's a little late in the
game, which is nerve-wracking.

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:56.880
Very nerve-wracking.


00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:59.470
But I kind of have to
change the aerial vision.

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:02.900
So the idea is we're going
to put these trusses in.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:06.560
And they will make
multiple points

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.170
bear the weight of one point.


00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:10.980
So we can actually get
something to hang and swing in,

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:16.950
do gymnastic aerial
acrobatics on them-- whatever

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:18.870
we're calling it today.


00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:21.700
Right now that means reducing
the show to three points.

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.490
And that's fine, I've
figured that out already.

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:33.920
[MUSIC PLAYING]


00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.700
So it's Thursday, March 19.


00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:38.610
I am one month away from tech.


00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:42.570
Well, one less day than
a month away from tech.

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:43.570
Yeah I'm really excited.


00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:44.630
It's been going great so far.


00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:45.560
It's been really, really fun.


00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:46.600
I love being in the room.


00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.170
I love working with these guys.


00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:53.000
What I feel like has to give
is-- it's really time for us

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.760
to become more than a group of
dancers and actors in a room.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.560
It's time for us to
take that next step.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.980
And I feel like we're on the
verge of getting to that very

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:05.430
cohesive place, where we can be
more than Princeton students,

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:06.980
but a squad.


00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.860
An actual squad of Marines.


00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:11.440
And so that's what
this week is about.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.770
So it's spring break right now,
which-- and I called the actors

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:16.160
here, and we have most of them.


00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.190
CLARK GRIFFIN: I think
we need to-- one thing

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:22.330
for me is holding character.


00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.310
I've struggled with
keeping character up

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:26.600
throughout a long
period of time.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:30.310
So being a soldier
throughout the whole thing,

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:32.880
you can't be like, Oh I'm
a soldier, go off stage.

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.320
EAMON FOLEY: Yeah.


00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.230
CLARK GRIFFIN: You can't
get into character,

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:36.330
you have to be the character.


00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.270
EAMON FOLEY: Yeah you have
to live it and figure out

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:38.640
what it is.


00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.050
It's definitely journey,
it's going to take a while.

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:42.270
I understand it's
going to be a process.

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:44.120
And it's a process
that we've kind of

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.260
had to get some
numbers up and running.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.220
But I guess now's the time where
we can really, really let that

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.750
be-- as we choreograph,
let that character be

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.790
in the forefront of the
brain the whole time.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:56.040
CARSON HUGHES: It
is hard to imagine

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.580
in a specific rehearsal,
we're doing this one piece,

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:01.500
but it comes right
after something else,

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.440
and right before something else.


00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.900
Doing that together.


00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:08.420
I think just-- again what Clark
was saying about the acting

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:12.040
characters stuff-- I
think at least some of us

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.850
aren't that familiar with that.


00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:16.740
So that's the scariest part,
the least comfortable part.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:18.200
EAMON FOLEY: These
men were brought

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:22.250
so low so they could take
command out on the field.

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:27.920
They have to be-- you
guys have to be changed.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.960
It's a whole different
thought structure.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.690
And so that's what we're going
to discover during this week.

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:34.280
All right, we're going to
become different people.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.990
When we come into
these dances, we're not

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:37.400
going to be ourselves anymore.


00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.730
We're not going to
be people anymore.

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:39.860
We're going to be soldiers.


00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:41.500
It's a whole different
way of thinking.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.680
So let's start
with some warm-up,

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.430
then we're going to
do some wrestling, OK?

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:52.450
[MUSIC PLAYING]


00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:53.870
So that's what
this week is about.

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:56.390
This week is going to be
us wrestling each other.

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.630
It's going to be running
these rehearsals less

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:02.120
like rushed dance rehearsals--
which kind of just

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.450
has to happen at the school
because everyone's so busy--

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:08.220
but it's going to be
digging into process

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:12.610
and finding a way to actually
do some experimentation

00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:15.510
to figure out how these
boys can emotionally

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:18.320
connect to that idea.


00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:20.360
More than just look great
doing the choreography.

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:20.930
Because they look great.

I'm doing something

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:24.030
to better these recruits.


00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:27.470

to change their lives.

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:40.240
EAMON FOLEY: So we found out
that the set is about at 100%

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.580
over budget.


00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:43.700
I was told to splice it in half.


00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.090
Massive changes have to be made.


00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:51.260
And we are one month til
opening, about one month

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:51.910
and two days.


00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:52.890
It's like the 23rd.


00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:53.920
I have no idea.


00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:58.640
Time is just-- time is flying.


00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.140
I just don't want
to-- I'm not going

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:04.780
to be apologetic for
having big vision.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:08.980
OK, I'm going to write the
conclusion to my thesis

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:12.510
because that is to due tomorrow.


00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:13.760

Most unexpected thing
to happen in rehearsal

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:25.930
so far was the other
day, two days ago,

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:29.680
my lead came into
rehearsal and she told me

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.500
that she had to drop the show.


00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.790
And she told me that she
wasn't going to be able do it.

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:38.360
And this is about a week
and a half before tech.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.310
Two and a 1/2 weeks
before opening.

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:42.020
I mean there was just
a moment of like,

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:47.850
Oh my god I could have to
replace the lead of this show.

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:53.020
And teaching someone how to
do aerial dance in two weeks.

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.250
That could be the
play right now.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.500
KAMBER HART: I was
scared of being

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.440
the weak link in the show.


00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.680
I was also terrified about
getting schoolwork done.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:08.860
My junior paper was due the
Monday before the show opened,

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:10.110
and that was really stressful.


00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:12.860
My adviser had asked
me to start over.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:16.700
I turned into 20 pages and he
was like, We need to start over.

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:21.380
I was like OK, there's not
that much time, but OK.

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:24.560
Eamon caught me in this
moment where I was really

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:25.660
scared academically.


00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:29.280
I was just terrified that I
was going to screw up the show,

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:32.780
and that I was going to screw
up the rest of my academics.

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:34.650
I got in this moment of
panic and I was like,

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:36.780
I don't know what to do.


00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:39.590
And so I just came into
rehearsal 10 minutes early

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:40.790
and just cried.


00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:42.640
He was very calm.


00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.630
He's like, You know what?


00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:48.290
It's a little past the
point where that's possible,

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:50.370
so what are we going
to do to make this OK?

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:54.380
And he worked with me to figure
out a schedule that could

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:57.000
that could let me get
my academic work done.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.390
He was so understanding.


00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:00.140
EAMON FOLEY: That was
a little horrifying,

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:01.920
but we came back
down from that ledge.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:05.340
But gosh, Princeton can
be a stressful place.

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:10.790

tough school to go to.

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.580
What I think is on
the top priority

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:18.770
right now is-- of
my work to do--

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:20.350
is to make sure that
these dancers are

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:21.600
comfortable on this equipment.


00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.340
We just got it in two days ago.


00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:25.180
It all got out for the
first time yesterday.

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:28.020 position:97%
 


00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:32.420
It's a huge new skill
that takes a lot of work.

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:36.410
And they have to get it
show ready in two weeks.

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:37.400
It's asking a lot.


00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.690
Especially when they have so
much other stuff going on.

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:42.310
With that in mind,
it's totally doable.

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:45.970
But what worries me is the stuff
that I don't have control over.

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:48.610
And that's how the
set's going to move,

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:49.940
and how the set's going to work.


00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:51.730
And when we get
that stuff in, is

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:54.900
it going to feed the
choreography in the staging,

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:57.220
and the direction that
we've already done so far.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.220
Or are we going to have
to make massive changes.

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:00.840
I'm down for massive
changes, I just

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.480
want to make sure
it's going to work.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.020
It's not going to be like,
Oh we have to cut this.

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:05.980

Rather than, Oh, let's figure
out creative solutions

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.770
around this problem so we can
still make this moment happen.

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:20.580

show goes, if it worked or not.

that these Vietnam War

to be due on the 13th,
which is in a few days.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:33.960
But honestly, I haven't been
doing that much work on it

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:38.400
for the last few days because
I'm waiting on this experience

that into the thesis itself.

to be fine for that one

thinking what exactly

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.760
do we need to do personally

going and be more intense.

I think we came through and we
achieved that original goal,

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:03.570
which was to do something
so big and so awe-inspiring

think after it's done.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.680
I've gone from the dress
rehearsals have been.

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.220
Just people coming to me
with their mouths open,

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:18.880
and just not the saying
words and walking away.

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:22.440
That is the war, that is--
it is too big to judge.

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:26.260
And too intense for any one man.


00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:29.780
I think we've created that
intensity in the Matthews

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:30.790
Acting Studio,


00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:32.340
which is really cool.


00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:33.210
SUBJECT 7: Now everything
is coming together.

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:35.730
It's just feels so amazing.


00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:37.000
SUBJECT 8: We've all
grown so much from--

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.700
SUBJECT 9: And to
trust dancers as full,

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:43.660
all-around performers--


00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:44.590
SUBJECT 7: Right, and to
trust us with his vision?

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:45.040
SUBJECT 9: That's a lot.


00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:53.250
SUBJECT 7: Yeah. [INAUDIBLE].


00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:55.050
Thank you, it means
so much to him.

00:26:55.050 --> 00:27:00.500
[MUSIC PLAYING]


00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:03.870
STEVIE YANG: I was just really
impressed by-- number one,

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:07.360
all the dancers are amazing, and
their techniques are beautiful

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.910
and all that.


00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:11.630
But more impressively,
I think their emotion

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:14.920
and their acting has just
really blown me away.

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.440
SUBJECT 9: Just two young
men in their physical prime,

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:20.820
lost in the eternal twilight
of the Vietnamese jungle,

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:23.740
huddling together for warmth
on a pitch-black night,

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:26.910
filling hours of silence
with just the sound

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:28.620
of each other's beating hearts.


00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:29.120
[LAUGHTER]


00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.970
Can you handle this, Marines?


00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:31.900
ALL: Sir, yes sir.


00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:32.830
SUBJECT 9: Good.


00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:34.930
I'll see you on the range
tomorrow, bright and early.

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:41.830
PAUL FOLEY: It is a big show.


00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:44.610
This is a full-on real show.


00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:48.300
And I'm so impressed with
the dancers, the singing,

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:51.470
and how he was able to
pull all this together.

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:53.010
ROBIN FOLEY: He's
a professional he's

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:56.760
learned an awful lot
actually fighting

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:59.220
hard to get what he wants, so
he can produce what he wants.

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:03.670
And it's so impressive
on different levels.

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:08.170
SUBJECT 10: Tony Walker, Private
First Class, [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:10.080
SUBJECTS: [INAUDIBLE].


00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:13.520
No one's coming to save you, GI.


00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.350
No one's coming to save you.


00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:18.560
EAMON FOLEY: What I've
learned about myself is that I

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:21.020
can do this in the real world.


00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:23.800
I think I can make theater.


00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:28.550
And I think that I can make
really big, sensory stuff even

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:29.840
in places where people say no.


00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:33.550
I learned that if I
keep up that conviction,

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:36.520
that don't-take-no-for-an-answer
kind of attitude,

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:38.020
then I'm going to get
the quality that I want.

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:42.060
And I think we've gotten
the quality that I want.

00:28:43.060 --> 00:29:45.410
[MUSIC PLAYING]


00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:47.570
What's on the
horizon right now is

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:50.000
I want to get this show into
the hands of professionals.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.960
I want them to see it,
I want to hear feedback,

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:53.000
I want to work on it, I
want to get this show up.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.480
I think the show can't
end right here and now.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:59.690
I think it has to keep going.


00:28:59.690 --> 00:30:01.040
