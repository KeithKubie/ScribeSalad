00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We have one big issue left to resolve,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
which is how do we pick e and d to make this property true?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
For correctness what we need to know is that ed - 1 is equal to Ï†(n),

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and we know since n is the product of the primes p and q

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that this is equal to (p-1)(q-1).

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The quiz is which one of these should be selected randomly--

00:00:25.000 --> 99:59:59.000
either e, d, or it doesn't matter which one?
