00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.447
This is a quiz to get you started with Python.

00:00:03.447 --> 00:00:05.680
We define a function thatâ€™s called sine

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.337
underscore cosine and this function should

00:00:10.337 --> 00:00:15.084
create arrays called X sine underscore X,

00:00:15.084 --> 00:00:19.472
cosine underscore X and fill these arrays with

00:00:19.472 --> 00:00:23.474
values that allow us to eventually plot the

00:00:23.474 --> 00:00:26.743
sine and the cosine curve from X equals zero

00:00:26.743 --> 00:00:29.658
to X equals two pi, exactly two pi.

00:00:29.658 --> 00:00:34.085
Your task is to fill in the code in this loop that

00:00:34.085 --> 00:00:38.563
iterates over fifty points. Make sure that X

00:00:38.563 --> 00:00:43.138
ranges from zero to two pi exactly. Sine X is the

00:00:43.138 --> 00:00:45.506
corresponding sine value,

00:00:45.506 --> 00:00:47.765
cosine X is the corresponding cosine

00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:50.363
value and then the matplotlib

00:00:50.363 --> 00:00:54.363
package will take care of plotting the curves.
