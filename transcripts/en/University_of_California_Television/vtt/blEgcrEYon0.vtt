00:00:00.621 --> 00:00:03.204
(techno sound)

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.053
(techno music)

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.602
- If you ask, how does the brain work

00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:21.000
from an engineering
perspective, then you might ask,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.020
what does the circuit diagram look like?

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.533
After all, if complex modern processors

00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:30.270
are designed and understood by engineers,

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.820
then maybe a simple brain could be

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.550
likewise understood at that level.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.450
So, let's consider exactly
that, a simple processor.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.570
And if you take the lid off, you'll find

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.740
underneath the die, the chip.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.010
Looking at it a little bit closer

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.120
you'll see that it's broken
up into various modules

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.820
for processing, for input
from various sources

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.320
and for outputs, memory and
likewise in the control.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.860
If you'd look at a small
region and zoom in on it

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.860
you'll find it's covered by a
vast mesh of tiny, tiny wires.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.150
This is about maybe a dozen layers thick,

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.790
underneath it all there
are the actual switches,

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.540
the transistors, which
do the switching on this.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.920
Now if you want to make it, you just need

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.620
a few billion dollars, machines like this,

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.690
and, you know, you're good.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.460
If you want to reverse engineer it,

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.050
then maybe you could use
some machines like this

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.090
as one example, which I'll be discussing

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.500
in more detail, called a FIB SEM.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.250
Now, on the other end, here's
another processing unit.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.050
Let's take the cover off and
underneath there's a brain.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.135
And it, too, has various
modules in it, you know,

00:01:52.135 --> 00:01:55.790
optical inputs, they're
called optic lobes,

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.280
antenna inputs for smell, memory units,

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.620
they all have different
names, mushroom bodies,

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.670
ellipsoid bodies, and so
forth, studied by biologists.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.460
So you can also zoom in
and look very carefully

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.830
and presumably there's also going to be

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.750
a vast mesh of wiring in there,

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.460
and somehow buried in
underneath all of that

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.595
should be synapses, which are switching

00:02:19.595 --> 00:02:22.040
between all of these different wires.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.360
Now if you want to make one of these

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.634
you need to invest in an old banana

00:02:26.634 --> 00:02:27.510
(audience laughter)

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.390
and wait, not much cost
and it'll self assemble.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.884
And it's amazing and
you've heard about this,

00:02:34.884 --> 00:02:39.070
you know, in the first talk
and it's truly amazing.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.170
So now if you want to reverse engineer it

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.320
we really need, it's a tough problem

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.510
and we need tools from
across the spectrum,

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.370
from biology, from genetics, and I'll talk

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.220
a little bit of the
aspect that can come in

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.010
from the semiconductor
industry, that FIB SEM.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.328
So just to put a
perspective, let's put some

00:02:57.328 --> 00:03:01.520
dimensions on these and
compare them side by side.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.230
A current processor is sort of a

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.170
flattened structure, two
and a half dimensions,

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.010
but the volume of it
is under a millimeter.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.610
The fruit fly, it's a nice little blob,

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.190
under a millimeter in size, but not

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.200
too different in the volume.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.540
The number of transistors and switches

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.440
in the processor are
actually pretty impressive,

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.350
about a billion transistors nowadays,

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.310
that's a bit more than the fruit fly.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.090
If you go back 10 years, the Pentiums,

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.120
they had about a comparable number.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.300
And the last part now is the wire size

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.859
and the transistor size and the
dendrite size, synapse size,

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:45.859
they're all in the tens
of nanometers, very small.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.096
And the challenge is to bridge the gap

00:03:48.096 --> 00:03:53.096
between the small size
of tens of nanometers

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.140
all the way up to a good
fraction of a millimeter

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.550
and catch that large dynamic range.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.610
So to reliably resolve these transistors,

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.789
in all three dimensions,
we need to sample,

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:07.620
probably instead of 50 nanometers,

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.390
maybe at five or 10 nanometer increments.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.740
These are the voxels that
you'd use to form images,

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.730
and you've seen before
one can sort of collect

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.240
many such images in 3D, form a stack.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.528
But if you just quickly
look at the numbers,

00:04:22.528 --> 00:04:26.310
how many voxels, how
many pixels are there,

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.690
eight nanometers compared
to half a millimeter,

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.030
there are lots, it's a good
fraction of a petabyte.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.540
And if you're acquiring the data at

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.170
a modest rate of a
megahertz, then you'd be

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.320
acquiring data for eight years,

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.360
even for something as
simple as a fruit fly plane.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.440
Now I should also point out we do need

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.770
to really see the connectivity

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.220
one needs to go down to the EM level,

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.450
to the electron microscope level.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.240
Light microscopy cannot
quite resolve the details

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.606
and see the fine connectivity.

00:04:57.606 --> 00:05:00.127
Light microscopy can do many other things,

00:05:00.127 --> 00:05:02.657
image live, so all these techniques

00:05:02.657 --> 00:05:05.790
are very complementary
and support each other.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.340
So, what is this FIB SEM?

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.192
This is basically an instrument

00:05:11.192 --> 00:05:15.000
where you use FIB, which
is a focused ion beam

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.152
and it basically abrades away the surface

00:05:17.152 --> 00:05:19.940
a few nanometers at a time.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.500
The advantage of an ion
beam is the abrasion is

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.915
just a little bit finer, more controlled

00:05:24.915 --> 00:05:27.993
in the Z dimension, otherwise
it's very similar to

00:05:27.993 --> 00:05:30.670
what Mark was talking about earlier,

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.850
the serial block face cutting.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.350
After you abrade, or
remove a little layer,

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:36.890
you image the surface with a scanning

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:41.890
electron beam and then you ablate again.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.500
And you cycle through
this about every minute.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.100
And you keep going and going

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.390
for as long as you possibly can.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.570
And in the end, you gradually
reconstruct a circuit.

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.880
In this case, if you're looking
at a semiconductor chip,

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.610
you can see all the metal layers inside.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.140
If one's looking at a fly brain,

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.202
then you should get a three dimensional

00:06:05.202 --> 00:06:08.870
reconstruction of all the details inside.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.410
So this here is the outline
of one of these synapses,

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:17.240
the black part is actually
the membrane itself.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.170
Ah, and there you can see.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:24.170
So what you saw, you know
time here is moving in in Z.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.720
And you'll see on the
left picture right there

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.370
the dark spots, those are actually

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.540
the synapses, they're pretty small.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.580
And this is a typical fan in circuit,

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.170
there are multiple synapses
going all onto one dendrite.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:43.000
And you see the opposite in
the fly, fan ins, fan outs,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.980
there are just a variety of
structures that are all visible.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.466
It's more complex than it
is for a mammalian brain.

00:06:51.466 --> 00:06:54.900
So we got one of these
machines and started out.

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.984
And so we ran it, three days later

00:06:58.984 --> 00:07:02.620
it came to a grinding halt and stopped.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.780
And so we imaged one one
thousandths of a brain

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.600
and couldn't continue, there are problems.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.381
And so we came to this conclusion.

00:07:11.381 --> 00:07:12.380
(audience laughter)

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.920
FIBSEM's irrelevant because it
can't image anything useful.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.758
I continued to be employed.

00:07:17.758 --> 00:07:18.950
(audience laughter)

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:21.590
And worked on the next problem,

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:23.755
five years of reliability engineering,

00:07:23.755 --> 00:07:28.430
basically to handle all of
these interrupts as they happen.

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.570
Can we anticipate things,
make graceful stops

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:33.730
if something bad is going to happen,

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.320
mitigate damage control and we can

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.759
restart without loss of anything.

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:42.206
The bar is very high
because if you have a gap

00:07:42.206 --> 00:07:46.220
in this dense interconnect of wiring,

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.220
there's no way that you
can connect the wires

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.790
from the left half to the right half

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:52.370
and your circuit diagram is just useless.

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:54.309
So you don't want to be
there, imaging several years

00:07:54.309 --> 00:07:57.080
into the project and then say oops.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.550
So a few years later, here we are,

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:06.190
imaging now for about
a three months project,

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:07.670
that is looking at the optical lobe.

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:09.543
You might have noticed three pieces,

00:08:09.543 --> 00:08:12.750
the medulla, lobular and lobular plate.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:16.620
And this is sort of what
you see inside a fly brain.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.577
This is, the motion you see is, again,

00:08:18.577 --> 00:08:22.030
is moving in Z, deeper and deeper.

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:26.150
Initially the width was about 120 microns,

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.660
it's about the width of two human hairs.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:32.394
And in zooming in about 10x
and we can look at detail

00:08:32.394 --> 00:08:36.900
and for example right
there, that's a synapse.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.742
And it's connecting this dendrite over to

00:08:39.742 --> 00:08:42.656
several other guys on the other side,

00:08:42.656 --> 00:08:44.990
you know, it's all very subtle.

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:49.387
And it's a, you know, it's
a big challenge to try to

00:08:49.387 --> 00:08:53.450
pull all of that information
out and segment it.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:56.610
So it took us three months to image this.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.220
And then we gave it to some other people

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.830
and about three years later
they processed the data.

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:05.288
Processing it and analyzing it

00:09:05.288 --> 00:09:07.920
is by far the bigger challenge.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.820
This is, this is not easy and it requires

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:13.167
a lot of hand effort or did
require a lot of hand effort

00:09:13.167 --> 00:09:18.167
to segment, curate, make sure
there's no mistake in there.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.430
And what we're doing here
is dense segmentation.

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:23.940
We're getting pretty much
all of the processes,

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.980
all of the neurons, identifying them.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:28.905
And then you can pull them out one by one

00:09:28.905 --> 00:09:32.450
and you find that they have
their own unique shapes

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:36.212
and sizes, and compare them to what

00:09:36.212 --> 00:09:38.410
is known from other experiments.

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:42.715
For example, you know,
some of these neurons

00:09:42.715 --> 00:09:45.900
are, you know, this is
coming in from the retina,

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.856
some of them are sensitive
to an on transition

00:09:48.856 --> 00:09:51.575
or to an off transition or to a left

00:09:51.575 --> 00:09:54.897
to right motion or front to back motion

00:09:54.897 --> 00:09:59.897
and people can identify that
based on optical imaging.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.820
But optical imaging can't tell you

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.730
the detailed synaptic connectivity,

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:07.960
but it can give you the classes

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.691
of neurons, so one can connect the two

00:10:09.691 --> 00:10:12.380
and bootstrap our way forward.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:15.130
In addition, optical imaging can look at

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:17.996
live samples, too and
tell which ones are firing

00:10:17.996 --> 00:10:20.510
on on transitions and off transitions

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:22.350
and we can actually monitor that.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:25.020
So all of that data can be put together

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.690
and you can begin to identify the

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:30.500
components of a circuit diagram.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.190
And these are the three major parts

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:34.007
that you saw earlier,
the medulla, the lobular

00:10:34.007 --> 00:10:36.730
and the lobular plate,
up here's the retina.

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:40.950
The thing is with the
FIB SEM it allows you

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.548
to make the last little
connection which is to ask,

00:10:43.548 --> 00:10:47.010
here's one neuron which we know reacts

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:51.630
to a left to right on
transition, what are its inputs?

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.848
And you can define the
neurons that are responsible

00:10:53.848 --> 00:10:56.196
for that, characterize those independently

00:10:56.196 --> 00:10:58.910
and we make this last step.

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:01.570
And then you can begin to
test models of the circuit.

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:06.570
Is this a coincidence detector
based on excitatory inputs,

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:09.674
is it a different version of that,

00:11:09.674 --> 00:11:11.960
a nor detector where you might have

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.430
an inhibitory input on one side?

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:16.470
And it turns out that it's a little bit

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:19.440
of a combination of both
are present in the fly brain

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.740
and you can even sort of get estimates

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.180
of what might be causing the delay

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.620
based on length on the synapse.

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.299
So having this extra level of detail

00:11:27.299 --> 00:11:30.200
helps close a lot of open gaps.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.333
So so far we still haven't
gotten to the full fly brain.

00:11:33.333 --> 00:11:36.001
And we reverted to another technique

00:11:36.001 --> 00:11:39.820
called hot knife sectioning
to get all the way up.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.680
Imagine the fly brain, you chop it up

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.629
into like a loaf of bread
into about 30 pieces

00:11:44.629 --> 00:11:47.420
each about 20 nanometers thick.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:50.550
You put it onto a little laminated surface

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:54.410
and you have about 30 of these tabs

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:56.910
and feed them in to a bunch of machines.

00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:01.800
And this puts us in the
range of getting these,

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.140
this eight FIB SEM year
effort maybe down to

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.890
a little bit more reasonable time.

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:08.917
And we are gearing up and trying to expand

00:12:08.917 --> 00:12:11.840
toward this direction here.

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:15.218
And so far, for the past two years

00:12:15.218 --> 00:12:18.936
we've come just a little
ways along that path.

00:12:18.936 --> 00:12:21.580
Looking in here we have what we've

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.332
accomplished called the hemi brain.

00:12:24.332 --> 00:12:26.510
It aspires to be half a brain but

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:29.430
it's a little bit shy of
it, it's on a female fly.

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:33.300
But it's unilateral
over a good part of it,

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.190
misses some aspects, you know, too much on

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:37.730
the optic lobe, missing the parts below

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:41.320
which are associated with
feeding and appetite.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.830
But a lot of modules are in there,

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:46.406
the central complex, which is a sort of

00:12:46.406 --> 00:12:50.460
an internal compass for the fly

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:53.360
and people are studying
that independently,

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.870
olfactory learning and the mushroom body,

00:12:55.870 --> 00:13:00.170
lateral horns, all these
names are dear to biologists

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:02.660
studying different parts of the fly brain.

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:04.270
And here's what that looks like.

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:05.930
That big round circle, the doughnut

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:07.930
that you saw, that's the ellipsoid body.

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:12.630
And that's associated with its navigation,

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:15.180
sort of an internal compass of the fly.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:18.200
And here we're just sort
of flying through the data

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.260
and you can just sort
of see the complexity,

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.660
here we're getting pretty
close at this resolution,

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.212
it isn't as beautiful as what Mark has

00:13:25.212 --> 00:13:28.450
with the dedicated hi res microscope.

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:32.260
What we're doing right
here, as we fly in and out,

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.860
that's going across that section.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.350
We have to make sure that section has

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:38.403
good enough quality that
we can match the dendrites

00:13:38.403 --> 00:13:42.780
from one side to the other
without loss and that's critical.

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:47.265
And I'll just let this play a little bit.

00:13:47.265 --> 00:13:49.430
(audience laughter)

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:52.890
It's amazing that this thing
self wires and it looks

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:57.510
so disorganized, but in the
end it really is organized.

00:13:57.510 --> 00:13:58.620
And there are the different modules,

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:00.681
we're zooming back out, here you can see

00:14:00.681 --> 00:14:04.480
the whole upper head
of the fly brain there.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.590
Remember these are several slabs

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:07.758
and we're just going to go through

00:14:07.758 --> 00:14:10.260
six of them, we have 13 altogether.

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.650
This represents about two years of imaging

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:16.669
that we've done, we've just
sort of completed this.

00:14:16.669 --> 00:14:19.676
And what will come next after this,

00:14:19.676 --> 00:14:23.340
we want to go over, try
looking at a male fly,

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:27.030
but doing it now in its
entirety, all the way

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:29.450
and that'll be a larger imaging effort.

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:32.765
And here we are back
to the central complex.

00:14:32.765 --> 00:14:35.120
So what's next?

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:38.450
That data is not good enough by itself,

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:42.012
it needs some processing
and it goes off to experts,

00:14:42.012 --> 00:14:46.970
computer science experts
who use neural nets.

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:48.668
And there have been a lot
of fascinating developments

00:14:48.668 --> 00:14:52.980
in the past few years of what they can,

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:54.900
how quickly they can extract it.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:57.020
So they are now maybe at the level where

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.225
instead of taking 10
times longer than imaging,

00:14:59.225 --> 00:15:01.232
they might almost be able to keep up

00:15:01.232 --> 00:15:05.700
and pull out the nerves and
get these connectivity diagrams

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:08.790
of what nerve connects to
what out of the thousands,

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:11.670
hundreds of thousands of
different nerves in there.

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:15.130
And give those to biologists
so that can be correlated

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:17.660
with all of the other
information that they work with.

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:21.130
So I'd like to put this technology,

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:24.230
this FIB SEM, on a
little diagram like this,

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:26.880
just to show where it might
fit in into the world.

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.499
The bottom axis is size, we're looking at

00:15:29.499 --> 00:15:32.200
relatively larger size structures,

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.290
it's getting close to a millimeter,

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:37.780
a little bit below
that, for the fly brain.

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:39.877
And the vertical axis is resolution.

00:15:39.877 --> 00:15:42.660
There's some techniques out
there, as Mark talked about,

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:44.185
which can get much better resolution,

00:15:44.185 --> 00:15:48.128
but the size is going to be
a little bit more limited.

00:15:48.128 --> 00:15:50.530
And we're playing this trade off between

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:53.560
size and resolution
and I think FIB SEM has

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.390
a little bit of a sweet spot and fly brain

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:59.280
sort of demands some of those attributes.

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:03.980
Now the FIB SEM can also be used for,

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:06.835
in a different modality, where you can

00:16:06.835 --> 00:16:09.440
operate it with lower current.

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:12.690
And in there one might be able to image,

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:15.060
let's say a whole cell,
with high resolution.

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:16.490
The whole cell's smaller in volume

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:20.640
with a higher resolution
and images instead of

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.660
being blurry like this,
can be somewhat crisper.

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:27.010
And we can see more detail of the synapse

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:30.480
in the bottom slide over
here, like right down here.

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:33.870
Post synaptic vesicles over here,

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:36.260
individual ribosomes can be imaged

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.690
and at the top we can
even see microtubules.

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:46.130
This is just a random
piece of mammalian cortex.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.290
And one can take out a part of that,

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:51.850
segment it, similar to
what Mark has shown,

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:55.970
and you can get all the
intercellular organelles,

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:59.490
endoplasmic reticula, the mitochondria

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:04.340
and mine it for, you
know, for various details.

00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:06.854
Or at the bottom maybe even
label all the vesicles,

00:17:06.854 --> 00:17:09.630
you know, it's a little
bit up to the biologist

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:11.830
how they begin to mine this kind

00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:14.480
of information, but it is accessible.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.060
So where do we go from here?

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:19.504
I think next, you know, we'll continue

00:17:19.504 --> 00:17:23.480
on trying to acquire the fly brain atlas,

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.630
that's going to be a little
bit of a longer term effort.

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:30.080
And, you know, that'll be then combined

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.731
with all the neural processing,

00:17:32.731 --> 00:17:35.761
you know, to get the synaptic details

00:17:35.761 --> 00:17:39.800
and the connectivity diagram and then

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.650
that'll be absorbed by
other scientists to,

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:45.851
with light imaging and behavior to

00:17:45.851 --> 00:17:48.560
really understand the circuitry.

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.600
I think going on to the
next level beyond that,

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.790
after we have one nice, complete brain,

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:56.080
you begin to look at differences.

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:58.326
And I think this will be
another exciting phase

00:17:58.326 --> 00:18:02.320
for this field, where we look
at fly to fly difference.

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.040
In the semiconductor
industry if you want to do

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.471
failure analysis, you do die to die,

00:18:06.471 --> 00:18:08.430
two computer chips, take two images,

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:10.624
subtract them from another,
if there's a difference

00:18:10.624 --> 00:18:12.950
that's an error, you throw it out,

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:15.330
or you know where the problem is.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:18.410
Here we have to do a
similar version, fly to fly.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.340
And so and the differences could be

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.180
in development stage,
not being overwhelmed

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.920
by all the background,
or is there experience,

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.729
is there a memory, can we pull it out,

00:18:29.729 --> 00:18:33.700
is it going to be represented
in this EM data or not?

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.473
But I think it'll be just,
you know, a fascinating time.

00:18:36.473 --> 00:18:37.451
Thanks for your attention.

00:18:37.451 --> 00:18:39.701
(applause)

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.243
