00:00:00.223 --> 00:00:02.214
And this here is our Delta T,

00:00:02.368 --> 00:00:07.562
over time, for Apple’s stock on May 6, 2010.

00:00:07.731 --> 00:00:10.360
And you’ll find during the day it trades very normally

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.668
and all of a sudden you get this amazing oscillation here

00:00:13.683 --> 00:00:16.204
of the stock first going down and then going up again

00:00:16.467 --> 00:00:19.366
and that is really indicative of something bizarre happening.

00:00:19.541 --> 00:00:21.541
And our statistic would have found it

00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:23.486
and might have saved you some money.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.246
So, that’s my example from financial data.

00:00:27.311 --> 00:00:29.892
In the next few minutes we’re going to pick a different example.
