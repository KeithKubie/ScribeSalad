00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.964
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:07.810
LASSE: Hi, I'm Lasse.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.370
ANDREAS: Hi, I'm Andreas.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.950
LASSE: This is an experiment
called Teachable Machine.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.600
It makes it easier
for anyone to start

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.990
exploring how machine learning
works, live in the browser,

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.960
no coding required.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.530
ANDREAS: Over here is
the input, my camera.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.660
And here are the three classes;
green, purple, and orange.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.240
And over here is the output.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.100
This is where the
machine responds to you.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.580
Right now, it's set to respond
with one of these three gifs.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.850
You can change these gifs
to any gifs you want.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.830
First, I'm going to
teach the green class

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.300
to recognize when I put
my hand up, like this,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.850
and show a cat gif.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.170
I just hold down the green
button for a couple of seconds.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.120
So now it's training
the green class.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.915
And there.

00:00:51.915 --> 00:00:55.200
Now you see that the green bar
is up with high confidence,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.875
and it's showing the cat gif.

00:00:56.875 --> 00:01:00.544
But you'll notice that green
is up no matter what I do.

00:01:00.544 --> 00:01:03.970
If the hand's up or down.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.470
That's because the machine
is looking at my input

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.920
and deciding which class
it's most similar to.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.140
But since I've only
trained one class,

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.930
everything looks most
similar to that one.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.275
That's why I need to
teach it a second class.

00:01:17.275 --> 00:01:20.940
So now, with my hand down,
I'll hold this purple button

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.810
for a couple of seconds.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.680
And it's training
the purple class.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.585
And there.

00:01:27.585 --> 00:01:29.090
Now it's working.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.420
When I put my hand
up, the green class

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.560
triggers with the cat gif.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.350
And when I put my hand
down, the purple class

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.200
triggers with the dog gif.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.730
Up, down, up, and down.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.970
What if I raised my
hand just a little bit?

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.670
It's kind of confused.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.575
The bars are wriggling
around because it's not sure.

00:01:51.575 --> 00:01:55.070
Is it the green class
or the purple class?

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.226
If I raise my
right hand instead,

00:01:58.226 --> 00:01:59.600
you'll see that
the machine still

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.670
recognizes that this is more
similar to the green class,

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.250
which is kind of interesting.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.190
Let me try to train this
orange class with a crazy face,

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.690
like this.

00:02:12.106 --> 00:02:15.680
So now when I make that face,
it should trigger the last bunny

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.180
gif.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.280
It works.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.120
And I can also switch to speech.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.390
Now when my hand is
up, it says hello.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.356
COMPUTER: Hello.

00:02:26.356 --> 00:02:28.480
ANDREAS: And when my hand
is down, it says awesome.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.387
COMPUTER: Awesome.

00:02:29.387 --> 00:02:31.220
ANDREAS: And I can
change these to anything.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.480
Like, oh, cool.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.750
COMPUTER: Hello.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.167
Oh, cool.

00:02:38.167 --> 00:02:40.500
LASSE: The point of all this
is to let you start digging

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.500
into machine learning
in a hands-on way.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.230
Like sometimes, your
machine might not work.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.630
You can learn a lot by
thinking about your examples

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.610
and trying different approaches.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.460
You can even try to confuse
it on purpose, which can

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.060
be a really fun way to learn.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.160
It's built with a library
code, deeplearn.js.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.040
This let you train and run
machine learning models locally

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.430
in the browser, which is what
makes it respond so fast.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.400
And deeplearn.js works
on mobile devices too,

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.310
so you can try this experiment
with the camera on your phone.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.620
You can get the code and
start teaching your machine

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.760
at g.co/teachablemachine.
