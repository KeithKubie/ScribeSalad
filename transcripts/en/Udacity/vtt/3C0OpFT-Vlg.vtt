00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:05.560
If we're going to find a portfolio or an
allocation of assets to different stocks

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.830
that minimizes risk, we have to pause
for a moment and consider what is risk.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.111
Let's consider two stocks, XYZ,
here that's gone up about ten percent,

00:00:17.111 --> 00:00:19.570
but as you can see,
it's been very volatile.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.190
Here's the historical price
of another stock, ABC.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.860
It also went up ten percent over this
same time period, but as you can see,

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.340
it was less volatile.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.230
So it's this volatility that we
use as a measure of risk and

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.030
that is simply the standard deviation
of historical daily returns.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.360
Again, in this case,
risk is measured as volatility or

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.530
standard deviation of
historical daily returns.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.830
That's the standard view of
risk in most finance texts.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.540
There are other ways to view
risk that we touch upon here and

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.140
there through this course but the key
is standard deviation of daily returns.
