00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:02.770
Make a table and solve.

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.060
A biologist is researching the
impact of three different

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.690
water-based sugar drinks on bees
ability to make honey.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.540
He takes 2 liters of Drink A,
which contains 40% sugar.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.490
So let me write this down.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.900
Let me make our table and
then we can solve it.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:27.560
So let's take amount of drink.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.190
And then we'll say
percent sugar.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.760
And then we can say sugar
quantity, so the actual

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.170
physical quantity of sugar.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.490
Maybe I should say sugar amount,
or amount of sugar.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.800
Now this first drink, Drink A,
it says he takes 2 liters of

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.110
Drink A, which contains
40% sugar.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.390
The first column will be which
drink we're talking about, so

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.160
Drink A, he takes
2 liters of it.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.040
It's 40% sugar.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.750
So if we want the actual amount
of sugar in liters, we

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:21.220
just multiply 2 liters times
40%, or times 0.4.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.080
Let me write times with a dot so
you don't think it's an x.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:31.610
2 times 0.4, which is equal
to 0.8 liters of sugar.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.580
So you have 0.8 liters
of sugar.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.810
1.2 liters of I guess the other
stuff in there is water.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.350
But it's 0.8 of the 2 liters
is sugar, which is 40%.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.240
Now,, he adds 1.2 liters
of Drink B.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.860
He finds that bees prefer this
new solution, Drink C.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.150
So when you add these two
together, you end

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.400
up with Drink C.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.350
And we end up with how
much of Drink C?

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.770
2 plus 1.2 is 3.2 liters
of Drink C, which

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.420
has 25% sugar content.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:22.110
So this is 25% sugar, which also
says we know the amount

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.170
of sugar in it.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.600
Because if we have 3.2 liters
of it and it's 25% sugar, or

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.970
it's 1/4 sugar, that means that
we have 0.8 liters of

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:32.670
sugar here.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:39.380
So this is 0.8 liters
of sugar.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.060
Well, that I already wrote
in the column name.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.090
That's the amount of sugar.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.550
It's 25% sugar.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.350
We have 3.2 liters of it.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.760
Now, they want to know what
is the percentage of

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.580
sugar in Drink B?

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.990
So let's just call that x.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.690
So that's right over here.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.030
Now, if it's x percent sugar
here, or this is the decimal

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.970
equivalent, that's x, how
much sugar do we have?

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.770
We have 1.2 liters times the
decimal equivalent of sugar,

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.660
so this is going to
be 1.2 times x.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.790
Now let's think about it.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.560
We have 0.8 liters of sugar in
Drink A, and when you add this

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.550
amount to it, you still have
0.8 liters of actual

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.080
sugar in Drink C.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.980
So this thing has to
be equal to zero.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.250
We could set up an
equation here.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:42.770
We could write 0.8 plus
1.2x is equal to 0.8.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.930
You subtract 0.8 from
both sides.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.000
You get 1.2x is equal to 0. x
has got to be equal to 0.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.570
So this thing right here
has got to be zero.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.280
There's no sugar in Drink B.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.250
It's just got to be
like 1.2 liters.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.170
I guess the solution is water.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.420
So it's 1.2 liters of water.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.670
There's no sugar in Drink B.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.080
It is 0% sugar.
