00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.510
It would take them one and one fifth of an hour or six fifth hours to complete

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.306
that work together. And converting that to minutes, it would take them 72

00:00:08.306 --> 00:00:14.301
minutes total time to complete the work or one hour and 12 minutes. Great work

00:00:14.301 --> 00:00:18.578
if you found these two numbers. We want to take our equation and solve for x.

00:00:18.578 --> 00:00:22.484
We know that this fraction represents the amount of work that they both can

00:00:22.484 --> 00:00:27.486
complete in one hours time. So x represents the amount of time it takes for

00:00:27.486 --> 00:00:32.682
them to do all of that work, or to complete the entire job. So we can solve

00:00:32.682 --> 00:00:37.734
this equation by multiplying through by the LCD, which is 6x. We simply

00:00:37.734 --> 00:00:40.950
multiply these denominators together, since the greatest common factor among

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:49.626
them is one. We simplify this to 3x, this to 2x, and this fraction to the 6. We

00:00:49.626 --> 00:00:53.910
add like terms on the left to get 5x equals 6, and finally we divide both sides

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.756
by 5 to get x equals 6 5th hours. We know 6 5th's hours is the same thing as 1

00:00:59.756 --> 00:01:05.042
hour and 1 5th of an hour. And digging all the way back to fractions in our

00:01:05.042 --> 00:01:09.830
clock, we know 1 fifth of an hour is really 12 minutes. Now, if you didn't know

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.030
this off the top of your head, you could have simply divided 60 minutes, which

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.704
is 1 hour, by 5 to get 12 minutes. We know an hour is 60 minutes. So, all

00:01:17.704 --> 00:01:22.516
together, this would make 72 minutes of time. So this is how we know that the 2

00:01:22.516 --> 00:01:28.649
of you can solve all of the problems in 72 minutes or 6 5ths hours.
