1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,640
I'm a lesbian man.
I'm just looking for gas to peg me.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,060
I bet there's a lot of them that would
want to fuck you just for revenge.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,840
How much of that is a women that,

4
00:00:09,841 --> 00:00:12,360
why is it that the pretty women don't
seem to have any problem with men?

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,050
Like a lot of them are like
pretty easy going about men,

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,110
but if you have bad genetics,

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,720
like if you got dealt
a wrong in the stick,

8
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:25,290
that's that is if there's like people
talk about income inequality in this

9
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:28,050
country and that's definitely a real
thing. But if there's a real thing,

10
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:31,410
it's like who do people want to
fuck inequality in this country?

11
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,140
And that's off the Goddamn charts,
right?

12
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,880
I mean there's just, as men
and as women, we just have to,

13
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,860
we have to understand that some people,

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,280
they have a unearned
tyranny on sexual affection.

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,580
It's unearned. They didn't have to
do anything like these Russian women.

16
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,610
The people aligned to you about, right?
Yeah. You, you meet them and you go,

17
00:00:53,611 --> 00:00:58,611
Jesus is just Russian gladiator
genetics and perfect like model form.

18
00:01:01,231 --> 00:01:04,130
And you're like, Holy Shit, let me
get the fuck out of this room quick.

19
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,970
I was on a cruise one time,
I was married and um,

20
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,940
and I had rented the, like the back
quarter I've ever gone to the same spot.

21
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:19,050
Oprah stays in and it cost a fortune.

22
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,190
And I were out on the deck and,

23
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,900
and there's two big suites in the middle
and another one just like mine at the

24
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:28,080
end, but the one that was in this one,
which was also a real expensive room,

25
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,190
was this Russian dude. And he
was short, got a chunky and bald,

26
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,270
but the girl who was with him was
just a 12 and I knew his second,

27
00:01:39,481 --> 00:01:39,991
I saw her,

28
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:44,610
I was fucked because there's no way
my wife was not going to catch me,

29
00:01:44,611 --> 00:01:48,380
just at least take it away. One little
glimpse at the corner of my eye.

30
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,910
And then she would go, oh
yeah, that's what you want.

31
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:54,910
You'd rather fuck her
than me. And I'm like, no,

32
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:01,450
absolutely not. Absolutely
not. Why would I, why would I,

33
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:06,100
that's outrageous.
What did that Regis assertion?

34
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,730
What an accusation.
Yeah.

35
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,660
If they only knew how vulnerable
we are to a woman like that,

36
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,060
it's like that woman can,

37
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:21,090
there's a lot of people that that woman
can like run their life and they'll meet

38
00:02:21,191 --> 00:02:26,191
a guy who's an accountant who's never
fucked a 12 and they'll start talking to

39
00:02:26,381 --> 00:02:27,790
him and basically,

40
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:32,860
and you can do anything they want to do
as long as they're willing to actually

41
00:02:33,101 --> 00:02:36,970
touch him. As long as they're willing
to stick their fucking beautiful times.

42
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,930
Guy's mouth,

43
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,140
he's helpless to suck on his list and
the grind that pussy against Dick,

44
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,510
he's God has asked.

45
00:02:43,511 --> 00:02:48,310
She later put your finger on the base
of his taints and rub it while you stick

46
00:02:48,311 --> 00:02:50,920
your tongue down his throat,
his dick, as hard as a rock.

47
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,590
These things,
they've never happened to this man.

48
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,450
There goes the neighborhood time
down to jack the car up to the house,

49
00:02:58,451 --> 00:03:02,710
throw the in the fucking dream yard.
Tell the kids, yeah, that's an ice tea.

50
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:06,460
So I really hoped it would
turn out this way. A hood,

51
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,610
ice tea and body count.
Fuck yeah.

52
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:16,790
There's certain women that they
could just run you. Oh, oh, oh.

53
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,680
I know. I know. I know.
I know. I know. I get it.

54
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:26,160
Yeah, man, I get it. I married one of
them. Got To be careful. Just get you,

55
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,140
uh, if you, if you're not, if
you're not, here's the thing.

56
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,180
Yup. How much of that,
like for dudes who you,

57
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,780
there's certain cases where you know,
it's not gonna work. Like God dammit,

58
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,990
this dude, he's like, uh, uh,

59
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:46,650
a small sheep and he married a wolf or
it's just a matter of time before she

60
00:03:46,651 --> 00:03:50,790
fleeces them and gets the fuck out of
dodge and hopefully he'll still be alive,

61
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:53,220
but this is not going to work out well.
We've all seen that before.

62
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,510
Oh, I wish I could tell you this
story. I wish you could too.

63
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,980
Let's shut this fucking podcast
off and resume 10 minutes.
Okay. All right. Let me,

64
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,800
let me tell you this story because
I just don't want to say, man,

65
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,580
it's intertwined with something.
Right, right, right. But it's very,

66
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:12,390
very pertinent Joanna.
Do with that on the legal ramifications.

67
00:04:12,391 --> 00:04:16,770
Can anybody go to jail? No.
Can Anybody get sued? No.

68
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,080
No. I don't think so.
And it's the truth. Okay.

69
00:04:22,081 --> 00:04:26,160
So I've just created a fictional scenario.
Let's call the gentlemen,

70
00:04:26,161 --> 00:04:28,050
what do you want to call
them? Let's let, let,

71
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,830
let's call him Todd Blaker tie.

72
00:04:31,831 --> 00:04:36,500
Bleeker okay, now I can't even do it
this way because I'll get chastised.

73
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,470
I'll get die. I think people would
find out slow down there. Right.

74
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:46,710
I and also I've drunk and I know you
getting drunk on your show and Oh,

75
00:04:46,711 --> 00:04:48,930
it's my fault.
You give me a fucking people on reddit.

76
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:51,490
They had their fingers above the keys.
They were hovering right.

77
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:56,400
Ready to start searching, right? No, there
is no such thing as a guy named Matt.

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,200
And I will not tell you the
story on the same. But anyway,

79
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,990
what was amazing was I saw it
happening in front of me. Yeah.

80
00:05:05,991 --> 00:05:08,670
You know,
his,

81
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,770
his wife was there and they'd been
married for a long time and he didn't look

82
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:17,370
like much. And, and uh, and at all.

83
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,180
And uh,
and,

84
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,640
and there was a kind
of an assistant and uh,

85
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,780
that was ridiculously gorgeous.

86
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,290
And so I just looked at
that and I was like, uh,

87
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,990
you know where this is going.
[inaudible] exactly.

88
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,570
I've seen where I thought
it was going in and uh,

89
00:05:39,571 --> 00:05:42,570
and there was nothing he can do
it. I mean, it was absolutely,

90
00:05:42,571 --> 00:05:43,560
he was completely right.

91
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,310
Just perfect. You know, there was nothing
he could do. He wouldn't give everything.

92
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:52,900
Oh yeah. Like Gary Oldman and Dracula.
Remember that time we would have,

93
00:05:52,901 --> 00:05:55,260
like we'd known the Reiner
was just hypnotized by him.

94
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,430
Ah, she's going to put a shirt
in the middle of the night

95
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,680
and Gary Old Oldman be slithering
into the fucking windows as missed

96
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,670
body heat with the, it's like, oh yeah.

97
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,700
With Kathleen Turner towards the
fucking chair through the window,

98
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,060
drove throw it right in the fucking bat.

99
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,890
He didn't even want to abuse
the door to fuck her. And uh,

100
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:18,640
that was great.

101
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,560
Katherine Turner Back in the Disney
Ah, Woo. People hot as it gets,

102
00:06:23,561 --> 00:06:26,230
as high as she was so sexy.
I mean,

103
00:06:26,231 --> 00:06:29,500
she developed some health problems as
she got older, but when she was young,

104
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,130
Holy Shit. Yeah, it was
amazing. It was champagne.

105
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,283
Yeah,

106
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,260
it was a lot of error.
Feel like rubbing,

107
00:06:37,261 --> 00:06:40,620
went off thinking about me owe
you a few said go ahead and do it.

108
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,120
Nice. Nice reciprocation. Yeah.

109
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,360
It's hard when you watch the guy get
preyed upon when you're watching like a

110
00:06:47,361 --> 00:06:51,410
man's struggle with the fucking spiders
web and you're like, well, hey man,

111
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,540
you know, it'll be fun when she does
fuck you. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Right.

112
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,570
So as long as he could stay
active and get close to her,

113
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,720
don't let it get too much money.
It was careful.

114
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,730
Yeah. It, uh, I know
because, uh, you know the,

115
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:11,890
the, the, I had been around
for a long time and it was
a contract, so, right. Yeah.

116
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,850
So there goes that part of it,

117
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:19,570
but I think the paperwork was fairly solid
in towards the end of like a limit or

118
00:07:19,761 --> 00:07:21,740
whatever. Okay. Now
everybody's going to go,

119
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,690
this is get moving.
Alright.

120
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,510
I knew a guy who was about to marry Gowan
shooting him and he was trying to, uh,

121
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,150
do,
uh,

122
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:34,980
no prenuptial and my friends
were screaming at him like,

123
00:07:34,981 --> 00:07:39,720
what the fuck are you talking about?
And he's like, look man, I don't if it,

124
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,950
if it doesn't work out, I'd like
her to have half and then went. But

125
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,800
it's almost like,
you know,

126
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:50,460
like you wish you had garlic to put
around you right now you're telling Noah

127
00:07:50,461 --> 00:07:51,510
about the flood.

128
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,720
So really two animals and they
both very much and they are ugly.

129
00:07:57,721 --> 00:08:01,830
She's not okay. Understand
this. The world is not fair.

130
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:06,660
The reality of not fair as you made enough
money to attract her, but she's got a,

131
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,620
she's got a web,

132
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:12,660
you might get hooked you Mike and inject
it or you might be able to figure out a

133
00:08:12,661 --> 00:08:17,230
way to keep her nervous.
Right? How you do that, Joe?

134
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,850
Mysterious, Bro. I'm serious.
And I have like a book.

135

You gotta get show powers that they do
of these things. You got to show powers.

138
00:08:32,851 --> 00:08:36,600
They don't have a ton. What are these
things? You have to be different.

139
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:41,650
You have to be able to quote Shakespeare.
Yeah. You gotta be, um, yeah.

140
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,780
You've gotta be willing to give up a lot
of money if you're not going to be dude,

141
00:08:43,781 --> 00:08:44,614
and you got a hot wife,

she gets bored with you fucker trainer,

143
