00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.480
I'd like to hear your thoughts on people entering the military in their thirties

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.650
I'm sure you saw it.
How did they fare?
I don't remember.

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.430
Military at an older age is fine.
You got maturity,
you've got experience,

4
00:00:11.431 --> 00:00:13.800
you've got intelligence and so that's good.

5
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.920
You're going to bring a lot to the table.
However,
you also have maturity,

6
00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:18.180
experience and intelligence,

7
00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:21.870
so the only downfall of it is you got to do some dumb stuff when you're in the

8
00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:23.260
military and and,

9
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.260
and if you're older and you see how dumb some of the stuff that you're doing is,

10
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.240
it's going to be harder for you to do it.

11
00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:33.270
You're going to have a little bit of a negative attitude on if you allow

12
00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:36.360
yourself,
it'd be easy to,
I should say that if you allow yourself,

13
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.180
it'd be easy to develop a negative attitude about that stuff.

14
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.050
I joined when I was 18 years old.
I didn't care.

15
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.540
You want me to do whatever you want me to do?
I'll do it.

16
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.670
I didn't see the stupidity and a lot of the stuff.

17
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.000
And so I think that's the only drawback because you'll just be looking at some

18
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:52.410
of the stuff that you do in the military thinking,
oh,

19
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.080
this is much more efficient way to do this.
And if you let that get to you,

20
00:00:55.081 --> 00:00:59.040
it's going to be problematic.
So going there with an open mind,
do the crap,

21
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.470
the tedious and kind of mindless stuff that you got to do and push through that.

22
00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:06.780
And then you'll get to a position of leadership and you can do your best to

23
00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:09.210
mitigate that and take care of other soldiers,
sailors,
airmen,

24
00:01:09.211 --> 00:01:13.980
and Marines while you're out there serving the country.
So yeah,
it's awesome.

25
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.390
It's great.
You'll,
you'll be a big benefit.
Do you think that,

26
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.220
that even that,
um,
how you're saying like,
okay,
you'll,
you'll,

27
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.550
you kind of look at things in more of an adult way kind of thing where it's
like,

28
00:01:26.551 --> 00:01:27.870
well,
there's more physically to do something.
Like,

29
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.490
do you think that that mindset would kind of keep you from,
uh,
you know,

30
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.940
being more cohesive to with us if you allow it to,
it definitely will.
If you,

31
00:01:35.941 --> 00:01:38.940
if you,
that's why I said you have to allow,
if you just go look,
this is,

32
00:01:38.941 --> 00:01:42.990
this is the way it is right now.
I'm a [inaudible] in the military.

33
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.080
They're telling me to do this thing.
It doesn't make any sense right now.

34
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.370
I'm going to do it to the best of my ability and move forward.
If you say,

35
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.950
Oh this is stupid and you spread the negativity of the other guys,

36
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.270
but why are we doing this?
Students,
yeah,

37
00:01:54.271 --> 00:01:56.670
it's going to be problematic to go in there and have a good attitude.

38
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.520
You can promote really quickly if you're squared away like that,
you know,

39
00:01:59.521 --> 00:02:03.240
so you got a good opportunity ahead of you.
It's,
I think it's totally good to go.

40
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.990
What about even like socially,
you know like kind of like,
oh

41
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.740
these kids are 18 you've been out in the world,
you've had a job,

42
00:02:10.741 --> 00:02:12.990
you probably have a house,
you might have kids.
These kids are,

43
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.910
I was out of high school,
like,
you know what I mean?
It's,
you're not there yet.

44
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.750
You're,
and you think about what,
you know,

45
00:02:21.751 --> 00:02:25.500
when you're that age compared to what,
when you're,
when you're 30,
you know,

46
00:02:25.501 --> 00:02:27.600
my big thing is I tell my kids all the time,
you know,

47
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.880
or like my oldest daughter who's in college and whatnot,
and I'm always like,

48
00:02:32.881 --> 00:02:35.580
when I was your age,
I was in my first seal platoon.
You know,
like,

49
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.550
you just can't even compete with what I was doing with the responsibility that I

50
00:02:40.551 --> 00:02:44.910
had when I was 18 years old.
You know,
all that stuff.
Um,
but,
but the truth is,

51
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.750
when you're 18 you're not as mature as you are when you're 30 so yeah,

52
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.720
there'll be a social disconnect.
Like I went to college when I was,

53
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.090
I think I was 28 or 29 or 30.
And so,
yeah,
I was around kids that were 18,

54
00:02:57.091 --> 00:03:01.270
19 years old.
And I very quickly that,
you know,

55
00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:03.730
you'd meet some mature kids,
but a lot of kids were just,
they were just young,

56
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.020
you know.
I mean there's not a big difference between 18 and 15 for some people.

57
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.410
Right?
Yeah,
it's true.
You think about what you were doing,
you were 15 years old,

58
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:13.420
16 years old.
Like I joined the military.

59
00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:16.570
So luckily I had some kind of structure imposed upon me.
Yeah.

60
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.500
But you think about the kind of stuff that you can do when you're 18 years old,

61
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.930
people do dumb,
dumb,
dumb stuff.
Yeah.
You,
you,

62
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.010
you look back and you're happy that you made it.
Yeah.

63
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.800
Yes.
Cause you do dumb stuff.
Dumb stuff.
No,

64
00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.040
we're talking about wasting your time on youtube videos.

65
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.960
Go waste your time on Youtube.

66
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.400
Like just put in penal teenagers doing dumb stuff and you'll,

67
00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:47.530
you'll say,
wow,
50% of the stuff that you see,

68
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.300
you'll recognize like,
oh yeah,
I remember that.
So yeah,
don't do dumb stuff.

69
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.690
And as a 30 year old in the military you can help give some of that guidance to

70
00:03:55.691 --> 00:03:58.690
people.
So I think it's cool.
Go for it man.
And kind of vice versa.
Right?

71
00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:00.940
Cause like if you're the 18 year old 19 year old guy,

72
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.080
there's like you know a hundred well however many other 1819 year old guys,

73
00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:08.460
you guys are cruising then here comes this 30 year old.
Yeah.
You know,

74
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.870
all levelheaded brought,
I can't relate to this guy,
this guy.
Kind of weird that.

75
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.950
The other thing is when you're 18 you don't even know how much those 30 year

76
00:04:14.951 --> 00:04:15.700
olds,

77
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.800
you just think you have there that you actually think you know more than you're

78
00:04:18.801 --> 00:04:22.600
looking at them like they're idiots.
Why would you not,
you know,

79
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.610
swing off this rope and see if you can get through the window on the third
floor.

80
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.260
Why would you not do that and what exactly.
Yeah,
so that's something I would be,

81
00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:33.580
I would brace yourself for that too.

82
00:04:33.581 --> 00:04:36.720
Remember the perspective of an 18 year old and they're not looking at you going,

83
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.730
gosh,
I'd really like to learn a lot.
They're looking at you like,

84
00:04:39.731 --> 00:04:43.540
I can't believe you're joined the military.
What's wrong with you?
Yeah.
Oh Man.

85
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.900
There is.
There were guys who actually,

86
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.600
they came from the military and still eligible for,

87
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.630
for football in college and one of those $26,000 27 and let's think,

88
00:04:54.401 --> 00:04:59.170
let's face it,
26 27 that's Yo,
that's your physically like you're solid still.

89
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.100
And we looked at them,
it's like,
man,
these are like,
these are old school guys.

90
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.090
One careful with my own practice.
Literally it was like,

91
00:05:07.091 --> 00:05:10.510
I felt like that for one of the guys anyway.
And then you go to class,
right?

92
00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.250
And you get these people who,
you know,

93
00:05:12.251 --> 00:05:15.910
they don't go to college right after high school.
They go,
you know,
later on when,

94
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.180
in my opinion,
when most of us should go,
when you know why you're going.

95
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.920
And so this one lady was in my class,
she was maybe 35 maybe 36 whatever.

96
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.110
[inaudible] look at you with disgust all day long.
No,

97
00:05:26.111 --> 00:05:30.260
she didn't look at me at all.
She just freaking donor on program.
Yeah.
Yeah.

98
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.220
Like I was no factor in her life.
She was doing,
yeah.

99
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.300
Literally the correct way to do it.
She sat up front,
they go weird.
Oh,
you know,

100
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.660
and she's asking questions protocol,
literally.

101
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.700
And that's really the way to go when you think about it.

102
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.640
You don't even have to think about that's the way to go.
But nonetheless,

103
00:05:45.641 --> 00:05:46.181
she's like this,

104
00:05:46.181 --> 00:05:49.960
but she's obviously 30 something years old and it just didn't compute to me.

105
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.770
You know?
Like I was like,
I just didn't get it.
[inaudible] important thing.
Well,

106
00:05:53.771 --> 00:05:57.250
not most,
but that's a really key part of this conversation is when you're eight,

107
00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.220
imagine as a 30 year old.
When you're looking at that 18 year old,

108
00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.930
they don't see it.
I don't understand anything.
Certain things.

109
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.580
So check.
No Sir,

110
00:06:06.581 --> 00:06:09.640
we don't want 18.
