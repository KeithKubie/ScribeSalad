that so that says well I think it's

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400
that so that says well I think it's
 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.399

incredible achievement but also says a

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409
incredible achievement but also says a

have perfectionistic syndrome where I
 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.380
have perfectionistic syndrome where I
work on an article for a year and then I

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390
work on an article for a year and then I
 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.820
work on an article for a year and then I
work on it for another year

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830
work on it for another year

and I know the literature that women are

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380
and I know the literature that women are
 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.560
and I know the literature that women are
more likely to do that perfectionistic

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570
more likely to do that perfectionistic
 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.080
more likely to do that perfectionistic

syndrome is linked to being worried
 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.560
syndrome is linked to being worried
about being stereotyped I make lots of

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570
about being stereotyped I make lots of
 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.380
about being stereotyped I make lots of
decisions where where I I think very

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390
decisions where where I I think very
 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.910
decisions where where I I think very
carefully about how I am perceived by by

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920
carefully about how I am perceived by by
 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.800

others and
 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.020
others and
often times I'll be and say a faculty

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030
often times I'll be and say a faculty
 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.880
often times I'll be and say a faculty
meeting or even when I'm talking to

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890
meeting or even when I'm talking to
 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.260
meeting or even when I'm talking to
companies and senior leaders and I'm

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270
companies and senior leaders and I'm
 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.030
companies and senior leaders and I'm
like well how many comments should I

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040
like well how many comments should I
 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.190
like well how many comments should I
make about race versus gender versus

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200
make about race versus gender versus
 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.770
make about race versus gender versus
religion like am I being seen as to this

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780
religion like am I being seen as to this
 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.600
religion like am I being seen as to this
or true that so I worry about these

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610
or true that so I worry about these
 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.059
or true that so I worry about these
things all the time but a couple things

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069
things all the time but a couple things
 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.050
things all the time but a couple things
I know to be true

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060
I know to be true
 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.650
I know to be true
one is that when you take calculated

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660
one is that when you take calculated
 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.229
one is that when you take calculated
risks you know and you to put yourself a

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239
risks you know and you to put yourself a
 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.270
risks you know and you to put yourself a
little bit out there almost always

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280
little bit out there almost always
 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.180
little bit out there almost always
something amazing happens and so that is

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190
something amazing happens and so that is
 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.940
something amazing happens and so that is
one thing that that I've learned - I

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950
one thing that that I've learned - I
 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.449
one thing that that I've learned - I
really believe that the whole diversity

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459
really believe that the whole diversity
 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.020
really believe that the whole diversity
and inclusion architecture people don't

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030
and inclusion architecture people don't
 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.000
and inclusion architecture people don't
understand the underlying science and

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010
understand the underlying science and
 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.280
understand the underlying science and
when they understand that it's not about

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290
when they understand that it's not about
 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.380
when they understand that it's not about
bad people doing bad things but about

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390
bad people doing bad things but about
 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.210
bad people doing bad things but about
the structural differences it sort of

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220
the structural differences it sort of
 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.900
the structural differences it sort of
gives me hope and and that helps me take

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910
gives me hope and and that helps me take
 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.380
gives me hope and and that helps me take
these calculated risks and I think the

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390
these calculated risks and I think the
 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.140
these calculated risks and I think the
third thing is just me personally

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150
third thing is just me personally
 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.850
third thing is just me personally

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650
tenured in the sciences has got to be
 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.800
tenured in the sciences has got to be
really good you know this has to be like

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810
really good you know this has to be like
 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.050

understand that that's coming partly

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040
understand that that's coming partly
 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.069
understand that that's coming partly
from an environment where there's lots

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079
from an environment where there's lots
 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.960
from an environment where there's lots
of stereotypes and just knowing that

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970
of stereotypes and just knowing that
 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.720
of stereotypes and just knowing that
sort of helps me kind of take a little

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730
sort of helps me kind of take a little
 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.430
sort of helps me kind of take a little
bit off in terms of the anxiety but it's

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440
bit off in terms of the anxiety but it's
 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.930
bit off in terms of the anxiety but it's
something that I still work through

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940
something that I still work through

it even worse yeah
 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.420
it even worse yeah
because I think when you're the only

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430
because I think when you're the only

about I used to ask people for feedback

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570
about I used to ask people for feedback
 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.900
about I used to ask people for feedback
constantly and I would go find the

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910
constantly and I would go find the
 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.300
constantly and I would go find the
person who I knew was gonna be the most

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310
person who I knew was gonna be the most
 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.370
person who I knew was gonna be the most
critical and I would say tell me about

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380

my work even though I was really careful
so fast forward I've done research over

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:08.200
so fast forward I've done research over
 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.950
so fast forward I've done research over
the past 15 years showing that people

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960
the past 15 years showing that people
 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.020
the past 15 years showing that people
with some kind of outsider status are

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030
with some kind of outsider status are
 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.050
with some kind of outsider status are
less likely to receive informal feedback

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060
less likely to receive informal feedback
 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.680
less likely to receive informal feedback
so everyone receives formal which is you

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.690
so everyone receives formal which is you
 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.390
so everyone receives formal which is you

crew your mid-year review but the
 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.300
crew your mid-year review but the
watercooler feedback which is a really

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310
watercooler feedback which is a really
 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.100
watercooler feedback which is a really
matter which is what really matters like

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110
matter which is what really matters like
 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.290

ok I think that you should be doing this

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.300
ok I think that you should be doing this
 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.030
ok I think that you should be doing this
or hey have you thought about this or

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.040
or hey have you thought about this or
 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.040
or hey have you thought about this or
hey this new something or other came out

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.050
hey this new something or other came out
 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.780
hey this new something or other came out
and you

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:35.790
and you
 

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.000
and you
hey you probably didn't pull it together

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.010
hey you probably didn't pull it together
 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:39.770
hey you probably didn't pull it together
the way you should have but you know

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:39.780
the way you should have but you know
 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.620
the way you should have but you know
come back the next day that informal

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:42.630
come back the next day that informal
 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.810
come back the next day that informal
feedback is really what sort of pushes

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:44.820
feedback is really what sort of pushes
 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.360
feedback is really what sort of pushes
people in one in one direction or

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:47.370
people in one in one direction or
 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:47.810
people in one in one direction or
another

another
 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.640
another
and so there there are all of these

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:49.650
and so there there are all of these
 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.040
and so there there are all of these
subtle so the way I always think about

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.050
subtle so the way I always think about
 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.080
subtle so the way I always think about
it is what is the structure of the

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:54.090
it is what is the structure of the
 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.070
it is what is the structure of the
company that either gives rise or

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.080
company that either gives rise or
 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.450
company that either gives rise or
facilitates stereotypes in really

00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460
facilitates stereotypes in really
 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.320
facilitates stereotypes in really
unconscious ways or what is the company

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:03.330
unconscious ways or what is the company
 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.050
unconscious ways or what is the company
doing to mitigate those stereotypes and

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:06.060
doing to mitigate those stereotypes and
 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.370
doing to mitigate those stereotypes and
that is all at a very unconscious level

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:09.380
that is all at a very unconscious level
 

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:17.350
