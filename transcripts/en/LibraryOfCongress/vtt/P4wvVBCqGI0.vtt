Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.440
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus:
Good morning.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.750
I'm Stephanie Marcus from
the science, technology

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.380
and business division, and
we host this lecture series

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.680
with NASA Goddard 12 years now.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.140
So it's really awesome.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.480
We've had some wonderful
programs, and you're welcome

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.780
to catch the old
ones on our website.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.080
We have them all up there,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.310
and they are quite
a range of topics.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.160
We try to do both space
sciences and earth sciences,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.280
and sometimes we had a
harder time getting the earth

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.580
science people.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.340
So we had our hydrology
person recently,

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.700
and today we have our atmosphere
person, and I think all

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.750
of us get very upset if GPS
isn't working, or our computers

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.790
or whatever depends on
satellites and things,

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.870
where the weather in the upper
atmosphere can really give us a

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.170
hard time.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.640
So today we're going
to hear about that.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.070
NASA has two new missions
to study the ionosphere,

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.950
upper atmosphere, and
we're very lucky today

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.950
to have Dr. Sarah Jones
from Goddard speak to us.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.120
I'm not going to try to say
what she's going to talk about,

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.230
because I have trouble
understanding it.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.690
I thought I knew the air,
and space, and all that,

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.370
but there's a lot more to it.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.590
Doctor Jones is from Vermont,

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.190
and she did her physics
studies at Dartmouth.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.300
I see my former supervisor
Connie is here.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.630
She's from New Hampshire, so she
was really wanting to hear this,

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.800
and also, she got
her PhD in physics

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.150
from the University
of New Hampshire.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.620
So I'm not going to
say anything more.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.010
Let's hear about up there.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.810
Thank you.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.460
[ Applause ]

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.010
&gt;&gt; Sarah Jones: Thanks
very much, Stephanie,

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.540
and thanks for inviting me here
at the Library of Congress.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.530
I think this is an awesome
series of lectures here.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.400
At NASA, we get really excited
to come out and tell people

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.310
about the great work
that we're doing.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.680
At least we think it's great,
and hopefully you will, too.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.310
So today, we're going to
talk about the science

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.680
of the upper atmosphere,

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.280
by which I mean essentially
the boundary

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.040
between Earth and space.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.300
And so the atmosphere that we
breathe here below thins out

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.340
and kind of goes out into
the vastness of space,

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.580
and we're going to
talk about this region

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.190
where the particles are
getting really thin,

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.120
and some of them are charged.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.050
Stephanie mentioned the
ionosphere, and this is a region

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.350
that is going to be studied

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.760
by two new NASA missions
called Gold and Icon.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.590
So NASA divides its science
into four different categories.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.080
There's a lot of
overlap between them.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.320
There's astrophysics, earth
science, planetary science,

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.080
and heliophysics, where I work,
which is basically a study

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.880
of the sun itself and then
the effects of the sun

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.960
on everything else -- the Earth,
the rest of the solar system.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.840
And so we're studying in my
group the upper atmosphere

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.380
and the effects of the
sun on the atmosphere,

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.420
which can be considered
space weather.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.800
Now in heliophysics,
we have a whole fleet

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.840
of missions studying
different pieces

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.870
of the scientific puzzle all
throughout what's called the

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.650
heliosphere, which
is this region

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.540
of the universe that's
affected directly by the sun.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.860
We have the Voyager
satellites that are basically

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.390
at that very boundary, the
edge of the sun's influence

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.600
over the universe,
and it's color-coded,

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.840
where the orange missions
are missions that are

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.810
in implementation, which means
they've either just launched

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.170
and they're going through
their commissioning phase,

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.740
or they're going to launch soon,
and so I wanted to pause here

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.940
and give a shout out to
the Parker Solar Probe,

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.530
which here is called
Solar Probe Plus.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.820
It's been renamed
after Eugene Parker,

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.090
who's a famous solar physicist,

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.890
and some of you may
have got this handout

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.620
which NASA is calling solar
pizza, and it tells you

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.680
about how Parker Solar Probe
is going to be the mission

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.260
that comes closer to the
sun than ever before,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.240
basically touching the sun.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.220
So if you think about
the sun being --

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.430
let's say if it was 75
feet away from the Earth.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.160
Parker Solar Probe would be
three feet away from the sun.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.560
It's really close to the sun,

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.390
and it's about 2,500
degrees Fahrenheit

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.350
where it will be coming
closest to the sun,

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.610
and so this is a mission that's
been dreamed about for decades,

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.440
and we haven't been able to do
it, because that's really hot,

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.220
and the satellite would
have melted, but by now,

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.750
engineering technology
has come to the point

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.120
where materials could
be developed to shield

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.560
that spacecraft so that
it won't be destroyed.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.330
So that launches
at the end of July,

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.770
and my colleague Doctor Alex
Young will be here in December

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.790
to talk to you all about
Parker Solar Probe.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.860
Today we're going to
talk about Gold and Icon.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.390
Gold is a mission that consists

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.250
of a camera that's
called a hosted payload,

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.620
because it's actually
riding on a satellite

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.130
that is not a government
satellite.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.180
It's owned by a commercial
company,

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.840
and so we're renting
a space and a downlink

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.880
for data from this satellite.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.290
It's something new that NASA
hasn't really done before,

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:37.030
and it's a way to get your
instruments into space

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.910
and spend less money doing
it, especially if you're going

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.660
to a place like geostationary
orbit, where Gold had to go

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:44.960
to make its measurements.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.100
So Gold launched in January,
January 24th of this year.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.730
The satellite is operated
by SES Government Solutions.

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.420
It's called SES-14.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.170
You can look it up on
the internet if you'd

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.640
like more information,
and since then,

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.790
the satellite has been
slowly making its way

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.030
up to what we call
geostationary orbit,

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.620
which is a location 22,000
miles above the Earth,

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:15.360
and it will park there and sit
there while the Gold camera

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.840
looks down at the Earth
and takes pictures

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.920
of what's going on below.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.270
This mission is led by
University of Central Florida,

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.920
and the principal
investigator is Dr. Richard East

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.820
at the Laboratory
for Atmospheric

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.930
and Space Physics in Colorado.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.180
The other new mission to study
the upper atmosphere is called

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.480
ICON, Ionospheric Connection
Explorer, and it launches

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.700
in one week, next Thursday,
and it's going to launch

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.170
into low Earth orbit,
which is the type of orbit

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.180
that the International
Space Station is in,

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.080
so it will be flying
directly through this region

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.340
of the upper atmosphere that
we'll be talking about today,

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.880
and it's going to study --

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.130
essentially, its
primary mission is

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:58.680
to study how this
region changes,

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.210
this upper atmosphere
changes, in response to weather

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.860
that we're experiencing
down below.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.740
So this is a picture
of the atmosphere.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:10.040
This is the stratosphere, right.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.370
This is where our airplanes
fly and where we have clouds,

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.630
and then it fades out
into the upper atmosphere

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.280
that I'm talking about, and
the region we're talking

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.880
about today starts
about 60 miles above us

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.510
and then extends
outward into space.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:28.420
So it's essentially the boundary
between Earth and space,

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.700
and you can think of the gas
up here as just an extension

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.240
of the air that we
breathe below.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.870
It consists of oxygen, nitrogen,
different types of gas.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:41.190
It's much thinner
than it is here below.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:42.820
Think of going up
to Mount Everest.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.140
The air gets pretty thin, right?

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:49.770
At 60 miles, it's a whole
lot thinner, and it moves.

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:51.070
It has temperature.

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:54.440
The gas has temperature
and responds to pressure,

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.840
and there's a wind up
there, just like there is

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:02.280
down here below, and so we see
changes on long-term scales,

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:07.020
weeks and months, which are like
climate type changes down here,

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:10.460
and we also see changes on
the order of hours or days,

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.950
more like the weather patterns
that we see down here below.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:18.110
Now most of the gas up
there is like the air

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:19.430
that we breathe below.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.200
However, when the
sunlight comes down

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.600
and bombards the atmosphere,

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.310
some of that neutral gas gets
ripped apart into electrons

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:31.940
and ions and it becomes
electrically charged,

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:36.070
and so these ions,
this small population

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:39.850
of ions is appropriately
named the ionosphere,

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:43.660
and the ionosphere and the
neutral upper atmosphere are

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:47.190
in the same region of
space, this 60-ish miles

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:50.580
above our heads,
interacting with each other.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:56.850
And this breaking apart of
the gas that's up there is one

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:59.450
of the ways, actually, that
the atmosphere protects us

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:03.040
from getting too much UV light.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.450
So I wanted to show a video,
an animation that was created

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:10.560
by NASA to take us on a
tour of the ionosphere.

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:19.460

&gt;&gt; Wanting for more space,
open skies, and exotic travel?

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:27.580
Then look up, about 30
to 60 miles straight up,

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.900
at the ionosphere,
Earth's interface to space.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:35.130
Nestled far above the clouds
but below outer space,

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.490
this little-understood
destination invites you

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:40.100
to explore its many features.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.870
Experience both the
weather from Earth

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.570
and the weather from space.

Marvel at the ballet of radio
waves and navigation signals,

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:51.270
like GPS, leaping through
this particle paradise.

00:09:51.270 --> 00:10:00.050
Sit back, relax, and take in
the aurora, some satellites, --

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:04.010

Space Station as they sail by,

and you'll want your
camera handy for one

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:15.630
of the region's signature
features,

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:18.630
bright and colorful air glow.

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:20.580
This daily show is made possible

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:25.630
by the ionosphere's own
swarming charged particles,

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:29.180
because that's what
the ionosphere is.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:30.670
It's all charged particles.

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:32.560
During the day, enjoy the sea

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.800
of particles freshly
energized by the sun.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.780
As the sun sets, this
particle party relaxes

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:41.650
and the air glow thins.

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:45.410
Our quieter night life lets
you gaze into clear skies.

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:50.520
The ionosphere is
in constant motion,

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:55.200
an amazing effect
of space weather.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.580
Don't miss when solar
storms rain down.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:00.880
The storm separates the
particles even more,

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:08.350
making this colorful region
delightfully more dense

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:15.300
in some places and
stunningly sparse in others.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:20.490
And don't forget about
storms from Earth below.

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:25.200
Your weather from back
home also stirs up this one

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.870
of a kind destination.

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:35.520
Experience the unique
beauty of every season,

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.990
as changes in Earth's
atmosphere daily

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:38.390
and annually can
create pressure waves,

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:39.690
changing the ionosphere's
shape and density.

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:40.990
Venture to the equator,

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:42.290
where ion particles are
packed in lush and thick.

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:43.590
Cruise along a magnetic
field line

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:44.890
and see how the ionosphere's
charged material also interacts

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:46.190
with Earth's own magnetic field.

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:47.490
Don't miss the superhighway of
particles zipping out to space

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:48.790
and back down to the planet.

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:50.090
This unpredictable array

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:51.390
of charged particles can
help you unplug and unwind.

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:52.690
This is because the crowd of
particles can garble the radio

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:53.990
and satellite communications
from home.

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:55.290
The ionosphere welcomes
you to discover more

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:56.590
about this little-known region.

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:57.890
After all, once you've explored
this interface to space,

00:11:57.890 --> 00:11:59.690
who knows how much farther
you'll be able to go?

[ Beeping Sound ]

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:16.870
&gt;&gt; Sarah Jones: So you saw
in the video a little bit

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.570
about how dynamic
the ionosphere is.

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:22.450
Because those particles are
charged, they respond directly

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.390
to magnetic and electric fields
that are in the atmosphere

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:29.530
and are moved around by them,
and so you can get changes

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:32.410
in the very shape of the
ionosphere on a time scale

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:35.290
of hours, and then you
have longer term changes,

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:39.320
like annual changes, that
were mentioned in the video.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:43.720
Now the ionosphere is also the
region where radio waves have

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.460
to propagate through from
our satellites to the ground

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:51.890
for things like GPS, and we use
it for other purposes as well.

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:55.460
For example, when you're doing
long-range communications

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:59.610
from the ground, your AM radio
station can send your signals up

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:02.150
and actually bounce them
off of the ionosphere

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:05.310
to send the signal further than
it would have gone otherwise.

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:10.180
But when we get dynamic
space weather, as it's called

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:12.400
when the radiation from
the sun is changing,

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.180
it's becoming more intense,

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.160
there are things
called storms happening,

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.570
there can be structures
in the ionosphere

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:23.010
that can then garble
the signals.

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:24.520
[ Music ]

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:25.820
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:29.170
We don't need to see that again.

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:35.080
And so the ionosphere can
actually cause problems

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:38.640
with long-range communications
via radio waves,

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.900
and it can also garble some
signals from satellites --

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.950
for example, GPS -- and then

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:49.080
that can cause usually very
small errors in GPS locations,

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.890
which are important more
for technologies that are

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:55.960
on the horizon, like
self-driving cars, but also,

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:59.730
GPS is being used for some
creative applications,

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:02.710
like sending out
plough trucks unmanned

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:05.920
so that they can clear ice and
snow off of dangerous roads,

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.450
or also for agricultural
purposes,

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:11.720
so that you can have
unmanned vehicles

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.030
that are gathering crops,
and so this is important

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:18.150
for those types of applications.

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.770
In addition to that,
the charging

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:24.730
of the atmosphere has effects
on power lines down below.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.570
It causes what's called
geomagnetically induced

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:29.810
currents, which usually
aren't a problem,

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:34.250
but in rare cases can actually
do some damage to transformers,

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:37.660
and so power companies are
really interested in learning

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:42.860
about this process so that they
can better protect their assets

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.880
and prevent problems.

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:49.980
So these are some of the
reasons why it's important

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:52.460
to understand the ionosphere.

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:53.760
It's also important

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.240
to understand the neutral
part of the atmosphere.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.730
Remember that's the
bulk of the particles,

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:01.860
and your satellites
are flying through,

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.800
ploughing through these
particles as they move

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.800
through low Earth
orbit like Icon will,

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:09.400
like the International Space
Station does, and if you think

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.930
about driving a car,
right, ideally,

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:15.050
you want a very aerodynamic
design for your car,

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:17.480
because whether you can see
it or not, you're driving

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:21.040
through the air, and you want it
to be deflected around your car.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.100
If you have a boxy car,
you're going to use more gas.

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.380
It's going to pull
back on your car.

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.630
Well, the same thing happens
with satellites in space.

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:34.100
The air is much thinner, but it
still pulls on the satellite,

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.590
and what that does to a
satellite is over time,

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:40.500
the satellite actually loses a
little bit of altitude steadily,

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:44.480
and you either have to use
some sort of act of propulsion

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.240
to bump it back up like they do

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:49.280
on the International Space
Station, or eventually,

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.820
it gets to a low enough altitude

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:55.700
where it actually re-enters the
Earth's atmosphere and burns up.

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.350
Most of it burns up.

00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:03.240
And there is a recent example
I don't know if any of you saw

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.880
of a Chinese space station

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.350
that was re-entering
the Earth's atmosphere.

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:10.220
Most of it did burn up,
and then pieces of it fell

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.880
into the Pacific Ocean.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.760
But understanding when and
where these satellites are going

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:20.410
to go requires knowing
the density of the gas

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:23.180
up in the upper atmosphere,
how much is there,

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.710
what is the composition
of the gas,

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:33.950
and there was a well-publicized
event in 1979, when Skylab,

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:39.200
which was the American space
station, re-entered much earlier

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.210
than had originally
been predicted.

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:44.450
It was predicted
before it happened.

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:47.950
The engineers were updating
their predictions over time,

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:50.680
but it was earlier than
their initial prediction,

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.270
because during the time
that Skylab was up,

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:56.310
the sun was actually putting
out a lot more radiation

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:59.950
than anyone had expected,
and when that happens,

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:03.840
the atmosphere receives all
this energy and gets heated,

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.880
and the particles
actually expand,

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:09.030
and so you get gas
coming from down below.

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.970
Now it's up at a
higher altitude.

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:13.140
Now you have a lot more
gas that you're having

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:17.280
to move the satellite through,
and it loses orbit faster.

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:21.350
And so I don't know
if anyone knows this,

00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:24.260
but as I was reading this
article from CBS News,

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.840
I found out that when
Skylab did come down,

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.120
pieces of it came
down in Australia.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:34.660
The Australian government fined
the US 400 Australian dollars

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:36.460
for littering.

haven't paid it, but --

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:44.880
[ Laughter ]

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:49.490
Okay, and so this is
one important reason

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:54.410
for just knowing how much gas
is there and when is it going

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:56.960
to be more dense
than it was before,

00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:00.330
how is this region responding
to the sun's radiation,

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:02.520
which then also requires
a better understanding

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.840
of what the sun is putting out,

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:07.350
which is why we need
missions like Parker.

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:08.650
Another reason, though, is

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:10.480
that we're not just
tracking satellites.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:16.370
At this point, there's a lot
of debris orbiting in space.

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:21.560
One example is a problem
that happened in 2009.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.650
Two satellites crashed into
each other and smashing

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:27.350
into little pieces,
and there was a bit

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:29.970
of a concern for a while.

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:33.950
Engineers went and rushed to
make the calculations to see

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:36.540
if there was a chance that
the debris would come near the

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.710
International Space Station,

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:42.220
because when debris strikes the
space station or a satellite,

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:45.440
it can do damage, or in that
case, even endanger the lives

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.200
of the astronauts, and
fortunately, in this case,

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:52.710
it was okay, but making those
predictions is really dependent

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:57.790
on knowing the shape and
the density of the gas

00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:00.090
in that upper atmosphere.

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:08.910
And so we really do need to know
both how the ionosphere works,

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:12.440
and how the neutral atmosphere
works, and how they push on

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.700
and change each other so that
we can understand what we need

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:18.410
to know for our technologies,

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:22.410
and one way that we can measure
what's going on up there is

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:27.570
to measure actually the glow
that comes from these particles.

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:31.180
They would be invisible, except
there's a process called airglow

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:33.950
which makes it so that we can
take pictures of the shape

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:36.250
of the upper atmosphere,
pictures of the shape

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:38.460
of the boundary between
Earth and space,

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:43.570

to you a little bit
more about air glow.

never truly dark.

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:59.470
If you removed light pollution,
the moon, stars, and galaxies,

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:00.770
there would still be --

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:02.070
-- a very faint, colorful glow.

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:03.370
That's airglow.

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:05.460
With cameras, you can
photograph it only

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:08.140
on the darkest of nights.

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:09.490
It's about one-tenth as bright

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:11.580
as the combined light
of all the stars.

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:16.520
From above, it forms a luminous
bubble encapsulating Earth.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:20.060
Appearing right at the interface
to space, airglow holds clues

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:23.130
to how our atmosphere
affects weather and space

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:26.330
and how space weather
affects humans on Earth.

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:32.080
The balance of light
spans 60 to 400 miles

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:37.910
above the Earth's surface.

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:40.970
In the uppermost boundary of the
atmosphere is the ionosphere.

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:43.500
This is where our GPS
signals and astronauts travel.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:47.770
What makes this region
complicated is

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:50.120
that it's constantly changing.

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:56.140
It reacts to both energy
emanating from the sun

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:57.440
and weather near
Earth's surface,

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.150
and as the ionosphere
fluctuates, so can conditions

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:01.450
in near Earth space, where
the space station lies.

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:02.750
But spotting changes in
the ionosphere is a lot

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:04.050
like trying to watch the wind.

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:05.350
You need a marker of some kind

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:06.650
to see the invisible
particles move past,

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:08.950
and for that, we have airglow.

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:17.010
&gt;&gt; Sarah Jones: So you just
saw some pictures of airglow.

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:19.780
You can see how it looks
pretty structured sometimes.

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:26.810
In addition to breaking apart
neutral gas in the atmosphere,

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:29.370
when sunlight hits
the atmosphere,

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:32.460
it also causes the ions
of the ionosphere as well

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:34.720
as the neutral gas
to give off light.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.750
It glows in a variety
of different colors all

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:41.520
across the spectrum of
light, from near infrared,

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:45.180
through visible light, up into
the ultraviolet, which is light

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:47.730
that we can't see
with our human eyes,

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:53.160
and it's a really useful tool
for us in studying this region,

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:57.540
because actually, by measuring
the light that's coming off

00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:59.510
of the atmosphere,
you can determine

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:02.190
to some extent the
composition of the atmosphere,

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:04.010
because different
types of gas --

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:05.780
for example, oxygen
and nitrogen --

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:08.850
will give off different
colors of airglow.

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:13.470
Also, in terms of measuring
density and temperature,

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:17.010
you can calculate that from
measurements of how bright

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:20.420
to air glow is, and you
can even measure the motion

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:22.790
of the particles from
Doppler shifts in the light

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:24.090
that you're measuring.

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:26.180
So it's an extremely
powerful tool

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:32.990
for understanding this region,
and this region, this transition

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:35.460
between the Earth's
atmosphere and space,

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:38.380
it's really interesting,
because you've got these ionized

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:42.250
particles moving in response to
magnetic and electric fields,

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:45.090
and then you've got the ions
and the neutrals both moving

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:48.110
in response to pressure
gradients

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:53.100
and temperature differences,
much like the weather fronts

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:55.960
that we have here, down
in the lower atmosphere.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:59.410
And so the neutral
gas responding mostly

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:02.840
to the pressure and temperature
has itself a temperature

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.720
of about 1,000 degrees
Fahrenheit.

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.110
It's pretty hot.

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:08.850
The ions, actually,

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:12.390
the ionosphere has a temperature
that's a bit hotter than that,

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:15.300
and if we could be transported
and we could take a trip

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:19.820
up to the ionosphere, we would
actually feel a really strange

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:23.130
sensation of having
two winds at once,

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:26.470
two different temperatures,
two different directions,

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:32.450
one denser than the other.

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:34.000
It's trying to restart again.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.300
Sorry.

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:46.570
&gt;&gt; The night --

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:50.090
&gt;&gt; Okay. All right.

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:54.500
So for a long time,
scientists thought

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:57.370
that this upper atmosphere
responded primarily

00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:00.020
to what's coming at us
from the sun and that

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.080
that was pretty much
the only impact,

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.160
and it certainly
does have an impact.

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.820
When extreme ultraviolet
light comes from the sun

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:10.190
into the atmosphere, it
heats up different parts

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:13.900
of the atmosphere, in particular
the stratosphere down below,

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:17.290
which can then cause what
are called atmospheric tides

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:21.390
in the air, similar to the tides
that we have in the ocean water,

00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:23.250
and so it's an effect
coming from below,

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:26.300
but it's indirectly caused by
the sun, because it's a result

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.350
of the heating from the
sun's light coming down.

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:32.930
And in addition to
those types of effects

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:38.940
which cause different
large-scale features

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:44.470
in the ionosphere, the sun
also gives off a steady stream

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:48.250
of radiation and magnetic
field called the solar wind,

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:52.590
and sometimes can give off
more of a burst of radiation --

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:55.510
for example, when we have
coronal mass ejections.

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:58.130
Has anyone heard of those?

00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:59.670
The coronal mass ejection is

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:03.480
when a sun essentially
spits off a piece of itself,

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.850
and it goes hurtling outward,
sometimes toward the Earth,

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:09.990
and it contains solar
plasma and magnetic fields

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:12.680
that then interact with
the Earth's magnetic field

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:14.470
and the Earth's upper
atmosphere,

00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:18.200
and this causes effects
which we call space weather,

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:21.780
and some of them are
storms typically referred

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:27.280
to as geomagnetic storms, and
they can cause large-scale,

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.850
global-scale heating of the
atmosphere which will, again,

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:33.700
then lift those particles
to higher altitudes,

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:36.020
where they will more
likely interact

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:38.260
with satellites in
low Earth orbit.

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:41.530
And so for a long time,

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:45.450
scientists thought this was
pretty much the complete

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:50.490
picture, but recently, in
addition to the space weather

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:54.840
that you get coming from the
sun, there's been a growing body

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.340
of evidence that
shows that it seems

00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:02.340
like certain weather events
from below are actually showing

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:04.640
up in the upper atmosphere.

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:10.970
Now this is a picture of airglow
where you see the whole half

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:16.230
of the Earth in airglow,
taken from the moon in 1972.

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:19.590
The Apollo 16 mission
had a camera on the moon

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:21.700
where they could image
the Earth and the airglow.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:24.030
I think it looks
kind of like a mouse.

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:26.880
And so the bright
half there is the half

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.380
of the Earth that's getting
hit directly by sunlight,

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:32.190
and so the airglow is
the brightest there.

00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:33.490
That tail of the mouse

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:35.740
at the bottom is
actually the auroral oval,

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:37.040
where you're getting
the Northern Lights,

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.500
and there would be one --
and the Southern Lights,

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:41.420
so there should be
one on both sides.

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:43.710
You can't see the other
one because it's swamped

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:48.540
by the airglow emissions,
but on the night side,

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:51.860
the mouse has some
little arms coming out.

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:55.190
This is a feature that
was discovered in the 40s

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:57.570
by a scientist named Appleton.

00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:00.170
It's called the Appleton
anomaly, although it's not

00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:03.280
so much as anomaly now
because it's been explained,

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:04.990
and we're not getting into it

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:07.880
because it's kind
of complicated.

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:10.630
I just wanted to point out that
the mouse's arms look pretty

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:17.130
smooth, but recently, we've had
cameras with higher resolution

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:18.820
that have gone through
and measured the Earth

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:23.710
in the same way -- for
example, the image satellite --

00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:27.490
and we've been able to
build up pictures like this,

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:30.020
where those arms of the
mouse are actually bands

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.630
that go all the way around the
Earth, and they're not smooth

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:34.270
like scientists thought.

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:36.900
There's actually a sort of
bead type structure there

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:39.560
where you have bright
spots along the arcs,

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:43.050
and this is an image
that it's in a paper

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:45.580
by Doctor Thomas
Immel, who's the PI,

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:48.090
the principal investigator,
of the Icon mission.

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:51.000
He's leading that mission,
and he shows evidence

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.160
that these bright
spots correspond

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:57.730
to weather that's happening
below in the tropics,

00:27:57.730 --> 00:28:02.200
and so this and other evidence
that's similar was part

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:05.800
of the motivation
for the Icon mission.

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:10.540
Icon is designed to study
really this brand-new area

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:11.840
of scientific research, right.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.370
It's like for a long time,
scientists have been saying,

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:16.480
"Well, just ignore
what's happening below

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.130
because it doesn't
affect anything,"

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:20.660
and now there's evidence
saying, "Hang on.

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:23.650
You shouldn't have ignored
that," so NASA's going back,

00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:25.950
and we're not going to
ignore that anymore.

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:28.500
We're going to start
measuring what's happening

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:31.740
in the upper atmosphere in
response to the weather below.

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:36.730
So ICON has four instruments.

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:38.960
So the satellite will be
orbiting in low Earth orbit,

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:42.900
actually flying through this
airglow that you're seeing,

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:46.010
and on the horizon, it's going
to take pictures of the airglow

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:50.810
in infrared, visible light,
and far ultraviolet light,

00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:53.760
and from those measurements,
it can get the temperature,

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.900
it can get a measure
of the winds

00:28:55.900 --> 00:29:00.420
where the neutral particles are
moving, and it can get a measure

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:03.430
of the composition and
how many ions are there.

00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:07.070
And in addition, they have
another instrument that's called

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:08.850
an NC2 instrument.

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:12.240
It takes measurements
right there locally.

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:16.260
It's an ion velocity meter
that gathers up the particles

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:20.840
and measures them to determine
the drift of the ions,

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:22.500
so you're getting
the second wind.

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:25.400
You're measuring both the
wind of the neutral particles

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:29.300
and the ionized particles, and
it's also giving information

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:33.340
about the electric
fields in that area.

00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:39.440
So additional evidence that
the weather below is actually

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.290
affecting the upper atmosphere.

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:45.370
There's a computer simulation
done by Astrid Maute,

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:49.310
who's also a part of the ICON
mission, where she showed

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:54.630
that during El Nino, when
the ocean water is warmer,

00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:57.430
it causes more water
vapor to be released,

00:29:57.430 --> 00:30:00.040
and that sets off a chain
reaction that can push --

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:04.070
-- the lower border of
the ionosphere upwards

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:09.020
and actually change the shape
of that boundary, and again,

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:12.250
that moves the particles
up to a higher altitude.

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:14.700
And so in her computer
simulation,

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:18.780
this plot on the right
shows the density

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:22.720
of the ionosphere during
one of these events,

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:27.650
and you have longitude on
the x-axis and latitude

00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:30.540
on the y-axis, and you can see

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:33.910
that because particles were
lifted up in certain areas,

00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:36.400
the ionosphere is
more dense there.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:40.360
Particles from below came up
and increased the density.

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:44.830
So that's one way that El
Nino could affect the upper

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:47.620
atmosphere, and now
ICON has to go and see

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:49.140
if they can measure that.

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:51.700
They'll be flying right
through regions like this

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:54.580
that are expected to
have higher density.

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:57.720
But one of the coolest
things that we want

00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:02.170
to measure is gravity
waves, not to be confused

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:06.170
with gravitational waves, which
are the warps in space-time

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:09.740
that won the Nobel
Prize in 2017,

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:11.360
but still interesting
nonetheless.

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.090
These are buoyancy waves.

00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:15.540
If you think of water
flowing over a rock,

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.010
you get ripples in the water.

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:18.880
The same thing happens with air.

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:22.970
Air flowing over mountain ranges
will be rippled, and also,

00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:25.700
in this case, this is
a computer simulation

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:29.330
of what the upper atmosphere
would look like after a tsunami.

00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:35.320
The tsunami is a large storm,
and the cyclone actually sets

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:39.440
up this ripple structure in the
air, and so this is the type

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:43.570
of measurement that ICON
and Gold will be making.

00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:46.900
ICON will be flying through
those ripples, right,

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:52.940
but Gold will be sitting 22,000
miles above, looking down,

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:56.480
getting this whole big picture,
and so when ICON says, "Well,

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.590
we've seen some ripples,
but we have no idea

00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:01.960
where they're from," Gold
can look and say, "Well,

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:04.380
we see there's a
big storm near you,

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:06.540
and that's where
they're coming from,"

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:09.270
and it gives us the complete
picture of what's going on.

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:13.180
So you can think of Gold as like
your typical weather satellite,

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:15.720
only it's looking at the
upper atmosphere instead

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:19.340
of the lower atmosphere, and
you can think of ICON as sort

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:23.390
of the hurricane chasers going
into the eye of the storm.

00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:29.020
And so as I mentioned,
Gold launched in January.

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:31.620
It's going to give us
these images much faster

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:34.470
than we've ever had before,
once every half-hour,

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:38.540
which might seem kind of slow
compared to what we're used to,

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:40.480
but what we've had
in the past was more

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.730
like one per several hours

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:45.870
or even one per day
or several days.

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:50.050
So this will allow us to
have enough resolution

00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:53.070
to measure what would be
considered weather effects

00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:55.450
rather than long-term
climate type effects,

00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:57.750
like we measured in the past.

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:08.030
So this video just shows
the viewing geometries

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:09.740
of the GOLD and ICON missions.

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:12.340
Gold is actually hovering
over a fixed location,

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:15.240
so it's rotating with the Earth.

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:18.630
It's hovering over the
mouth of the Amazon River,

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:24.330
and ICON is cutting through
in the atmosphere below.

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:29.570
It whips around at a rate of
about one orbit per 90 minutes,

00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:34.390
an hour and a half,
and GOLD has a camera

00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:36.880
that actually has a
split field of view.

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:40.810
So it takes a picture, then
it moves over a little bit,

00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:45.200
takes another picture, and so on
across the northern hemisphere.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:47.950
Then you'll see it go back
across the southern hemisphere,

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:51.800
and it builds up a complete,
essentially mosaic image

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.260
of what's going on below.

00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:01.300
And those little triangles
coming out from ICON,

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:05.120
those are the fields of view of
the different airglow cameras

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:07.420
that they have on board.

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:20.220
And once GOLD gets done
scanning across the Earth,

00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:22.880
it actually goes back
and scans the horizon,

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:26.200
which is where ICON is
looking from down below.

00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:28.930
It gives a different
type of science.

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:37.480
And so this color scale here is
what the ionosphere will look

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:39.300
like when it's being measured.

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:41.090
Gold actually will
be measuring night

00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:42.390
from the neutral particles,

00:34:42.390 --> 00:34:44.300
so it will look a
little bit different,

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:47.330
but it also changes
from day to day.

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:56.730
And so the airglow gives
you a sort of modeled look

00:34:56.730 --> 00:35:00.500
that corresponds to the shape
of the atmosphere, the density,

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:03.690
what kind of particles are
there, and it allows you

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:08.100
to get most of the information
that you would need for any sort

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:10.310
of computer simulation
that you're using.

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:14.350
Other information will
come from missions

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:16.860
like Parker Solar Probe, where
you're getting information

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:18.180
about what's coming
from the sun,

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:23.120
and this will help us move
toward first being able

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:25.170
to understand what's
going on now, right.

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:29.510
That's what we call
now-casting, and then over time,

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:32.340
being able to start
forecasting and saying, "Look,

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:34.300
this is what's happening
at the sun,

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:38.050
and so we can expect this sort
of effect in the atmosphere,

00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:41.430
which might have this sort of
effect on our technologies."

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:43.360
And so that's where
we're heading.

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:46.040
Gold and Icon won't get
us all the way there.

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.990
It's the very beginning

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:50.840
of forecasting weather
down here on Earth.

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:54.330
But they're a big step
in the right direction

00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:56.800
that will help us
understand and try to tease

00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:00.240
out the different effects of
what's happening at the sun

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:04.180
versus what's coming up from
down below -- tsunamis, El Nino,

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:06.870
other weather patterns
like that.

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:15.490
And so before I go, I
wanted to invite you

00:36:15.490 --> 00:36:19.620
to watch the icon launch on NASA
TV, and so this is a picture

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:23.260
over here of the fairing
that icon will go into.

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:26.100
They just did their
mission readiness review,

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:29.520
I saw on the NASA
blog yesterday,

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:32.600
so they're moving
forward toward launch,

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:36.930
and launch is next
Thursday, which is June 14th,

00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:39.940
and it will be -- the
coverage will start

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:42.690
at 9:45 a.m. eastern time.

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:46.810
The launch will more likely be
around 10:00 a.m., and that,

00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:51.010
you can watch it on NASA
TV on your TV station,

00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:54.100
or you can watch it
streaming on the internet.

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:57.520
And so we're very excited
for this, and I just want

00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:00.510
to thank you all again
for coming and listening.

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:08.500
[ Applause ]

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.700
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus:
Thank you so much.

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:12.000
I guess one of these days,

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.440
we'll have the space weather
girl who's also giving

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:18.170
that forecast along with
the Earth weather girl.

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:23.050
We'll take questions now, and
Dr. Jones will repeat them

00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:25.350
so everyone can hear them.

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:28.080
&gt;&gt; Your mission in
the ionosphere,

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:32.870
it appeared there were two
winds, potentially funny.

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:35.590
Have they shown any
indication of some type

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:37.640
of whirlpool configuration
that we see

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:40.490
in rivers occurring
in the ionosphere?

00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:41.790
&gt;&gt; Sarah Jones: So
the question was

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:43.670
about the two different
winds that are happening

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:46.450
in the upper atmosphere, the
ion wind and the neutral wind,

00:37:46.450 --> 00:37:51.310
and whether or not we see
whirlpool type effects.

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:54.430
Actually, there are all kinds
of really interesting effects,

00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:56.500
not exactly the same,
but happening

00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:58.170
in the upper atmosphere.

00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:02.830
For example, those two arms of
the mouse, the bands that are

00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:05.770
around the Earth,
they're really symmetrical

00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:09.210
around the Earth's
magnetic equator,

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:14.270
and they actually are caused by
what's called a fountain effect,

00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:16.570
which occurs because
of the Earth's magnetic

00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:20.630
and electric fields pulling on
those ions, and it causes them

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:24.310
to move upward and
then outward and down,

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:26.010
kind of like a fountain,

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:29.500
and that's what produces the
light in those two bands.

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:33.320
There are also other patterns
that I'm not very familiar with,

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:37.990
but one called the winter polar
vortex, which also moves air

00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:41.200
from the polar regions
down toward the equator.

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:44.500
So yeah, there are a lot of
similarities like the two.

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:48.920
&gt;&gt; What are the effects
of the El Nino thickening

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:51.390
of the ionosphere on Earth?

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:54.480
&gt;&gt; Sarah Jones: So the
thickening of the ionosphere,

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:59.490
it could potentially cause
effects like small changes

00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:04.160
in the accuracy of GPS or issues
for long-range communications.

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:07.690
Ultimately, the big effect, I
think, would be on satellites

00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:09.580
that happen to be
in low Earth orbit.

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:12.620
If the densities get high
enough, it can cause charging

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:15.360
on the spacecraft, which I
don't think would damage it,

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:16.660
but could affect instruments

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:18.940
and the measurements
on those satellites.

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:21.790
I think that would be the
main effect in that case.

00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:27.340
&gt;&gt; What is the relationship, if
there is one, between airglow

00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:29.260
and the aurora borealis?

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:30.560
&gt;&gt; Sarah Jones: Sure.

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:32.600
Thank you, and I forgot
to repeat your question.

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:35.230
You were asking about
what would the effect

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:39.780
of the El Nino density in
the ionosphere have down here

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:43.210
on Earth, but your question
was: How are the aurora

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:44.510
and the airglow related?

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:45.810
Is that right?

00:39:45.810 --> 00:39:48.530
Okay. Yeah, they are
related, actually,

00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:54.330
because they're both very
similar chemical processes.

00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:58.870
So the aurora happens when the
sun is giving off this steady

00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:00.170
solar wind --

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:03.760
-- and magnetic field which
then impacts on the Earth.

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:06.200
Some of those particles leak

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:10.610
into the Earth's magnetic field
area and kind of get stuck there

00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:15.120
and hang out there, and then
ionospheric particles also kind

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:17.950
of leak upward into that region,

00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:21.180
and then during some
geomagnetic events,

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:24.450
like coronal mass ejections,
they can get accelerated

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:27.820
in a way that causes them to
cruise down the field lines,

00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:29.930
kind of like in that
ionosphere video.

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:33.360
That's why you get the aurora in
a ring, because it's particles

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:36.230
that are traveling down
field lines from a region

00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:38.770
where they got accelerated.

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:43.910
But what causes the line is
those particles coming down.

00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:47.550
They impact the atmosphere,
knock electrons off

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:49.250
of the particles there.

00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:53.170
That causes them sometimes to
give off light immediately.

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:56.510
Other times, you
get other light also

00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:59.380
from when the particles
recombine,

00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:02.410
and certain chemical
interactions give off certain

00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:03.710
types of light.

00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:05.510
So that's how it
works in the aurora.

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:07.560
In the airglow, it's
almost the same thing.

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:09.860
It's just sunlight
causing it to happen,

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:13.230
and so you also get
excitation, they call it,

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:14.980
where you get this
immediate release of light,

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:17.350
and then you also
get recombination,

00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:20.580
especially at night, when
you're not getting bombarded

00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:21.880
with sunlight anymore.

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:24.280
Those electrons and ions
kind of find their way back

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:26.170
to each other, and some of them

00:41:26.170 --> 00:41:27.970
when they recombine
will give off light

00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:29.770
in a variety of different
colors.

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:32.950
So it's very similar.

00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:36.030
&gt;&gt; I think you mentioned the
GOLD satellite was a hosted

00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:38.170
payload on another satellite.

00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:40.760
What's the other satellite
for, and how do you build it

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:42.230
so that one doesn't
affect the other,

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:43.530
or do they affect each other?

00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:44.830
&gt;&gt; Sarah Jones: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:41:44.830 --> 00:41:47.960
It's about the GOLD mission
being a hosted payload,

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:50.960
and how you avoid the one
mission affecting the other,

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:53.590
and what the primary
mission is for.

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:57.290
I actually don't know what SES
Government Solutions is using

00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:58.590
SES-14 for.

00:41:58.590 --> 00:42:00.150
I don't think it's
classified or anything.

00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:01.690
I'm just not familiar with it.

00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:05.640
I think it's a -- it
could be a TV satellite,

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:09.130
but that's speculation,
but we did go through a lot

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:13.730
of measures working with SES,
which is the parent company

00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:15.810
of SES Government Solutions.

00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:18.470
All along, actually from
even the proposal stage,

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:21.820
before the mission was selected,
the gold team was working

00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:24.370
with SES, talking to them
about these exact things,

00:42:24.370 --> 00:42:27.970
and how do we avoid affecting
each other adversely.

00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:31.030
They wouldn't want us if we
were going to affect them,

00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:33.980
and NASA wouldn't let us
launch if our data were going

00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:38.360
to be affected, and so it's just
this long-term collaboration,

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:41.520
essentially, which
worked out quite well.

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:48.970
&gt;&gt; The surface of the
Earth is moving roughly

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:50.960
about a thousand miles per hour.

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:54.730
Is there a defining point
where the atmosphere relative

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:57.480
to space slows to zero

00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.910
or so many feet per
minute or miles per hour?

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:03.620
And then of course, you
know, space is zero.

00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:05.720
&gt;&gt; Sarah Jones: Yeah,
so essentially,

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:08.360
getting out of the
Earth's atmosphere depends

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:11.080
on reaching an escape
velocity, right,

00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:14.570
so that your velocity
is actually faster

00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:18.160
than gravity can pull you down
toward the Earth, essentially,

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:20.370
to keep you up out of there.

00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:24.100
In terms of -- and the question
was about the atmosphere

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:28.530
as it becomes space and
that boundary there.

00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:32.590
Is there a defining point
where the particles stop moving

00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:34.000
with the Earth, essentially?

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.670
Yeah, I think that
the answer would be

00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:44.020
that the particles
fall off gradually,

00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:49.240
and where the point is that
they become space I think is

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:51.510
something that we
haven't really measured.

00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:53.340
I'm not sure if they're --

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:55.240
they're probably our
models that would say,

00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:58.220
but that actually would
be dependent a little bit

00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:01.130
on the expansion of
the atmosphere due

00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:04.640
to the energy coming
from the sun.

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:05.940
&gt;&gt; And a follow-up.

00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:07.890
Is there any stripping
of our atmosphere

00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:10.550
over the course,
ever, at any point?

00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:13.690
I know with ozone, the hole
in the ozone at some point,

00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:16.010
but is there stripping
because of that movement?

00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:17.310
&gt;&gt; Sarah Jones: Yeah.

00:44:17.310 --> 00:44:18.610
The question is: Is there a sort

00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:19.910
of stripping effect
of the atmosphere?

00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:23.470
And I think that's a really
great and interesting question,

00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:26.690
because I think on other
planets in our solar system,

00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:28.150
that's the understanding, right,

00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:31.520
is that they may have had
atmospheres in the past

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:33.280
that were stripped away.

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:35.680
This is not my area
of expertise at all,

00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:40.890
but I am really interested in
it, and I think that the idea is

00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:43.000
that certain types of gas
could have been stripped away

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.590
in the past, but you'd have
to ask someone more expert

00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:48.430
than me, but thank you.

00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:53.080
&gt;&gt; On the slide up there,
it says the satellite

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:58.500
and the rocket on June 6th were
in California, and on June 14th,

00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:01.290
they're going to be
up in the Pacific.

00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:02.930
How do you get the
rocket up there?

00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:05.000
&gt;&gt; Sarah Jones: Yeah, and thank
you for pointing this out,

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.470
because I poorly made
this slide, actually.

00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:08.770
&gt;&gt; June 6th was yesterday.

00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:13.620
&gt;&gt; Sarah Jones: This picture
is from May 22nd, 2018.

00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:15.470
At that point, the satellite

00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:18.400
and the rocket were
all in California.

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:22.280
Yesterday they did their
mission readiness review,

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:25.770
and I don't know when it
happens, to be honest,

00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:30.880
but I do know that what happens
is that they take the rocket,

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.830
and the satellite, and
everything all put together.

00:45:33.830 --> 00:45:38.170
They ferry it out to the
Marshall Islands shortly before

00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:39.820
launch on June 14th.

00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:41.550
&gt;&gt; On a ship?

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:44.750
&gt;&gt; Sarah Jones: I
think so, yeah.

00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:46.900
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: I was
also interested in that,

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:51.460
in the type of launch where
it's going to be an airplane

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:53.700
with the rocket and
the satellite.

00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:55.380
Why do they use the airplane?

00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:57.330
Normally they would just
use the rocket for that.

00:45:57.330 --> 00:45:59.300
&gt;&gt; Sarah Jones: That's
right, I think, and again,

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:04.630
it's not my expertise why
ICON is being launched

00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:08.260
on this Pegasus rocket which
launches from an airplane.

00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:10.700
They actually take off
with the airplane first.

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:12.700
But I believe it's because
you need less thrust

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:15.220
and propulsion once
you're already in the air

00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:17.990
above the densest part
of the atmosphere,

00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:23.590
and so that makes it easier
to get it up into orbit.

00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:24.890
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: Okay.

00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:27.190
That should be interesting.

00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:30.520
&gt;&gt; What's the benefit from
launching it all the way

00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:33.770
out in the Pacific versus
Vandenberg or anywhere else?

00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:35.070
&gt;&gt; Sarah Jones: I know it was --

00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:36.530
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: Question.

00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:38.340
&gt;&gt; Sarah Jones: -- something
that had to be discussed.

00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:42.860
Why would you choose to launch
from Marshall Islands instead

00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:47.880
of somewhere like
Vandenberg or Kennedy?

00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:50.270
I believe that the reason was

00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:54.660
because the Marshall Islands
gave them the inclination

00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:56.220
that they wanted for the orbit.

00:46:56.220 --> 00:47:01.230
So it's something like a 20 or
22-degree inclination orbit,

00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:04.000
which allows it to get
up around the tropics

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.070
and also measure
near the equator.

00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:09.480
I think that was the reason.

00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:13.850
&gt;&gt; Wasn't it fairly recently
that the charged particles

00:47:13.850 --> 00:47:16.010
in the airglow were
photographed,

00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:19.930
like within the past
20 years or something?

00:47:19.930 --> 00:47:21.720
&gt;&gt; Sarah Jones: So the question
is, "How long has it been

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:24.030
since we started measuring
the charged particles

00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:25.330
in the airglow?"

00:47:25.330 --> 00:47:26.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just remember
seeing like a photograph.

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:30.140
It was like a discovery, and
everybody was excited about it.

00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:31.440
&gt;&gt; Sarah Jones: Oh, yeah.

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:32.740
I think I know what you mean.

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:36.360
One of the satellites that was
able to measure the aurora,

00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:39.780
both regions and all
of the airglow at once.

00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:41.080
It was the first time.

00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:43.340
It was done very recently.

00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:44.640
I'm sorry.

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:46.070
I don't remember what
mission that was, but in terms

00:47:46.070 --> 00:47:48.300
of just measuring the airglow,

00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:50.390
it's actually been
something that's been done

00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:53.810
since the beginning of
this research field.

00:47:53.810 --> 00:47:55.290
Also measuring the aurora.

00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:57.440
And it's an interesting
question,

00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:00.020
because we can use
the upper atmosphere

00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:02.460
as a real laboratory
for chemistry.

00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:05.860
Actually, there were chemical
emissions in the aurora

00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:08.740
and airglow that had
never been seen on Earth,

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:11.740
and so there were big
debates about, "What is this?

00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:13.280
What is the light coming from?"

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:15.080
We know it's coming
from a chemical reaction

00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:18.630
between the particles, but
there were even speculations

00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:21.460
about new elements
in the periodic table

00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:25.540
that might give off this kind
of light, and the reason was

00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:29.690
because some of these lines come
from metastable states, which,

00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:33.160
at least at that time
and the level of vacuum

00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:36.240
that they could achieve in
their laboratory experiments,

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:38.450
they would never see in the lab.

00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:43.430
So the red line that happens
in the aurora and the airglow,

00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:48.950
the particle receives the energy
and just kind of is metastable,

00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:52.810
so it hangs out for like an
entire minute before giving off

00:48:52.810 --> 00:48:56.250
light, and unless you're
at a really low density,

00:48:56.250 --> 00:48:58.150
before that minute is up,
you're going to get hit

00:48:58.150 --> 00:49:00.910
by some other particle, and
it's going to lose energy

00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:03.330
that way instead of
giving off the red light.

00:49:03.330 --> 00:49:06.980
So yeah, it's been
this really great way

00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:10.480
of studying basic chemistry.

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:14.920
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: Have
we exhausted the questions?

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:20.680
Well, thank you all for coming,
and we'll see you in September.

00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:23.910
We have a little hiatus
before our next lecture.

00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:26.530
So thanks again for coming.

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:28.340
It's great to be here.

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:29.640
&gt;&gt; Sarah Jones: Thank you.

00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:32.640

of the Library of Congress.
