00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.130
Let's give ourselves
a little bit

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.480
of practice with percentages.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:13.820
So let's ask ourselves, what
percent of-- I don't know,

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.940
let's say what
percent of 16 is 4?

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.600
And I encourage you
to pause this video

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.830
and to try it out yourself.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.940
So when you're saying
what percent of 16 is 4,

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.520
percent is another way of
saying, what fraction of 16

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.740
is 4?

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.330
And we just need to write
it as a percent, as per 100.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.610
So if you said what fraction
of 16 is 4, you would say,

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.150
well, look, this is
the same thing as 4/16,

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.380
which is the same thing as 1/4.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.660
But this is saying what
fraction 4 is of 16.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.449
You'd say, well, 4 is 1/4 of 16.

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.240
But that still doesn't
answer our question.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.116
What percent?

00:00:58.116 --> 00:00:59.740
So in order to write
this as a percent,

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.360
we literally have to write
it as something over 100.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.915
Percent literally
means "per cent."

00:01:05.915 --> 00:01:08.820
The word "cent" you know
from cents and century.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.550
It relates to the number 100.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.419
So it's per 100.

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:13.960
So you could say,
well, this is going

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.481
to be equal to question mark
over 100, the part of 100.

00:01:19.481 --> 00:01:21.980
And there's a bunch of ways
that you could think about this.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.980
You could say, well, look,
if in the denominator

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.990
to go from 4 to 100, I
have to multiply by 25.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.970
In the numerator
to go from-- I need

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.710
to also multiply by 25 in order
to have an equivalent fraction.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.390
So I'm also going
to multiply by 25.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.720
So 1/4 is the same
thing as 25/100.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:48.040
And another way of saying 25/100
is this is 25 per 100, or 25%.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.382
So this is equal to 25%.

00:01:52.382 --> 00:01:53.840
Now, there's a
couple of other ways

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.450
you could have thought about it.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.240
You could have said
well, 4/16, this

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.640
is literally 4 divided by 16.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.064
Well, let me just
do the division

00:02:04.064 --> 00:02:05.480
and convert to a
decimal, which is

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.229
very easy to convert
to a percentage.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.780
So let's try to actually do
this division right over here.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.520
So we're going to
literally divide 4 by 16.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.225
Now, 16 goes into 4 zero times.

00:02:18.225 --> 00:02:20.880
0 times 16 is 0.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.835
You subtract, and you get a 4.

00:02:22.835 --> 00:02:24.960
And we're not satisfied
just having this remainder.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.560
We want to keep adding zeroes to
get a decimal answer right over

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.170
here.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.250
So let's put a decimal
right over here.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.870
We're going into
the tenths place.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.660
And let's throw some
zeroes right over here.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.190
The decimal makes sure
we keep track of the fact

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.398
that we are now in the
tenths, and in the hundredths,

00:02:43.398 --> 00:02:45.940
and in the thousandths place
if we have to go that far.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.840
But let's bring another 0 down.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.790
16 goes into 40 two times.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.975
2 times 16 is 32.

00:02:54.975 --> 00:02:57.160
If you subtract, you get 8.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.960
And you could bring
down another 0.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.890
And we have 16 goes into 80.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.630
Let's see, 16 goes
into 80 five times.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.060
5 times 16 is 80.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.120
You subtract, you have no
remainder, and you're done.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.790
4/16 is the same thing as 0.25.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.570
Now, 0.25 is the same thing
as twenty-five hundredths.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.010
Or, this is the same
thing as 25/100,

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.897
which is the same thing as 25%.
