00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.570
So you know that thing where
you move house, but imagine you

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.300
forgot to tell your friends.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.480
And then they come round for
dinner, and they're like,

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.450
did you still want
us round for dinner?

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.090
And you're like, yeah.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.590
I've just realized
I've moved house,

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.970
and I forgot to tell you.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.057
And that's awkward.

00:00:28.057 --> 00:00:29.890
Well, that's exactly
what's happened, folks.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.140
You're watching this on the
Google Developers Channel,

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.800
but all the web content has now
moved to the Chrome Developers

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.300
Channel.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.550
Shazam.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.510
So you can find this
show, "Supercharged,"

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.330
where I take people's sites and
try and find performance fixes.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.500
You can find "Polycasts"
with Rob Dodson.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.330
You can find "Totally Tooling
Tips" with Matt Gaunt and Addy

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.890
Osmani.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.930
And you can find
"HTTP 203" with me

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.350
and Jake Archibald,
all over there, all

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.800
packaged up nice and neatly.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.810
So head over there.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:54.805
Subscribe.

00:00:54.805 --> 00:00:56.520
And I guess I'll see you there.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.070
Bye.
