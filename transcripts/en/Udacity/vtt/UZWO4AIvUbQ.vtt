00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.320
Alright, now let's say we have a bunch of our

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.700
data in a relational database. Your next question is probably,

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.640
how do we get it out? And what can we

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.990
do with it? Well, let's try to learn about this

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.040
using our aadhaar data. Now, data is usually retrieved from

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.800
a relational database using one of a family of languages

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.240
that I'll call SQL like languages. Well, there are some

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.210
small variations between the languages. They have the same general

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.530
concepts and syntax. Now, how could we query

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.439
the Aadhaar enrollment data set with SQL like syntax,

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.489
if data was in a database. Stored in a

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.740
table called Aadhaar data. Well, the most simple thing

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.222
that we might want to do is simply to select all of the data, that is, all rows

00:00:43.222 --> 00:00:45.376
and columns. If we wanted to do that, we

00:00:45.376 --> 00:00:50.060
could type something like select star from aadhaar data.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.300
Note that the SQL syntax is pretty human readable. We're

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.420
just saying we want to select star or everything from

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.860
the aadhaar data table. If we were to run this

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.750
command as is, we would produce tens of thousands of rows

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.840
which is probably not super constructive right now. So what

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.230
we can do is, limit the number of rows by just

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.960
saying limit 20 at the end of our SQL command.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.180
If we ran this query, let's see what we get back.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.940
Oh, great, the first 20 rows of

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.820
the data. These are rows describing enrollments for

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.430
the registrar Allahabad Bank, with various enrollment agencies,

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.670
districts, age, genders, et cetera. Now, say we

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.070
only wanted some of these columns. Say,

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.200
district and subdistrict. We could just ask for

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.672
those specific columns instead of star. For example,

00:01:37.672 --> 00:01:41.624
we might write, select district, subdistrict from aadhaar

00:01:41.624 --> 00:01:42.921
data, limit 20.
