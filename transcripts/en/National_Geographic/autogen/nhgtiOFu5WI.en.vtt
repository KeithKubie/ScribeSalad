defenses has been taken down it is
 

00:47:36.210 --> 00:47:38.750
defenses has been taken down it is
connected with all the other areas all

00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:38.760

so sometimes we do see the rare animals

00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:43.200
so sometimes we do see the rare animals
 

00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:51.799
so sometimes we do see the rare animals
entering this area

00:47:51.799 --> 00:47:51.809
 

00:47:51.809 --> 00:47:54.870
so the meerkats are very much rare is

00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:54.880
so the meerkats are very much rare is
 

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.729
so the meerkats are very much rare is
something which is very very difficult

00:47:56.729 --> 00:47:56.739
something which is very very difficult
 

00:47:56.739 --> 00:47:59.370
something which is very very difficult
and to find you don't have to be very

00:47:59.370 --> 00:47:59.380
and to find you don't have to be very
 

00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:07.439
and to find you don't have to be very
lucky to see the meerkats I have never

00:48:07.439 --> 00:48:07.449
lucky to see the meerkats I have never
 

00:48:07.449 --> 00:48:12.449
lucky to see the meerkats I have never
operate so the mierqis they do have free

00:48:12.449 --> 00:48:12.459
operate so the mierqis they do have free
 

00:48:12.459 --> 00:48:15.179
operate so the mierqis they do have free
daters but mostly you will see them as a

00:48:15.179 --> 00:48:15.189
daters but mostly you will see them as a
 

00:48:15.189 --> 00:48:19.999
daters but mostly you will see them as a
mob and they do protect each other

00:48:19.999 --> 00:48:20.009
mob and they do protect each other
 

00:48:20.009 --> 00:48:22.499
mob and they do protect each other
normally when it comes to the animals

00:48:22.499 --> 00:48:22.509
normally when it comes to the animals
 

00:48:22.509 --> 00:48:24.629
normally when it comes to the animals
such as snakes you will see they can

00:48:24.629 --> 00:48:24.639
such as snakes you will see they can
 

00:48:24.639 --> 00:48:27.769
such as snakes you will see they can
easily mobilize and charge that snake

00:48:27.769 --> 00:48:27.779
easily mobilize and charge that snake
 

00:48:27.779 --> 00:48:37.520
easily mobilize and charge that snake
they do kill snakes

00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:37.530
 

00:48:37.530 --> 00:48:41.599
so no one is around the pen at the

00:48:41.599 --> 00:48:41.609
so no one is around the pen at the
 

00:48:41.609 --> 00:48:53.180
so no one is around the pen at the
moment Nina they are like the dwarf

00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:53.190
moment Nina they are like the dwarf
 

00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:56.000
moment Nina they are like the dwarf
mongoose and they've got similar kind of

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:56.010
mongoose and they've got similar kind of
 

00:48:56.010 --> 00:48:58.970
mongoose and they've got similar kind of
the behavior because you'll see the

00:48:58.970 --> 00:48:58.980
the behavior because you'll see the
 

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:01.580
the behavior because you'll see the
normal stand up red staining and

00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:01.590
normal stand up red staining and
 

00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:04.040
normal stand up red staining and
binocular vision in check and check and

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:04.050
binocular vision in check and check and
 

00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:06.589
binocular vision in check and check and
they do make quite a lot of noise if

00:49:06.589 --> 00:49:06.599
they do make quite a lot of noise if
 

00:49:06.599 --> 00:49:08.060
they do make quite a lot of noise if
they are not happy or when they see a

00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:08.070
they are not happy or when they see a
 

00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:10.820
they are not happy or when they see a
predator such as neighbours they do make

00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:10.830
predator such as neighbours they do make
 

00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:26.180
predator such as neighbours they do make
noise

00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:26.190
 

00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:30.089
so the the banded mongoose I have seen

00:49:30.089 --> 00:49:30.099
so the the banded mongoose I have seen
 

00:49:30.099 --> 00:49:32.339
so the the banded mongoose I have seen
them here in Juma the other day I was on

00:49:32.339 --> 00:49:32.349
them here in Juma the other day I was on
 

00:49:32.349 --> 00:49:34.640
them here in Juma the other day I was on
a guided walk and they were all just

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:34.650
a guided walk and they were all just
 

00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:38.190
a guided walk and they were all just
migrating from a big termite mound very

00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:38.200
migrating from a big termite mound very
 

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:40.320

00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:54.600
so these are the suitable areas for

00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:54.610
so these are the suitable areas for
 

00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:59.060
so these are the suitable areas for
these animals to hide when is too hot

00:49:59.060 --> 00:49:59.070
these animals to hide when is too hot
 

00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:16.660
these animals to hide when is too hot

the interesting thing is that when it's

01:31:55.350 --> 01:31:55.360
the interesting thing is that when it's
 

01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:59.070
the interesting thing is that when it's
green there's far more cover which it's

01:31:59.070 --> 01:31:59.080
green there's far more cover which it's
 

01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:01.140

both purposes really of blending in when

they're akin lions and leopards or what
they call starvation resistant which

they call starvation resistant which
 

01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:29.800
they call starvation resistant which
means they can go for about two weeks

01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:29.810
means they can go for about two weeks
 

01:33:29.810 --> 01:33:32.650
means they can go for about two weeks
without adequate meal but they don't

they'll eat all the time they'll eat as

01:33:35.890 --> 01:33:35.900
they'll eat all the time they'll eat as
 

01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:39.220
they'll eat all the time they'll eat as
much as they possibly can but when they

01:33:39.220 --> 01:33:39.230
much as they possibly can but when they
 

01:33:39.230 --> 01:33:40.810
much as they possibly can but when they
get hungry so they're - it starts

get hungry so they're - it starts
 

01:33:40.820 --> 01:33:43.300
get hungry so they're - it starts
changing and then what problem is this

01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:43.310
changing and then what problem is this
 

01:33:43.310 --> 01:33:45.100
changing and then what problem is this
when they get old and maybe sick they

01:33:45.100 --> 01:33:45.110
when they get old and maybe sick they
 

01:33:45.110 --> 01:33:47.590
when they get old and maybe sick they
lose the ability to hunt and that's when

01:33:47.590 --> 01:33:47.600
lose the ability to hunt and that's when
 

01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:49.570
lose the ability to hunt and that's when
they can potentially become dangerous

01:33:49.570 --> 01:33:49.580
they can potentially become dangerous
 

01:33:49.580 --> 01:33:52.000
they can potentially become dangerous
because when starvation kicks in an

because when starvation kicks in an
 

01:33:52.010 --> 01:33:54.550
because when starvation kicks in an
animal loses its fear of all sorts of

be about the limit but they will eat
 

01:34:09.140 --> 01:34:10.780
be about the limit but they will eat
much more regularly
