changed in the area of deep learning so

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120
changed in the area of deep learning so
 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.300
changed in the area of deep learning so
for example the way you fit your data

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310
for example the way you fit your data
 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.780

your training set and your test set come
 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.370
your training set and your test set come
from different distributions that's

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380
from different distributions that's
 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.900
from different distributions that's
