00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.650
Hi.

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.970
I'm Jeffrey Sham
with the Google

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.060
Developer Relations Team.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.830
In this video, I'll show you
how to get started with the

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.460
DoubleClick For Publishers API
PHP Client Library, from

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.560
downloading the code to running
examples, and also

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.520
tips like what has changed in
the login configuration and

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.640
where to find the log files.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.640
For new users, I'd recommend
taking a look at the Getting

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.130
Started Guide.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.260
Here you will find resources
for account signup, setup

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.200
information for different
programming languages, as well

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.690
as other developer resources.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.520
From here we will navigate to
client libraries and start

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.805
from the QuickStart Guide
provided for PHP.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.450
One of the first things you need
to do is make sure your

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.160
system meets the requirements
to use the client library.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.580
For PHP, we need Version 5.2
with date of sub-client, and

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.630
the sub-client, openness to
cell, and curl extensions.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.340
So let's go ahead and download
the client library

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.120
from the code site.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.690
This is the project homepage for
the client library, and it

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.500
contains up-to-date

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.700
information on version releases.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.920
You can go to the Wiki tab for
additional information, Issues

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.640
tab for bug tracking, and Source
tab for instructions on

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.550
how to check out the code
through a version control

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.680
system, or just to view
the code online.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.740
Now let's go to Downloads and
get the most recent version of

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.820
the client library.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.340
The most current library
will have the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.590
featured library label.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.440
So we click on the file link.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.635
Wait for the download
to finish.

00:01:35.635 --> 00:01:38.970
Click on the download so it
unpacks, and we're almost

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.305
ready to run some code.

00:01:40.305 --> 00:01:43.980
For setup, we go to our client
library directory, and then go

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.230
to /src/Google/Api/
Ads/Dfp/auth.ini.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.775
And we open that up to put
in our information.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.630
Choose Client Login.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.900
All we have to do is fill in
the email and password.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.460
It's good practice to have an
application name, and the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.610
network code has to be filled
in if the user is associated

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.530
with more than one network.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.150
With the file saved, our
setup is now complete.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.510
Let's take a look at the
examples, which are organized

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.470
by version and then
by service.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.920
Looking at Creative Service,
you can see that there are

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.360
seven examples that
we can run.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.240
Let's take a closer look
at the Get Creatives

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.990
By Statement example.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.440
You can open the PHP file with
an editor of your preference,

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.880
but I'd like to show you how
to view this file online

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.720
through the Client Library
Project Site.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:49.570
So we go to Source, Browse,
Examples, choose our version,

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:55.720
our service, and finally,
pick our example.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.620
You will notice that many of the
examples, like this one,

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.970
will have a pattern of creating
a DFP user, using it

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.730
to create a service, and
then using a service

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.770
to make an API call.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.560
In this case, we create a DFP
user with no arguments.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.700
So we just post the credentials
from the auth.ini

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.910
that we configured earlier.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.490
We use the Filter Statement with
bind variables to specify

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.270
that we only want up to
500 Image Creatives.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.230
We call Get Creatives By
Statements on the service with

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.740
the statement object, and we
display the results, one line

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.460
per creative, to the
command line.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.900
Now let's run this example
and see what we get.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.685
To do this, we just have to
type php GetCreativesBySt

00:03:39.685 --> 00:03:45.440
atementExample.php
and hit Enter.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.370
And there we go.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.370
We've successfully retrieved
some image creatives.

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.750
You can find out more
information about the request

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.870
from the logs in the
Logs Directory.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.130
The Request ID here is really
useful for troubleshooting if

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.440
you've ever run into problems,
and you'd like to post a

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.670
question on the forum for us.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.315
You can also configure
the level of

00:04:06.315 --> 00:04:07.580
logging that you want.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.320
By default, the library captures
each request into the

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.840
Request Info XML.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.180
Let's change our logging to
capture the SOAP Request and

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.600
SOAP Response Log as well.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.930
Going back to the command
line, we can

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.920
run the example again.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.700
Great, the request
is finished.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.170
And looking at the Log Directory
again, we see now

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.460
that there is a soap_xml.log
file.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.720
Looking at the log file, you
can see the tail end of the

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.570
XML response for the Get
Creatives By Statement call we

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.760
made just now.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.960
So what does it look like
if we run into an error?

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.330
Let's try it out by changing
our filter field to an

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.316
incorrect value.

00:04:45.316 --> 00:04:48.220
Running the example again, this
is what we'll see in the

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.090
Request Info Log.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.060
We see that the last call has
failed from the isFault=1.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.660
And the Error Details tells us
that there was a problem with

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.280
our filter statement.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.560
And that's all there is to
getting started with the PHP

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.130
Client Library.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.540
We have a number of resources
available to help you,

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.260
including these documentations,
FAQs, blogs,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.920
forums, and developer
hangouts.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.790
I hope you enjoyed the
streamcast and would love to

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.860
discuss more through any
of these channels.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.110
Just let us know.
