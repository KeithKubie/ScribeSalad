00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.400
So, when I need to get creative and
I'm feeling like I'm out of ideas,

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.190
a lot of times I'll look at other media,
like video games, or

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.840
movies, or television shows,
or just go for a walk.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.560
Because a lot of times,
staring at Xcode,

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.220
and trying to get creative
is the exact wrong approach.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.350
&gt;&gt; When I'm trying to get
creative in building an app,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.460
I usually look to others
instead of myself.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.250
So, I'll ask my twin brother or
my friends or family and just figure out

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.260
what problems they're going through and
figure out if there's a cool,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.930
mobile way that we could solve them, and
then start building an app from there.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.740
&gt;&gt; Having a problem to solve helps
me get in a creative mindset.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.370
Because sort of defining
the problem gives me sort of

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.640
the space that I'm working within.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.650
Chances are I know how that problem
has been solved previously and

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.860
I'm unhappy with those results.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.780
So I have that, that gives me
the components that I'm working with,

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.152
the components that I want to change.
