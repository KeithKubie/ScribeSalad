00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:05.671
- [Moshe] Hey, this
is Moshe Kasher.

00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:07.339
- [Natasha] And Natasha Leggero.

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:09.008
- [Moshe] We just got
married six months ago.

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:10.576 align:start size:94% position:6%
- [Natasha] Which we
think pretty much makes us

00:00:10.576 --> 00:00:12.779
qualified to give love
advice to strangers.

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.213 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Moshe] So,
that's what we did.

00:00:14.213 --> 00:00:16.683
We packed up the
car, hit the road,

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:18.118
and spread the love.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:21.788 align:start size:94% position:6%
- [Moshe And Natasha] This
is the Honeymoon Tour.

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:27.893 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
- Look how much
better my boots look.

00:00:27.893 --> 00:00:29.362
- [Natasha] Yeah.

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:33.466 align:start position:0%
- Bought some boot-cleaning
solution today here in Portland.

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:37.203
- Wait, Moshe, you should
do that thing where, like,

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:40.205
no woman jerks off to feet.

00:00:40.205 --> 00:00:42.308 align:start size:88% position:13%
- We were trying to work
on a joke about that.

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:45.712
- There's no woman who's
like, needs to come on

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:47.747
some man's feet.

00:00:47.747 --> 00:00:49.048
- Right, the fetish.

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:50.216
Although women do have fetishes.

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:51.317
- Not feet.

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:52.152
- No.

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:54.153
- [Natasha] No.

00:00:54.153 --> 00:00:55.488 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Are there any female
foot fetishists?

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:56.889
- No way.

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:59.559
I bet you there's
zero in the world.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.062
(jazzy music)

00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:12.138
- Do you guys need a ticket?

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:13.405
- [Woman] No, nuh-uh.

00:01:13.405 --> 00:01:16.242
- Do you have a friend
who might need a ticket?

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:19.846 align:start size:97% position:3%
I'm trying to sell this ticket
because my husband's sick.

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:22.915 align:start size:84% position:16%
One ticket, 15
dollars and a beer.

00:01:22.915 --> 00:01:24.250
That's all I want.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.518
- I heard you have
a ticket for sale.

00:01:25.518 --> 00:01:26.986
- I do.

00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:28.688 align:start size:97% position:3%
My husband got sick, he
wouldn't even eat the tacos

00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:30.155
I brought him for dinner.

00:01:30.155 --> 00:01:30.990
- Can we call him?

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.825
- Yes.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.263
(phone ringing)

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:38.798
- He's probably vomiting
right now or something.

00:01:38.798 --> 00:01:39.632
- [Man] Hello?

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:40.600
- Hi, is this Kelly?

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.334
- [Kelly] Yes.

00:01:42.334 --> 00:01:44.537 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Hey Kelly, it's Moshe
Kasher and Natasha Leggero.

00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:46.005
Say hi Natasha.

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:47.706 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Hi, we're really embarrassed
your wife is trying to

00:01:47.706 --> 00:01:50.109
sell your ticket at our show.

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:51.944
- Yeah, we were wondering, we
know you aren't feeling well,

00:01:51.944 --> 00:01:53.279
but we wondering if you
could maybe talk her

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:54.647
out of doing this.

00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:57.116 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
- So the host of a
relationship expertise show,

00:01:57.116 --> 00:01:58.317 line:0%
Mr. Greg Behrendt.

00:01:58.317 --> 00:02:00.452 line:0%
Greg, if you want to come out.

00:02:00.452 --> 00:02:02.655 line:0%
Hey, there he is.

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:04.557 align:start size:88% position:13%
- So we've been married
for seven years.

00:02:04.557 --> 00:02:06.659
Christie once wore JNCOs.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.464
- JNCOs are a style of
pant originally started

00:02:12.464 --> 00:02:16.902
by a family called the
JNCO family in Florence.

00:02:16.902 --> 00:02:19.806 align:start size:97% position:3%
The progenitor of Salvatore
JNCO first created

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:24.177 align:start size:97% position:3%
harlequin pants and clown
pants for the opera and then

00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:27.480 align:start size:97% position:3%
he actually came over to
America where his son carried

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.315
on the family loom.

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:32.885 align:start size:97% position:3%
Finally, in 1991 when
Frankie Bones and some other

00:02:32.885 --> 00:02:35.688 align:start size:88% position:13%
sick fucking DJ
started the rave scene.

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:37.423
This is a pretty happy
couple, if that's the

00:02:37.423 --> 00:02:38.390
worst problem they have.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.659
Give them a round of applause.

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:40.826 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I think there's
people out there who

00:02:40.826 --> 00:02:42.161
really need our help.

00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:43.929
- Anybody want to
come up with a real

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:44.831
Come on up!

00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:49.002 align:start size:94% position:6%
- So, Willow, what is your
main problem with Danny

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:51.004 align:start size:97% position:3%
that you'd like to discuss,
and then he can say

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:52.739
his with you?

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:53.740
- Let me say the problem.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.408
- There we go, yeah.

00:02:57.377 --> 00:02:59.078
Yes, I love it.

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:00.245
- I got the problem.

00:03:00.245 --> 00:03:01.748
The problem is me.

00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:05.251 align:start size:94% position:6%
The problem is sometimes,
this morning, she was

00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:08.021 align:start size:97% position:3%
putting on some shorts dude,
and I was like, are you

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:10.523 align:start size:94% position:6%
going to wear those, cause
I'd rather you didn't,

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:12.024
- Wait, is this what

00:03:12.024 --> 00:03:14.526
- Stop telling me that I
look good because it makes

00:03:14.526 --> 00:03:17.964 align:start size:97% position:3%
me feel bad and I'm like
fuck, I'm scared that you're

00:03:17.964 --> 00:03:20.966 align:start size:88% position:13%
going to go out without
me and get raped.

00:03:20.966 --> 00:03:22.201
- Oh.

00:03:22.201 --> 00:03:25.204 align:start size:81% position:19%
This has been a
great comedy show.

00:03:25.204 --> 00:03:27.206
- You are amazing, I love you.

00:03:27.206 --> 00:03:28.441
And I love you too.

00:03:28.441 --> 00:03:30.443
I've seen you at the
Hawthorne Theatre.

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:31.277
- What about this guy
who's been staring

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:33.079
at us the whole time?

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:34.046
- Yeah, I don't know.

00:03:34.046 --> 00:03:35.548
- What the heck is going on?

00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:37.383 align:start size:94% position:6%
- You want, here, you want
it for fifteen dollars?

00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:39.218 align:start size:84% position:16%
- It's half the
price of what I paid.

00:03:39.218 --> 00:03:40.386
- Give me the cash.

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:42.155 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Moshe] Are you
really going to come?

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:43.956
We're the comedians.

00:03:43.956 --> 00:03:46.091
- [Woman] They're really funny.

00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:49.562
- And we're very famous,
we're household names.

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:50.629
- You're gonna come?

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:52.398
But she needs fifteen dollars.

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:53.232
- Yeah, no problem.

00:03:53.232 --> 00:03:54.066
- Okay.

00:03:54.066 --> 00:03:55.068
All right, thank you.

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:56.402
- Appreciate it.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.106 align:start size:97% position:3%
- So it's not the same
problem that they had where

00:04:00.106 --> 00:04:02.775 align:start size:97% position:3%
he doesn't like her z
pant, what are they called?

00:04:02.775 --> 00:04:03.576
- JNCOs.

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:05.111
- JNCOs.

00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:09.081
But your problem is that you
want her to wear some JNCOs?

00:04:09.081 --> 00:04:11.684 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You're struggling
with some real issues,

00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:14.787 align:start size:94% position:6%
some real self-esteem
stuff, because that's not

00:04:14.787 --> 00:04:18.424
about her that's about the
sadness inside of you man.

00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:21.427 align:start size:97% position:3%
You're just afraid you're
going to lose her, period, so

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:22.928
that means you don't feel
good enough about yourself

00:04:22.928 --> 00:04:26.098
inside the relationship,
sorry, I'm great at this.

00:04:26.098 --> 00:04:27.633
- He is great at this.

00:04:27.633 --> 00:04:28.835 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I'm just, I'm
fucking great at it.

00:04:28.835 --> 00:04:30.102
- What do you think?

00:04:30.102 --> 00:04:32.671
- I didn't want to be, I
wanted to be in a band.

00:04:32.671 --> 00:04:35.274
- I'd like to play
devil's advocate.

00:04:35.274 --> 00:04:39.779
I think that Willow, scoot
over, I feel that Willow

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:44.716 align:start size:97% position:3%
could do a little bit better
job letting Danny know

00:04:44.716 --> 00:04:48.955 align:start size:84% position:16%
how sexy he is and how
manly he is and how

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:52.025
attracted to him you are
and he needs to be a bit

00:04:52.025 --> 00:04:53.492
more confident.

00:04:53.492 --> 00:04:57.297 align:start size:97% position:3%
- And realize that not every
man is a creep like you

00:04:58.898 --> 00:05:01.734 align:start size:81% position:19%
and that your love
is good enough.

00:05:02.835 --> 00:05:04.136
- Your love is beautiful.

00:05:04.136 --> 00:05:05.405
- Will you guys commit to it?

00:05:05.405 --> 00:05:06.506
- Absolutely.

00:05:07.406 --> 00:05:08.841
- Yeah all right.

00:05:08.841 --> 00:05:10.042
- That's the end of
their relationship.

00:05:10.042 --> 00:05:11.310 align:start size:84% position:16%
Ladies and gentlemen,
Willow and Danny!

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.246
(audience cheers)

00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:15.748 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I want Greg to help someone
else he's so good at it.

00:05:15.748 --> 00:05:16.682
- Oh, he is good at it.

00:05:16.682 --> 00:05:19.151
Maybe we should have him do us.

00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:21.020
- Oh, I don't want
to go down that path.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.657
Oh no, I like you guys,
I want to stay friends.

00:05:25.657 --> 00:05:27.326 align:start size:97% position:3%
- So you want me to say
what my problem is with you?

00:05:27.326 --> 00:05:28.328
- Go for it.

00:05:29.394 --> 00:05:31.697
- He's real messy.

00:05:31.697 --> 00:05:34.867 align:start size:97% position:3%
Like when he drops something,
he told me his instinct

00:05:34.867 --> 00:05:36.836
is to run away from it.

00:05:39.605 --> 00:05:42.207 align:start size:97% position:3%
So that's like a whole
household of stuff that he's

00:05:42.207 --> 00:05:43.676
running away from.

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:45.177 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Do you want me to handle
that one or is there?

00:05:45.177 --> 00:05:46.512
- That's the only problem.

00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:49.348 align:start size:88% position:13%
- The little tiny shit,
they're just seeds

00:05:49.348 --> 00:05:51.083
and then they grow, trust me.

00:05:51.083 --> 00:05:54.687 align:start size:97% position:3%
So like, hear that, and
start packing your shit up,

00:05:54.687 --> 00:05:55.555
I'm telling you.

00:05:55.555 --> 00:05:56.421
It'll wreck it.

00:05:56.421 --> 00:05:58.390
The dumbest thing.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.193
- That's your advice?

00:06:01.527 --> 00:06:03.696 align:start size:94% position:6%
- In a relationship,
that's an easy compromise.

00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:06.065 align:start size:97% position:3%
If you really love a
person, you'll do the thing

00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:09.368
they want you to do and not
the thing you prefer to do.

00:06:09.368 --> 00:06:10.569
Does that make sense?

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:12.304
- It's not that big of
a deal though Moshe.

00:06:12.304 --> 00:06:13.239
- My turn.

00:06:13.239 --> 00:06:16.041
- No, I think we're done.

00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:20.213
- One thing that I don't
like, is that, basically,

00:06:22.314 --> 00:06:26.085 align:start size:88% position:13%
like, she's not
faithful to me I guess.

00:06:26.085 --> 00:06:28.287
- You know you're going
to have to get over that.

00:06:28.287 --> 00:06:30.156
People have their own
lives and they have

00:06:30.156 --> 00:06:31.723
to be who they are.

00:06:31.723 --> 00:06:33.326 align:start size:84% position:16%
You know, pick up your
shit and let her do

00:06:33.326 --> 00:06:34.460
what she feels like.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:35.961
- Thank you.

00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:37.229
- It's going to save your
marriage I swear to God.

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:39.132
- You guys, thank you
so much for coming out.
