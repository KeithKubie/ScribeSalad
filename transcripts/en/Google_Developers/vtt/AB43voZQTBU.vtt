&gt;&gt; 
Hi, were here today at Google I/O to talk

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.830
to Jay and, Jay, do you mind introducing yourself
and talk a little bit about your company?

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.440
&gt;&gt; HINDMAN: No problem. I’m HINDMAN, I’m
the senior director of Partner and Product

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.580
Marketing at MobiTV. And MobiTV--we’re relatively
new to Android development and we’re kind

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.590
of showcasing some of our applications at
the show right now. Our core product is MobiTV,

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.450
and that’s 40 live or made from mobile channels
from big brands like ESPN, ABC, CBS, NBC,

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.010
Discovery, et cetera. And that’s been available
for a long time on different platforms and

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.440
is now being ported over to Android which
we’re really excited about. MobiForBiz is

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.329
another new product that we’ve come out
with that allows you to get personalized breaking

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.929
video alerts on stocks that you happened to
be--to own in your portfolio, as well as watch

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:54.300
live business TV on CNBC, Bloomberg and others.
&gt;&gt; Okay, that’s great. So, you mentioned

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.716
being kind of new to Android. What is it about
Android that got you to put your application

00:00:58.716 --> 00:01:04.809
to it and make it available on the (INDISTINCT)
&gt;&gt; HINDMAN: Yeah, I mean, it’s two things.

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.140
First of all, our development team was very
excited when Android was announced. The fact

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.780
that they knew it was going to be very open
sourced and that they’d have the ability

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.480
to kind of get into the code and do a lot
of things that they maybe are unable to do

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.540
other platforms. But also, we generally let
our carriers’ handset roadmap kind of dictate

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.030
which handsets work to and we’re very close
with AT&amp;T, Sprint and others knowing that

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.410
they got Android devices on the horizon meant
that we were going to be developing our preloaded

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.450
applications on those, anyway.
&gt;&gt; Okay, great. You know, one thing developers

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.850
really like to hear is more stories, stories
going to entrance us, do you have anything

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.740
you could share with us?
&gt;&gt; HINDMAN: Yeah. Yeah, I talked to our development

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.790
team a little bit about this. So, we have
a product called MObiVJ that we’re also

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.750
making available for Android. The MobiVJ is
roughly 18 channels and music videos, but

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.590
also a whole bunch of audio-only channels
or radio channels from different genres of

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.220
music. And one of the things that they noticed
as they started developing this product is

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.520
that the way the Android widget for video
playback works is that when you try to play

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.030
an audio-only clip, it’s actually looking
for video. So in a hybrid product like this

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.390
that’s both audio and video, it’s looking
for video to display on the screen. If it

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.310
doesn’t, it won’t even play the audio
feed. So, what they did is they invented a

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.989
single pixel and then painted over it, a single
video pixel, so when you start that audio

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.769
stream, it pulls up the video pixel and says,
“Oop, yup, it’s definitely a video, it’s

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.760
playing,” and then it goes ahead and plays
the audio stream. And if it happens to be

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.239
video that’s playing, it just goes full
screen and plays the whole--the whole video

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:27.469
clip.
&gt;&gt; Okay, that’s great.

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:30.629
&gt;&gt; HINDMAN: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Are there other things about the tool chain

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:37.359
or the development process that make it interesting
develop on Android, or particularly interesting.

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:41.909
&gt;&gt; HINDMAN: One of the things that our team
really likes is the Monkey Tool, that it allows

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:45.530
him to kind of do some emulation and it’s
really pseudo-random events that are generated

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.060
by the tool that allows them to go ahead and,
you know, use it the way users are using it.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.329
The way a user will kind of fumble with it
and poke buttons and push things here and

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.549
there. That’s what the Monkey Tool does.
So that it, you know, has system-level events

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.279
like that and then user-generated events,
and it does a random stream of that. And then

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:03.840
it will do one that’s a little bit different
that’s a random stream and it shows you

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.040
how users would really interact with it, and
it’s really helpful on the development cycle.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.329
&gt;&gt; That’s great. Are there particular things
about the Android platform because it’s

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.290
open that you can do with your application
that you might not be able to do on other

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.730
platforms?
&gt;&gt; HINDMAN: Yeah, there’s a couple of things.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.239
The virtual key pad or key board that allows
you to kind of touch the search box in our

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.379
applications and then it just boom!, it just
kind of pops right up there, is really new

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.010
to us and it enables some functionality that
we’re just kind of now thinking through

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.060
how are we going to take advantage of it,
and also, the painting over video. The fact

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.739
that that keyboard will pop up even when the
video is playing in the background allows

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.270
us to do some kind of text-based stuff that
is really cool. So, you can still type, you

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.969
know, over that video while it’s playing.
The keyboard goes back down, the video continues

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:48.909
to play. And so it just--it makes the device
or the application more rich and allows us

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:51.959
to do things we couldn’t otherwise do.
&gt;&gt; Well, it’s great. Well, thank you for

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.669
taking the time to talk to us today. I look
forward to exploring the application.

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:56.989
&gt;&gt; HINDMAN: My pleasure.
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:57.989
&gt;&gt; HINDMAN: Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:57.992
&gt;&gt; HINDMAN: All right.
