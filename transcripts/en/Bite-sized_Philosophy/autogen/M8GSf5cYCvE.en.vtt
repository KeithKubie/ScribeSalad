00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.120
 Let's say you are socially anxious. 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.360
 Ok so what happens if you are socially anxious? 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.280
 You go to a party, your heart starts beating faster. 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.120
 Why? 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.320
 The party is a monster. Why? 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.680
 Because it rated you. 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.440
 And it judges you, it places you low below the dominance hierarchy. 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.160
 Because that is a negative judgment. 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.340
 And that disrupts your sexual success. 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.840
 And that means that you are being evaluated in part by nature itself. 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.480
 That's right, so you're not confronting the Chaos dragon when you're in a social situation. 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:33.780
 So what do you do? 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.260
 You do this, you bend over. 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.600
 And that radiates low dominance, I am not a danger. 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.700
 You won't get far with that. 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.740
 But that is the most logical thing to do, as opposed to a tyrant 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.120
 "I am not a danger" 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.040
 You look at the king and you are dead 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.240
 I am not a danger, I lean forward. 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.260
 And then what happens inside 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.000
 "What do people think of me? What do people think about me?" 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.360
 "Do I look stupid?" 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.120
 "I look stupid, dear, I'm weird, I hate it here, man I'm sweating too much." 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.440
 It is all internalized. It is all self-focus. 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.520
 The eye is not working. 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.760
 What do you tell these people 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.060
 do NOT stop thinking about yourself, because that will not work. 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.940
 Just like, do NOT think of a white elephant. 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.180
 White elephant, white elephant, white elephant 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.120
 You can't tell people not to think about anything, because then they end up in a loop. 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.960
 What you do with socially anxious people is you say 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.880
 Look at other people 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.680
 Look at them 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.200
 Right. Why? 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.580
 Because if you look at them you can see what they think. 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.600
 And, unless you are very poorly socialized, and some people are, some people don't have social skills and so 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.100
 The reason they can't go to a party is because they don't know how to introduce themselves. 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.120
 No one has ever explained to them how to behave. 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.080
 And so they are a good 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.820
 candidate for behavioral therapy. Because you can let them walk through the process how you actually do 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.520
 express the procedures necessary for social acceptance. 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.420
 But most people are not like that, they can. 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.340
 So if they are very introverted and high in neuroticism 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.000
 Then they can talk pretty well with someone one on one. 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.120
 Why? 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.380
 Because you look at them! 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.840
 When I look at you 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.500
 That's something you can do if you have to talk to a group of people 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.940
 NEVER talk to the GROUP of people. 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.640
 That does not exist 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.800
 You talk to individuals. 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.380
 And they reflect the entire group for you 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.720
 Because they are all taken away 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.420
 So you look at one person 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.480
 They radiate what everyone thinks. And you know how to talk to one person. 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.900
 So that's easy 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.740
 So 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.460
 As soon as you focus on the person and not on yourself 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.020
 Push your attention outside, use your eyes to push your attention outside. 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.660
 And you start paying attention, well then all automatic mechanisms start working 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.540
 And then you stop acting weird. Because when we talk, and I look here- 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.360
 I don't know what you're going to do 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.540
 And I place disturbances in - 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.760
 They are bad agreements in our 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.480
 In our conversation. And the reason is, I don't pay attention. 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.740
 So that's why the eye is at the top of the pyramid. 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.300
 What makes it possible to win all sets in the dominance hierarchy is the eye. Pay attention! 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.340
 Pay attention. 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.820
 That's the point 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.200
 That is why the Egyptians worshiped Horus 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.600
 That's why Horus was the one who saved Osiris from the deep. 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.560
 It is the capacity to watch out for 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.920
 What attracts your attention the most? 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.100
 * KLAP * 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.580
 What your right hemisphere indicates as abnormal. 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.620
 It attracts your attention. 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.060
 This is not going very well. 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.740
 I don't have to look at that. 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.020
 WRONG! 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.680
 You have to look at that! 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.780
 You have to look at that! 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.900
 Which is not going well, because that- 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.840
 That is the terrible monster that you may eat, but it is also the place where you get all the information. 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.940
 So 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.860
 That is why it is useful to have discussions with your enemies 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.160
 Because they tell you things you don't know yet 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.160
 And that's such a good thing, because if you don't know that 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.160
 Then you're not that smart, are you? 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.020
 There may come a time when you had to know that 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.080
 And maybe your enemies tell you why you're so stupid 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.560
 And maybe some other things that aren't true 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.600
 But 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.460
 Even if it's one thing that's right, man, thank you, maybe I can still work on that 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.440
 And, then I no longer have to carry that with me 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.600
 So, that is partly the reason why the predator 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.080
 It is always the predator that has the gold. 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.820
 It is the person who has a message that you would rather not hear. 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.700
 So it's hard, it's hard. But that doesn't matter, life is hard
