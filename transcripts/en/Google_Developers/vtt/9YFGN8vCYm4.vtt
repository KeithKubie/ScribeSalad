TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hi, everybody.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.226
Thank you.

00:00:15.226 --> 00:00:16.309
I have a cheering section.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.690
That's amazing.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.750
How's everybody doing?

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.850
Having a good I/O?

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.080
Just got a few more
sessions to go.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.040
I'm glad that you made
it out to this point.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.920
I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.730
And this is Ubiquitous
Computing with Google.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.400
Now, we've all been
talking a lot lately

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.740
about ubiquitous computing,
IOT, wearables, and so on.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.060
And there's a lot we're going
to be able to do together

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.870
to help make our users'
relationship to technology

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:42.530
better.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.490
And this is the next step.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.060
Before I get
started, please know

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.180
that you can give me feedback.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.010
The I/O overlords
would like to know

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.640
what you think of this
and similar content

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.000
and this session in particular.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.740
So just head over
to the schedule

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.036
either on the app or the web.

00:00:57.036 --> 00:00:58.160
And tell us what you think.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:01.090
OK.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.160
So a year ago, I stood on
this or a very similar stage.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.320
And I talked to you about
wearable computing with Google.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.650
I put forth this
idea of computing

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.030
that was more about the
user than the device

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.490
that they carried.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.290
And we explored the implications
of that and code design

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.240
by looking at the
problem through NPC,

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.115
simple and straightforward,
thinking about the space.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.160
Today, we're going to take
those ideas and build upon them.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.417
In this session, we're
going to take a deeper look

00:01:30.417 --> 00:01:31.875
at the platforms
and tools that can

00:01:31.875 --> 00:01:34.750
make your app available on
a variety of form factors,

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.450
not just across wearables,
but something that's available

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.430
on your television and
in your car and someday,

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.900
even more places.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.350
And we'll explore the
implications of that design

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.250
through code that you can
check out and compile today.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.080
Let's get started.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.980
So first off, what is
ubiquitous computing?

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.520
It's simply a fancy
phrase for technology

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.370
that's accessible to the user
whenever and wherever they

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.780
want or need it.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.260
That's it.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.320
It could be outside when
they're going for a bike ride

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.949
or having some friends
over to watch cat videos.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:13.830
Or maybe it's time
for a road trip.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.050
Your users can be in
any of those situations.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.700
And you don't want them to have
to think about what device they

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.870
need to get to your service.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.410
Instead, you're going to want an
experience that presents itself

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.120
to the user wherever
it makes sense

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.702
by building an app that
runs on whatever device

00:02:29.702 --> 00:02:30.410
they have nearby.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.520
And many people look at
the evolution of computing

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.050
like this.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.570
It's always about the next
device-- big computer,

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.190
little computer,
littler computer.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.180
What's the next thing in
this linear progression?

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.310
But really, our
present and future

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.791
looks quite a bit different.

00:02:51.791 --> 00:02:55.500
It looks a lot more
like this, right?

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.301
We use a bunch of technology
in different ways.

00:02:58.301 --> 00:02:59.800
And we often do
that simultaneously.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.270
In fact, the growth of
these connected devices

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:06.870
is staggering.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.215
Although the number
in 2020 depends

00:03:09.215 --> 00:03:12.230
on who you ask-- it can be
a little bit different--

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.195
It's always more
than you can imagine.

00:03:14.195 --> 00:03:15.820
Now, I didn't throw
out the units here.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.070
Does anybody want to tell
me what the units are there?

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:21.400
Millions?

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.850
It's billions.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.665
200 billion devices in 2020.

00:03:26.665 --> 00:03:29.290
And you can actually break this
number down because 200 billion

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.900
is sort of like this
abstract number.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.330
Think of it this way.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:40.340
26 smart devices for every
human on the planet in 2020.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.250
A lot.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.310
But not everybody has 26 in
their pockets at the same time,

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.810
right?

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.420
This is across industries.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.270
But think about the number of
devices that are going to be

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.145
and already are in our world.

00:03:55.691 --> 00:03:56.940
Here's another number for you.

00:03:59.742 --> 00:04:03.010
Hey, this is really interesting,
especially for us, right?

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.630
Gartner has estimated
half of IOT solutions

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.030
will be from startups
less than three years old.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.460
Half.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.340
So the question really is,
have you already started

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.430
building for this reality?

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.470
The good news is it's not that
hard to deal with, not as hard

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.280
as it might seem.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.260
The explosion in form factors
is manageable by having

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.790
a strong core platform that
lends itself to extensibility.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.280
So you can think less about a
new project for each new device

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.205
and more about a
versatile solution

00:04:36.205 --> 00:04:39.120
that you can extend
for new form factors

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.940
as they become available.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.040
And these platforms that
help you, they exist today.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.760
I'm going to show you a
working example in a bit.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.550
But before we dig
into some code,

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.710
this is what it
looks like logically.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.640
Now, the traditional approach
to supporting different devices

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.590
is to make an app for
each device and platform

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.995
as they become available
and adopted by users.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.560
Like my animation?

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.960
This has typically
meant a new project

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.210
for each and every device
developed and supported

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.610
independently.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:15.510
Just crazy.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.110
And the ironic thing is that
we as developers are already

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.510
thinking about this
experience as part

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.900
of a single whole experience
for the user across devices.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.900
It's just silly to approach
these as separate projects.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.440
Instead, you want to take
the longer lens view.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.670
Think about having a view
into your service from each

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.090
and every device
that makes sense.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.000
Your model and controller
are on a central device

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.020
or in the cloud.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.495
But then the wearable,
in the living room,

00:05:42.495 --> 00:05:45.950
in the car's a different
view into that service.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.160
And this is the definition
of ubiquitous computing

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.040
again, right?

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.920
It's where your
service is available

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.246
anywhere and everywhere.

00:05:54.246 --> 00:05:55.620
Now, each of you
and your service

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.090
is going to differ
slightly, right?

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.340
It's going to look a little
bit different on the wrist

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.730
than it will in the car.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.750
And that's what you want
to spend your time on.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.830
You don't want to have to
spend your time on figuring out

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.590
the glue in between
all these things.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.100
So what we'll do is we'll
jump right into best practices

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.520
here so that we can think
about how to conceptualize

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.830
that experience.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.020
And people no longer
need to sit at a desk

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.040
to get the benefits
of technology.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.820
Experiences that we build
can do more than just

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.510
allow for that usage, right?

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:31.160
As I've been saying, they
can assume that usage

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.160
throughout the day
and in the world.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.530
They can do more
than just work nicely

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.400
with existing
technology in our lives.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.550
They can work seamlessly
across all of it.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.490
Now, with that in mind,
these best practices

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.880
will help us navigate the
issues, big and small,

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.660
that we develop in this way.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.525
And a note about
these best practices

00:06:50.525 --> 00:06:52.420
is that they're
guidelines that apply

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.110
to your experience
on each device

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.400
as well as the greater
experience across all devices,

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.700
which is a great litmus test
for best practices in this area.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.399
And make them great for
ubiquitous computing

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:06.190
when you're thinking
about both the smaller

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.750
picture and the bigger
picture across everything

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.560
at the same time.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.470
The first one is sort
of obvious, simple.

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:15.940
Now, think about it this way.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:18.800
The user experience
should be so simple

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.500
that it feels effortless,
almost magical.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.070
In the long run,
users always prefer

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:31.070
simplicity and reliability
over quantity of features.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:33.250
Whatever user problem
you solve, make

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.010
sure to address
that really well.

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:38.690
And never get in the
way of that solution.

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.180
A great example of this
is a messaging app.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.510
I love messaging
on Android Wear.

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:44.330
I get a message.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.920
And I can reply by voice.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.810
It's so intuitive and simple.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:51.020
It just makes sense.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.130
The next one is contextual.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:58.830
Now, being contextual is
really about being relevant.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:03.220
Take into account the time, the
location, and even the activity

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.510
the user's involved
in to provide them

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:09.540
with the most useful experience
wherever they happen to be.

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:12.640
As an example, I love the
idea of a shopping list

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.470
that automatically comes
up as I get into the store

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:20.030
and, before I leave, maybe sends
me a notification of any items

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:21.690
I might have missed.

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:24.980
In this case, we're providing
information to the user

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.090
before they have to
ask because we're

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.890
taking into account their
context for them, which

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:33.690
leads me to this idea.

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:38.900
The experience should be so fast
that it should feel immediate.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.610
Now, being contextual
can help with this.

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:45.630
But it's also about
micro-interactions.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.140
Remember that you're not
trying to distract and occupy

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:49.190
the user.

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:51.260
You want to present just
the right information

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.530
right away so they
can get what they need

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:56.750
and keep living their lives.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:59.780
A great example of this is
Voice Search on Android TV.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.720
The user can say what
show they want to watch.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.880
And any app that's
set up for search

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.730
can launch that
content for them.

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:09.370
Another great example
is Auto Play and queuing

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:10.670
on Google Cast.

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:13.020
The next episode can
just come right on

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.630
so the user doesn't
have to stop and find it

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.400
when they're binge watching.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.930
I do on the weekends.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:23.060
The last thing is extensible.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:24.820
And you're going to
want to build your app

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:28.630
and experience to be as
extensible as possible.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:31.010
Where are the places
that your user will want

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:33.760
to user service in the future?

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.980
And how can you build
that into your core app

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:40.040
now so that the overall
experience that the user has

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:45.600
is in hand whenever and wherever
it makes sense for them?

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.410
So those are them.

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.750
Oh, an example of this-- music.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:52.120
I love listening to
music wherever I want.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.630
And it turns out, I think,
everybody's that way.

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:57.460
That might be at home
in the living room.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:02.860
That might be on the go while
I'm on a run or in the car.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:04.920
So there you are-- a
handful of principles

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.880
to help you refine the design
of your user experience

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:12.330
and reach your users in
an undeniably useful way.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.220
That's really key.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.890
We found when working
with developers

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:18.990
that these guidelines help the
most when working with new form

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:21.060
factors, understanding
right away how

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.650
to contextualize and measure
your work for success.

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:27.330
And that's why we created
a design sprint technique

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.940
for learning the design
principles for new form factors

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.220
in particular.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.620
The material for one
of these design sprints

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.410
was just launched
yesterday morning

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:37.190
on developers.google.com.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.320
And many of you who
arrived a session early

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.150
may have found a play
book on your seat.

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:45.670
Design sprints are a great
way to learn immediately

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:49.930
and to try out design principles
for these new form factors.

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:52.087
And then you can apply
them to your own project

00:10:52.087 --> 00:10:53.420
with the comfort of familiarity.

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:57.550
All right.

00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:00.440
Let's look at a practical
solution, shall we?

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.990
One that you can
download, compile, adjust,

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:04.050
and learn from.

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:07.370
A sample code usually just
shows you a narrow view

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:09.630
at a partial solution,
which is great

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:12.210
if you want to know just
how one thing works.

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:15.550
However, when you want to see
how everything fits together,

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.882
you need a fully
functioning example.

00:11:17.882 --> 00:11:19.840
And this is particularly
important for building

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.050
across devices because how
everything fits together

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:25.430
is the thing.

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:28.820
And we recently released a
simple but complete app just

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.280
for this purpose.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.855
This is not the
only kind of thing

00:11:31.855 --> 00:11:33.650
that you can build
to be ubiquitous.

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:34.430
Remember that.

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:37.560
But rather, it's just a
look at one kind of app

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:41.490
and how it can be built
with these ideas in mind.

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.254
The universal
Android Music Player.

00:11:43.254 --> 00:11:45.420
Remember I was just talking
about listening to music

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:46.280
everywhere?

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.250
This app helps you do that.

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:56.160
And it works on your phone,
your watch, your television--

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:03.950
both Android TV soon and Google
Cast-- and of course, your car.

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:06.750
And it's completely
open source on GitHub.

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:07.490
There's the URL.

00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:12.980
Now, let's say you
have a media app that's

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:14.410
built around an activity.

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:15.430
This is pretty common.

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:20.200
And that was just fine
for an app on a device.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.660
But if you want to support more
devices, what you usually do

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.800
is you either expand
that activity,

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:30.290
or you create new ones
for each new device.

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:33.620
That's still not so bad until
you realize that you probably

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:36.880
have to revisit your
app's overall design each

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.070
and every time to coordinate
new message passing, play

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:41.930
locks, and that kind of thing.

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:46.220
Instead, you're going to want a
solid core central service that

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:49.670
extends easily to
each new form factor.

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:54.260
There's an Android API that
makes this straightforward.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.640
UAMP is built around this
media browser service and media

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.400
session.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.470
So this is a way that you would
build your app on Lollipop

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:05.060
so that you could have media
keep playing in the background,

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:08.060
be controlled from the
lock screen, and so forth.

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.520
It's also a great way to
allow multiple devices

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.880
to act as consumers
of a central service

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:16.124
rather than everything built
in activities that need

00:13:16.124 --> 00:13:17.290
to independently coordinate.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:23.430
The media browser service
maintains a tree structure

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:26.860
of all your media, such
as a collection of music.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:31.290
And this could be either
streamed or stored locally.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.950
Media Session tracks
the current state

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:37.200
of what your app is playing.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.160
Now, here's where
it gets interesting.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.350
Everything, whether
it's your phone app,

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:43.730
Android TV, Android
Auto-- they're

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:46.960
all consumers of the Media
Browser Service and Media

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.840
Session.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.620
Let's say you've got
your phone hooked up

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:54.160
to Android Auto like this.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.710
So the companion app
on the left, that's

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:58.640
the Android Auto Companion app.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:02.170
And that app is responsible
for drawing the user interface

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:05.660
and sending those pixels
to the vehicle display.

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:10.010
This app also connects to
the Media Browser Service.

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:11.970
And it queries it to
get the tree structure

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:14.280
of your apps media library.

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.940
The driver of the car
then selects the song,

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.630
either the touch screen
or through voice search,

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:22.390
and then Android Auto
will use Media Session

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:24.560
to run your callbacks.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.810
And this is great on Android
Auto because as a developer,

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:30.010
you never have to worry
about the details of making

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:31.980
a user interface that's
safe for driving.

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:34.270
Android Auto takes care
of all of that for you.

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:37.710
It just needs the music service
available to get the data

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:40.460
and handle playback.

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.900
And the app on the left,
it could be anything.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.360
It could be Android Wear .

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.530
It could be just another
activity in your same app

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:49.110
handling Android TV.

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:51.380
Or maybe it's
handling Google Cast.

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:54.660
Any of these will work
because of how it's set up.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:57.880
We don't have to rewire the
app each and every time we

00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.370
add a new form factor.

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:02.060
Instead, we have this
solid central service

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:05.480
that extends easily to
each new form factor.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.400
You simply access
the music service

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:12.424
for any context that
makes sense for your user.

00:15:12.424 --> 00:15:13.840
Now, remember what
I said earlier.

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.080
This is certainly
not the only way

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.460
to make a ubiquitous app or
the only ubiquitous app that

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:19.380
makes sense.

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:20.810
It simply gives
you an idea of how

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:23.140
to structure a common
app such as a music

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.210
player for extensibility.

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:27.410
The specific APIs
you use are of course

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:29.440
going to depend
on your use case,

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.330
how you implement the best
practices we talked about,

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.909
and where you keep your
model and your controller.

00:15:34.909 --> 00:15:35.950
It could be on the phone.

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:37.070
It could be in the cloud.

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:39.320
It could be wherever that
make sense for your service.

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:44.420
Let's take a look at
a few examples of apps

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:46.450
shipped and available
to users that are

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:50.420
doing this kind of thing today.

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:55.600
iHeartRadio-- it brings radio,
music, news, podcasts, sports,

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.220
and more to users.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.432
And you can even make
your own custom stations.

00:15:59.432 --> 00:16:00.140
It's easy to use.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:00.723
And it's free.

00:16:00.723 --> 00:16:01.860
I love this app.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.790
And best of all--
my favorite thing--

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:07.350
it's available wherever I go.

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:08.510
It's on Android Wear.

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:10.110
You can Cast to your TV.

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:11.650
You can even use it in the car.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.090
Another great app is
WhatsApp messenger.

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:18.010
It's great for messaging,
sending photos,

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:20.200
group chat, and a lot more.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.110
And it's been available for
phones for a long while.

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:26.330
And it's also available on
Android Wear and Android Auto.

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:28.950
Do you see the pattern here?

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:31.190
This is one of those
applications like music

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:33.340
where you expect it
to work everywhere.

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.357
And it does.

00:16:35.357 --> 00:16:37.440
You can keep the conversation
going whether you're

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.410
waiting in line with your phone,
on a walk with your watch,

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:42.150
or a quick road
trip with your car.

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:46.770
And last, Cookbook.

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:50.310
Cookbook aims to bring users
the joy of cooking and sharing

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:53.130
with Recipe Search,
calculated prep time, shopping

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:54.200
list, and more.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.800
And if you're like me, you
like to get everything as messy

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.300
in the kitchen as
possible, which

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:03.110
is great because it works on
all the things I can get messy.

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:05.839
It works on the phone.

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:08.740
You can also load your recipes
up on your watch or your TV,

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.310
as well.

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:13.920
Now, if you'd like to do
with your app what these apps

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.260
have done.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.150
you can find a lot more detail
on the Ubiquitous Computing

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:20.780
course that's launching on
Udacity in the coming weeks.

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.420
It's part of the
Android Nano degree.

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:24.880
And it's going to be
available very soon.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.780
It covers wearables,
living room,

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:29.260
and auto in much more detail
than we talked about today.

00:17:39.436 --> 00:17:40.810
There's an old
saying that I keep

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:43.990
coming back to when we're
thinking about this space.

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:45.830
Sometimes, when building
apps-- and we're

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:48.040
all guilty of this--
we forget to see

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.880
the forest for the
trees, which is to say,

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.900
we get so focused on that
one thing in front of us

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.630
that we forget
that we're building

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:58.390
a relationship with the
user across their lives,

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:01.500
across their technology.

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.450
And to be really valuable, we
should be present in their life

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:07.460
whenever it makes sense to them.

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:10.150
To this end, we should
build with ubiquity in mind

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:13.500
from the beginning and extend
to new form factors over time.

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.472
And the tools and
design knowledge

00:18:15.472 --> 00:18:17.180
that are required for
this are available.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:18.471
And they're at your fingertips.

00:18:18.471 --> 00:18:20.450
We just need to get started.

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:24.110
And then we're going to find
out how much further we can go.

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:26.290
For example, the Works
with Nest program

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:29.965
is making the potential of
the thoughtful home real.

00:18:29.965 --> 00:18:31.990
You can learn more
on their website.

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:36.150
Also, announced yesterday
was project Brillo.

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:39.070
This is an operating system
for the internet of things.

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:42.190
It's derived from Android
and able to run on devices

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:44.490
with a minimal footprint.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:46.740
Core functionality
includes connectivity

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:48.010
and scaled management.

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:50.080
And of course, when
you pair with Weave,

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.910
also talked about yesterday,
setup and discovery

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:56.540
becomes effortless for the user.

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.860
And devices can
all be compatible

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:00.310
and work with each other.

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:04.745
This is the future
of what we do.

00:19:04.745 --> 00:19:05.870
And we should get together.

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:07.620
And we should talk
about it more.

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:11.459
So also announcing today,
we're going to do just that.

00:19:11.459 --> 00:19:13.250
I hope you can join us
for first conference

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:15.420
on ubiquitous computing
as we get together

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.900
as friends across
companies and industries

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.920
to work towards more
interoperability and ultimately

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:23.492
more value for all of our users.

00:19:23.492 --> 00:19:24.950
Please head to this
link to sign up

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:27.240
and be the first in
line to hear more.

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.616
And if you like,
let us know what

00:19:28.616 --> 00:19:29.864
you want from this conference.

00:19:29.864 --> 00:19:30.880
Maybe you want to speak.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.950
Or maybe there's another way
you want to get involved.

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:34.033
Let's build this together.

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:40.590
Please dive in and learn
so that you can reach

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:42.589
your users in even more places.

00:19:42.589 --> 00:19:45.130
And we can really start to have
a deep conversation about all

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:46.800
these things.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:50.350
Now, over here in
the area to my right,

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:52.540
you'll see all these people
in lovely red shirts.

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.540
We're actually going
to be taking Q&amp;A

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:56.020
as a group out in the sandbox.

00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:57.390
We hope you join us there.

00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:58.450
We can play with devices.

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:00.300
We can talk about
your specific apps.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:03.290
And we can really engage
in a conversation right out

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:04.520
in the sandbox.

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.480
Thank you very much.
