00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.890
The connection between logic and
human cognition is interesting.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.720
Logic is a very important school of
thought in AI, for several reasons.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.660
One reason is that logic provides a very
formal and precise way of reasoning.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.190
Another reason is that logic provides
a formal notation for expressing how

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.530
intelligent agents reason, whether or
not they're using logical reasoning.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.840
But does this mean that logic
is also the basis of cognition?

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.100
It suddenly appears that humans
use logic some of the time.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.910
For example,

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.510
I may have a statement like if I get
a big bonus, I'll take a long vacation.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.250
I did get a big bonus, therefore I
may infer I'll take a long vacation.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.108
This is clearly.

00:00:48.478 --> 00:00:52.721
But simply because of a behavior appears
to be logical, does not necessarily

00:00:52.721 --> 00:00:56.130
imply that we use logic as
a fundamental reasoning strategy.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.570
I might solve a new problem, by analogy
to a previously encountered problem,

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.310
I did not use logic, but
my behavior appears to be logical.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.830
The logic that we have considered so
far is deductive logic.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.880
But a lot of human reasoning is
inductive or abductive in its character.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.440
If you haven't come across
an abductive so far,

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.560
we will discuss in detail
later in the class.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.930
Deduction has to do with
reasonings from causes to effects.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.850
Abduction has to do with
reasoning from effects to causes.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.950
When you go to a doctor,
you go with some signs and symptoms.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.290
Those are the effects.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.330
The doctor comes up with
a disease category.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.990
That's the cause.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.970
Abduction is reasoning from
data to an explanation

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.820
to a disease category for the data.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.210
Induction is given some relationship
between cause and effect for a sample.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.010
How do we generalize it between
a cause and effect relationship for

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.590
a population?

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.360
So while human reasoning appears to be
inductive and abductive in character

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.970
much of the time, the logic that we
have considered so far is deductive.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.840
That's yet another issue that we'll
return to later in the class.
