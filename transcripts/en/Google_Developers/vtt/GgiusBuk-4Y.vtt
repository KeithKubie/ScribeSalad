LAURENCE MORONEY: Welcome
to the Googleplex.

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.880
This is an incredible place
with lots of great stuff being

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.670
worked on every single day.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.660
Before I worked here,
I always wondered

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.960
what it be like to
come to the Googleplex,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.560
meet up with a Googler,
and have coffee with them,

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.090
and just chat about what
they do, how they do it,

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.120
and why they do it.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.120
And today we're going
to do exactly that.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.180
So welcome to this episode
of "Coffee with a Googler."

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.679
And one of the things that we've
been doing since we started

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:29.514
the show is we've been
asking about which

00:00:29.514 --> 00:00:30.930
Googlers you'd
like to speak with,

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.417
which Googlers you'd like me
to have a conversation with,

00:00:33.417 --> 00:00:35.250
and what kind of topics
we could talk about.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.291
And the first name that
came up was Colt McAnlis.

00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:39.490
He's also the name that
came up the most often.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.200
So Colt, you're finally with us.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.700
Thank you.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.090
Congratulations.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.700
COLT MCANLIS: Thank you.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.270
So I just want to make
sure that this is clear.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.853
I want to make sure
I understand this.

00:00:45.853 --> 00:00:48.852
I outranked Larry
Page to be here.

00:00:48.852 --> 00:00:50.310
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Your page rank is

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.490
higher than Larry Page's rank.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.390
COLT MCANLIS: Thank you,
community, for voting me here.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.389
I mean, what does Larry
have to talk about?

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:58.680
LAURENCE MORONEY: I don't know.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.475
I will talk about
it with him someday,

00:01:00.475 --> 00:01:01.850
and we'll see what
he has to say.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.660
And I'd love to hear what
he has to say about you.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.040
COLT MCANLIS: You shouldn't
probably ask him about me.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.210
LAURENCE MORONEY: I'll give
it a try and we'll see.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.210
COLT MCANLIS: OK.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.870
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So Colt, you're

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.380
a developer advocate
here at Google.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.180
And tell us, what is a developer
advocate and what do they do?

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.170
COLT MCANLIS: Well, it's this
really weird hybrid role,

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.670
right?

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.080
I mean, we're all very
technically inclined people

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.880
who know very technical stuff.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.190
But in reality, we've
got to spit out content.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.539
We're kind of like
talking sock puppets.

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:27.580
LAURENCE MORONEY: Indeed.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.610
COLT MCANLIS: Yes.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.880
LAURENCE MORONEY: To
be sure, to be sure.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.588
COLT MCANLIS: I feel
for Kermit the Frog.

00:01:31.588 --> 00:01:32.894
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yes, me too.

00:01:32.894 --> 00:01:35.310
I think he's angry because
he's got your hand up his butt.

00:01:41.247 --> 00:01:42.830
COLT MCANLIS: Well,
tell me, Laurence.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.955
What do you think about
the developer advocacy role

00:01:44.955 --> 00:01:46.510
and how you approach it's craft?

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.170
LAURENCE MORONEY: You
know, one of the ways

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.378
that I like to approach it
is really enriching people

00:01:49.378 --> 00:01:50.380
through video.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.820
I have this show
where I'm a host,

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.800
and I call it "Coffee
with a Googler."

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.202
Wait, what?

00:01:57.202 --> 00:01:59.160
So Colt is a developer
advocate here at Google.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.460
And there's lots of
ways that one can

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.710
be an advocate for developers.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.584
And Colt, you've got
some pretty unique stuff

00:02:03.584 --> 00:02:04.779
that you've been working on.

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:05.820
Can you tell us about it?

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.320
COLT MCANLIS: You
know, I really try

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.699
to find the stuff that
helps developers that's

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.190
not part of our normal rigor.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.545
So we talk about APIs a lot.

00:02:13.545 --> 00:02:14.920
We talk about the
platform a lot.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.300
We talk about how the
new stuff is coming out.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.008
But there's a lot of
things that are just

00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:21.940
core and fundamental to making
and building great applications

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.190
that kind of fall through
the cracks, that no one else

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.429
is really covering.

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:27.970
And to be honest, I really like
to focus a lot of my advocacy

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:28.897
in those rare areas.

00:02:28.897 --> 00:02:30.730
LAURENCE MORONEY: Like
I know some examples.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.260
You've been working on the
"Compressor Head" and "Android

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.507
Performance Patterns."

00:02:34.507 --> 00:02:35.840
Tell us about "Compressor Head."

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.110
I mean, I keep hearing there's
this TV show out there.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.960
And did you get
the idea from them,

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.760
or did they get
the idea from you,

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.750
those folks in Silicon Valley?

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.120
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah, so
"Compressor Head," for those

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.020
who may not have seen it,
is a show about compression

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.760
that we do on the Google
Developers channel.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.280
And effectively, it's me trying
to distill these really crazy

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.040
complex algorithms that
drive everything we

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.490
do in computers now-- like every
bit you see on a mobile device

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.780
has been compressed
at this point--

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.470
and distill the algorithms down.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.310
Because for some reason, the
art and science of compression

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.509
really has fallen away from
the education that we've done.

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:18.550
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now,
some people might say that

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.341
with bandwidth getting
increasingly cheaper

00:03:20.341 --> 00:03:22.950
and storage getting increasingly
cheaper, compression

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.517
isn't really that important.

00:03:24.517 --> 00:03:25.850
What would you think about that?

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.090
COLT MCANLIS: I
wholeheartedly challenge that.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.040
You have to remember that
software and data is a gas,

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.870
right?

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.710
It will grow to fill whatever
container we put it in.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.980
And we're going through
this great industrial boom

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.510
right now where hardware
costs are coming down.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.932
But that is not something that's
going to continue indefinitely.

00:03:44.932 --> 00:03:46.390
If you watch the
way that computing

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.827
has worked over
the past 50 years,

00:03:47.827 --> 00:03:49.410
you end up with these
booms and busts.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.334
You get a huge jump
in processing power.

00:03:51.334 --> 00:03:53.000
And then that will
level off for a while

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.340
until a new technology
comes around

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.650
and you get a huge one again.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.989
And we're seeing that
with data right now.

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.530
And you also have to remember
that while our data centers are

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.790
getting larger and where we
host our content gets larger,

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.190
the medium between the
cell tower and your phone

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.050
is not growing at
that same rate.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.390
I mean, you have to remember
that almost half of America

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.180
is still on a 2G network.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.204
Worldwide, 2G is like
the king's knees.

00:04:19.204 --> 00:04:20.870
That's the best they
can get, especially

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.670
for the next 5 billion humans
that are coming online.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.672
They're not going to
be on 4G LTE networks.

00:04:25.672 --> 00:04:26.880
LAURENCE MORONEY: Absolutely.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.670
COLT MCANLIS: If
you're someone that's

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.950
trying to create a strategy
around getting the most

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.750
users to your content, trying
to build an ecosystem that's

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.250
data driven in their
social networks

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.010
for these next 5
billion users, you

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.380
can't rely on data centers
and all these other hardware.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.920
You have to compress your data.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.060
We talk a little bit
about this in the show.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.090
There's a couple
different spots where

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.460
we talk about these things.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.760
In fact, I think we
have the clip of it.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.280
LAURENCE MORONEY: We
have a clip, yeah.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.710
Jimmy, can you run the clip?

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.168
COLT MCANLIS: The move-to-front
algorithm is pretty simple.

00:04:50.168 --> 00:04:53.520
For each symbol we read,
we write its output buffer

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.625
position, and then move it
to the front of our buffer.

00:04:56.625 --> 00:04:59.580
Now, for example, if
we input the letter N,

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.312
that sits at position 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,

00:05:04.312 --> 00:05:06.470
13, 14.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.491
So we write that to
our output stream.

00:05:08.491 --> 00:05:10.615
LAURENCE MORONEY: So it's
a pretty complex subject,

00:05:10.615 --> 00:05:11.890
and you're teaching
it quite simply.

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.194
Is that the theme of the show?

00:05:13.194 --> 00:05:14.110
Is that how you do it?

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.000
COLT MCANLIS: That's
exactly what it was.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.170
I mean, we're using
Lego blocks in there.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.940
The whole concept
came from, how do we

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.810
take this really complex
idea and break it down

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.020
to be able to teach it with
sticky notes and Play-Doh

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.820
and Lego blocks?

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.290
Because we've got kids,
and we're constantly

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.290
teaching things to kids.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.620
And so I figured if this method
works on three-year-olds,

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.914
obviously it'll work on
programmers-- no offense.

00:05:35.914 --> 00:05:37.330
So yeah, that's
the whole gimmick.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.520
That's the whole
point of the show.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.330
How complex can we
get from an algorithm

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.660
and how can we teach it with
Play-Doh and sticky notes?

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.470
LAURENCE MORONEY: So now as
well as "Compressor Head,"

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.844
you talk a lot
about performance.

00:05:45.844 --> 00:05:47.745
And you have your
perfmatters hashtag

00:05:47.745 --> 00:05:49.620
and your "Android
Performance Patterns" show.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.078
And I think you've just finished
up another season of that.

00:05:52.078 --> 00:05:52.787
Tell us about it.

00:05:52.787 --> 00:05:54.744
COLT MCANLIS: So "Android
Performance Patterns"

00:05:54.744 --> 00:05:56.830
is, again, one of those
gap filling initiatives.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.880
Everyone has to care
about performance.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.340
If you're shipping
an application,

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.130
users leave feedback about
bad performing applications

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.010
in a negative manner three
times more than anything else

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.120
in your app, more than if they
don't like your social media

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.970
is laid out, or they
don't like how long it

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.400
takes to download something,
or just your UI is bad.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.700
That's like crickets.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.400
However, if you're slow,
or if it feels laggy,

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.870
man, people just hate it.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.842
It's just the truth
of the industry.

00:06:24.842 --> 00:06:26.800
LAURENCE MORONEY: And
negative reviews, I mean,

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.950
everybody wants to avoid that.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:28.866
COLT MCANLIS: Exactly.

00:06:28.866 --> 00:06:31.451
And you can't fix that with
chiming back with people.

00:06:31.451 --> 00:06:33.700
You just have to fundamentally
fix that at your level.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.116
And "Android
Performance Patterns"

00:06:35.116 --> 00:06:37.169
is built around that gap.

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:38.710
Because you've got
the documentation,

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.047
which tells you how to use
the API and what it does.

00:06:41.047 --> 00:06:42.880
But then you really
don't have anything past

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.590
that to tell you the right way
to use it for your performance

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.672
cases across all the
devices in our ecosystem.

00:06:47.672 --> 00:06:48.630
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.546
COLT MCANLIS: Because
what works on a high end

00:06:50.546 --> 00:06:53.170
Android device may not
work on a low end one

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:56.380
or on a different device type
or form factor or something.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.060
LAURENCE MORONEY: So what are
the typical performance gotchas

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.180
that people have that you might
help them avoid with the show?

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.886
COLT MCANLIS: So there's three
big pillars of performance

00:07:02.886 --> 00:07:04.010
that we like to talk about.

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:07.410
So you can either have rendering
problems-- so for example,

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.704
overdrawing too many pixels
on the screen at one time.

00:07:09.704 --> 00:07:12.370
So this means you're going to be
wasting GPU and CPU cycle time.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.310
We've also got memory problems.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.690
So this is the quintessential
programmer issue--

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:20.049
using too many memories, kicking
off garbage collection events.

00:07:20.049 --> 00:07:22.090
In fact, I think we actually
have a clip of that.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:23.048
We have a clip of that.

00:07:23.048 --> 00:07:25.410
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK, can we
run the clip please, Jimmy?

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:27.576
COLT MCANLIS: Even though
you're in a managed memory

00:07:27.576 --> 00:07:29.330
environment,
improperly using memory

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.110
can still kick off a load
of performance problems.

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:34.850
And allocating too many
objects in a short time frame

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.720
is a clear problem that
you should be aware of.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.520
You have to remember that
the memory heap in Android

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.070
is segmented up
into separate spaces

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.390
based upon what type of
allocation is occurring.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:47.640
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK, so in
that scene, we saw memory.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.880
And earlier, we were
talking about graphics.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.190
And the third one--
is it battery?

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:50.940
COLT MCANLIS:
Battery, that's right.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.590
I gotta tell you,
one of the things

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:55.360
that we all hate with our
mobile devices right now is

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.070
you can't get through a day
without needing to recharge.

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:01.060
I mean, you're doing cool stuff,
and you need to get it done.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.914
But the fact is
that most developers

00:08:02.914 --> 00:08:05.330
aren't thinking enough about
how to optimize their battery

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:05.829
performance.

00:08:05.829 --> 00:08:07.930
And we talk a great
deal about the things

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:10.070
that developers need
to do to keep users'

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:11.320
batteries lasting longer.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.312
And I think we all
benefit from that.

00:08:13.312 --> 00:08:14.520
LAURENCE MORONEY: Absolutely.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.680
That's more than just negative
reviews and avoiding them.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.460
That's actually making
someone's life a little better.

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.630
COLT MCANLIS: It's a
little karma, really.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:21.810
I mean, as a developer, you
want to get that good karma.

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:22.830
It's doing the right thing.

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.330
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Speaking of karma,

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.190
I keep hearing about
this Perf Like a Pirate.

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.566
I mean, there's good pirates,
and there's bad pirates.

00:08:29.566 --> 00:08:31.440
And this seems to be
one of the good pirates.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:31.900
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.169
LAURENCE MORONEY: So what's this
whole Perf Like a Pirate thing?

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:35.520
I've always wanted to go, arr.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.224
So now I get to.

00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:37.890
COLT MCANLIS: (PIRATE
VOICE) Yar, matey.

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:39.515
You've got to do it
in the right voice.

00:08:39.515 --> 00:08:42.440
It's a little between Irish
leprechaun and British weirdo.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.087
I don't know.

00:08:44.087 --> 00:08:45.920
LAURENCE MORONEY: That
sounds a lot like me.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.560
COLT MCANLIS: Comment
in the section.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.040
So Perf Like a
Pirate was an event

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.820
that we started a
year before last.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.260
We ended up wanting to do
this event on performance

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.650
for HTML5 Users Group in
San Francisco, SFHTML5.

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:03.880
And just weird dice roll that
the event actually happened

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.342
on Talk Like a Pirate Day.

00:09:05.342 --> 00:09:06.550
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yar, I see.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:08.640
COLT MCANLIS: And no one
really thought about it.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.700
It was kind of in the
back of everyone's mind.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:10.255
And I was like, you know what?

00:09:10.255 --> 00:09:11.754
We've got to do
something with this.

00:09:11.754 --> 00:09:14.372
And so I gave my
entire talk in pirate.

00:09:14.372 --> 00:09:15.330
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:16.920
COLT MCANLIS: And so for like
the next six to eight months,

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.160
every time I would go to
a conference or something,

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.410
someone would walk by me and
be like, yar matey, do we

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:22.805
be talking about performance,
which was fantastic,

00:09:22.805 --> 00:09:24.680
because I'm like, we've
got to do this again.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:25.888
So we did it again last year.

00:09:25.888 --> 00:09:28.570
I got a huge turnout,
another great set of people.

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:30.160
And so it's just
kind of really cool

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.837
to take this really mundane
topic like performance

00:09:32.837 --> 00:09:34.920
that makes everyone's eyes
roll back in their head

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.490
and have fun with it.

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:37.970
And really more,
it's like to me,

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:40.900
that's the essence of what we
do as developer advocates is

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.360
take these really crazy,
insane things and make them

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.881
fun to learn about and fun
to bring together and change

00:09:46.881 --> 00:09:48.130
the way we do our development.

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:48.600
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Well, it certainly

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.308
has been fun having
you here today, Colt.

00:09:50.308 --> 00:09:51.880
Thank you so much for coming.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.220
