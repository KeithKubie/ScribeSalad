SPEAKER 1: Hello, I'm Jen
Person for the Developer Show.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.050
This is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.860
from Google in the last week.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.440
The Google I/O 2018 schedule
just got a big update.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.260
On it, you can find additional
sessions and code labs,

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.530
as well as new app
reviews, office hours,

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.460
and after hours events.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.500
Head on over to the
post for links and info

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.340
on how to reserve your seat
or view the live stream.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.060
For apps that target Android
P, TLS, or Transport Layer

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.760
Security, is the default. To
learn how to update your app,

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.600
including how to make clear
text connections when necessary,

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.990
take a look at the post.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.510
Chrome 67 introduces several
new features and changes

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.460
to DevTools,
including the ability

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.590
to search across
all network headers

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.460
and CSS variable value
previews in the styles pane.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.670
All the details with screen
shots are on the post.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.260
Google and Netflix recently
announced Kayenta--

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.600
an open source, automated
canary analysis service

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.000
that allows teams to
reduce risk associated

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.420
with rolling out deployments
to production at high velocity.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.430
Kayenta is integrated
with Spinnaker,

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.420
an open source, multi-cloud
continuous delivery platform.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.770
All the details and links to
get started are on the post.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.920
Google Cloud Endpoints is
a distributed API gateway

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.160
that you can use to develop,
deploy, protect, and monitor

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.260
APIs that you expose.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.530
You can now configure Cloud
Endpoints to use a new managed

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.470
rollout strategy that
automatically uses the latest

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.140
service configuration without
having to redeploy or restart

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.110
it.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.730
We recently added
version history

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.920
to Cloud Firestore
security rules.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.080
For any Cloud
Firestore project, you

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.300
can now browse all previously
published versions of rules,

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.050
view the differences between
previous and current versions,

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.120
and edit the current version.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.780
Details and screenshots
are on the post.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.230
In 2016, we introduced
Firebase Cloud Messaging,

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.970
the next evolution in
Google Cloud Messaging.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.120
It includes a host
of new features,

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.390
such as an intuitive
notifications interface

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.820
in the Firebase console,
better reporting,

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.800
and native integrations with
other Firebase products.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.620
We're excited to devote more
time and attention to improving

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.130
FCM, which is why the GCM
server and client APIs have been

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.500
deprecated and will be removed
as soon as April 11, 2019,

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.600
meaning you will need to
upgrade to FCM within a year.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.550
Of course, we recommend
you upgrade sooner

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.665
rather than later.

00:02:27.665 --> 00:02:31.930
A step-by-step migration
guide is linked from the post.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.320

I'm Jen Person for
the Developer Show.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.420
Thanks for watching.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.590
I'll see you next week.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.390
I feel like I hear Chariots of
Fire as I'm trying to do this.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.215
I'm just on that Olympic
level of saying words.
