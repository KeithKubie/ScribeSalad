[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.530
SPEAKER 1: Standing next
to me is Winifred Reilly.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.010
She is a psychotherapist
specializing in marital therapy

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.860
and relationship issues in a
private practice in Berkeley,

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.200
California.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.110
In her 35 years of
clinical practice,

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.570
she has treated
hundreds of couples,

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.810
many who are convinced
they're headed for divorce.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.060
Ms. Reilly has been a
guest lecturer on marriage

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.950
and sexuality, and
her writing has

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.680
appeared on the "Huffington
Post", "The Good Men

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.030
Project", "XO Jane," and her
blog, "Speak of Marriage".

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.210
I'm so excited that we get
to hear Winifred Reilly.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.990
Thanks.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.702
WINIFRED REILLY:
Thank you so much.

00:00:47.702 --> 00:00:49.160
So I'm going to
start first-- thank

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.243
you so much for having me.

00:00:50.243 --> 00:00:52.310
I'm going to start
first by telling you

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.320
this personal story.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.700
So my husband and I were married
early on a Sunday morning.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.450
By late that afternoon, we were
in the car driving down 101

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.450
to spend a few days
down in Big Sur.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.610
So our friends had
painted Just Married

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.470
across the back of our car.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.310
So as we're driving
along, people

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.120
are honking, and waving,
and giving the thumbs up.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.910
And then this guy
in a pick up truck

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.880
comes pulling on up to our car.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.630
And he's honking for my husband
to roll down the window.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.630
And then at about
75 miles an hour,

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.450
this guy leans across
the cab of his truck

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.410
and yells out the
window, don't do it.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.050
So I'm married, what?

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.870
Maybe five hours, six hours.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.190
And I'm thinking, nah.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.050
That'll never be us.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.520
Not the business of yelling out
of the car window at newlyweds,

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.260
but the idea that we would
be disgruntled or unhappy.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.760
It never occurred to me.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.640
Now, you'd think that I
would have known better given

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.832
my work, given that I'm a
marriage and family therapist.

00:01:59.832 --> 00:02:02.040
I mean, you'd think I would
have been better prepared

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.190
in some way for what
marriage would be.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.160
But actually, I was just
as naive and unprepared

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.240
as my clients.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.890
I had ideas that
were fairly useless,

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.980
like we have so much in
common and we're so in love.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.200
How hard could this be?

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.360
So here's what a
client of mine said

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.491
on the eve of her
third anniversary.

00:02:24.491 --> 00:02:24.990
Yeah.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.420
I know marriage takes work.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.780
Everybody knows that.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.500
I was prepared for that, and I
knew we have our difficulties.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.950
But I never, ever imagined
that the biggest difficulty

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.420
in my life would be
my husband, George.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.050
So I'm here today to talk
about my book, "It Takes One

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.550
to Tango".

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.550
I'm going to talk about
why marriage is hard,

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.400
and I'm going to
tell you a little bit

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.340
of my personal
story, how I changed

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.520
my own marriage by
taking a leadership role,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.540
and how you can create a
vibrant and satisfying loving

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.320
relationship too.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:07.610
So the question is, why
is marriage so hard?

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.220
Well, here.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.520
Marriage puts two people
into a small space

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.790
with the expectation of keeping
them there for a lifetime.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.100
And then says, good luck.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.880
Marriage doesn't come with
a guide book or a road map.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.690
And none of us come in with
all the skills that we need.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.090
Many of us have had
terrible role models.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.550
We've had parents who fought to
the death or hated each other

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.390
and finally divorced.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.290
Or we had over-idealized
romantic role models,

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.530
like grandparents who
were married 75 years

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.756
and swore they'd never
had one, single argument.

00:03:44.756 --> 00:03:46.630
Now, and then there you
are on your honeymoon

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.370
on the third day, and you're
ready to kill each other.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.000
So you've completely blown
it right out of the gate.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.050
Then we also have
mistaken ideas,

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.120
like marriage shouldn't be
hard, or people who fight

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.860
should get a divorce.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.340
Or those people look really
happy, what's wrong with us?

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.540
You know, so we have the
negative role models.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.820
There's a confusion
about the difference

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.899
between marriage and courtship.

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:20.230
Courtship is that wonderful
drunk on love beginning

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.370
phase where it's all about
sameness and loveliness.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.710
And you just can't
believe that you finally

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.580
found someone so perfect,
someone so much like you

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.530
with so much in common.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.160
And unfortunately,
courtship doesn't last.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.630
And many people really do think
that's what relationships are.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.380
So when courtship ends, they
just move on to the next one.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.830
Or when marriage gets difficult
or the long the longer

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.180
relationships start to
struggle, people think, nah.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.490
I'd better move on.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.340
So when people struggle and they
find marriage to be difficult,

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.370
what I want people to know
is that nothing is wrong.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.180
It's just that marriage
is a really tough teacher

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.280
and we all have plenty to learn.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.780
But many of us don't like
the idea of being beginners.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.610
We think, somehow,
we're supposed

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.810
to be good at everything, even
without any practice at all.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.520
Now, my graduate school training
mimicked some of these myths

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.570
about marriage that were
not particularly helpful.

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.300
But worse, it seemed
to make the trouble

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.520
that people had in
marriage be more

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.470
of a pathology, sort of an
aberration, more than the norm.

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.100
But I was thinking, there
are some really lovely people

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.540
that I see in my practice.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.840
And my husband and I,
were not actually crazy,

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.180
but we were going at it in
ways that didn't make sense.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.230
So I thought, something
is wrong with this idea.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.010
So I decided to figure out why.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.310
And in order to do that,
I decided to turn myself

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.810
into a marriage expert.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.020
Now, back then, none
of this existed.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.613
I couldn't just
sit at my computer.

00:06:07.613 --> 00:06:11.270
Well, actually, I didn't even
have a computer back then.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.460
And I couldn't just
sit down and Google

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.970
why is my husband
driving me crazy?

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.092
What am I supposed to do?

00:06:17.092 --> 00:06:18.050
There was none of that.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.910
So I went to the bookstore.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:24.170
You know, I read books, and I
took workshops and trainings,

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.250
and went to conferences.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.320
And here's the most
interesting thing that I found.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.340
It pretty much turned everything
I understood about marriage

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.930
and relationships upside down.

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.180
So most of us
think that marriage

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.850
is about agreement
and consensus,

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:47.410
about compromising,
and meeting halfway.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:51.400
It's our need for consensus
that's driving us crazy.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.580
We need this agreement,
we need this validation.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.470
We need somebody to say, yes.

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:57.170
I hear you.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:58.030
I agree with you.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:59.590
I perfectly understand you.

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:00.100
Oh, yes.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.800
What you're saying makes
perfect sense, and yes.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.460
Let's do it your way.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.900
But, of course, you know, of
course we'd all like that.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.620
I mean, everybody
wants validation.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.360
You know what I like to
say is that validation

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.720
is a perfectly
fine thing to want

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.770
and it's a really
dangerous thing to need.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.310
So here's essentially
what it comes down to.

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:29.380
We need to learn how
to disagree, not agree.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.260
Now, I'm not saying that we
have to fight all the time

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.360
and that that's the
key to happiness.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.670
I'm just saying that
what we have to do

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:40.330
is we need to learn to
effectively deal with being

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.830
two different people.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.850
This was 180 degrees
off of everything

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:49.450
that I believed up until
then, but somehow it

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:51.050
made perfect sense to me.

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.680
I didn't know how to
apply it to my life,

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.890
but I knew that I
was onto something.

00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:00.550
So let's consider this
quote from Einstein.

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:04.330
"Central to the advancement
of human civilization

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.700
is the spirit of open inquiry.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.880
We must not only learned to
tolerate our differences--

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:14.290
we must welcome them as the
richness and diversity which

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:18.930
can lead to true intelligence."

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:23.310
So I read this quote, and I'm
in a workshop for therapists.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:26.610
And we're working with
how to deal with our most

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:29.850
impossible, difficult couples.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:32.610
So I thought immediately
of this couple

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:34.260
I'll call Bruce and Cindy.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.190
They were my couple from hell.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:41.120
They fought about everything.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.250
They'd get to the corner
and they couldn't decide--

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.499
you know, if they're just
taking a walk-- whether they

00:08:45.499 --> 00:08:47.390
should go right or left.

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:52.640
So I tried to imagine
die-hard vegan Bruce welcoming

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.670
as rich and diverse his
wife Cindy's interest

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:58.730
in eating hamburger, when
this guy would not even

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:01.070
wear leather shoes.

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:03.950
And what I realized
is that's the point.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:05.710
We don't have to get--

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:08.180
Bruce and Cindy are never
going to agree on anything.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:11.870
And the good news is,
we didn't actually

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:14.330
have to make them agree.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:19.700
But here's one of the pieces
of trouble with consensus.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:20.530
OK.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:24.940
So have you ever noticed that
your version and your spouse's

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.730
version sound nothing alike?

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:29.620
Have you ever thought
that maybe you're

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:33.400
living in alternate
realities, parallel realities

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.240
on a good day?

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.280
So here's how I observed
this in my office.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.980
Somebody is there and
they're starting to talk.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.310
And they say, you know,
and this thing happened,

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:45.310
and that thing happened.

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:48.730
And then their partner moves
like, some micro-movement,

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:50.650
a little eyebrow, a little--

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:51.220
[SNIFFING]

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:51.970
Something happens.

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:52.690
And, what?

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:53.189
What?

00:09:53.189 --> 00:09:54.820
And they're completely riveted.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.770
They can't finish a sentence.

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:59.050
They can't complete a thought.

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:00.430
And they say, see?

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:01.630
This is what I mean.

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:06.390
We can't talk about X. I'm
not allowed to bring up Y.

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:09.400
And I say, why not?

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.200
Who made these rules?

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.620
And so if you want to
know who made these rules,

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:17.920
I'm going to ask you
to take a minute,

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:22.900
and I want you to think
about, imagine and remember,

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:27.490
the two of you back in the
early days of your relationship.

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:28.510
There you are.

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:31.560
You're in Starbucks
sharing cafe lattes.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.380
Maybe you're actually drinking
one tea with two straws.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:38.830
And you're planning your
weekend away, romantic.

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:41.020
The first trip to the country.

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:44.740
And now meanwhile, in
some smoky back room,

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.290
your people and your
partner's people

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:51.330
are back there negotiating the
terms of your relationship.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:51.890
OK.

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:52.740
Fine.

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.550
I won't question
how many times a day

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.031
she has to talk to her mother.

00:10:57.031 --> 00:10:57.530
OK.

00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:58.030
Fine.

00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:59.660
And she's just not
going to bring up

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.140
what the cost of
those club-level seats

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:03.300
are at the ball park.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.760
And all right, really?

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.260
OK.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.630
They'll never, ever,
ever talk about sex.

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:12.000
So this gets signed into law.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.800
They shake hands, Meanwhile,
you're out there having a lark.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:20.120
You have no idea that these
are actually the rules that

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.620
will confine you.

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.630
They will define you.

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:25.490
They will make you miserable.

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:28.250
They will make you feel like
you are living in a box,

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:33.750
until you have the strength
and stamina to change them.

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:37.160
Now, [INAUDIBLE]
about courtship, about

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.780
courtship being about all
things lovely and wonderful.

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:45.680
These rules, you made these
rules back in the beginning

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:50.240
when the goal was to keep
the peace, to fall in love,

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:54.920
to preserve your bond, to
keep your partner essentially

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.900
from thinking you're
completely awful

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.640
and deciding to leave you.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.040
So all of these
things are hidden,

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:05.360
but you make these rules and
you will have to live with them.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.450
So that's what courtship is.

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:10.910
And so here is marriage.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:16.550
Marriage is essentially about
the rest of your life together.

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:21.050
You can't keep up the
facade of not being yourself

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:24.280
when you're in a
long relationship.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.800
So marriage is really about
coming to terms with the fact

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.590
that you are two different
people, that you want

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:33.980
different things, that
you like different things,

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.530
that some of the things
you're going to want

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:41.190
are going to clash with what
your partner has in mind.

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:44.790
Now, this is really,
really important.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:47.300
We have to figure out
how to deal with this,

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.910
our differences, with grace.

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:52.160
And in order to do
this, you're going

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.160
to have to learn how
to stand on your own.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.260
This is crucial.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.020
This is the whole
point that I wrote--

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:02.570
this is why I wrote this book.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:07.070
If you can't stand on your own,
if you can't take a position,

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:09.450
you're never going to
challenge the rules.

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:11.550
You're not going
to like your life.

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:13.820
You're not going to
like your partner.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.820
You're not going to
like how you feel.

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:18.470
You will have compromised
your core values.

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:21.830
You will have sunk below
your own bottom line.

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:23.120
You will be fearful.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.420
You will find yourself spending
years saying things like,

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.810
we're not allowed to do this,
and I'm not allowed to do that.

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:32.570
You're going to feel trapped.

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:36.000
You are going to
blame your spouse.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.570
If you imagine yourself one
year, five year, 10 years.

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:43.890
I'm married almost 40 years.

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:46.770
Find yourself all the
way down the line,

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:49.710
you won't even be able
to recognize yourself.

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:52.500
You will have turned
yourself into a pretzel

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:57.810
of acceptability, and you
won't be able to stand it.

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:00.000
Why this is important
is that you have

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.130
to realize what's at stake.

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:06.090
You've sacrificed
your I for your we.

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:08.460
And in order to be
happily married,

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.070
to be in a satisfying
relationship,

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:13.860
we have to be as
connected to ourselves

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:16.890
as we are to our spouse.

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:19.650
If you can't do
that, what's at stake

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:23.670
is your vitality,
your well-being,

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:29.010
and really even possibly
your entire relationship.

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:32.840
So here's where my
personal story comes in.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.420
I come home from this workshop.

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:39.280
I've gotten this new
idea, and I'm ecstatic.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.440
I've finally figured out why
my husband and I are fighting

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.370
like a couple of junkyard dogs.

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:46.100
I figure, this is it.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:46.670
I've got it.

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:48.500
So I come home, and
I'm all excited.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:52.820
And I say, essentially,
honey, this

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.830
is the greatest thing
that's ever happened.

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:58.070
I'm going to dismantle
our entire marriage right

00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:00.183
down to the rafters
and we're going

00:15:00.183 --> 00:15:02.690
to remodel this whole
thing while we live in it,

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:06.440
and I'm going to be the
architect and the carpenter.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.560
So my husband, you
know, he didn't

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:13.970
embrace all of these ideas with
quite the relish that I did.

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:17.135
And you know, pretty
much what he said was,

00:15:17.135 --> 00:15:20.860
I pretty much think our
marriage is fine as it is.

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:23.470
So that didn't deter me.

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:24.640
I decided, no.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:25.780
I'm going to keep at it.

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:27.710
I knew that this was right.

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:30.280
You know, but then
actually-- so to be honest,

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:33.460
what he actually said after
I think our marriage is fine

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:37.930
as it is, he actually said,
you went to a workshop

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:40.540
for the weekend and you
came back brainwashed.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:43.520
And you are, essentially, you're
not going to save our marriage.

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.050
You are about to destroy it.

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:48.750
So, I mean, I can't blame
him for thinking this.

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:52.110
I mean, I'm saying things
like, in order to be close,

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:53.970
we have to be separate.

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:56.870
In order to stop fighting,
we have to disagree.

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:58.840
You know, these things
don't make any sense,

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.870
and so I can understand.

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:03.840
And here's the other thing.

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:07.200
I was pretty much--
here's the picture.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.270
This is exactly what I was like.

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:11.790
I came home like
a lunatic zealot.

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:13.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.830
I knew that this
was right, but there

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:20.850
was some way in which I couldn't
actually sell it to him.

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:24.345
So I kept trotting out my
good ideas, and books to read,

00:16:24.345 --> 00:16:27.320
and things to do.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.090
And you know, I was like
a door-to-door salesman

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:33.920
trying to sell a reluctant
housewife a new vacuum cleaner.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.040
I don't really need this.

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.120
Mine works just fine.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:40.560
So I was about to
give up, and then I

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:46.680
realized that maybe I'm
going about this all wrong.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:51.150
I realized that
the instructions,

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:55.510
what I was going by, was that
you have to stand on your own.

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:57.520
You have to take risks.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.960
But what I was doing
was exactly the opposite

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.670
of what I needed to do.

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:05.880
I was trying to get
my husband's buy in.

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.700
It was as if I
was saying, honey,

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.550
I could very well stand
and be separate from you

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:13.230
if you don't join me.

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:16.930
I can't take the lead
if you don't come along.

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:21.240
And that was when I realized
that this business of changing

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:25.050
my marriage was going
to be a whole lot harder

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:29.910
and a little more complicated
than I had first anticipated.

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:34.380
I realized then that if I was
going to change my marriage,

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:36.950
I was going to have
to change it myself.

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:49.880
So I didn't have any real
rules for how to do this,

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:53.520
but these are the
principles that I had.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.560
You can't change your partner.

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:59.320
You have to take risks.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.460
You have to challenge the
rules that confine you

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:05.220
and frustrate you.

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:08.070
You have to recognize and
accept that this is not

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:10.740
a kind of a beeline to change.

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:15.420
You're going to have to
learn by falling seven times

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:17.526
and standing up eight.

00:18:17.526 --> 00:18:23.630
And most of all, you're going
to need to focus on yourself.

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:27.890
Well, I decided that
focusing on myself

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:31.500
was the best place to begin.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:35.790
So instead of focusing on
all of the ways in which he

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:38.340
was contributing to
our difficulties,

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:42.510
when focusing on myself I
discovered a handful of things.

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:44.680
I'm as stubborn as my husband.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.970
I am as likely to
start a fight as he is.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:51.990
I am maybe even less
likely to allow it to end.

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:56.760
I will be willing to
fight about anything,

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.820
as ridiculous and
stupid as it might be,

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.870
as long as I have to
end up being right.

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:07.870
But the worst thing, the most
painful observation that I had

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:10.240
was that I realized
that I have the staying

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.640
power of a dandelion.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.250
Under pressure, I
would just crumble.

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:18.550
And it didn't really
match my sense of myself,

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:20.110
who I am out in the world.

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:23.530
But somehow at home,
there were these ways

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:28.710
that our interactions would,
you know, just make me dissolve.

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:33.640
So I decided that further than
just this focus, which helped,

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:38.810
I learned how to stop pulling
my end of the tug-of-war rope.

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:41.060
What I realized
that I needed to do

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:46.580
was I needed to pick this most
frustrating, mind boggling

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:49.370
interaction that I would
have with my husband.

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:52.950
It's what I refer to as
our loopy-logic fight.

00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:59.000
We'd start-- it didn't matter
what we were talking about,

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.100
but within a short
period of time,

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.905
he's throwing things in
from left field and right.

00:20:03.905 --> 00:20:05.900
And I'd be saying, wait,
wait, wait a minute.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.207
Weren't we talking about shoes?

00:20:07.207 --> 00:20:07.790
Wait a second.

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:09.990
I thought we were
talking about bananas.

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:11.280
What's going on?

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:14.700
And I would just lose
my ability to think.

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.010
He was very good.

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:16.775
I really have to--

00:20:16.775 --> 00:20:18.630
I admire competence.

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:21.950
He was terrific, but
it would make me lose--

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:24.320
I felt I was losing my mind.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:29.090
So what I began doing was
experimenting with what would

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:32.780
it take for me to maintain
my thoughts, to feel

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:35.670
like I'm staying in one piece?

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:39.770
So I tried deep breathing, and
I tried counting backwards.

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:43.440
And I tried writing down the
points that I wanted to make.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.290
But none of that worked.

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:50.290
So then one day I decided to
take a physical step back,

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:53.400
and I noticed I was able to
maintain my thinking better,

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.230
but not very well.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:57.190
So I took another step back.

00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:58.740
And then I experimented.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:01.410
I'd come back in the
room, and I would just

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:02.880
lose it in about six seconds.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.440
And I'd come back
out of the room.

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:05.520
So I did this--

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.100
honestly, people say,
how long did it take?

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.410
It took a year.

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:14.160
It took a year
for me to actually

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:17.190
be able to stand there.

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:18.450
And this is how it happened.

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:21.870
One day in the middle of
one of our stupid go rounds,

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:25.450
I realized I didn't
have to leave the room.

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:28.410
There I was, and it was
like suddenly his words

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:31.050
were like snowflakes
falling through the air.

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:34.980
And I was perfectly calm,
and I knew what I thought,

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.560
and I knew what I wanted to say.

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:40.725
And it was like popping
outside of the pull of gravity

00:21:40.725 --> 00:21:45.710
and just floating
free through space.

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:50.530
And so here's what I'm
going to ask for you to do.

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:52.600
I would like for you--

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.440
here's my question.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:59.470
What experience
do you have, what

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:02.750
is it like for you, what
experience do you have

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:05.050
where you lose yourself?

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:08.630
Where what you want,
it feels out of reach?

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:13.580
Where what goes on makes your
head spin and frustrate you,

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:17.940
or makes you shut down
or cry, or blow up?

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:22.320
What one situation would
you like to master?

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:28.090
So I'd like you to just take
a minute and write it down.

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:31.060
One way to think
about it is this.

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:36.850
Instead of X, I want to do
Y. Instead of blowing up,

00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:38.890
I want to remain calm.

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:42.460
Instead of crying
when I'm angry,

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:46.120
I want to be able to hold
my thoughts together.

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:49.230
I want to be able
to express myself.

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:52.270
Now, in order for
you to do this,

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:56.410
you're going to have
to do two things.

00:22:56.410 --> 00:23:00.520
You're going to have to give up
trying to change your partner,

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:03.070
and I mean really give it up.

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:06.880
I don't mean just lip service,
no pun intended there.

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:10.210
I don't mean lip service to the
idea of secretly believing you

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:12.370
partner should change.

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:14.650
People come in and they--

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:16.810
it's like they're bringing
in a broken toaster

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:18.640
to the fix-it shop in my office.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.380
And it's like, here.

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:23.270
I finally brought-- I'm bringing
my situation to an expert.

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:26.890
I've tried to fix my
partner, and here it goes.

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:29.470
And so it's not like that.

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:32.980
The thing about marriage
is that it's a choice.

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:37.030
We can stay with our
partner, or we can leave.

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:43.990
But if we're going to stay,
we have one of two choices.

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:47.860
We can be completely
driven nuts by our partner,

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:51.580
or we can figure out what we're
going to do with ourselves.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.800
So the other thing you're
going to have to do,

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:02.580
you're going to have to totally
give up the "it takes two"

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:03.205
paradigm.

00:24:03.205 --> 00:24:04.580
You're going to
have to throw out

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:09.080
all the stuff about fairness
and needing both partners

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.840
to work as a team and change.

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.240
See, this is one of the
things that surprised me

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:20.390
in my own marriage, that as I
was busy focusing on myself,

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:25.440
my husband was actually
changing in ways all on his own.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.570
He was calming down.

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:30.620
And occasionally, he was even
the more levelheaded arguer.

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.416
When we would get
into something, he--

00:24:33.416 --> 00:24:36.680
you know, one day he's
completely surprised me.

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:44.210
I came home to make lunch,
and he left all this stuff

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:46.970
all over the counter,
the plate and the fork

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:49.020
and all of that stuff.

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:51.770
And I was immediately incensed.

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:55.640
And so we sort of got into it.

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:58.700
Oh, like, what a nice way for
you to come home and say hello.

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:00.830
Well, you know, I
only have 15 minutes

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:02.480
and I have to deal
with your mess.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.120
Back and forth, and
back and forth we went.

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.540
And then he stopped
and he said, OK.

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:09.380
Hold on a minute.

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:11.060
Let's back up.

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:14.480
So in other words, you
come home in a rush

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.970
and complain about my mess.

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:20.070
I get defensive, and
you feel despair.

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:21.860
Is that about right?

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:24.430
And I said, uh, yeah.

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:27.500
Now, really, I was
about to fall over.

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.660
And he said, yeah.

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:30.680
I can see that.

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.720
And then he began to clean up.

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:37.490
So what happens when you
stop focusing on your partner

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:40.030
and you focus on yourself--
that was what he did.

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:44.780
He was focused on me, and then
he was focused on himself.

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:46.790
So you're going to
have to completely

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:52.220
give up the two to tango
paradigm in order for this

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:53.840
to work.

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:57.265
Now, here's the interesting
thing that people say,

00:25:57.265 --> 00:26:03.340
you know, in business, people
are impressed with leadership.

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:06.550
They call leaders, they
call it being an innovator.

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:10.630
You know, they say, you
know, you're a trendsetter.

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:12.910
But when I suggest
that people have

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:15.790
to take [INAUDIBLE]
in their own marriage,

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:18.130
they think that I'm
essentially telling them

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:21.970
that they're going to have
to be some sort of doormat.

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:27.130
So I promise you, I'm not asking
you to roll over and play dead,

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:30.430
or give up on the things
that are important to you,

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:34.360
or just live with conditions
that you can't stand.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:38.800
I'm really suggesting
that you recognize

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:43.600
the power of being a leader for
change in your relationship,

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:47.320
and it really is going to
start with that one thing

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.320
that I'm asking you
to look at, the one

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:55.100
thing that you can change, the
one thing that you can control.

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:59.560
And don't be surprised if
it takes a long time for you

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:04.570
to master that that one
thing that I asked you to do.

00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:06.850
It's an incredibly--
it's so much more

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:12.830
empowering than waiting
for your partner to change.

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:17.080
So you know, and basically
what I want you to understand

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:20.500
is that you have more
power than you think.

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:23.480
If you're skeptical,
you're not alone.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.210
I mean, really, I'm
asking you to let

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:28.570
go of one of the most cherished
beliefs, that people have

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:31.480
to change as a
team, that it's not

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:35.170
worth doing if your
spouse doesn't join you.

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:39.010
So I'm really just asking
you to take the challenge,

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:40.780
challenge yourself.

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:43.990
The goal is not here to turn
you into a little island

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:46.090
of self-sufficiency.

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:49.300
It's about turning you
into a partner who's

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:54.480
capable of change, who's
capable of leadership.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:59.410
One person must take the
first step in change.

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:04.700
My invitation to you is, why
not let that person be you?

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:09.400
Thank you.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.886
SPEAKER 1: I love
this book so much.

00:28:11.886 --> 00:28:13.010
WINIFRED REILLY: Thank you.

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:15.820
SPEAKER 1: And one
of the chapters--

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:17.260
in almost every
chapter there was

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:20.240
something where I had to put
it down and think about it.

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:23.620
But almost everything
in Chapter Six,

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:28.755
when it says "what happens
once you calm down?"

00:28:28.755 --> 00:28:29.630
WINIFRED REILLY: Yes.

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:32.740
SPEAKER 1: And that, for
me, has been in my marriage,

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:36.425
a very difficult thing to
do, is just to calm down.

00:28:36.425 --> 00:28:36.925
Because I--

00:28:36.925 --> 00:28:37.840
SPEAKER 1: It's high pressure.

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:38.715
WINIFRED REILLY: Yes.

00:28:38.715 --> 00:28:41.624
Under the same
impression or feelings

00:28:41.624 --> 00:28:43.040
that you were
talking about, where

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:44.810
we have to do this together.

00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:45.900
We have to agree.

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:48.640
And my husband really likes
for me to agree with him.

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:49.640
WINIFRED REILLY: Uh huh.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:50.910
SPEAKER 1: So it's very--

00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:52.535
WINIFRED REILLY:
That's not surprising.

00:28:52.535 --> 00:28:55.730
SPEAKER 1: --Causes
tons of issues.

00:28:55.730 --> 00:29:00.560
So calming down, it's
just such a great thought

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:01.834
and a great concept.

00:29:01.834 --> 00:29:04.250
WINIFRED REILLY: And it's not
something that's easy to do.

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:06.830
You know, I mean, when you're
really upset and somebody

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:10.112
says to you, calm down, I
mean, how useless is that?

00:29:10.112 --> 00:29:10.820
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:12.528
WINIFRED REILLY: You
know, so it actually

00:29:12.528 --> 00:29:14.390
has to happen from inside.

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:18.200
And it really is another one of
those kind of try this and try

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.040
that, you know?

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:21.740
Like I was saying, in
order to stay present

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:25.290
in my loopy-logic fight,
you know, I tried counting,

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:28.010
I tried digging my
fingernails in my hand.

00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:30.420
I tried planting my feet.

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:31.910
You know, it really
just ended up

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:34.820
being that I needed
the physical distance.

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:38.600
And little did I know that
what I was doing at that point

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:42.470
was kind of calming
down my neocortex.

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:46.220
I was staying in that little
sliver of reasonableness

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:49.400
while the kind of flood of
the whole rest of my brain

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:52.280
was taking over and acting like
it was some kind of emergency.

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:52.910
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:53.870
Yes.

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:56.330
And that, on page 131--

00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:57.230
WINIFRED REILLY: Mhm.

00:29:57.230 --> 00:30:00.430
SPEAKER 1: You talk about how--

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:04.620
and this is, for me, a
revolutionary thought--

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:07.050
"for most people,
it takes some time

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:09.240
to grow comfortable
with the idea of being

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:13.640
responsible for
comforting ourselves

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:17.150
when we're disappointed or
hurt and somewhat longer

00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:20.620
to discover its benefits."

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:22.720
And you'd recognized the
point of self-soothing

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:23.967
with your children.

00:30:23.967 --> 00:30:26.050
WINIFRED REILLY: Yes, and
we all-- you know, yeah.

00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:28.180
We want them to
self-soothe so that we

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:29.386
can get a night's sleep.

00:30:29.386 --> 00:30:30.010
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:30.310
WINIFRED REILLY: Right?

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:32.590
SPEAKER 1: And to
self-soothe ourselves,

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:34.764
as a partner in the marriage.

00:30:34.764 --> 00:30:35.680
WINIFRED REILLY: Yeah.

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:37.510
I mean, if you think
about it, you're

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:40.540
in the middle of a
thing with your partner.

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:44.230
If you're relying on
them to be soothing you,

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:45.670
I mean, they're busy.

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:47.354
Their brain is lit
up at that moment.

00:30:47.354 --> 00:30:48.520
So what are you going to do?

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.370
Go into some sort of free fall?

00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:54.790
I mean, you have to actually
settle down and tell yourself,

00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:56.800
I'm really going to be OK.

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:59.150
But one of my clients
had a wonderful phrase.

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:01.870
He said that the thing that
would help him the most

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:05.930
was that when he got anxious
he would remind himself,

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:07.670
he would say, OK.

00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:10.390
I might get hurt here,
but I'm not going to die.

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:11.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:15.906
That was his self-soothing,
and so we find something.

00:31:15.906 --> 00:31:17.780
SPEAKER 1: What are some
of your suggestions?

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:18.613
WINIFRED REILLY: OK.

00:31:18.613 --> 00:31:20.890
Well, like I said,
you can breath.

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:24.640
I think you have to
start with the novel idea

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:27.190
that it's actually your job.

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:29.700
And I think that's a
big beginning part.

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:33.950
You know, being able to lean on
each other and being together,

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:38.140
like I said, this is not
about being a little island.

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:42.440
It's just about-- it's nice to
be able to lean on each other,

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:45.100
but you have to be able
to stand on your feet,

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:47.320
especially when
you're not agreeing.

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:49.410
You know, you can't
lean on somebody else

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:53.110
while they're agitated or
holding their position.

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:55.060
So you can breathe.

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:57.430
You can talk yourself down.

00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:58.900
You can take breaks.

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:01.210
You can say, hold on.

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:02.364
I'm just getting flooded.

00:32:02.364 --> 00:32:03.280
I'm going to step out.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:07.960
I'm not suggesting that you, you
know, come back two days later.

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.520
I'm saying, just five minutes.

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:10.840
Quiet your brain down.

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:13.552
So it really is an experiment.

00:32:13.552 --> 00:32:15.010
Sometimes there
are issues that are

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:17.980
so hot to deal with that
you pick them up tomorrow.

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:20.010
SPEAKER 1: Mhm.

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:22.370
That's great.

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:26.630
Did you want to ask a question?

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:28.600
And have Dory's
questions right here.

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:29.433
WINIFRED REILLY: OK.

00:32:32.551 --> 00:32:34.550
SPEAKER 1: I'm going to
read the Dory questions,

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:39.990
and feel free to add as
many as you would like.

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:43.120
And it is anonymous.

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.310
So the first
question we have is,

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:50.070
how to convince your partner
to go to couples therapy,

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:51.872
and is it helpful
to do it alone?

00:32:51.872 --> 00:32:52.830
WINIFRED REILLY: Great.

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:54.720
I love that question.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:57.480
You can't convince
or persuade someone

00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:00.060
to do something that
they're uncomfortable with.

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:03.490
You can ask, and it's
actually your job to ask.

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:07.930
I mean, nobody is going to
advocate for you except you.

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:09.910
But you know, there are
reasons people don't

00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:11.610
want to go to couple's therapy.

00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:14.710
They think it's a first
step toward divorce.

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:16.060
They're fearful.

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:20.750
They think that things
are fine as they are.

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:23.800
Let's, you know,
don't rock the boat.

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:27.650
Or, you know, they just
don't believe in it.

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:30.880
And so it's "The One
to Tango" principle.

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:34.317
If there's something important
to you, go on your own.

00:33:34.317 --> 00:33:34.900
Take the lead.

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:37.480
I do work with some
people by themselves

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:41.620
without their partner, and
so a good couples therapist

00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:44.931
will actually help you,
not just take your side.

00:33:44.931 --> 00:33:45.930
That's not that helpful.

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:48.190
I mean, it's lovely,
but if you're

00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:51.280
talking about nonsense
in your relationship,

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:54.310
you actually have to have
somebody who can, you know,

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:57.360
not just commiserate with
you, but actually help

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.710
you take charge of yourself.

00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:04.360
So you know, I think
sometimes what people--

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:08.469
it sort of seems obvious.

00:34:08.469 --> 00:34:13.409
You can start by saying, this
is really important to me

00:34:13.409 --> 00:34:15.300
and I'd like you to go.

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:16.560
At least try it once.

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:21.300
But really, go by yourself.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:22.389
Go by yourself.

00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:25.780
A lot can happen, if you don't
just go there to complain,

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:27.429
but you go there to say--

00:34:27.429 --> 00:34:30.040
like I did-- you
know, say, oh, wait.

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.610
I'm as big of a hothead.

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:34.239
Oh, here's my contribution
to the difficulty,

00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:37.359
and I want help with that.

00:34:37.359 --> 00:34:38.830
SPEAKER 1: Great.

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:40.960
What are some of
the steps one can

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:44.860
take when they're screaming,
name calling, as well

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:47.770
as verbal abuse in their
relationship but the partner

00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:51.790
refuses to stop this
behavior, or the partner says

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:54.589
it will stop if the
partner does such and such?

00:34:54.589 --> 00:34:55.880
WINIFRED REILLY: If you change.

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:56.270
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:56.807
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:56.807 --> 00:34:57.640
WINIFRED REILLY: OK.

00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:58.306
Well, all right.

00:34:58.306 --> 00:35:00.970
So if somebody is
screaming and yelling,

00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:03.960
I differentiate this from,
you know, where there's, like,

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:04.780
physical violence.

00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:07.690
So let's just take
that off of the table.

00:35:07.690 --> 00:35:11.890
It's just kind of
bedlam at your house.

00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:14.830
I think the surprising
thing is for you

00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:16.810
to be able to remain calm.

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:19.640
I learned this from my
son's kindergarten teacher.

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:24.390
The room would be chaotic,
and she would lower her voice.

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:27.670
She would get really quiet,
and the energy in the room

00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:28.900
would change.

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:32.920
Now, if your spouse
is off the rails,

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:36.510
you're not going to be able to
reason with him or her anyway.

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:40.560
And so I suggest you sit
down and be a witness.

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:43.792
Also you don't have to
argue every single point.

00:35:43.792 --> 00:35:46.000
I mean, you know, you don't
have to argue if somebody

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.395
is saying the Earth is flat.

00:35:47.395 --> 00:35:48.025
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:48.025 --> 00:35:50.780
You don't actually have to
say, well, actually, here.

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:52.480
Here is why it's round.

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:55.120
You have to calm down.

00:35:55.120 --> 00:36:02.440
You also might want to try with
a really nasty spouse saying,

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:06.670
you know, do you actually
think I can hear you

00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:08.560
when you talk like that?

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.240
How about if we sit down.

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:13.180
Why don't you tell me what it
is you want me to understand,

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:16.780
or I don't really have any
idea why you get so frustrated.

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:20.380
Do you have any idea
why you totally lose it?

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:22.060
You know, that you
start to become

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:26.119
the ambassador for sanity
in a crazy situation.

00:36:26.119 --> 00:36:27.160
At least, that's a start.

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:32.120
SPEAKER 1: Next
question, you talked

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:36.770
about standing on your
own and taking a position.

00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:39.980
In the same vein, do you think
it's absolutely necessary

00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:44.630
to spend time alone explicitly,
be single for many years

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:46.930
before being married?

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:49.770
WINIFRED REILLY: Well, I wasn't.

00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:53.190
And you know, I was very
young when I got married.

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:56.840
And my sense of self, oh, I
sure thought I was an adult,

00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:00.210
but I had lots of growing to do.

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:05.620
I think that coming in at
any phase in your life,

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:07.500
you're still going
to meet challenges.

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:10.470
That whole list of why is
marriage hard that I talked

00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:14.460
about in the beginning, it's
still going to be difficult.

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:16.695
You know, you're going
to think, oh, I'm

00:37:16.695 --> 00:37:18.700
a really sane,
well-adjusted person.

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:21.060
I can handle just
about anything.

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:24.480
And then, you know, you yourself
in a small space with somebody

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:30.732
and you're going to just see all
the little holes in yourself.

00:37:30.732 --> 00:37:31.940
You know, there's this quote.

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:34.660
"A man can be a fool
and not know it,

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:36.300
but not if he's married."

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:36.800
You know.

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:37.300
SPEAKER 1: Very true.

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:39.030
WINIFRED REILLY: A
woman can be a fool

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:41.220
and not know it,
unless she's married.

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:47.100
And so I think that the
more solid and strong

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:49.890
we are as people,
the better it is.

00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:51.835
But you're still going
to hit the trenches.

00:37:51.835 --> 00:37:53.520
You're still going
to have to learn

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:58.830
how you live with this person
when agreeing to disagree

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:02.820
does not solve every problem.

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:06.600
SPEAKER 1: This next
question is great.

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:09.240
Any advice for
single people trying

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:12.030
to find or choose a
partner and wanting

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:14.324
to make that relationship work?

00:38:14.324 --> 00:38:15.240
WINIFRED REILLY: Yeah.

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:20.610
Well, you know, it's the same as
anyone even in a relationship.

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:25.260
Be clear about what you want,
know as much about yourself,

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:26.850
and be willing to be brave.

00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:28.460
Be willing to reveal yourself.

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:34.290
I have clients who come in
20, 30 years down the line,

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:37.290
and they've hidden so
many parts of themselves

00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:40.170
that they feel strangled.

00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:43.680
And you know, so the
thing when you're

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:49.890
looking for a relationship,
find somebody who's curious.

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:52.780
Find somebody who wants
to take an adventure,

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:55.140
but isn't going to be
a lark with anyone.

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:57.510
It's just not going to
be a walk in the park,

00:38:57.510 --> 00:39:05.640
but somebody who is willing
to laugh, explore, grow.

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:10.670
It helps.

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:11.900
SPEAKER 1: And it's--

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:14.524
I appreciate what you said
just about knowing yourself.

00:39:14.524 --> 00:39:15.440
WINIFRED REILLY: Yeah.

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:20.190
SPEAKER 1: Because it
seems like no matter what,

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:26.280
how much you investigate
the person, or interview

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.292
the person, or try to
analyze the person.

00:39:28.292 --> 00:39:29.250
WINIFRED REILLY: Right.

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:30.900
SPEAKER 1: It always
comes down to who

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:32.360
you are on the other side.

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:32.463
WINIFRED REILLY: Yes.

00:39:32.463 --> 00:39:33.129
And that's true.

00:39:33.129 --> 00:39:36.240
I mean, it really is--

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:40.680
you know, if you don't know
what you want, and who you are,

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.900
and what you think, if
you have no connection

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:45.780
to your inner most
reliable witness,

00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:48.180
you're just going
to be moving about

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:50.520
and you're not
going to actually be

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:54.880
able to have your relationship
go in any direction.

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.615
And so, you know,
it's not for sissies,

00:39:56.615 --> 00:39:59.965
is what say people say about
long-term relationships.

00:39:59.965 --> 00:40:00.840
SPEAKER 1: Very true.

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:02.760
And this one, this
question, is about

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:04.110
long-distance relationships.

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:05.070
WINIFRED REILLY: OK.

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:06.445
SPEAKER 1: How
would one approach

00:40:06.445 --> 00:40:09.810
this when a couple is in a
long-distance relationship?

00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:12.060
And what are your
thoughts on each partner

00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:14.964
seeing a separate therapist?

00:40:14.964 --> 00:40:16.380
WINIFRED REILLY:
You know, so this

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:19.200
may sound like a kind
of a jokey answer,

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:21.990
but therapy can be one
of the worst things you

00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:23.370
could do for your marriage.

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:25.380
I mean, there's
statistics about it.

00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:27.630
So it doesn't mean don't do it.

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:30.660
It's just that you
will sometimes--

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:33.690
therapists will take sides.

00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:35.580
You know, you've got two people.

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:39.630
If you're focusing, if you're
doing relationship work,

00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:40.704
not just inner work.

00:40:40.704 --> 00:40:42.870
Inner work is a different
thing when you're doing it

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:44.040
within individual therapy.

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:46.110
When you're doing
relationship work--

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:49.320
I've actually worked with
people where someone flies in

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:52.800
and I see them for, you know,
two or three hours, and maybe

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.140
a couple of times
in a short time.

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:59.190
And then they go back and
they do their own work.

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:02.250
But in a long-distance
relationship,

00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:04.060
some of the pressure
is off, you know?

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:07.200
In the beginning I showed this
cartoon with the definition

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:09.180
of marriage is two
people in a rowboat,

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:11.342
and they're rolling in
opposite directions.

00:41:11.342 --> 00:41:13.050
But that's some of
the stuff that happens

00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:15.220
when you're living together.

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:17.280
Things heat up.

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:22.080
But you know, it's
the same, I suppose.

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:24.870
You know, any work, any
time that you're together,

00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:27.510
pay attention to
yourself, what you want.

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:32.290
You know, don't shy away
from challenging things.

00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:35.080
SPEAKER 1: When you mentioned
that therapy isn't necessarily

00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:38.190
the best thing, it reminded me
of what you told us at lunch,

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:40.750
that you had a therapist that
recommended something that

00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:40.990
wasn't--

00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:41.560
WINIFRED REILLY: Yeah, yeah.

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:43.660
My therapist said, oh,
your husband, you know,

00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:44.870
you're so frustrated.

00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:49.240
He's really never going to
really take a hold and grow.

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.970
You really should, you
know, just move on,

00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:53.380
which was stunning.

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:57.400
And I actually stopped that
therapy pretty quickly,

00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:02.830
realizing that I would have much
rather somebody said, you know,

00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:04.930
what I'm saying to people.

00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:07.270
Well, this is
challenging, you know?

00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:08.630
Fasten your seat belts.

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:10.360
Put on your work boots.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:10.900
Get going.

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:11.775
See where you can go.

00:42:11.775 --> 00:42:15.870
It wasn't that my husband
was immune to change,

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:20.080
he just was kind of more content
with things as they were.

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:25.160
So I came in with these ideas
for how to have it go better,

00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:29.020
and you know, and
at this point, he

00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:31.570
wouldn't argue that
our relationship is

00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:35.984
much, much better because
we both basically grew up.

00:42:35.984 --> 00:42:37.900
SPEAKER 1: And that leads
me to a question of,

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:40.540
how does one choose a therapist?

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:45.612
Because if you have a therapist
that is quick to say, yeah.

00:42:45.612 --> 00:42:46.570
This isn't working out.

00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:48.220
You guys should
just get divorced.

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:50.470
WINIFRED REILLY: I don't
think you should allow anyone

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:51.850
to tell you to get divorced.

00:42:51.850 --> 00:42:52.600
SPEAKER 1: Mhm.

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:54.766
WINIFRED REILLY: Remember
what I said about marriage

00:42:54.766 --> 00:42:55.900
being a choice.

00:42:55.900 --> 00:43:00.130
You can stay with this
partner or you can leave.

00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:04.210
But if you're going to
stay, you have two choices.

00:43:04.210 --> 00:43:07.990
You can figure out what you're
going to do with yourself,

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:11.680
or you can allow that person
to drive you completely nuts.

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:15.520
And this business of figuring
out what to do with yourself

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:18.487
is really pretty extraordinary.

00:43:18.487 --> 00:43:19.570
There are a lot of things.

00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:23.320
You know, it's not
just we calm down.

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:25.720
But later in the
book, I have a thing

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:30.010
about what some people
discover to be change.

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:32.650
Like, one person
said his wife is just

00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:37.056
a busy person moving around,
always drove him really crazy.

00:43:37.056 --> 00:43:38.680
And then you realize,
it's a little bit

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:42.310
like living near train
tracks, but people eventually

00:43:42.310 --> 00:43:44.290
stop hearing the train.

00:43:44.290 --> 00:43:46.480
And he just stopped
focusing on it.

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:48.400
She was always running
around and doing stuff.

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:50.560
He figured out how to
regulate his own state

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:53.260
and be peaceful in the
midst of all of her people

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:54.400
coming and going.

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:58.810
You know, so rather than,
you need to slow down,

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:01.840
he figured out how
to just maintain

00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:03.170
his own shape in the context.

00:44:06.109 --> 00:44:07.150
SPEAKER 1: Next question.

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:14.110
How to agree or disagree
on parenting issues,

00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:16.120
how we approach parenting,
if we are coming

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:17.800
from very different places.

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:19.630
WINIFRED REILLY:
This one, you know,

00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:21.520
I could write an entire book.

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:24.580
This one is not a quick
answer because it's

00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:28.090
one of those things that you
can't have two philosophies.

00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:30.550
You can't say, we're never
going to spank the kids

00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:32.220
and somebody is going
to spank the kids,

00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:35.780
or you're never going to do time
out, or you're going to do--

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:36.280
you know?

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:41.890
And so I can't actually give
this one a quick answer,

00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:45.040
but it actually
comes down to needing

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:50.200
to collaborate in some
way, but more to be

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:54.370
persuasive in terms of--

00:44:54.370 --> 00:44:55.240
see, OK.

00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:57.760
When you have two
things and you're only

00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:00.610
going to have one
outcome, the only way

00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:03.430
you're going to get
anywhere is that somebody

00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:05.140
is going to have to yield.

00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:07.570
Somebody is going to
have to be generous.

00:45:07.570 --> 00:45:09.850
They're going to have
to say, all right.

00:45:09.850 --> 00:45:14.990
This is not my first choice, but
from a solid and strong place,

00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:17.110
we'll do what you want.

00:45:17.110 --> 00:45:18.430
We can't compromise.

00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:21.700
You can't have half a time out.

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:25.480
You can't have one
parent saying we

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:27.580
have no sugar in the
house and the other one,

00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:30.600
you know, feeding the kid
sugar, or screen time.

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.880
I mean, these
issues, you have to--

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:34.720
it's sort of like this.

00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:36.400
You're going to
either move over here,

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.858
or you're going to
move over there.

00:45:37.858 --> 00:45:41.950
And how do you do it, I think
it requires a sense of self.

00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:45.370
Don't expect these
conversations to happen quickly.

00:45:45.370 --> 00:45:46.930
Hang in there with it.

00:45:46.930 --> 00:45:50.830
See if you can both come from
the most curious and generous

00:45:50.830 --> 00:45:51.655
places in yourself.

00:45:54.332 --> 00:45:55.206
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:45:55.206 --> 00:45:57.780
And there are a
couple more here.

00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:01.860
How amplified is the
"It Takes One to Tango"

00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:05.760
message when one of the
partners can't change much?

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.430
For example, Asperger's.

00:46:07.507 --> 00:46:08.340
WINIFRED REILLY: OK.

00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:10.380
So I do work with
couples like that,

00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:19.680
and so here's the piece that if
the Asperger's person actually

00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:25.140
recognizes that there may be
ways that he or she isn't going

00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:29.370
to change, but can acknowledge
that it drives their spouse

00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:31.590
nuts, that's one thing.

00:46:31.590 --> 00:46:33.870
And then for the other
spouse, to give up

00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:37.860
all hope of this
person being different

00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:44.190
and to make your own moves,
and think your own thoughts.

00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:47.580
You know, I work
with one couple where

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:52.680
the guy would be-- he
would begin every answer,

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:56.820
or every piece of a conversation
was begun with the word no.

00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:58.740
And he eventually stopped.

00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:01.230
She'd say, I'd like
to go to the moon.

00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:02.250
And he'd say, no.

00:47:02.250 --> 00:47:04.175
I think, you know,
Pluto would be better.

00:47:04.175 --> 00:47:05.550
But every-- no
was the beginning.

00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:09.810
So she eventually got to,
I can just ignore that word

00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:11.110
and I can listen.

00:47:11.110 --> 00:47:13.440
And he actually did change.

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:16.030
I think people actually
can change, probably

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:19.950
not everything, but I don't
put a ceiling over what's

00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:21.790
possible for people.

00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:24.180
But I think, you know,
you pick this person.

00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:27.150
You know somewhat of
what you're getting

00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:28.627
and what you're not getting.

00:47:28.627 --> 00:47:30.210
And you have to
figure out how to make

00:47:30.210 --> 00:47:32.859
yourself happy in that context.

00:47:32.859 --> 00:47:34.650
SPEAKER 1: Have you
ever seen the technique

00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:38.550
you described work on a marriage
that has already failed,

00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:42.600
where the partners are
divorced or separated?

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:46.025
At which point would you
recommend, as a professional

00:47:46.025 --> 00:47:47.657
with experience, giving up?

00:47:47.657 --> 00:47:48.490
WINIFRED REILLY: OK.

00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:50.865
Well, if it's already failed
and you're already divorced,

00:47:50.865 --> 00:47:52.350
I mean, I have seen
people remarry,

00:47:52.350 --> 00:47:54.433
but I don't think that's
quite what you're asking.

00:47:54.433 --> 00:47:57.180
So I'm going to answer
a question of, like,

00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:00.540
how far gone is too far gone.

00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:04.080
I actually-- you know, my
book opens with this quote.

00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:06.840
It's a Turkish proverb
that says, "No matter

00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:09.690
how far you have gone
down the wrong road,

00:48:09.690 --> 00:48:11.670
you can turn around."

00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:13.860
So I never give up.

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:16.770
It's not my job to tell
people, you know, you can do it

00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:17.790
or you can't do it.

00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:18.990
But I never give up.

00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:22.810
I never put a ceiling over
what's possible for people.

00:48:22.810 --> 00:48:25.060
But here's the thing.

00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:27.460
Marriage is a choice.

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:30.340
If you want to try
and make it a go,

00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:32.860
I say, you don't have
anything to lose.

00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:34.210
Give it your all.

00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:35.080
See what happens.

00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:38.540
There's no guarantee as
to how it will come out.

00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:41.140
But if you have even
one shred of hope,

00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:46.090
start working on your side
of it and don't give up.

00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:48.250
You still might
not end up married,

00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:50.590
but I like people
to at least come out

00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:53.080
of it being able
to say, you know,

00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:57.510
I feel as if I really
did everything I could.

00:48:57.510 --> 00:48:59.160
SPEAKER 1: This is
our last question.

00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:06.840
You mentioned giving up the
idea about 50/50 fairness

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:07.920
and working as a team.

00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:12.720
How do you then balance
day-to-day obligations,

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:16.250
such as parenting, working
without being completely run

00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:18.270
down or bearing
most of the weight?

00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:19.811
WINIFRED REILLY:
Well, you know, it's

00:49:19.811 --> 00:49:22.845
tricky because this is a
common concern, especially

00:49:22.845 --> 00:49:24.720
for the person who feels
like they're already

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:26.310
carrying more weight.

00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:32.940
This idea is not
about how you should

00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:36.120
be doing all of the cleaning,
and watching all the kids,

00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:40.620
and turning cartwheels
about everything.

00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:43.530
It really is about-- so if
you're in a situation where

00:49:43.530 --> 00:49:46.310
your partner is not doing much.

00:49:46.310 --> 00:49:48.240
This is a time where
you actually might

00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:50.490
need to really step forward.

00:49:50.490 --> 00:49:55.230
And instead of saying, you know,
like, what's wrong with you,

00:49:55.230 --> 00:49:57.030
you might say--

00:49:57.030 --> 00:50:00.750
this would be like what I would
say to somebody in my office--

00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:02.880
so what do you tell
yourself while you're

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:05.820
sitting there reading
and your wife is running

00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:08.530
around doing the dishes,
unloading the dishwasher,

00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:10.950
and juggling three children.

00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:14.110
Like, tell me how that
makes sense to you.

00:50:14.110 --> 00:50:17.370
And so you want to find
yourself in a position

00:50:17.370 --> 00:50:20.310
where you're not working
on changing your spouse,

00:50:20.310 --> 00:50:24.720
but that doesn't mean, you know,
blooming where you planted.

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:27.030
This is why I say it's
going to take gumption.

00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:30.180
You're going to have to move
toward your difficulties

00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:32.160
and talk about them in
ways that figure out

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:35.580
ways to talk about them that
are effective, that aren't

00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:39.870
about changing the other person
but are really about coming

00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:42.650
forward and being yourself.

00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:43.650
SPEAKER 1: Great.

00:50:43.650 --> 00:50:44.886
Thank you so much for coming.

00:50:44.886 --> 00:50:47.150
WINIFRED REILLY: Oh, It's
been really a pleasure.
