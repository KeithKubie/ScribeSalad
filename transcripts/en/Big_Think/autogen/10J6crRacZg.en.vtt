00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:09.920
My co-author of the book Altered Traits is
a neuroscientist, Richard Davidson.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.030
He has a lab at the University of Wisconsin.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.250
It’s a very large lab, he has dedicated
scanners, he has about 100 people working

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:26.820
there, and he was able to do some remarkable
research where he flew Olympic level meditators—who

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.239
live in Nepal or India typically, some in
France—he flew them over to the lab and

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:41.079
put them through a protocol in his brain scanners
and did state-of-the-art tests and the results

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:44.230
were just astounding.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:50.620
We found, for example, or he found that their
brain waves are really different.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.840
Perhaps the most remarkable findings in the
Olympic level meditators has to do with what’s

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.030
called a gamma wave.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.440
All of us get gamma for a very short period
when we solve a problem we’ve been grappling

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.340
with, even if it’s something that’s vexed
us for months.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:13.910
We get about half second of gamma; it’s
the strongest wave in the EEG spectrum.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:20.700
We get it when we bite into an apple or imagine
biting into an apple, and for a brief period,

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:29.630
a split-second, inputs from taste, sound,
smell, vision, all of that come together in

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.290
that imagined bite into the apple.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.159
But that lasts very short period in an ordinary
EEG.

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.850
What was stunning was that the Olympic level
meditators, these are people who have done

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:52.540
up to 62,000 lifetime hours of meditation,
their brainwave shows gamma very strong all

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.490
the time as a lasting trait just no matter
what they’re doing.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.450
It’s not a state effect, it’s not during
their meditation alone, but it’s just their

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.310
every day state of mind.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.479
We actually have no idea what that means experientially.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.950
Science has never seen it before.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.300
We also find that in these Olympic level meditators
when we asked them, for example, to do a meditation

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:26.360
on compassion their level of gamma jumps 700
to 800 percent in a few seconds.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.130
This has also never been seen by science.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:36.290
So we have to assume that the special state
of consciousness that you see in the highest

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:45.290
level meditators is a lot like something described
in the classical meditation literatures centuries

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:53.920
ago, which is that there is a state of being
which is not like our ordinary state.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:01.540
Sometimes it’s called liberation, enlightenment,
awake, whatever the word may be we suspect

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.630
there’s really no vocabulary that captures
what that might be.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.720
The people that we’ve talked to in this
Olympic level group say it’s very spacious

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.940
and you’re wide open, you’re prepared
for whatever may come, we just don’t know.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.350
But we do know it’s quite remarkable.
