00:00:00.175 --> 00:00:01.008
- [Instructor] Talk a little bit about

00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:03.834
the social and political
structures of ancient Rome.

00:00:03.834 --> 00:00:06.079
It's important to keep
in mind that ancient Rome

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:08.636
wasn't just this static
thing that never changed.

00:00:08.636 --> 00:00:11.047
It existed for over 1,000 years,

00:00:11.047 --> 00:00:14.019
from its period from its
founding as a kingdom,

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.263
if you believe the founding myth,

00:00:17.263 --> 00:00:19.763
founded by Romulus in 753 BCE.

00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:23.256
Most historians don't
accept that founding myth.

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:26.947
But then it became they
overthrew their last king

00:00:26.947 --> 00:00:29.447
in 509 BCE, Tarquin the Proud,

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:32.765
and then they established
the Roman republic,

00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:35.048
which was eventually then turned into

00:00:35.048 --> 00:00:38.381
an empire by Julius Caesar and Augustus.

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:41.947
And so, whenever you have
something this long lasting,

00:00:41.947 --> 00:00:43.188
you could imagine the social and

00:00:43.188 --> 00:00:46.142
the political structures
evolved over time.

00:00:46.142 --> 00:00:50.425
But let's begin with the
period when it was a kingdom,

00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:52.460
because even then there were some things

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.785
that were noteworthy and some social

00:00:54.785 --> 00:00:56.314
and political structures that continued

00:00:56.314 --> 00:01:00.821
into the republic period and
even when it was an empire.

00:01:00.821 --> 00:01:02.388
So one interesting thing is that

00:01:02.388 --> 00:01:04.428
when we typically think of kings,

00:01:04.428 --> 00:01:08.077
we think of it as being
dynastic, that if I am king,

00:01:08.077 --> 00:01:10.712
then my oldest son, or
maybe in certain cultures,

00:01:10.712 --> 00:01:13.500
my oldest daughter might
become king or queen.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.492
But turns out, that many of the,

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:18.549
especially the early kings
of the Roman kingdom,

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:20.601
were actually elected.

00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:24.210
They had a lot of power, all
the power resided in them,

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.938
they were the executive, the legislative,

00:01:26.938 --> 00:01:29.871
they were the judicial, they
even had religious power.

00:01:29.871 --> 00:01:33.130
But it's interesting to think
of the idea of elected kings.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.812
Now all of them weren't elected.

00:01:34.812 --> 00:01:38.363
Several of them were dynastic
but it is an interesting idea.

00:01:38.363 --> 00:01:40.593
Now another idea that emerged during

00:01:40.593 --> 00:01:44.685
the Roman kingdom is
this idea of citizenship.

00:01:44.685 --> 00:01:46.270
Now it's important to realize today,

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.623
in a lot of countries, we think of

00:01:47.623 --> 00:01:50.822
oh, everyone who's a formal
resident of that country,

00:01:50.822 --> 00:01:52.904
you can view them as a citizen,

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:55.200
or most of the people, you
could think of citizens,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.020
especially maybe people born in a country.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.060
But that was not the case in Rome.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.298
And when we go into this Roman kingdom,

00:02:01.298 --> 00:02:03.111
I'll remind, and I do this in many videos,

00:02:03.111 --> 00:02:06.171
we're not thinking about
this sprawling Roman empire

00:02:06.171 --> 00:02:08.516
that we'll see several
hundred years later.

00:02:08.516 --> 00:02:11.971
At that time, Rome was really
just in control of Rome

00:02:11.971 --> 00:02:14.527
and over time, especially
during the republic period,

00:02:14.527 --> 00:02:18.527
it starts to expand and
eventually have hegemony

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.753
or dominant power over the Mediterranean

00:02:23.954 --> 00:02:25.754
or parts of the Middle East, I should say,

00:02:25.754 --> 00:02:27.671
and in southern Europe.

00:02:29.137 --> 00:02:30.935
But let's go back to this kingdom period.

00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:33.910
And what I'm about to
draw actually stays true

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.905
through most of Roman civilization.

00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:37.183
If this white circle are the people

00:02:37.183 --> 00:02:41.990
who lived under Roman rule,
only a subset were citizens.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.159
So this were the citizens.

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:47.326
These were male landowners,
citizens right over here.

00:02:48.221 --> 00:02:51.292
And within the citizens,
they were further divided

00:02:51.292 --> 00:02:52.875
between patricians,

00:02:54.777 --> 00:02:57.127
and you can think of them as the nobility,

00:02:57.127 --> 00:02:59.682
these were people and
they became patrician

00:02:59.682 --> 00:03:01.401
based on what family they were born into.

00:03:01.401 --> 00:03:02.730
And it's based on this idea and the word

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.347
literally comes from this
idea that you are descended

00:03:05.347 --> 00:03:08.568
from the founding fathers of Rome.

00:03:08.568 --> 00:03:11.892
And then all the other
citizens were the plebians.

00:03:11.892 --> 00:03:15.475
So all of the other
ones were the plebians,

00:03:17.241 --> 00:03:18.683
right over here.

00:03:18.683 --> 00:03:21.910
And, as we'll see, over the patricians

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.375
held most of the power
and most of the wealth

00:03:24.375 --> 00:03:25.952
for a significant amount of time.

00:03:25.952 --> 00:03:27.457
But as we go through the republic period,

00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:30.444
the plebians start to gain
more and more and more power

00:03:30.444 --> 00:03:32.771
and many plebians also
start to accrue wealth

00:03:32.771 --> 00:03:35.821
and some patrician
families do end up poor.

00:03:35.821 --> 00:03:37.735
But, for the most part, the patricians,

00:03:37.735 --> 00:03:38.833
they're the nobility,

00:03:38.833 --> 00:03:41.868
they're associated with the
aristocracy, but the plebians,

00:03:41.868 --> 00:03:44.661
some of them become wealthy
and powerful as well.

00:03:44.661 --> 00:03:45.708
Now you're probably saying what about

00:03:45.708 --> 00:03:47.321
all of these other people?

00:03:47.321 --> 00:03:49.960
Well, you could imagine
non-landholding males,

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.579
you could imagine women,
you could imagine slaves.

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.620
And even though we aggrandize Rome

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.232
and there were many very
interesting things about Rome,

00:04:01.232 --> 00:04:03.982
one of the legacies that
Rome had, which maybe

00:04:03.982 --> 00:04:08.149
as the historians reflect a
little bit more negatively on,

00:04:09.163 --> 00:04:12.604
is that Roman society was
built on the idea of slaves.

00:04:12.604 --> 00:04:17.339
And most of the slaves were
people that they subjugated

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:19.138
people that they conquered in other lands.

00:04:19.138 --> 00:04:21.381
They might have been people who at least

00:04:21.381 --> 00:04:24.148
the authorities thought they
committed a crime of some kind.

00:04:24.148 --> 00:04:27.092
But the society was built on slavery.

00:04:27.092 --> 00:04:29.761
So you had a large
segment of the population

00:04:29.761 --> 00:04:33.626
that had no rights, that
were considered slaves.

00:04:33.626 --> 00:04:36.387
Later on, they start to
gain some very, very basic,

00:04:36.387 --> 00:04:39.490
rudimentary rights, but you
can imagine, as a slave,

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.990
close to no rights whatsoever.

00:04:43.019 --> 00:04:45.534
Now, other institutions that developed

00:04:45.534 --> 00:04:47.480
during the time of the Roman kingdom were

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.462
an institution that developed at the time

00:04:49.462 --> 00:04:53.629
of the Roman kingdom was the
Senate, was the Roman Senate.

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.889
And under the king, the
king had most of the power,

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:01.724
but once the Roman
republic gets established,

00:05:01.724 --> 00:05:05.646
it's actually the Senate where
most of the power resides.

00:05:05.646 --> 00:05:08.469
Now, this right over here, is a depiction,

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:10.954
that came much later, of the Roman Senate.

00:05:10.954 --> 00:05:12.160
And it's important to realize that

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.283
the Senate was not the only institution

00:05:14.283 --> 00:05:18.083
or the only position
within the Roman republic.

00:05:18.083 --> 00:05:19.916
The consuls were there

00:05:21.262 --> 00:05:24.463
and you could view the
consuls as the executives,

00:05:24.463 --> 00:05:27.315
or if you think of a system
like the United States,

00:05:27.315 --> 00:05:30.654
the executive power
resides in the President,

00:05:30.654 --> 00:05:32.944
so it's analogous to the President.

00:05:32.944 --> 00:05:34.473
They are running the government.

00:05:34.473 --> 00:05:38.163
They are also commander
in chief of the military.

00:05:38.163 --> 00:05:40.444
Now, consuls, even
though it was considered

00:05:40.444 --> 00:05:43.737
a very high title, their
power was very limited.

00:05:43.737 --> 00:05:46.306
There was two of them at any given time,

00:05:46.306 --> 00:05:48.284
so I just drew the two consuls.

00:05:48.284 --> 00:05:51.250
They could veto each
other at any given time

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.073
to keep any one consul
from getting too powerful

00:05:54.073 --> 00:05:56.719
and they only had a one year term.

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:59.029
And during that one year,
they would alternate

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:02.558
on a monthly basis on who
was the more senior consul.

00:06:02.558 --> 00:06:05.168
So you could imagine the consuls

00:06:05.168 --> 00:06:07.583
were limited in many, many, many ways.

00:06:07.583 --> 00:06:09.195
And even though the Senate officially

00:06:09.195 --> 00:06:10.994
was supposed to advise the consuls,

00:06:10.994 --> 00:06:13.547
in practice, what the Senate told

00:06:13.547 --> 00:06:17.581
the consuls to do, the
consuls actually did.

00:06:17.581 --> 00:06:20.256
So another question is,
well, who gets to be a consul

00:06:20.256 --> 00:06:22.340
and who gets to be a Senate?

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.709
Well, in the early days, the Senate

00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:27.717
was mainly or it was
patrician, and over time,

00:06:27.717 --> 00:06:29.899
as plebians start to
exert more and more power,

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:32.394
especially as we go into
the mid and later republic,

00:06:32.394 --> 00:06:34.000
Roman republic, you start to have

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.217
more wealthy plebians in the Senate.

00:06:36.217 --> 00:06:39.880
But in general, the Senate is
composed of the aristocracy.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.047
So wealthy and influential
men of Rome are in the Senate.

00:06:46.028 --> 00:06:48.661
How are they selected for the Senate?

00:06:48.661 --> 00:06:50.707
Well, in the early days,
it was actually the consuls

00:06:50.707 --> 00:06:52.189
who selected the Senators.

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:54.381
Later on, or shortly thereafter,

00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:56.929
and for most of the
republic period of Rome,

00:06:56.929 --> 00:06:59.846
it was a position called the censor

00:07:01.518 --> 00:07:05.685
that decided who got to
actually serve in the Senate.

00:07:07.694 --> 00:07:08.894
Now another question you might say

00:07:08.894 --> 00:07:11.203
is well, who's deciding
who gets to be a consul,

00:07:11.203 --> 00:07:12.189
who gets to be a censor,

00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:14.730
and there's many other of
these executive positions

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:16.884
that are generally called magistrates,

00:07:16.884 --> 00:07:19.559
and that came from one
of the assemblies of

00:07:19.559 --> 00:07:23.726
the Roman republic, in particular,
the Centuriate assembly.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.127
Centuriate assembly,

00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:33.754
which elected consuls,
the senior executives,

00:07:33.754 --> 00:07:35.020
the senior magistrates,

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.453
is one way that you could think
about it, they elected them.

00:07:38.453 --> 00:07:41.332
And who was in the Centuriate assembly

00:07:41.332 --> 00:07:43.630
and why did they call it
the Centuriate assembly?

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:47.149
Well, it started off as citizen soldiers

00:07:47.149 --> 00:07:51.278
being grouped into groups of
100 and on a particular issue,

00:07:51.278 --> 00:07:54.182
including who should be elected consul,

00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:55.555
this group of 100 would vote,

00:07:55.555 --> 00:07:58.430
whatever the majority would
be, then their representative

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:00.314
to the assembly would vote that way.

00:08:00.314 --> 00:08:01.874
So they wouldn't just
select a representative

00:08:01.874 --> 00:08:04.516
and that representative
could do anything they want.

00:08:04.516 --> 00:08:07.217
They would tell that
representative how to vote,

00:08:07.217 --> 00:08:09.096
but that's why it was called
a Centuriate assembly,

00:08:09.096 --> 00:08:11.398
because you had these groups of 100.

00:08:11.398 --> 00:08:14.469
And a lot of their power was
in electing these consuls

00:08:14.469 --> 00:08:16.523
and these other senior magistrates.

00:08:16.523 --> 00:08:18.599
But that wasn't the only assembly.

00:08:18.599 --> 00:08:21.923
You also had the tribunal assembly.

00:08:21.923 --> 00:08:25.451
This is breaking up the Roman population,

00:08:25.451 --> 00:08:27.951
the Roman citizenry, by tribe.

00:08:29.721 --> 00:08:33.721
And this had both plebians
and patricians in it.

00:08:35.446 --> 00:08:37.413
So this is the tribunal assembly.

00:08:37.413 --> 00:08:41.580
You also have the Plebian
Council, this was only plebians.

00:08:43.522 --> 00:08:47.120
You also have the Plebian Council.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.939
And even though, all of these,
and they evolved over time.

00:08:50.939 --> 00:08:53.396
Over time, the plebians started
to get more and more power,

00:08:53.396 --> 00:08:56.829
the general idea, especially
during the Roman republic,

00:08:56.829 --> 00:08:59.493
is that the Senate is
where the important debates

00:08:59.493 --> 00:09:02.568
on foreign policy happened,
the important debates

00:09:02.568 --> 00:09:05.912
on what Rome should become as a society,

00:09:05.912 --> 00:09:09.495
as a republic, and
eventually as an empire.
