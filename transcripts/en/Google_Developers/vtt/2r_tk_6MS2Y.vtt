QUIM GIL: My name is Quim Gil.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.780
I work with Wikimedia foundation
as technical contributor

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.130
coordinator.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.670
Wikimedia is the movement that
develops Wikipedia, but also

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.670
many other projects like
Wikimedia commons, Wiktionary,

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.950
Wikiquote, Wikidata,
and so forth.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.100
We care about free knowledge,
spreading free knowledge

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.030
for everybody.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.700
We are definitely one of
the largest repositories

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.770
of knowledge of
the world, and that

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.750
requires plenty of
open source projects.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.930
So yes, we run a lot of
software in the back end.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.950
This year's Summer of
Code was very special,

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.550
because we went from
nine students to 19.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.110
And that was great.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.920
But at the same time
we were a bit scared.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.730
Can we handle that?

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.450
But the results
were pretty amazing.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.590
So we are really happy
about the experience.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.460
And also, we are very happy
about the small detail, which

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.560
is important, which is seven
of those students were women,

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.215
which was a very
different scenario

00:01:05.215 --> 00:01:07.940
than any previous years.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.920
So when you do this big
jump, basically doubling

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.630
the number of projects
that you are taking,

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.370
you really need to get
organized in a different way.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.410
You need to be more systematic.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.440
You need to rely on a lot more
on the mentors themselves.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.720
Each theme must be
more autonomous.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.950
But we kind of manage.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.600
We set this rule
that every project

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.290
needed to have two
mentors, for instance.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.270
They turn out to
work pretty well.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.440
We also put our bet in using
the regular community channels

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.420
for support, for deployment.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.700
In this way, just
after a few weeks,

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.970
our Summer of Code students were
not Summer of Code students.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.880
They were just regular members
of our community using exactly

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.410
the same channels as
the rest of us used.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:04.720
There's so much work to do.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.780
We could have Summer
of Code every season

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.919
if we could just handle that.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:15.100
What we're interested
in promoting more

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.350
in future additions is, well,
everybody knows Wikipedia.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.949
And, of course, Wikipedia
is our champion project.

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:23.490
But precisely because
of that reason,

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.610
we get a lot of attention
from the Wikimedia foundation,

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.810
but also from many contributors.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.500
We have many other projects
that are just as important.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.890
As I said before, like Wikimedia
commons, or Wikivoyage,

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.950
they are quite specialized and
they also have software needs.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.220
We want to help them more.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.650
We helped them
already in this round.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.150
But we really want
mentors and students

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.040
to put their focus on
these other projects.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.706
Because they need a lot of love,
and they have great communities

00:02:56.706 --> 00:02:59.210
that would help
anybody stepping in.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:04.320
If you want to see something
improve in Wikipedia, if you're

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.110
missing something that
should be there, all we do

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.450
is open source.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.280
And actually for us,
code is also text

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.120
that anybody can edit.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.035
Step in.

00:03:16.035 --> 00:03:17.410
I think we are a
great community.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.540
We are really friendly.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.900
And actually, any little
change that you can contribute

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.170
is going to be seen and
used by millions, literally.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.710
The core software
that runs Wikipedia

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.860
is developed with PHP.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.520
And this is the main language
we use for many projects.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.180
However, we have
many opportunities

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.870
for JavaScript
projects in the form

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.080
of plug-ins that could
be used for improved

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.060
musical notation, for instance.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.470
Or improve math syntax.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.210
Or you can also help,
like helping Wikimedia

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.760
support better media formats.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.090
It is all about
increasing the diversity

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:13.735
of free content, free media that
Wikipedia users could just use.

00:04:13.735 --> 00:04:15.670
Go check mediawiki.org.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.089
This is the mediawiki.org.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:21.329
This is the site
where we coordinate

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.140
all our technical activities.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.620
We have a page called
how to contribute,

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.580
which describes the
many different areas.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.170
Because, really, we have
from JavaScript gadgets

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.340
that someone could
code on a weekend

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:40.260
to deep pieces of infrastructure
that are running our servers.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.250
I mean, in between you have
many different projects for

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.700
designers, testers,
documentation.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.380
We have about 500
regular contributors

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.490
and about 2,000
contributors in total.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.710
And there's really hundreds
of software projects there.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.220
There's a chance for almost
any type of free software

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.150
contribution.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.020
We have former students
that are in the community.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.530
We have former students
that are mentors.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.910
We have former students that are
now employees of the Wikimedia

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:21.280
foundation or on other
Wikimedia organizations.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.810
This year, we had
a student that,

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.700
right after the
evaluation, was already

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.100
starting to work as
full-time developer

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.210
in the project she
was working on.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.900
Yes, we are not participating
in Summer of Code

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.320
for-- to hire developers.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.470
But of course, it's
a possible path.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.270
And well, it shows
the possibilities

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.922
that great students might
have in our community.

00:05:51.922 --> 00:05:53.220
MALE SPEAKER: Great, all right.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.506
That sounds great.

00:05:54.506 --> 00:05:56.179
QUIM GIL: Good.
