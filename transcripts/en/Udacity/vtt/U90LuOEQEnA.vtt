00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.330
Okay, Michael, what's the answer?

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.470
&gt;&gt; So, alright. Does it make sense to repeat, an attribute along a path in

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.600
the tree? So, it seems like it could be no, [SOUND] in that, you know,

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.750
if we're looking at attributes like, you know, is a true, then later we would

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.970
ask again is a true because we would already have known the answer to that.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.380
&gt;&gt; Right, and by the way, information

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.860
gain will pick that for you automatically.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.880
&gt;&gt; It doesn't have to be a special thing in the algorithm,

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.790
if, if, you consider, an attribute that you've already split on, then you're not

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.090
going to gain any information, so it's going to be the worst thing, to split on.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:32.970
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.020
&gt;&gt; Alright, but it,

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.410
&gt;&gt; Okay, doing good.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.180
&gt;&gt; But it seems like maybe you're trying to lead us

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.470
on because ,this we're in the continuous attributes portion of our show.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.020
&gt;&gt; Okay, well what's the answer there? Is the answer not also false?

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.880
&gt;&gt; Well we wouldn't want to ask the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.700
same question, about the same attribute. So,

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.096
we wouldn't have age, between 20 an 30, and then later ask again, age ,between

00:00:51.096 --> 00:00:55.160
20 and 30. But ,maybe we want to ask, you know, given that we are less than 20,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.400
we're, are we teenagers or not, so we might

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.720
have a different range, on age later in the tree.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.360
&gt;&gt; So, that's exactly right, Michael. So, the answer is

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.930
no, it does not make sense ,to repeat an attribute along

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.520
a path of the tree, for discrete, value trees. However, for

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.484
continuous [UNKNOWN] attributes, it does

00:01:14.484 --> 00:01:16.230
make sense. Because, what you're actually

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.840
doing, is asking a different question. So, one way to think

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.800
about this, is that the question is age in the 20's

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.810
or not. Is actually ,a discreet valued attribute that you've just

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.430
created, for the purposes of the decision tree. So, asking that

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.670
question doesn't make sense but asking a different question, about age,

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.390
does in fact make sense. So ,once you know, that you

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.740
are not in the 20's you might ask well am I

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.650
less than, 20 years old? Maybe a teenager or am I greater

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.420
than 40. How old am I, 44? Greater than 44, in which case, I'm old.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.570
&gt;&gt; So if it's, if you ask, [LAUGH] the

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.270
tree that you drew isn't quite right though, right?

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.530
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.360
&gt;&gt; because, if you go down the false branch, it means you are less than 20.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.550
&gt;&gt; No, I can be greater than 30.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.050
&gt;&gt; Oh, good one.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.480
&gt;&gt; Yes, I'm very clever, or at least I accidentally got it right.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.750
One of the two, it's the same thing. Okay, so there you go.
