00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.059
Because fixing mutations are so important, if you have

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:07.180
even one copy of a gene from BRCA1 that

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.890
doesn't work right, you're going to see that effect.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.490
And that means this allele would be dominant, not

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.059
recessive, because you would see an effect only with

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.380
one copy. And just like some of the other

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.180
dominant alleles we've learned about. The homozygous version of

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.000
this doesn't really exist for people because it's actually lethal.
