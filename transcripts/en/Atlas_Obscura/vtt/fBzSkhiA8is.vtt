00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.680
- First of all, I never
had a dollhouse as a child.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.130
We were really too poor.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.210
My mother, she raised us,
five of us, by herself,

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.113
but I knew how to make a
dollhouse out of cardboard boxes.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.510
So I would make those
for myself and my sisters

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.150
to play with.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.490
I finally bought one when I was about 40,

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.490
and I just loved the size
and the scale of miniatures.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.390
I could decorate-

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.230
put down the carpet and the
wallpaper and everything-

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.903
and that was exciting.

00:00:46.975 --> 00:00:48.730
By then I'd had two children,

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.293
my son and my daughter.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.130
I thought no person ever loved anybody

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.843
as much as I loved my son.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.223
I really thought that.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.100
The last time I saw him
then, when he was free,

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.560
he was going with his father to be

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.090
sized for his tuxedo for the prom.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.930
When I got home, I got a call from him

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.473
saying he was in jail.

00:01:28.302 --> 00:01:31.003
I just, you know, fell apart.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.213
Just fell apart.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.633
And because he had a prior record then...

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.750
- When this bill is law,

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.890
three-strikes-and-you're-out
will be the law of the land.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.130
It will be used to put
100,000 police officers

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.963
on the street.

00:01:49.963 --> 00:01:51.210
It will be used to build prisons

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.020
to keep 100,000 violent
criminals off the street.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.228
It will be used to give our young people

00:01:57.228 --> 00:01:59.928
something to say yes to.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.460
- He didn't deserve 167 years.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.610
He didn't kill anybody
or anything like that.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.233
So why would you give him 167 years,

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.630
when they killed Trayvon and Mike Brown?

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.300
Oh, my god!

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.607
When Mike Brown's mother said,

00:02:37.607 --> 00:02:42.187
"Do you know how hard it is
to bring up a black child

00:02:42.187 --> 00:02:45.640
and let him graduate from high school?"

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.540
And that really hit me,

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.340
'cause I knew what she was talking about.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.400
That's a lot of work.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.940
You know, my son is still alive,

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.533
but part of me is in prison with him.

00:03:05.603 --> 00:03:08.833
Mm-hmm, I never know how
they're gonna end up.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.820
If they're sad, you have
to give 'em a sad face.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.723
If they're laughing, you
have to make 'em laugh.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.070
I was limp.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.590
I couldn't do anything.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.240
All I could do was think about my child

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.800
not eating properly, or...

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.550
He had never even been away from home.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.080
I had sent him to camp,

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.400
but it just broke me down
to my knees, I think,

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.150
because I didn't raise him like that.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.990
So I stopped working.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.690
I just was very, very depressed

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.143
and thinking what I should've done.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.723
And finally I thought,

00:03:53.723 --> 00:03:56.317
because I was an activist in the '60s,

00:03:56.317 --> 00:03:59.710
I thought I had told them things,

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.250
but evidently not enough.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.250
So that gave me the idea to
make the Black History Museum

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.630
and go into the schools
and explain their lineage.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.000
They didn't come from weak people.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.210
They came from people that
wanted a brighter future

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:23.580
and suffered a lot to get to that point.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.730
So, that's what I want
to tell the young people.

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.550
They don't have to join a gang or...

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.753
Just be themselves.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.950
So none of this is sewn.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.720
I don't know how to sew,

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.050
but we use tacky glue,

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.120
and that is what's held
all these exhibits together

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.453
all these years, tacky glue.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.080
What the media shows and
what they choose to cover

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.160
is oftentimes not flattering
to young black men

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.851
and you can't tell me
that doesn't affect them,

00:05:10.851 --> 00:05:14.490
the way they think about themselves.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.490
So, my job, I felt, was to tell them about

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.100
where they came from,

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.369
what our people had to go through

00:05:24.369 --> 00:05:27.763
to even be recognized as a human being.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.100
So, we owe them a debt.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.960
We owe our ancestors a debt.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.510
A lot of times the kids
aren't taught that at home,

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.790
and definitely not at school.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.563
So, this was my contribution.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.770
That took my mind off of
the situation with my son,

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.420
especially in the beginning.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.770
I would just go without eating, bathing,

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.030
everything, just into it,

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.700
and that helped me.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.123
Saved my life, I think.

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.290
My husband, he designed these boxes

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.240
and made sure it had glass on the top

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.821
so the light could get in.

00:06:09.821 --> 00:06:10.970
- I can.
- Oh yeah.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.641
- Cut that down
- Look at that!

00:06:12.641 --> 00:06:13.761
- Yeah, I can cut that down.

00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:14.990
- If we had another way.

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.270
He'd tell me, "I have
to have you looked at."

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.943
Isn't that ugly?

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.603
Say that to your wife.

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:27.783
"I have to have you looked at."
- Mm-hmm.

00:06:27.783 --> 00:06:29.870
Yeah, if he was around you all the time

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.370
he'd be saying the same thing.

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:37.206
- Woo.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.690
He always wanted my success
and the success of our work.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.420
So the dioramas wouldn't
have any place to be

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.350
if he didn't make the boxes.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:50.490
So, he can whip 'em out like that.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.530
It's me that takes all the time.

00:06:54.495 --> 00:06:56.662
'Cause it's a lot of work.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.193
This is my little part.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.298
I can't go to jail anymore.

00:07:09.298 --> 00:07:10.957
And I've marched;

00:07:10.957 --> 00:07:12.870
I don't wanna do that anymore.

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.890
But I will show them who they are,

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:17.700
who their people were,

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.200
and maybe that'll pick 'em up.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.080
I look at these kids.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.043
They need me just like
he needed more of...

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:06.680
I like for them to be
wherever they can be seen

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.940
and appreciated.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.833
Nobody sees them here.

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.883
That's part of my dream for the future.

00:08:15.459 --> 00:08:19.250
In my mind, thinking about the future,

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:23.373
we have a building that
we can use and renovate.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:28.530
Where we still have the museum expanded,

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:32.790
and that I might have a creative room

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:36.260
to work with children
and teach them how to

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.180
accomplish this craft.

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:41.410
Maybe have a little library
for children in there.

00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:42.960
It's a happy place.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.610
It's a safe place for
families to spend time,

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:49.671
because this is not a
looky-loo where you can just

00:08:49.671 --> 00:08:51.400
look at it and go.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.960
You have to spend some
time with your child,

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.391
so they will know the truth.

00:08:56.391 --> 00:08:59.530
Just a place where they can come and learn

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:03.543
and have fun, read.

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:07.430
I just see something for the future

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:10.573
that would be just heavenly.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.290
Yeah, and I believe it's gonna come, too.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:17.640
Yeah, we don't have a quarter,

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.903
but it's gonna come.

00:09:18.903 --> 00:09:19.927
Mm-hmm.

00:09:19.927 --> 00:09:22.866
'Cause the children are at stake.

00:09:22.866 --> 00:09:24.329
So.

00:09:28.297 --> 00:09:29.849
Are we good?
- Yeah.

00:09:29.849 --> 00:09:32.470
Should we do the waltz?

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:33.303
- The waltz?

00:09:33.303 --> 00:09:35.720
Yes, you should do the waltz.
