BILL LUAN: Shanghai
GDG is a very

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.610
interesting developer community.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:07.440
SUSANNAH RAUB: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.670
has asked this question.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:09.960
RETO MEIER: This is where
the magic happens.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.060
JENNY MURPHY: This is primarily
a question and

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.740
answer show, so if any of you
out there would like to ask

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:14.990
questions--

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.560
LOUIS GRAY: Good afternoon.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.340
This is Louis Gray here, with
Google Developers Live.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.500
We've started a little bit late,
but we're really excited

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.450
here to go ahead and
talk with you and

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.600
introduce you to Don Dodge.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.190
He's a developer advocate in the
Developer Relations team

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.710
for Google.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.490
My name's Louis Gray, as
I mentioned before.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.950
I run Google Developers Live.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.500
And between the two of us, Don
and I have had a lot of

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.870
experience not only working at
startups, but working with

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.730
startups, covering startups,
talking to

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.330
people who do startups.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.220
And it might not seem the case
because Google is such a large

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.270
company, but we really are
especially interested in

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.400
entrepreneurship, VC investing,
angel investing,

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.970
and finding out what are the
next applications, services,

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.750
and people to really make a
difference in technology.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:03.869
So I wanted to see if--

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:04.657
Don, you can have
an opportunity

00:01:04.657 --> 00:01:06.700
to introduce yourself.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.960
DON DODGE: Hi.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.160
I'm Don Dodge.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.540
I work at Google Developer
Relations.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.690
And I work with startups mostly,
all across the world.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.315
I live in Boston area and work
in Mountain View and travel

00:01:23.315 --> 00:01:25.620
all over the world to find
the most exciting

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.530
startups that we can find.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.540
LOUIS GRAY: And how did you
end up at Google, Don?

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.740
DON DODGE: Well most
people know me from

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.010
Microsoft or Google.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.390
I worked at Microsoft and did
a similar job there in

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.650
Developer Relations and worked
with startups and venture

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.796
capital people.

00:01:45.796 --> 00:01:48.620
I was there for five years,
and now I'm at Google

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.870
Developer Relations doing
a similar job.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.580
And I've been here
for three years.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.180
The interesting thing though, is
most of my career was spent

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.310
at startups.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.580
I was involved in six of them.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.420
And most of my career
was with startups.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.362
Yet most people know me from
Microsoft or Google.

00:02:08.362 --> 00:02:09.070
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.009
That's pretty common, as you
can understand, with people

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.050
paying so much attention to
the big companies like

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.540
Microsoft and Google who make
a lot of the products

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.990
we use every day.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.040
It's easy to know you from
the big visibility.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.400
But the startup world is
very interesting space.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.500
I used to say that Google is the
biggest startup I've ever

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.620
worked for.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.810
There's a lot of things about
Google which feel like a

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.340
startup, and other things that
feel like a big company.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.170
And so there are definitely
attributes to working on small

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.280
teams, starting with incredible
ideas, and trying

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.590
to innovate, that define
what a startup is.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.470
As someone who has gone through
successful and maybe

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.400
less successful startups, as I
have, it would be interesting

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.030
to get your take a
little bit on--

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.670
first, what a difference
is between a

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.000
startup and a big company?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.020
When do you know you've
passed that threshold?

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.900
And then second, what are some
of those ingredients that make

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.060
a startup grow to
the next level?

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.570
DON DODGE: Interesting.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.070
"Startup" is a overused term,
and not very well-defined.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.900
Startups can be two people
or 200 people, and

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.910
maybe as large as 2,000.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.310
But most times, people think
of startups being less than

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.850
three years old, less than a
couple of million in revenue,

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.550
and probably less than
50 employees.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.010
That's what I tend to think
of as a startup.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.920
But there are much larger
companies that work like a

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.290
startup and act like a startup,
so it's not an easy

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.790
thing to define.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.370
LOUIS GRAY: And we talked about
the transition from that

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.570
startup phrase to what we call--
be it a young company,

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:45.810
the "growth" phase.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.520
Sometimes I often see people
make the mistake of confusing

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.770
public companies versus private
companies as being a

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.510
definition for a startup.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.560
You look at companies like
Twitter and Facebook, for

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.890
example, who were in the private
phase for a lot longer

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:58.800
than was traditional.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.270
Maybe 10 years ago, you would
see people go public before

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:03.280
they had profitability.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.560
You would see companies go
public just after they started

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.890
achieving revenue.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.130
And it looks like these other
companies like Facebook and

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.950
Twitter had made a conscious
decision to avoid the public

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.530
market scrutiny, to avoid some
of the Sarbanes-Oxley

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.990
requirements that were there
because those requirements

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.990
have changed.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.899
Do you find that you can
actually act like a startup

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:23.180
when you're a public company?

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.690
Or maybe there are private
companies that have already

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.600
moved beyond that stage and just
can be continuous, but

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.230
don't label themselves
as startups?

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:32.100
DON DODGE: Yeah, that's
a good point.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:38.240
I think the lines have blurred
between startup, and regular

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.290
company, and private company,
and public company.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.430
So the lines have
blurred a bit.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.070
For me, the difference is if
you're profitable, you're

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.280
probably no longer a startup.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.370
So I just look at, are you a
profitable company or not?

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.370
And if you're profitable,
then you're out

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.310
of the startup phase.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.705
Whether you're public or not
is a different matter.

00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:08.401
LOUIS GRAY: You know, I worked
at a company for eight and a

00:05:08.401 --> 00:05:10.040
half years, a company
called BlueArc.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.810
It was a network storage
provider.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.220
And when I first joined, they
were at first customer ship

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.000
phase, very exciting.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.800
We launched.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.450
We got coverage from The Wall
Street Journal, and The New

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.370
York Times, and all of
the technology rags.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.520
And then for the next eight
years, we went through a

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.000
number of phases--

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.170
first customer ship to
first product, second

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.610
product, third product.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.750
We filed for IPO, we withdrew.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.160
We filed for IPO again.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.920
And from eight years through, it
was like there were things

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.500
about us that were
startup-like.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.630
But we hadn't achieved
profitability yet.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.310
And you had to constantly try
to fight and have people

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.500
understand that you
were viable.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.570
And it was interesting-- just to
put an endcap on that, they

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.740
actually were acquired by
Hitachi Data Systems last year

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.650
for more than half a
billion dollars.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.260
And you'd say, well, were
they ever profitable?

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.030
No, they weren't.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.390
They were achieving
profitability maybe in a

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.210
quarter, but not for
the full year.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.180
But I think it would be hard to
challenge them and say they

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.710
were a startup because they
weren't profitable.

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.550
I think it's hard to tie
those two together.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.150
DON DODGE: Oh sure.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:11.910
There are lots of public
companies that are not

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:12.640
profitable either.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.360
LOUIS GRAY: Absolutely.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.180
And some divisions within the
company you mentioned--

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.400
Microsoft has often tried a lot
of work on their online

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.550
services side and never
made a profit.

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.460
And it's interesting to look
at acting like a startup

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:26.440
within a big company.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.520
And you let revenue from one
part of the company really

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.300
take advantage of the other
pieces that are more

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:31.760
innovative.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.230
And maybe you can take more risk
with places that you want

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.560
to take new markets on.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.880
As someone like yourself,
you've come to Google.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.760
You interact still with startups
on a regular basis.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.390
I know you've been a judge on
TechCrunch, Disrupt, and a

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:46.890
number of other things.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.870
Where do you see your role in
terms of the rest of the

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:53.820
community outside of
the Googleplex?

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.720
DON DODGE: Well most of my work
is with startups, and has

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.590
been for virtually
all of my career.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.000
So I've either worked in
startups or worked with

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.920
startups my entire life.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.560
Sometimes Microsoft is paying my
paycheck, and now Google is

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.450
paying my paycheck.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:15.050
But my job is working with
startups, and helping them be

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:19.030
successful, and finding some
interesting startups that

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:22.940
might want to partner with
Google or maybe become a part

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.010
of Google as an acquisition.

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:28.400
So for me, my whole life
has been startups.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:28.930
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:31.480
Now one thing we talked about
before we went on the air-- we

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.500
were talking about those things
that intrigue you,

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.540
either as an angel investor or
even a blogger to try and

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.640
cover these guys.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.910
I've never been lucky enough to
have the revenue available

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:43.360
to become an angel investor.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.400
But I always saw myself, as a
blogger, you'd kind of be the

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.930
VC arm for free.

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:50.050
Like I was always super excited
about a product.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.475
And I would talk about all day,
and let people know that

00:07:52.475 --> 00:07:54.140
this is going to be something.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:57.160
And it's kind of fun to look
back at things like

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.890
MightyText, and [? Fee Lee, ?]

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:00.480
and TweetDeck, and
social media.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.910
And some of these products that
have gone from where I

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.500
was covering them first-ever on
the blog, and seeing them

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.160
become viable companies or
products that have hundreds of

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.080
thousands or even tens
of millions of users.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.800
What is it about a product
or a service that

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:15.930
really sparks your idea?

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.800
And you say, that's something
I want to invest in.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.800
Or that's something I want
to tell everybody about?

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.140
DON DODGE: Well first it has
to be something that I

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:26.600
understand and can use.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.180
So that's probably
the first gate.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.360
If I don't understand what it
is-- if it's too complicated

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.549
for me or in an area I don't
really understand, then I'm

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:40.070
probably not going to get
excited about it.

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:42.030
I've said it for a long time--

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:46.210
investors invest in companies
that are in a business they

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:50.290
understand or they're led by
people that they know.

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:53.180
If you don't know the people and
you don't understand the

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.760
business, then the chances
of investing

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.590
are pretty near zero.

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.820
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:58.910
And now you mention people--

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:01.300
I think we could talk
about whether--

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.940
teams versus ideas-- and I
think we'll get to that.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.570
But from being connected and
networked as you are, I think

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:09.450
we both see that we have friends
that are established

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.790
at Company A. And they
may go off and

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:13.190
start their own startup.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:15.060
They might regroup as
a team, and you find

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.430
them somewhere else.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.660
Do you automatically say, look,
I'm going to invest in

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.360
this guy because I know he's
going to do a great job.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.880
Maybe a good example is Mike
McHugh who went from Tellme

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.540
Networks and did Flipboard.

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:25.780
And there's a guy with
an established

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.340
track record of history.

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:30.240
You see serial entrepreneurs
kind of just have a success,

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.780
move, have another success,
have another success.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.200
Do you ever get to the point
where you know-- like if Evan

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.150
Williams comes to you and
says, I'm going to start

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:40.130
something new, that you give him
money without even asking

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:42.670
with the product is, because
of their track record?

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:46.350
And what is it that defines that
kind of leadership that

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.390
you think can see through an

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:51.300
opportunity and make it happen?

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:51.410
DON DODGE: Yeah.

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:53.260
Those are good questions.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:57.130
Serial entrepreneurs do tend
to be more successful than

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.200
first-time entrepreneurs.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:03.380
They're about 30% or 40% more
likely to be successful than a

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.600
first-time entrepreneur.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.480
But that's not always
the case.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:13.250
Sometimes serial entrepreneurs
get too fat and happy, too

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:17.390
rich, and then they want to do
something that maybe they're

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:22.090
not totally, totally
committed to.

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:25.240
And that's probably not going
to be a good investment.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.150
I've seen that happen
a couple of times.

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:30.710
But if you can catch an
entrepreneur on their second,

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:34.280
third, fourth company, you've
got a pretty good chance of

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.780
being successful.

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:36.530
LOUIS GRAY: Now usually
a startup--

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:39.240
and we talked about it being
as few as three people--

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.750
but it always starts with one
person with one idea.

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:44.400
I've see a lot of change in
the Valley in the 15 years

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.710
that I've been working here--

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:47.870
about what is critical
and what's important.

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:50.060
I think-- when I was first in
the Valley, I remember you'd

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.910
read like MacWEEK Magazine, a
and it seemed that everybody

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:54.980
wanted to be a webmaster.

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:57.320
And maybe three years ago,
everybody wanted to be a

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.790
social media expert.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:01.220
And you've seen these waves kind
of come and go and find

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.200
out what's critical
to a startup.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.350
What are the type of roles
that you see all sorts of

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:08.780
startups really just
overpaying for?

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:10.880
Or they're really, really
looking for talent and it's

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.060
hard to find.

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:13.330
Is it design?

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.050
Is it something on
the back-end?

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.160
What is it that you think
everybody is really just

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.450
hopping for right now, and why
do you think that's happening?

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:22.870
DON DODGE: Well I think
designers are

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:24.850
the new rock stars.

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:26.750
So you're right.

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:31.160
In the past, everyone wanted
to be a website developer.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.330
And then a few years ago,
it was all social media.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.040
Everybody wanted to do that.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.410
And more recently, it's
a mobile developer--

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:43.350
or mobile games, mobile apps,
that kind of thing.

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:48.050
But what I'm seeing now is
designers are the key hire.

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:51.220
I've seen several companies
that I've invested in

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:55.510
personally, where they have a
great technical team, but they

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:57.540
struggle to find a designer.

00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:01.450
And design is so important
in social applications--

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:06.070
much more so than
enterprise-type applications.

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:10.570
And great designers are really,
really hard to find.

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:14.130
LOUIS GRAY: What does a company
need to do to find

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:15.030
this kind of talent?

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:17.210
How do you try and prioritize
when you don't have a lot of

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:18.680
money to start with?

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.330
How you grow a team?

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.080
DON DODGE: You know, that's
a good question too.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:28.080
I have people ask me, well, why
can't I be a sole founder?

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.090
Why do I have to have
several co-founders?

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:35.820
Or why do I have to have
technical people, or design

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.540
people, or business people,
or marketing people?

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:43.700
And the answer is that you
really only need the talent

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:47.130
that you need to get to
that next milestone.

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:49.920
Maybe it's a public beta.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:54.220
Or maybe it's releasing
it for real.

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:57.750
But whatever talent that you
need to get to that level is

00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:00.590
really all you need
for that time.

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:04.670
And it can be a different mix
of people as you go along.

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:08.430
But the key thing is, why do you
need more than one person

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:10.430
to start a company?

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:12.820
It's validation, really.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:17.260
Investors rarely will invest
in a company that has one

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.740
founder and maybe a couple
of engineers.

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:23.360
The reason is, they're looking
for validation.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:27.340
They want to know that you're
a leader that can attract

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.660
great talent.

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:33.130
If you can't convince a couple
of great people to drop what

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:38.350
they're doing and come join
you and your company, then

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.800
it's probably not a good idea.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:41.410
So--

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:43.540
LOUIS GRAY: One of the things
that I ran into a lot--

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:45.700
I would be asked to cover a lot
of different events, be it

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.590
something like TechCrunch,
Disrupt, or 500

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:50.250
Startups, demo days.

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:52.160
And what was always interesting
is they had a very

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.550
explicit pitch--

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:54.580
here's what we're doing.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.930
Here's the team that we have.

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:58.300
We're positioned in this market
that we know well.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.290
And here's how much money
we're raising.

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:02.920
And I think a lot of times,
people get excited about the

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.700
press releases that say X
company has raised $1 million,

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.820
$5 million, $10 million,
whatever that is.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.680
And obviously with tech blogging
being what it is,

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.960
it's rare that you see people
follow-up and go, what did you

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.400
do with that $5 million?

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.620
And what is that $5 million for
a hardware company versus

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:20.290
$5 million for a software
company, having lived through

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:22.510
a company that raised
a quarter billion

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:24.090
from venture capital.

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:26.440
But for hardware, I can
understand that the metrics

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.000
are a little bit different.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.620
What do you think money from
investment should be going for

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:35.040
at different stages of
a company's life?

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.740
And then the second thing--

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:39.750
as an investor, what kind of
role do you think you play, as

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:42.090
opposed to just putting money
on a bet and hoping it comes

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:44.660
back 5 or 10X?

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:49.130
DON DODGE: Well, I think we've
seen recently startups raise

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:50.570
too much money.

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:54.340
And having too much money
is almost as bad

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.000
as having not enough.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.800
If you have too much money,
you hire too many people.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.450
You expand too quickly.

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:06.210
You don't have that
hungry, work all

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:08.490
night kind of attitude.

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:14.150
So as an investor, I would
rather invest a million or so

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:19.280
in a pre-revenue startup than
I would invest in a company

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.330
that's raising $10 million.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.510
Because it's a whole
different dynamic.

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:28.890
The second thing is, as an
investor, I can add more value

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:32.150
to a small startup that's
pre-revenue and raising a

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:36.230
small amount of money than I
can a big company that's

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:38.380
raising $10 million
or $20 million.

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:38.880
So--

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.020
LOUIS GRAY: What kind of
impact do you mean?

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:41.670
Is it more than just the money
that you're providing?

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:43.740
Or what kind of advisor
role can you give?

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:46.070
What kind of introductions
can you do?

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.620
What are you supposed to do
after writing a check?

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:51.770
DON DODGE: Well I tell people
if I wanted to be a passive

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:55.190
investor, I would invest in
the stock market and just

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:56.400
invest in stocks.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.880
I'm not a passive investor.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.830
I'm an active investor
and try to add value.

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:04.820
So that means I'll help them
find other investors.

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:07.735
I'll help them find their
series A, B, C's.

00:16:07.735 --> 00:16:11.370
I'll help them get introduced
to the press--

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:15.950
TechCrunch and VentureBeat and
PandoDaily, and all these

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:17.970
other outlets.

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:22.130
I'll help them find maybe
some executive talent.

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:25.030
Help them find a designer,
introduce them

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:27.500
to potential partners.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:31.630
So it's those kinds of things
that are pretty important for

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:34.460
a startup when they're just
getting going, and less

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:38.430
important when they're on their
Series B and have raised

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:39.403
$20 million.

00:16:39.403 --> 00:16:40.330
LOUIS GRAY: Yeah.

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:41.670
So I want to go back
a little bit.

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:44.510
We were talking about your
history with startups.

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:46.080
You didn't tell anybody
what those are.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.040
Now I've known because we've
talked for some time.

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:51.010
And I think it's always
interesting to get behind--

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.680
behind the Microsoft, behind
the Google story, and

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.470
understand where you
were before that.

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:57.000
Maybe you can give us a little
bit of background on those

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.350
startups, and kind of talk about
either a success story

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:04.408
or a challenge story that came
out of any of those.

00:17:04.408 --> 00:17:04.859
DON DODGE: Yeah.

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:10.190
I did five startups, which
was most of my career.

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:13.099
And only late in life did I
join a big company like

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:14.130
Microsoft or Google--

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:15.800
LOUIS GRAY: But you say "late in
life" as if you're on your

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:16.364
death bed, sir.

00:17:16.364 --> 00:17:18.192
And I still see that your hair
is brown, and you're walking

00:17:18.192 --> 00:17:19.480
around with vitality.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.500
So I think it's not going to be
long where you say "most of

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.200
your life," because eventually,
Google will take

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.990
up the plurality
of your career.

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:27.680
DON DODGE: Yeah,
let's hope so.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.480
I started working when
I was very young.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.130
But the common thread through
all of the five startups that

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:37.540
I did was they were the
first of its kind--

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:40.870
the first time that this
technology had ever been done.

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:43.320
So it was bleeding edge
kind of stuff.

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:46.100
And I didn't plan it that way.

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:50.630
But once I did a couple of
startups, when I went to the

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:54.050
next one, it was always, OK--

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:56.590
is this leading edge stuff?

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:59.790
Is this breakthrough
kind of technology?

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:05.350
Is the startup team someone who
I really respect and I can

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:07.100
learn from?

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:10.690
Is it something new that
I haven't done before?

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:13.460
There's an interesting story.

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:14.150
I was--

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:16.180
one of the startups
was AltaVista.

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:20.510
It was the first real search
engine on the web.

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:27.970
And I was running the crawler
team and later

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:30.360
did multimedia search--

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:34.860
so searching for images, or
searching for music, or

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:36.850
searching for video.

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:39.020
And that had never
been done before.

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:41.090
So it was very exciting stuff.

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:46.210
And there was this tiny little
startup called "Google," and

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:50.650
Larry and Sergey were still
in their dorm room.

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:51.940
And I knew them then.

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:57.940
And I could have joined Google
12 years ago, right after

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:00.430
AltaVista, but you know
what I thought?

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:01.460
I've already done that.

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:03.280
I've done search.

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:05.210
We invented multimedia search.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:07.760
And it just wasn't that
interesting to me.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.360
So I didn't go to Google.

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:12.440
Instead, I went to Napster.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:16.280
Because Napster was something
really new and interesting,

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.470
never been done before.

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:18.530
DON DODGE: Now what's
incredible, Don--

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:20.430
I have to stop you
for a second.

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:22.730
Some people who are watching
this video don't know what

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:24.560
Napster was.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.940
I mean, I know that sounds wild,
because I was already

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:28.810
working in the Valley when
Napster was going on.

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:30.670
And it was quite controversial,
but also very

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:32.850
exciting as it changed
the game.

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:35.026
Tell us a little bit
about Napster.

00:19:35.026 --> 00:19:35.510
DON DODGE: Right.

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:37.160
So let me back up a little
bit further.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.560
AltaVista--

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:39.730
people might not know that.

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:43.260
But AltaVista was the first
search engine, the first

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.630
search engine of any size.

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:47.730
And it was the "Google"
of its day.

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:52.720
And this was back
in 1995, 1996.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.490
So it was pretty
amazing stuff.

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:59.900
Napster was the first
music sharing site.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:04.440
And it was a peer-to-peer kind
of environment where you could

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.510
share music with other
people, maybe people

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:08.990
you didn't even know.

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:12.930
And they could share
music with you.

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:16.700
It turned out to be, at least
determined by the courts, to

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:19.250
be illegal, and was shut down.

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:22.810
And it was the precursor of all
the music sharing sites

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:24.060
that are on the internet
today.

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:27.930
LOUIS GRAY: You know,
it's interesting.

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:30.650
I was actually working straight
out of college at a

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:32.680
little company called 3Cube.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.170
And every time I say 3Cube,
people go, oh, I remember.

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:35.900
I heard about them.

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.430
And they're usually thinking
about 3Com, or C-Cube, or

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:39.680
something like that.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.800
But 3Cube was in internet
communications.

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.370
And so we were doing things
like internet faxing--

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:46.370
remember back, faxing
was the thing.

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:47.730
We did conference calling.

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:50.600
And I still have yet to see a
product better than what we

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:51.190
offered back then.

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:52.035
It was called Phone Cube.

00:20:52.035 --> 00:20:55.270
And you could literally get on
your computer and dial out up

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:57.340
to 8 or 32 participants
at once.

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:58.770
You had your address book
integrated, and you

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:00.830
could call them out.

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:02.420
And I remember talking to
my mother about it.

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:04.820
Because it wasn't something like
you grew up and you say I

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:06.940
want to work on internet
faxing.

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.300
But I talked to her, and all she
was worried about, like,

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:10.750
are you doing something
good that's

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:11.790
helpful for the community?

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:14.110
Are you being able to
make great products

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:15.960
and tools for users?

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.420
So long as I wasn't
doing evil--

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:20.680
I know it sounds funny,
Google, do no evil--

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.370
but so long as I wasn't doing
something that was bad, she

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:24.510
was happy for me.

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:25.770
And I kind of got
that feedback.

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:27.820
Like it really doesn't matter
what industry you're in,

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:29.720
whether you're in music sharing,
as you're saying, or

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:33.180
search engines, or internet
communications--

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.400
so long as you're doing good
for end-users and they're

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.130
seeing value.

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:39.880
And I knew that a lot of our
customers were really excited

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:41.630
about what we were able to do.

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:43.910
We didn't have a
ton of success.

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:46.040
And eventually the company's
assets were purchased by

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:49.670
Oracle, and folded into one
of their meeting suites.

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:51.550
But we felt really good
about our product.

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:53.750
We knew that the technology
was incredible, and we got

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:55.470
great feedback from users.

00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:57.510
How do you know that you're
doing the right thing as a

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:59.310
startup, or even now?

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:00.310
How do you know that
you're providing a

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:01.480
high-quality product?

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.730
What kind of feedback
are you looking for?

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:09.650
DON DODGE: Well most of my
career in software, I worked

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:13.450
in obscurity, where no
one really understood

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:14.700
what we were doing.

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:19.320
I started my career in database
software, which is

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:23.180
arcane, back-end kind of
software that really isn't

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:25.550
visible to the public.

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:29.970
So most of the time, the work I
was doing, my parents had no

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:32.030
idea what I was doing.

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:34.860
And for most software
engineers, that's

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:35.690
the way life is.

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:39.150
You're working on things that
are not visible to the public

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:41.110
and not that well-known.

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:46.520
But underneath the covers can
be pretty amazing stuff.

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:49.430
And I think AltaVista
and Napster--

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:54.380
those two companies were the
first time in my career where

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:57.310
my mother actually understood
what I did.

00:22:57.310 --> 00:23:00.430
That doesn't make it better.

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:05.380
As a matter of fact, from a
financial perspective, we

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:08.540
didn't make money on either
one of those companies.

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:12.130
They were very well-known and
used by millions of people,

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:14.560
but we didn't make any money.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.810
LOUIS GRAY: The lawyers made
plenty of money, if I recall--

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:17.950
DON DODGE: Yeah.

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:21.170
The lawyers made a lot
of money on Napster.

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:24.000
LOUIS GRAY: So coming back to
the present day, we talked

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.300
about what angel investors
can do to help a company.

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:29.700
We talked about your approach
and what gets you interested.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.380
If I'm a startup person-- if
I've just got a great idea or

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:33.130
a great product--

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:37.360
what can I do to reach out,
either to you or other angel

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.740
investors or other VCs?

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:42.020
What is it that I need to do
to get their attention?

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:45.670
DON DODGE: It's really easier
than you might imagine.

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:50.030
Robert Scovill posts his cell
phone number on his website.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:54.530
And you can call him, you
can tweet to him.

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:59.180
You can put a message on
his Facebook page.

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:00.380
He's pretty accessible.

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:01.730
And most of us are.

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:02.515
LOUIS GRAY: But Robert's
not a VC.

00:24:02.515 --> 00:24:04.720
And he's not an angel
investor either.

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:04.980
DON DODGE: No.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:06.730
That's true.

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:10.150
But the point is that most
people who are in this

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:15.080
business are very visible
and easy to get to.

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:18.650
But all investors have
Twitter, and

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:20.510
Facebook, and Google+.

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:25.480
And they're actually pretty
easy to get to.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:28.580
That doesn't mean that they're
going to be interested or that

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:30.050
they'll respond.

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:34.870
The best way to get to investors
is to get to someone

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:36.030
who knows them.

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:41.200
So I tell startup entrepreneurs
all the time--

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:45.440
talk to other entrepreneurs who
have investors, and ask

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.280
them to introduce you to them.

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:51.290
Or talk to people who know these
VCs or these angels, and

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:53.290
ask for a warm introduction.

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:57.750
That will get you at least heard
so that you can get in

00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:58.870
front of them.

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:01.870
And then your idea has to
be something that they

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:05.750
understand, that they're
interested in, and that looks

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:07.260
like a good investment.

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:10.610
LOUIS GRAY: So what kind of
ideas or markets are certainly

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:11.670
catching your eye right now?

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:14.070
I think maybe if it's easier,
you can go ahead and name

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:16.390
companies that are exciting to
you, whether you've invested

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:17.090
in them or not?

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:18.910
And if you have, let us know.

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:20.760
But what are the types of
markets that you think are

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:25.690
really taking off or are having
incredible attention?

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:27.650
DON DODGE: Well some of them
are fairly obvious.

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:30.040
I have five areas
that I look at.

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:36.360
So it's mobile, social,
location, games, and payments.

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.320
So it's those five areas
that are pretty hot.

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:43.030
But what I do is I look for
companies that have at least

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:47.940
two of those five elements,
and preferably three.

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:51.690
That gives you a little better
chance of success.

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:56.530
And any company today, if you
don't have a mobile component,

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:58.810
it's hard to imagine how you're
going to be successful.

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:01.750
So you've got to have mobile.

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:03.780
Social--

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:05.360
that doesn't have to be there.

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:11.075
But if it's a mobile, social,
location-type company, you're

00:26:11.075 --> 00:26:12.260
hitting three of the five.

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:14.460
That's probably going
to be interesting.

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:17.940
Or if it's a mobile payments
company, that could be

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:18.770
interesting.

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:22.630
So you've got to hit at least
two of those five areas to get

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:23.750
my attention.

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:25.700
LOUIS GRAY: Now you're an
interesting guy because you've

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:28.230
got this different background be
it Microsoft, be it Google.

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:29.520
You've got database
experience.

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:32.190
You have a different variety
of backgrounds.

00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:36.010
What I'll often find is what
interested me to either write

00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:38.280
about something or to use
something, is obviously I've

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.170
got to be intrigued by the
product as something I might

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:41.670
want to use every day.

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:44.200
As we all have finite time,
the hard part is bringing

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.810
another product into your
workflow and either getting

00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:48.720
rid of something else
or reducing time

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:49.980
on something else.

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.350
Do you find yourself, for
example, carrying multiple

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:55.410
devices and different laptops
so you can test it all?

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:57.500
I know I haven't seen a lot of
BlackBerry apps coming my way

00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:59.710
recently, but for every Android
app, every once in a

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:01.270
while you see an iOS app.

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:02.830
Do you feel like you have to
carry all these different

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:04.960
devices just to test the
products that people want to

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.420
have you take a look at?

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:07.440
DON DODGE: Yeah absolutely.

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.160
I have an iPhone and
an Android phone.

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.990
I have a Mac, and I have a PC.

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:16.990
I have an iPad, and I have
a Samsung tablet.

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:19.790
So yeah, I have all these
devices, because I want to be

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:22.670
able to use different
things and try them.

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:24.470
And yes, you're right.

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:28.120
It is hard to get someone's
attention, to have them try

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:30.000
your new thing.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.090
But remember this-- if they
can't convince you to try it

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:40.160
and take the time to try it,
then they're not likely to

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:43.810
attract the number of users
that they'll need to be

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:44.620
successful.

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:47.200
So that's a good filter.

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:51.160
If it doesn't excite you, and
you won't take the time to try

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:55.240
it out, then likely a lot of
customers won't either.

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.000
LOUIS GRAY: It's interesting.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.770
Because I always sort of
get both directions.

00:27:57.770 --> 00:27:58.850
You'd understand that.

00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:02.240
But I would also get people
that almost discouragingly

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:04.650
say, well, Louis Gray and
Robert Scovill liked it.

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:06.500
That's sure to be a flop.

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.310
Because we're the
weird people.

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:10.020
We're the ones who are on the
edge who are constantly

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:11.610
connected and looking
for the new stuff.

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:14.070
I like being the first one
to join a network.

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:16.656
I like being one of the first
10 to invite my friends and

00:28:16.656 --> 00:28:18.520
have a unique invite code
that we can send out.

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:20.010
We like being the cool one.

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:23.500
And sometimes there's a little
bit of that evangelism piece,

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:26.220
as you understand, that makes
you feel like you're part of

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:26.760
the company.

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.810
Even if you don't have shares
and even if you don't

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:30.330
monetarily benefit.

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:33.120
Like every time I read
something, for example, about

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:36.290
Jason Goldberg and the work
he's done with fab.com and

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:38.130
part of that, Fabulous.

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:40.480
It's like I'm a proud father
and I'm excited for his

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:43.880
success, because I was part of
his story with social media

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.550
and being the first to write
about that, and see him

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:47.820
graduate onto the next thing.

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:50.660
I look at Iain Dodsworth of
TweetDeck, when he got

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:51.660
acquired by Twitter.

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:53.280
Again, I get nothing from it.

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.650
But like a proud papa, I push
the baby out the door

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:57.850
and say, let's go.

00:28:57.850 --> 00:29:02.060
So how do you feel about some
of that in terms of kind of

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:05.410
feeling a connection with the
entrepreneur, a connection

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:08.150
with the product, even if
you're not monetarily

00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:10.516
compensated for your
affection?

00:29:10.516 --> 00:29:12.530
DON DODGE: Yeah, well,
I feel the same way.

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:16.030
I've been in the startup world
my entire life, and I help

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:19.800
startups all the time that
I don't invest in.

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.460
I just help them because
it's what I like to do.

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:24.530
It's part of my job at Google.

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:29.820
And I live vicariously through
these startups

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:30.590
and what they do.

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:33.410
So I just think it's
a lot of fun.

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:38.210
I read Louis Gray, and Robert
Scovill, and Mike Arrington,

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:39.770
and all these other guys.

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:42.680
And I took my cues from them.

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:46.870
So when you wrote something
about a brand new social media

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:50.370
company, I would take
a look at it.

00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:54.440
So that's another way to get
visibility and get in front of

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:58.980
investors, is to come to someone
like you and have you

00:29:58.980 --> 00:29:59.840
write about them.

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.460
So it's an important part.

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:04.900
LOUIS GRAY: So you're saying I
should start blogging again.

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:06.430
I've not been doing
a great job there.

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:07.880
And obviously work
gets in the way.

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.630
But it's interesting.

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:12.680
I want to touch on one thing
before we wrap this up.

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:14.220
You're talking about your
role at Google.

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:17.350
What is it that startups and
other small or medium-sized

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:19.640
companies can learn from
using Google apps?

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:22.170
Is there something about Google
products that you think

00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:24.650
that they should adopt
right away?

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:27.050
And what are those reasons?

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:30.560
DON DODGE: Well Google has lots
of different products

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.850
that are helpful to startups.

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:41.140
So its Google Apps, Gmail,
Google Maps, Search, the

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:42.370
location stuff.

00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:45.900
There's all kinds of things
that people can use--

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:50.510
App Engine, the Compute
Engine.

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:54.610
So if you're doing a startup
that is cloud-based,

00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:59.510
web-based, mobile-based
with Android--

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:03.260
almost any startup that you can
imagine is going to touch

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:05.840
something that Google does.

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:12.160
And most of it is easy to use,
very visible, used by hundreds

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.610
of millions of people.

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:16.310
And many times free
to get started.

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:19.580
So it's a pretty obvious
place to start.

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:22.130
So the Developer Relations
Group, there's

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:24.550
almost 200 of us now--

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:27.590
are out there helping startups
use Google products to get

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:32.110
started and help them be
successful, answer questions,

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:34.330
get them technology
that they need.

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:39.670
So it's what we do, and I think
actually the job here at

00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:42.160
Google is much easier than
it was at Microsoft.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.670
Convincing startups to use
Microsoft products that you

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:50.180
had to pay for was much, much
harder than it is to get them

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:52.310
to use Google products--

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:55.160
most of which are free, or
others start out free and you

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:58.050
only pay later when
you get to scale.

00:31:58.050 --> 00:32:00.360
So it's a fun job.

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:00.900
LOUIS GRAY: Absolutely.

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:02.130
Well I definitely appreciate
you taking the

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:03.400
time to talk to me.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.730
I know we'd love to have you
back in Mountain View for a

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:07.050
lot of this.

00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:08.450
If I were your manager,
I'd push you to be

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:10.240
over here every day.

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:12.100
So maybe that time will come.

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:14.090
But I definitely appreciate you
taking the time late in

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:14.510
your week--

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:16.690
I know it's late over there
on the East Coast.

00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:18.980
And I look forward to talking
with more of these soon.

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:20.390
Thanks a lot, Don.

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:20.770
DON DODGE: Great.

00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:22.020
Thank you very much, Louis.
