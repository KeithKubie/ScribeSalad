00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.080
What is this stuff?

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:15.530
ChEARio mates, Trace ear for DNews.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.590
Earwax is weird and gross, it's basically
congealed ear sweat.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.770
There are two kinds of sweat: most is cooling
watery sweat, but some is thicker smellier

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.140
sweat -- which shows up in the armpit and
ear.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.750
Earwax isn't really wax, it's mostly dead
skin cells, proteins and oils added by the

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.260
apocrine gland.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:43.440
The junk is in there to protect the inner
ear from water or infection, as a foothold

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.570
for bacteria.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.710
Earwax fights off some diseases and can lubricate
and protect the ear from infection and water.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.850
It's a pretty common system of protection
in mammals.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.499
The wax builds up over time, and in some species
can reveal a lot about their past.

00:00:55.499 --> 00:01:00.859
Late last year, researchers at Baylor University
used the earwax of a blue whale to reveal

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:06.040
when it went through puberty, which years
it was able to find ample food, and when pollutants

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.050
like mercury were introduced to the whale's
environment.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.120
Whale earwax isn't quite the same as human
earwax, but based on studies like this, current

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.500
research is exploring what earwax can teach
us!

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.070
This week a study of human cerumen -- the
medical term for earwax -- dove into the stuff

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.410
nose first and found the smell of your earwax
can give away your ancestry!

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.030
Caucasian earwax smells stronger than East
Asian or Native Americans!

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.650
Research published in the Journal of Chromatography
B explored the ABCC11 gene, which affects

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.870
sweat, and thus earwax, in humans.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.380
The type commonly found in Caucasians creates
a stickier earwax and more stinky body odor,

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:54.030
while the type in East Asians creates dryer,
flakier earwax and less stinky body odor.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.710
It's not that the odors themselves are different,
it's that the volatile compounds in the earwax

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.740
are in different amounts.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.980
Volatile compounds are the tiny particles
we sense when we're smell something.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.729
Knowing this, scientists can use earwax, not
only to tell ethnicity, but in the future

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.640
they're going to try to follow those researching
the whale wax and see what secrets your ear

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.719
wax holds.

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:19.280
There are diseases that leave traces in ear
wax once they appear in the body.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.870
It might even catalog what you've eaten, or
where you've been!

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.709
Doctors of the future might be able to diagnose
a possible immune system invader, or health

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.150
risk, with a digital sniff of your earwax...

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.349
Now, your cerumen is protecting you from infection,
lubricating your ears, and keeping a health

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.900
record for your doctor, but even knowing ALL
THAT, there are those of you who will totally

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.170
want to get rid of it.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.370
Firstly, don't use a cotton swab.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.939
Not in the EAR CANAL.

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:49.939
Outer ear?

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:50.939
Knock yourself out.

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:51.939
Inner ear.

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:52.939
NO.

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:55.870
Sometimes, when you poke around in there with
cotton swabs, you're actually INCREASING earwax

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.440
buildup, mushing it together and causing blockages!

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.440
Stop it.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.920
Oh, and ear candling is silly and gross.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.760
Studies show it doesn't work and it's not
recommended.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.730
If you REALLY want to get rid of it, talk
to the pharmacist.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.340
They've got drops you can buy.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.500
But why would you want to?

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.010
That stuff is great!

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.930
