00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.870
 
I think that one of the most interesting

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:10.880
I think that one of the most interesting
 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.369
I think that one of the most interesting
themes in our research is that sometimes

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:15.379
themes in our research is that sometimes
 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.320
themes in our research is that sometimes
here in the West we can become prisoners

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330
here in the West we can become prisoners
 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.570
here in the West we can become prisoners
of our own cliches as Jose and planning

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580
of our own cliches as Jose and planning
 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.050
of our own cliches as Jose and planning
said today or prisoners of our own false

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060
said today or prisoners of our own false
 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.919
said today or prisoners of our own false
dichotomies and so we sometimes look to

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929
dichotomies and so we sometimes look to
 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:33.530
dichotomies and so we sometimes look to
Muslim women and we ask the question do

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540
Muslim women and we ask the question do
 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.240
Muslim women and we ask the question do
you want rights or do you want religion

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250
you want rights or do you want religion
 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.970
you want rights or do you want religion
and and that's the best that I cotta me

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980
and and that's the best that I cotta me
 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.270
and and that's the best that I cotta me
what we find when we ask Muslim women

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280
what we find when we ask Muslim women
 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.549
what we find when we ask Muslim women
themselves what they in fact want the

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559
themselves what they in fact want the
 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.580
themselves what they in fact want the
answer is both and they see no

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590
answer is both and they see no
 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.040
answer is both and they see no
contradiction between the faith they

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050
contradiction between the faith they
 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.619
contradiction between the faith they
cherish and the rights they deserve and

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629
cherish and the rights they deserve and
 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.930
cherish and the rights they deserve and
I think that's one of the most important

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940
I think that's one of the most important
 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.160
I think that's one of the most important
findings is that we have to break out of

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170
findings is that we have to break out of
 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.150
findings is that we have to break out of
these constructed false dichotomies and

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160
these constructed false dichotomies and
 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.219
these constructed false dichotomies and
really get a much more nuanced

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229
really get a much more nuanced
 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.870
really get a much more nuanced
understanding of this population which

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880
understanding of this population which
 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.850
understanding of this population which
tells us that they admire much about the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860
tells us that they admire much about the
 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.880
tells us that they admire much about the
West they they see no contradiction

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890
West they they see no contradiction
 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.710
West they they see no contradiction
between Islam and democracy or Islam and

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720
between Islam and democracy or Islam and
 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.530
between Islam and democracy or Islam and
women's rights but that these types of

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540
women's rights but that these types of
 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.800
women's rights but that these types of
things have to be have to grow out of

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810
things have to be have to grow out of
 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.830
things have to be have to grow out of
their own cultural context they cannot

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840
their own cultural context they cannot
 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.789
their own cultural context they cannot
be imposed from the outside I think that

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799
be imposed from the outside I think that
 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.130
be imposed from the outside I think that
there are definitely some ways that the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140
there are definitely some ways that the
 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.999
there are definitely some ways that the
interpretation of Islam needs to change

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009
interpretation of Islam needs to change
 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.330
interpretation of Islam needs to change
and many would argue to become more true

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340
and many would argue to become more true
 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.350
and many would argue to become more true
to its spirit but what is Islam

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360
to its spirit but what is Islam
 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.700
to its spirit but what is Islam
essentially is really the the collective

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710
essentially is really the the collective
 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.620
essentially is really the the collective
understanding of its people of its

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630
understanding of its people of its
 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.039
understanding of its people of its
followers and and so that that piece of

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049
followers and and so that that piece of
 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.010
followers and and so that that piece of
human agency is very important and what

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020
human agency is very important and what
 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.179
human agency is very important and what
we what we find is that not only are the

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189
we what we find is that not only are the
 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.249
we what we find is that not only are the
majority of Muslims interpreting their

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259
majority of Muslims interpreting their
 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.320
majority of Muslims interpreting their
faith to be to offer a vision of gender

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330
faith to be to offer a vision of gender
 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.980
faith to be to offer a vision of gender
justice but that they

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990
justice but that they
 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.310
justice but that they
they are in many ways fighting for

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320
they are in many ways fighting for
 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.010
they are in many ways fighting for
gender justice through the framework of

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020
gender justice through the framework of
 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.810
gender justice through the framework of
their faith rather than outside of it
