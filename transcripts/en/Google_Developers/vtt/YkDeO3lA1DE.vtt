Schalk:
Hello, my name is Chris Schalk.

00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:02.968
I'm a Google
Developer Advocate

00:00:02.968 --> 00:00:05.868
and I'm here at the Web 2.0
Conference in San Francisco.

00:00:05.868 --> 00:00:08.667
And I'm here
with Farhang Kassei,

00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:09.767
and he's going to tell us
a little bit about

00:00:09.767 --> 00:00:11.734
the platform that
they just announced.

00:00:11.734 --> 00:00:13.133
So feel free to introduce
yourself and tell us

00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.567
a little bit about the platform
that you announced today.

00:00:15.567 --> 00:00:17.734
Kassei:
Hi, Chris. My name
is Farhang Kassei.

00:00:17.734 --> 00:00:19.767
And we are here today

00:00:19.767 --> 00:00:22.567
to announce that eBay
is opening up Selling Manager

00:00:22.567 --> 00:00:23.901
to all developers.

00:00:23.901 --> 00:00:25.534
And Selling Manager
is the application

00:00:25.534 --> 00:00:26.667
where all the sellers go

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:28.200
to manage their business
on eBay.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.434
And we are opening it up

00:00:29.434 --> 00:00:31.534
so that you can
deploy your applications,

00:00:31.534 --> 00:00:32.734
develop your applications,

00:00:32.734 --> 00:00:34.868
and deploy directly
to the Selling Manager.

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.100
Schalk:
Cool.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.667
So can you describe
a little bit of, like,

00:00:37.667 --> 00:00:40.334
some of the technical details
behind your implementation?

00:00:40.334 --> 00:00:42.167
Such as how--
how does it use

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:44.067
OpenSocial's
gadget technology?

00:00:44.067 --> 00:00:46.067
Kassei:
So we are opening up

00:00:46.067 --> 00:00:47.400
Selling Manager
to developers,

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.868
and the applications
that developers deploy

00:00:50.868 --> 00:00:52.367
on Selling Manager

00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:54.167
are based on the gadget's
specification.

00:00:54.167 --> 00:00:56.467
And this is the same
extensibility technology

00:00:56.467 --> 00:00:59.267
that is underlying
OpenSocial.

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:00.467
Schalk:
And so can you explain

00:01:00.467 --> 00:01:02.534
maybe some of the reasons
why that you felt

00:01:02.534 --> 00:01:04.467
standardizing
on gadget technology

00:01:04.467 --> 00:01:06.234
to base
your implementation on--

00:01:06.234 --> 00:01:08.501
like, why was that, like,
the right choice for you

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:10.534
in your particular case?

00:01:10.534 --> 00:01:12.133
Kassei:
That--that's a very good
question

00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:14.100
'cause we have a--
we had a very lively debate

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.501
about this at eBay.

00:01:15.501 --> 00:01:17.067
Gadget technology,
as you know,

00:01:17.067 --> 00:01:19.868
provides the--what I call
the "so-called plumbing"

00:01:19.868 --> 00:01:21.934
underneath all applications'
infrastructure--

00:01:21.934 --> 00:01:24.901
stuff like security,
configuration,

00:01:24.901 --> 00:01:27.133
resource management,
internationalization,

00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:29.334
portable deployment--
things like that

00:01:29.334 --> 00:01:31.934
that are not
terribly interesting

00:01:31.934 --> 00:01:33.067
to the application layer

00:01:33.067 --> 00:01:34.467
but are extremely vital.

00:01:34.467 --> 00:01:36.868
And we could have
actually duplicated

00:01:36.868 --> 00:01:38.167
and developed it ourselves,

00:01:38.167 --> 00:01:40.701
but we think it's
to the benefit of everyone

00:01:40.701 --> 00:01:42.167
in the Internet community

00:01:42.167 --> 00:01:44.534
to actually help
one standard to shape up

00:01:44.534 --> 00:01:47.400
around all of these application
infrastructure components.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.067
So we thought that we're
going to use gadget technology

00:01:50.067 --> 00:01:53.400
and we help
develop the spec

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.834
towards where
it actually enables

00:01:55.834 --> 00:01:58.267
all classes of application
to be developed--

00:01:58.267 --> 00:01:59.634
not only social applications

00:01:59.634 --> 00:02:01.634
but also commerce
applications as well.

00:02:01.634 --> 00:02:02.834
Schalk:
Great, thanks.

00:02:02.834 --> 00:02:04.200
Can you explain
a little bit, like, also

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.634
how you use the Apache
Shindig technology,

00:02:07.634 --> 00:02:08.968
and how you actually
took that

00:02:08.968 --> 00:02:11.434
and created, actually,
your product.

00:02:11.434 --> 00:02:13.801
Can you explain a little bit
of that process?

00:02:13.801 --> 00:02:15.234
Kassei:
So Apache Shindig,

00:02:15.234 --> 00:02:17.434
for people who might not
be familiar with it,

00:02:17.434 --> 00:02:21.834
is an open-source reference
implementation of gadget.

00:02:21.834 --> 00:02:24.334
And when we decided
to use gadget

00:02:24.334 --> 00:02:25.534
and to support gadget,

00:02:25.534 --> 00:02:28.000
it gave us,
actually, a boost

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.934
for rapid deployment
and development.

00:02:29.934 --> 00:02:32.200
We adopted Apache Shindig

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.701
and we started, obviously,
changing some of the code.

00:02:34.701 --> 00:02:36.734
And Shindig's
actually designed

00:02:36.734 --> 00:02:40.434
to be customizable
per deployment.

00:02:40.434 --> 00:02:43.167
So we changed some stuff,
mostly around the periphery--

00:02:43.167 --> 00:02:45.000
security stuff,
some configuration stuff,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.300
some of the caching.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.601
But using Apache Shindig
actually gave us

00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:50.100
a pretty good boost
in our development.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.234
Schalk:
Mm-hmm.

00:02:51.234 --> 00:02:52.667
And how would you
describe the experience

00:02:52.667 --> 00:02:54.501
when working with
some of the other developers

00:02:54.501 --> 00:02:56.567
who actually commit
code to Shindig?

00:02:56.567 --> 00:02:59.167
Kassei:
So Shindig is an open-source
application,

00:02:59.167 --> 00:03:01.234
and it has a vibrant
community around it.

00:03:01.234 --> 00:03:03.501
And we had the benefit

00:03:03.501 --> 00:03:05.734
of actually using
their contributions,

00:03:05.734 --> 00:03:08.634
and they
constantly developed

00:03:08.634 --> 00:03:10.000
different features
on Shindig.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.167
They constantly improved
different aspects of it

00:03:14.167 --> 00:03:16.067
including performance
and security.

00:03:16.067 --> 00:03:17.901
So that was another
attractive aspect

00:03:17.901 --> 00:03:20.567
of using
an open-source paradigm

00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:24.434
that led us--
chose Apache Shindig.

00:03:24.434 --> 00:03:26.133
Schalk:
Mm-hmm. So let me shift
gears a little bit.

00:03:26.133 --> 00:03:28.601
Kind of stepping away
from the pure technology

00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:31.400
but also speaking,
like, in plain language,

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.234
how will your OpenSocial
implementation

00:03:34.234 --> 00:03:36.868
now both improve
the eBay PowerSeller

00:03:36.868 --> 00:03:40.067
as well as a gadget
developer's experience overall?

00:03:40.067 --> 00:03:43.934
Kassei:
So whatever helps eBay sellers

00:03:43.934 --> 00:03:45.200
helps eBay.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.334
And these gadgets
are actually food

00:03:48.334 --> 00:03:50.267
for the commercial
applications,

00:03:50.267 --> 00:03:52.000
and they're going
to help our sellers--

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.367
PowerSellers
or otherwise--

00:03:53.367 --> 00:03:55.367
to improve their efficiency

00:03:55.367 --> 00:03:57.100
and improve
their productivity.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.434
So in this case,
we think

00:03:58.434 --> 00:04:00.334
it's going to be a good help
to our sellers.

00:04:00.334 --> 00:04:01.767
Schalk:
Mm-hmm.

00:04:01.767 --> 00:04:03.567
And how about from the gadget
developer's perspective?

00:04:03.567 --> 00:04:05.300
How's the environment
going to help that?

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.234
Kassei:
Oh, from the gadget
developer's perspective,

00:04:07.234 --> 00:04:09.501
this is a very good
opportunity

00:04:09.501 --> 00:04:13.434
to actually access a qualified
large customer base.

00:04:13.434 --> 00:04:15.100
We're actually
willing to pay

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.300
for any tools
or any application

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.901
that helps them
be more productive

00:04:18.901 --> 00:04:20.100
or more competitive.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.300
So to my knowledge,

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.133
this is one
of the very few

00:04:24.133 --> 00:04:27.234
solid money-making
opportunities

00:04:27.234 --> 00:04:30.100
that the gadget community
has out there.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.601
And they can deploy
the applications.

00:04:31.601 --> 00:04:32.968
It's very easy.

00:04:32.968 --> 00:04:35.334
They're already familiar
with how to develop gadgets

00:04:35.334 --> 00:04:37.868
and they can
make it available

00:04:37.868 --> 00:04:39.567
to a large community
of eBay sellers.

00:04:39.567 --> 00:04:40.901
Schalk:
Mm-hmm. Great.

00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:44.300
So how do you see your new
OpenSocial implementation

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.934
affecting eBay's
overall business?

00:04:45.934 --> 00:04:48.767
Like, what's the net effect
that you expect to see?

00:04:48.767 --> 00:04:49.934
Kassei:
As I mentioned,

00:04:49.934 --> 00:04:53.033
anything that helps
our sellers helps eBay.

00:04:53.033 --> 00:04:56.834
And we definitely are enabling
the development community,

00:04:56.834 --> 00:04:58.167
the gadget
development community,

00:04:58.167 --> 00:05:00.901
to help eBay sellers
drive their growth

00:05:00.901 --> 00:05:02.767
by increasing
their productivity.

00:05:02.767 --> 00:05:04.100
So in that case,
we think

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.267
it's going to help
our sellers that way.

00:05:05.267 --> 00:05:06.434
Schalk:
Great, great.

00:05:06.434 --> 00:05:08.133
So getting back
to gadget technology--

00:05:08.133 --> 00:05:09.267
so right now you have it

00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:11.934
in your Selling Manager
implementation.

00:05:11.934 --> 00:05:13.701
Do you expect
to see gadgets

00:05:13.701 --> 00:05:16.400
in other portions
on eBay's site?

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.033
Kassei:
Let me ask you the question.

00:05:20.033 --> 00:05:21.834
What do you think
we should do

00:05:21.834 --> 00:05:23.167
next with our gadgets?

00:05:23.167 --> 00:05:24.334
Schalk:
Sure.

00:05:24.334 --> 00:05:25.801
I could see
a number of ways

00:05:25.801 --> 00:05:27.467
where you could--
for example,

00:05:27.467 --> 00:05:29.200
I could see gadget
applications themselves

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.501
being created,
which could then

00:05:31.501 --> 00:05:33.601
exist on other
OpenSocial containers

00:05:33.601 --> 00:05:36.167
and--providing kind of like
a front doorstep

00:05:36.167 --> 00:05:37.901
that would allow
anyone out there

00:05:37.901 --> 00:05:39.901
who has, like, their
comfortable social environment

00:05:39.901 --> 00:05:42.167
to then quickly jump
into the eBay experience.

00:05:42.167 --> 00:05:43.501
That's one thing
that I could see.

00:05:43.501 --> 00:05:44.934
Now that you're a container,

00:05:44.934 --> 00:05:47.400
you could easily facilitate
that with your implementation.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.467
Kassei:
That's another reason
that we chose gadgets.

00:05:49.467 --> 00:05:50.734
That's the beauty of it.

00:05:50.734 --> 00:05:51.968
Exactly what you said--

00:05:51.968 --> 00:05:53.667
which is a technology
that is well-understood

00:05:53.667 --> 00:05:56.200
by everyone--
including, for example, you--

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.033
and based on that,
you start thinking

00:05:58.033 --> 00:06:00.601
about, "What other
possibilities are there?"

00:06:00.601 --> 00:06:03.567
And some of them you might
need eBay help to implement it.

00:06:03.567 --> 00:06:04.968
And most of them
actually,

00:06:04.968 --> 00:06:06.300
you don't even need
eBay help.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.767
And you can actually
implement these gadgets,

00:06:07.767 --> 00:06:09.133
and eBay is a container,

00:06:09.133 --> 00:06:10.567
and your gadgets can do

00:06:10.567 --> 00:06:12.968
anything that is useful
to our seller community.

00:06:12.968 --> 00:06:14.167
Schalk:
Great.

00:06:14.167 --> 00:06:15.834
So I'd like to wrap it up
and if--

00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:17.400
before we finish up,
if you could tell me--

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.734
what are the next steps
a gadget developer can take

00:06:19.734 --> 00:06:22.968
to learn about how
to develop on your platform?

00:06:22.968 --> 00:06:24.968
Kassei:
So the gadget developers

00:06:24.968 --> 00:06:29.234
can visit
developer.ebay.com/web20.

00:06:29.234 --> 00:06:34.267
The URL again is
developer.ebay.com/web20.

00:06:34.267 --> 00:06:35.801
And you'll find
all the information

00:06:35.801 --> 00:06:37.200
to get started
over there.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.767
You can sign up to become
an eBay developer,

00:06:39.767 --> 00:06:41.501
and if you're already
an eBay developer,

00:06:41.501 --> 00:06:42.801
you'll find
all the information

00:06:42.801 --> 00:06:45.100
to learn about
the Selling Manger Apps--

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.300
how to develop one,
and how to deploy one on eBay.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.467
Schalk:
Great.

00:06:49.467 --> 00:06:51.200
Well, I'd like to take
this opportunity

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.567
to thank you again.

00:06:52.567 --> 00:06:53.801
It's been a pleasure
working with you.

00:06:53.801 --> 00:06:55.300
