00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let me close this section with my favorite story on bug reproduction.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
In 2002, I went to a conference to give a laptop demonstration of a complex software system.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Before I left, we had taken every precaution

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
so that the software would run perfectly.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But then came the evening before the demonstration.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I would be sitting in my hotel room and try out,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
for the last time, so everything would be working fine.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Nothing worked. The software would run into timeout errors anytime, everywhere.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I phoned my department at home.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
They had the same software, on the same machine, and everything worked.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I debugged this for 3 hours in a row.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
My battery had even run out of power, so I had to recharge it.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
That's when I decided to restart from scratch.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
To my amazement, the demo now ran just fine.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And so I wondered, why did the program work after restarting from scratch?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Was this because of some caching problem?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Did this have something to do with the battery?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Was this because I reinstalled everything?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Or because of cosmic radiation?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Hint: I gave you an indication right within the story.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Over to you.
