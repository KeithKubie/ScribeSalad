00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.170
I was sent some problems by
one of the viewers out there.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.760
I believe his name is Cortagio
or Cortajio, I apologize.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.260
I'm sure I'm mispronouncing it.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.570
But they are really
interesting problems.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.390
What's interesting about them
is that they don't involve

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.300
super-fancy mathematics.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.000
They just involve an elegant
way to apply fairly

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.970
simple mathematics.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.950
So, without me talking too much
about the problems, let's

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.140
try to solve one of them.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.740
Actually, I don't know where
I'm going to categorize this.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.770
Either in algebra or in the
brain-teaser playlist,

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:32.770
or maybe both.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.950
So, an officer on horseback
starts at the back of a column

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.140
of marching soldiers and rides
to the front of the column.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.160
Then turns around and rides
to the rear of the column.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.280
If the rider travels three
times as fast as the column

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.310
moves, and the column is 100
meters long -- OK, I think we

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.160
have enough information
to start drawing this.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.090
Let me draw the
column of soldiers.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.450
I'll just draw this
as a big fat line.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.630
So, that's the
column of soldiers.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.310
I'm about to cough.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.480
Excuse me.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.000
I've learned not to cough
directly in the microphone.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.120
Don't want blow
your speakers out.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.630
So that's the column of
soldiers right there.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.920
And the problem tells us
that it's 100 meters long.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.370
So this distance right
here is 100 meters.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.420
And it's moving with
some velocity.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.640
Let's say, to the right.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.990
So I'm going to just call
it, it's moving with

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.570
some velocity, v.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.090
We'll have to stay abstract
there because it doesn't

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.280
tell us the velocity.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.380
And then we have the officer.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.740
I wanted to make sure I was
giving the correct title.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.250
So, an officer on horseback
stars at the back of a column.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.110
So he starts here.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.060
He's on his horse.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.660
He's on his horse.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.875
That's my rendition of the
horse for these purposes, it

00:01:51.875 --> 00:01:54.800
has an officer on on the back.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.170
And he is going to, while the
whole column is going forward

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.150
with the velocity, v, he's
going to go to the front of it.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.210
Obviously he can go faster
because he's on a horse.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.640
And then he's going to go to
the back and they want to

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.750
know how far did this
whole column move.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.950
And how fast is he going?

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.990
Let's see, if the rider travels
3 times as fast as the column,

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.290
if the column is this traveling
with the velocity v, he's going

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.720
to be traveling with
the velocity of 3v.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.110
So let's think
about two things.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.200
Let's think about the time it
takes him to go to the front

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.270
of the column, and the
time it takes to go back.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.603
So let's say t1 is equal
to time to front.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.610
And then t2 would
be time to back.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.840
There might be other ways to
solve this, but this is the

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.790
way that's jumping
out into my brain.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.560
So let's figure out what
the time to the front

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.040
of the column is.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.030
So, over some period of time
-- so, how far is the column

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.170
going to move over to t1?

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.380
The column is going to move,
well, actually, let me write

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.510
a little formula here.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.420
Although I'm sure you
know this formula.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.330
Distance is equal to
rate times time.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.080
Right?

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.360
So, over time 1, how far
does the column move?

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.460
It's going to move v.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.100
v times time 1.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.920
And how far is this
guy going to move?

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.740
Well, we're saying over
time, when he moves to

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:24.840
the front of the column.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.645
So, this whole column is
moving to the right.

00:03:26.645 --> 00:03:28.470
And at the same time,
this guy's moving to

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.300
the right faster.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.720
So at the end of time 1, which
I've defined as the time

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.020
it takes him to get to the
front, what's true about the

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.330
officer on the horseback?

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.120
He will have had to travel
100 meters further than

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.950
the column, right?

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.380
In order to catch up to the
front of the column, he would

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.800
have had to go 100 meters
further than the column.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:53.520
So, the distance that the
column travels, plus 100 meters

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.040
is going to be the distance
that the officer travels in

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.130
the same amount of time.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.580
And what's the distance
that he travels in that

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.620
same amount of time?

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.520
Well, distance is equal to
rate, 3v, times time, t1.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.320
Time to the front.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.970
So this is a relationship
between velocity and

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.300
the time to the front.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.900
And let's see if we can
simplify this a little bit.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:22.070
So, if we track v t1 from both
sides, we get 100 is equal to

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:28.030
3v t1 minus v t1, that's 2v t1,
and divide both sides

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.400
by 2, you get 50.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.630
v t1 is equal to 50.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.120
The velocity of this column of
soldiers times the time it

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.760
takes this officer to get to
the front is equal to 50.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.000
Well, that doesn't
solve our problem yet.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.060
We want to know how far
does the column move?

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.730
We have two variables
with one equation.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.110
Not helpful yet.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.110
Let's see if t2 can
help us a little bit?

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.630
All right.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.040
I'll switch colors to
ease the monotony.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.210
Time to back.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.420
So, now we're in the opposite
situation, where the

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.030
guy's gotten here.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.070
He turns around.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.640
I'd argue, immediately.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.300
He turns around immediately.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.440
And he goes back.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.830
With the velocity of 3v.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.800
So, my question to you as he
starts out here, and relative

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.550
to him, he's going this
direction at a velocity of 3v.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.990
And the back of the column
is moving towards him with

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.330
the velocity of v, right?

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.720
So if you think about it, the
back of the column is going to

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.050
be approaching the rider
with the velocity of 4v.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.140
When you have two velocities
that are moving in opposite

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:39.540
directions -- if I move in this
direction, at 60 miles per

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.290
hour, and you're moving in that
direction at 60 miles per hour.

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.790
Relative to me, if I assume
that I'm stationary, you would

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.610
look like you're coming at
me at 120 miles per hour.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.310
So that same idea -- this
officer is going to be

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.020
approaching the end of the
column, the back of the column,

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.700
with the velocity of 4v.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.420
So how long does it take
them to get to the back?

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.950
Well, let's see.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.040
His velocity is 4v.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.110
I'll do that in green.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.070
So his velocity is 4v.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.870
That's how fast he's
approaching the back

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.000
of the column.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.250
And it's going to take him
time 2, times time 2.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.250
And his distance, he's going to
travel 100 meters, because

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.720
that's the length
of the column.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.110
Is equal to 100.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.310
And let's see, if we divide
both sides of this by 4,

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.520
we got velocity times
time 2 is equal to 25.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.630
And, once again, we have 1
equation with two unknowns.

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:33.000
It doesn't help a lot.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.210
Let's review the problem again
to see if somehow we can use

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.050
this information and this
information to solve what

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.600
they're asking for.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:49.110
So, they want to know how far
does the column move by the

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:54.130
time the officer arrives back
at the rear of the column.

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:58.470
So, they want to know how far
did this whole thing move over

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.320
the entire time of this
problem happening?

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.080
What was the entire time?

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.910
It was t1 plus t2.

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:06.040
That's the entire time. t1 to
go to the front, and then

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.120
t2 to go back to the back.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.040
So how far did the column move?

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.050
Well, the column, distance is
equal to rate times time.

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:16.260
So the column will move its
distance -- is equal to the

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.330
column's rate, velocity.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.770
And then what's the time
that this whole little

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:22.440
problem occurs on?

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.440
Well t1 is how long it
takes the officer to

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.680
get to the front.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.330
Plus t2.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.270
So this is what
we're solving for.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.260
This is what we need to know.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.360
We need to know the distance
traveled by the column.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.790
And, once again, we have
all these variables.

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.160
But maybe we can do
something interesting.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:40.890
Let's look at this.

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.260
So what is -- so if we just
distribute this, we have

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:49.130
distance is equal to v
times t1 plus v times t2.

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:50.900
And do we know what
these things are?

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:51.490
Well, sure.

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:55.760
We were able to kind of stumble
our way into into what

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.510
these values are.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:57.990
And that's what's interesting
about this problem.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:59.150
We never figured out v.

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:00.680
We never figured out t1 or t2.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.980
But we can figure out
this whole thing.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:06.590
Because v times t1 --
they tell us, is 50.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:08.920
So we can substitute
it back here.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.660
So the distance is equal to 50.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.280
Plus, what's v times t2?

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.460
Well, we solved it here when we
figured out how long it would

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.050
take to go back to the
front of the column.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.960
So that's 25.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.440
So that, we'll put over here.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.370
So the total distance that the
column traveled is 50 plus

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:29.380
25 meters, or 75 meters.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:32.040
And this is a neat problem,
because they didn't tell us

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.610
how fast the column
is actually going.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:34.720
They're just saying it's v.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.880
They just said that the
officer is going 3 times

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.320
as fast, but we don't
know absolute velocities.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.330
But we were still able to
figure out, even without even

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:45.440
knowing the absolute times, we
were still able to figure out

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.590
the total distance that
the column travelled.

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:49.080
Anyway, I hope you
enjoyed that.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.840
And if you did, you can thank
Cortagio for the problem.
