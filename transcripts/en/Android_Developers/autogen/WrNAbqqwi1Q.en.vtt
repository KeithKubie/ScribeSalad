talk to you today is about how to make
 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.890
talk to you today is about how to make
the research you're doing impactful and

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900
the research you're doing impactful and
 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.749
the research you're doing impactful and
the real key to doing impactful research

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759
the real key to doing impactful research
 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.390
the real key to doing impactful research
is not some silver bullet method it's

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400
is not some silver bullet method it's
 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.219
is not some silver bullet method it's
not some fancy piece of kit it's not

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229
not some fancy piece of kit it's not
 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.380
not some fancy piece of kit it's not
necessarily some really complex process

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390
necessarily some really complex process
 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.719
necessarily some really complex process
the real key to doing impactful research

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729
the real key to doing impactful research
 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.969
the real key to doing impactful research
is making sure you get the most out of

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979
is making sure you get the most out of
 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.950
is making sure you get the most out of
the research you do and making sure that

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960
the research you do and making sure that
 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.620
the research you do and making sure that
that research case you used in some way

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630
that research case you used in some way
 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.910
that research case you used in some way
so this talk is really just about some

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920
so this talk is really just about some
 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.469
so this talk is really just about some
insanely practical methods and

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479
insanely practical methods and
 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.120
insanely practical methods and
techniques that will help you go away

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130
techniques that will help you go away
 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.039
techniques that will help you go away
and do better use of research and your

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049
and do better use of research and your
 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.330

right everything else gets easier okay
 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.200
right everything else gets easier okay
so how do you do impactful research what

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210
so how do you do impactful research what
 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.420
so how do you do impactful research what
is that so I'm going to share with you

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430
is that so I'm going to share with you
 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.160
is that so I'm going to share with you
today three mistakes that we can of

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170
today three mistakes that we can of
 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.569
today three mistakes that we can of
commonly see people make when

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579
commonly see people make when
 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.420
commonly see people make when
approaching doing user research and

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430
approaching doing user research and
 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.620
approaching doing user research and
three methods and techniques from my

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630
three methods and techniques from my
 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.089
three methods and techniques from my
experience as a research or in the

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099
experience as a research or in the
 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.680
experience as a research or in the
Google Play team to help you mitigate

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690
Google Play team to help you mitigate
 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.869
Google Play team to help you mitigate
that risk and to make the research you

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879
that risk and to make the research you
 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:12.760
that risk and to make the research you
do more impactful

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770
do more impactful
 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.580
do more impactful
so the mistakes using the wrong methods

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590
so the mistakes using the wrong methods
 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.410
so the mistakes using the wrong methods
at the wrong time separating the

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420
at the wrong time separating the
 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.850
at the wrong time separating the
research from the rest of this team and

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860
research from the rest of this team and
 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.700
research from the rest of this team and
asking the wrong questions have fairly

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710
asking the wrong questions have fairly
 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.460
asking the wrong questions have fairly
straightforward fixes but fixing them

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470
straightforward fixes but fixing them
 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.230
straightforward fixes but fixing them
will help you maximize the value of the

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240
will help you maximize the value of the
 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.600
will help you maximize the value of the
research you do and make the most of the

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610
research you do and make the most of the
 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.490
research you do and make the most of the
data you collect in order to make better

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500
data you collect in order to make better
 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.950
data you collect in order to make better
decisions okay so mistake number one

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960
decisions okay so mistake number one
 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.820
decisions okay so mistake number one
using the wrong methods at the wrong

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830
using the wrong methods at the wrong
 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.400
using the wrong methods at the wrong
time so research is really just about

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410
time so research is really just about
 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.680
time so research is really just about
asking good questions and depending on

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690
asking good questions and depending on
 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:42.880
asking good questions and depending on
where you are in the product lifecycle

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890
where you are in the product lifecycle
 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.740
where you are in the product lifecycle
you probably have different questions

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750
you probably have different questions
 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.720
you probably have different questions
that need answered we can a makes sense

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730
that need answered we can a makes sense
 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.070
that need answered we can a makes sense
right so as your product or feature

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080
right so as your product or feature
 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.170
right so as your product or feature
evolve so do the cane of questions you

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180
evolve so do the cane of questions you
 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.750
evolve so do the cane of questions you
need to ask but one mistake we commonly

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760
need to ask but one mistake we commonly
 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.760
need to ask but one mistake we commonly
see is people trying to ask either the

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770
see is people trying to ask either the
 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.530
see is people trying to ask either the
same questions again and again as their

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540
same questions again and again as their
 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.050
same questions again and again as their
product evolved or trying to answer

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060
product evolved or trying to answer
 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.430
product evolved or trying to answer
different questions with the same

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440
different questions with the same
 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.100
different questions with the same
methods that really don't fit so doing

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110
methods that really don't fit so doing
 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.570
methods that really don't fit so doing
impactful research is not just about

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580
impactful research is not just about
 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.790
impactful research is not just about
using impactful methods it's really

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800
using impactful methods it's really
 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.320
using impactful methods it's really
about picking the right methods for the

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330
about picking the right methods for the
 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.180
about picking the right methods for the
questions you have and asking the right

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190
questions you have and asking the right
 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.540
questions you have and asking the right
questions at the right time so on my

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550
questions at the right time so on my
 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:14.920
questions at the right time so on my
team when we think about doing user

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930
team when we think about doing user
 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.480
team when we think about doing user
research we start by thinking we're

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490
research we start by thinking we're
 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.010
research we start by thinking we're
about in the development process we are

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020
about in the development process we are
 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.080
about in the development process we are
and typically at a high level there's

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090
and typically at a high level there's
 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.820
and typically at a high level there's
only really three questions that we need

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830
only really three questions that we need
 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.220
only really three questions that we need
to answer the first one is what to build

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230
to answer the first one is what to build
 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.440
to answer the first one is what to build
hmm the second one is how to build it

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450
hmm the second one is how to build it
 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.590
hmm the second one is how to build it
and the third one is did we succeed and

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600
and the third one is did we succeed and
 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.270
and the third one is did we succeed and
we call this strategic user research

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280
we call this strategic user research
 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.240
we call this strategic user research
design user research and the value to

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250
design user research and the value to
 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.090
design user research and the value to
user research so each of these questions

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100
user research so each of these questions
 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.010
user research so each of these questions
has many many many different methods you

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020
has many many many different methods you
 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.050
has many many many different methods you
can use and picking the right method is

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060
can use and picking the right method is
 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.180
can use and picking the right method is
going to help you maximize how useful

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190
going to help you maximize how useful
 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.220
going to help you maximize how useful
that answer is to you

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230
that answer is to you
 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.600
that answer is to you
there's robably too many methods to each

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610
there's robably too many methods to each
 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.220
there's robably too many methods to each
days that I can cover in this talk but

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230
days that I can cover in this talk but
 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.720
days that I can cover in this talk but
let me walk you through some of this

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730
let me walk you through some of this
 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:53.950
let me walk you through some of this
stuff that we do on Google Play

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:53.960
stuff that we do on Google Play
 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.900
stuff that we do on Google Play
highlighting the kind of research we do

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910
highlighting the kind of research we do
 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.200
highlighting the kind of research we do
at each stage okay so the first question

00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.210
at each stage okay so the first question
 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.150
at each stage okay so the first question
we do or the first question we ask is

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160
we do or the first question we ask is
 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.760
we do or the first question we ask is
what to build this is kind of strategic

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770
what to build this is kind of strategic
 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.680
what to build this is kind of strategic
user research really the goal here is to

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690
user research really the goal here is to
 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.510
user research really the goal here is to
help inform the product direction and

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520
help inform the product direction and
 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.970
help inform the product direction and
uncover new opportunities so what kind

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980
uncover new opportunities so what kind
 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.199
uncover new opportunities so what kind
of research can you do at this stage

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209
of research can you do at this stage
 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.270
of research can you do at this stage
what message can you do it to help you

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280
what message can you do it to help you
 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.720
what message can you do it to help you
use this so one of our most powerful

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730
use this so one of our most powerful
 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.880
use this so one of our most powerful
tools for this on both the developer

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890
tools for this on both the developer
 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.039
tools for this on both the developer
side and on the consumer side are what

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049
side and on the consumer side are what
 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.659
side and on the consumer side are what
we call kind of immersion or

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669
we call kind of immersion or
 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.030
we call kind of immersion or
observational studies and this is really

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040
observational studies and this is really
 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.410
observational studies and this is really
just basically watching people

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420
just basically watching people
 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.930

understanding what they're doing and
 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.910
understanding what they're doing and
really asking them why they're doing

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920
really asking them why they're doing
 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.310
really asking them why they're doing
what they're doing already the method is

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320
what they're doing already the method is
 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.720
what they're doing already the method is
really just watching your users and

really just watching your users and
 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.120
really just watching your users and
asking them why at this stage in the

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130
asking them why at this stage in the
 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.800
asking them why at this stage in the
process the goal is to discover things

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810

these kind of studies with developers so
 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.040
these kind of studies with developers so
what is the method here how do you make

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050
what is the method here how do you make
 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.140
what is the method here how do you make
the most of these observational studies

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150
the most of these observational studies
 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.090
the most of these observational studies
it could really be as simple as just

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100
it could really be as simple as just
 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.800

sessions the first one is not to ask

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680
sessions the first one is not to ask
 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.440
sessions the first one is not to ask
leading questions this is something we

these sessions we see them asking
 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.740
these sessions we see them asking
questions for the answer do they want to

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750
questions for the answer do they want to
 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.390
questions for the answer do they want to
hear is kind of embedded in the question

hear is kind of embedded in the question
 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.040
hear is kind of embedded in the question
that they're asking so that's a really

is not really to ask questions it can be

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.980
is not really to ask questions it can be
 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.830
is not really to ask questions it can be
answered with a yes or no answer this is

answered with a yes or no answer this is
 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.090
answered with a yes or no answer this is
something else that we really commonly

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100
something else that we really commonly
 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.970
something else that we really commonly
see like do you want feature a or B yes

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:33.980
see like do you want feature a or B yes
 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.040
see like do you want feature a or B yes
or no this is not great as it really

doesn't get you very rich data you get
 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.000
doesn't get you very rich data you get
one data point if you ask questions that

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010
one data point if you ask questions that
 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.470
one data point if you ask questions that
are more open-ended and encourage your

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:41.480
are more open-ended and encourage your
 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.030
are more open-ended and encourage your
users to talk you'll really get much

users to talk you'll really get much
 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.060
users to talk you'll really get much
richer data out of them the last thing

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070
richer data out of them the last thing
 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.500
richer data out of them the last thing
that we see people do is kind of drawing

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510
that we see people do is kind of drawing
 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.120
that we see people do is kind of drawing
attention to specific things that they

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130
attention to specific things that they
 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.190

it tends to change users behavior when
you're talking to them so don't draw

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500
you're talking to them so don't draw
 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.770
you're talking to them so don't draw
attention to things like features or

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780
attention to things like features or
 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.510

particular interface elements that you

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520
particular interface elements that you
 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.280
particular interface elements that you
do that you cannot want to know about

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:00.290

bunch of different research methods you

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:03.980
bunch of different research methods you
 

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:05.829
bunch of different research methods you
can use each stage in this process and

00:09:05.829 --> 00:09:05.839
can use each stage in this process and
 

00:09:05.839 --> 00:09:08.019
can use each stage in this process and
as I said before each method has or each

00:09:08.019 --> 00:09:08.029
as I said before each method has or each
 

00:09:08.029 --> 00:09:09.579
as I said before each method has or each
question has many different methods that

00:09:09.579 --> 00:09:09.589
question has many different methods that
 

00:09:09.589 --> 00:09:11.530
question has many different methods that
you can use much more than I have a

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:11.540
you can use much more than I have a
 

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:12.850

hopefully we can kind of give you a
 

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.060
hopefully we can kind of give you a
flavor of how you can use different

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:16.070
flavor of how you can use different
 

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:18.850
flavor of how you can use different
research methods at each stage but the

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:18.860
research methods at each stage but the
 

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:20.860
research methods at each stage but the
key here is that picking the right

point in asking questions that you don't
 

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:29.840
point in asking questions that you don't
necessarily need the answer to and
