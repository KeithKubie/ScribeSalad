Hey, what's up guys?
I am Grant Thompson - "The King of Random"

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.900
Hey man I am Brian Brushwood from the Modern Rogue.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.340
And internet we are presenting a new challenge to you today -

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.100
Can you make butter faster than you can make toast?

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.720
Yeah have you heard of the cinnamon challenge, the ice bucket challenge?

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.800
Nothing compared to this: Making butter faster than making toast, that's not possible!

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.620
This is a new challenge

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.900
We haven't even tried ourselves, so we went down to the store.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.040
We got some heavy whipping cream.
Come check this out this cream has not been opened yet. You can see me pull the seal

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.520
The only thing that we've done different with this cream is we've let it sit out for about uh

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.080
Three hours. Now how long does it take to make toast a couple of minutes? Yeah, give or take. So

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.740
ideally we should be able to make butter within 20 to 40 seconds, okay, all right

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.889
So we need something to pour the water into as well right
Right, so we're gonna dump out our water

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.770
I got a little container over here that we can dump our water into

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.319
Okay, all right. Pieces a toast, so this is the idea we're using water bottles today

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.009
And this is a shout-out to my friend Dan Rojas from the channel Green Power Science

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.260
His theory was that some of the ribbing on the sides of the water bottle would help assist in the churning of the butter

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.769
So our goal is to make this as quickly as possible. We're using water bottles

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.259
There's a good chance you have water bottles at home today as well

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.440
So these are the rules: You put in your piece of toast and as soon as you press play

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.240
We're going to pour in the cream

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.820
Put on the lids and shake this thing and see if we can turn butter and get it ready before the toast pops up

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.420
Okay, we're not actually sure if this is gonna work or not, but we're gonna do it here live for you first try

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.320
Uncut no jump cuts. Here we go here

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.480
We go. All right so I even got a stopwatch over here on my phone. Alright give it a start

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:37.680
Callahan so we're Gonna go in three two one begin start the toast they got how much- how full do I go let's go

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.939
That's good enough right there, [okay], and go ahead you put your lid on okay, whoa?

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.309
Yup here we go and shake shake shake shake shake. We're gonna make a mess cause this is spilled everywhere

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.740
Look at that. That's creamy. [all] right, [shoot] this sucks. [I] need a cloth

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.600
*I need a new cloth!*

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.380
Haha, mommy. I made a mess. What should I be feeling as I'm doing okay? So it starts off as a liquid and

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.489
Then after hopefully a few seconds. It's gonna turn into whipped cream

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.389
Nobody close your eyes while we are doing this.
Oh man!

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.430
It should go into whipped cream [its]

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.500
Mine goes faster than this what kind of cream is this I don't know

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.180
I don't know! I got the heavy whipping cream

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.800
Okay, so actually mine's clumping up already. It's turning into whipping whipped cream, and you want to just go a little bit faster

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.920
Get real close to toasties. [it'll] close to go harder. Go faster

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.299
[I] can feel it you're gonna feel that thing clumping around and then it's gonna break back into a liquid

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.550
Come on

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.520
Oh, no, it's frothy. It's frothy. I got froth keep on

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.280
It's okay. It's like nothing and it goes back to a liquid at some point.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.820
It's so hard right now (get ur mind out of the gutter)

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.940
The toast is coming soon

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.940
It's looking kinda toasty

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:03.460
Okay, mines all clumped. Just feels like it's full. Yeah, it is foamy. You got to break it. Yeah break that food bring it

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.260
Those are the G-forces that make it happen?

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.460
Or the turbulence or what?

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.940
I think so. I don't know what it is

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.240
Teamwork!

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.220
oh

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.640
woo

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.380
It just feels like I'm shaking styrofoam. Yes, it just it's like a full bottle of... whoo

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.820
Maybe we should've dumped us. Yeah

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:35.369
Yeah, maybe we did too much, so it doesn't start to it start to feel like that only quitting see look at this

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.270
It's actually

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.040
Kind of looks like butter. (XD) Oh you have it. I wonder if it was too warm

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.099
Is that is that bad? What temperature? Do you want to do?

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.820
I'm not sure

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:54.640
So I mean like we were talking [about] it being room temperature. We made sure to set the upstairs to 76 degrees

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.180
Supposed to be faster than this stuff. Oh

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.820
Toast is coming soon! Oh, it's starting to toast!

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.480
You wanna make it dark toast?

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.780
Don't know man. I think I got butter, but it's like it's weird. It's like oh look at that!

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.960
My God you have butter you've got butter, but the weird thing is is like. I can't believe it's not butter. Whoah!. it's going everywhere

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.760
We did it! We did it!

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.200
We [made] butter let's spread the butter. Yeah, holy holy crap of that is he well

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.240
Yes

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.160
All right here now if you don't mind me king of random [would] you toast to me?

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:38.349
We'd like to make a toast to all of you out [there]

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:44.499
Hopefully have better success to win tell us how you do with the toasted butter challenge cool hMM

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:49.538
bigger than the Cinnamon challenge [the] ice bucket [challenge]

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.559
It's really interesting about this is like the buttermilk is actually mixed in with the butter

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.560
Oh good wow we made butter faster than we made toast that's actually incredible and then the whole time

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.429
I was thinking it wasn't gonna work because it was all clumped up in there, and it wasn't moving mmM

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.590
Does he taste like whipped cream at all it is butters. Just lighter creamier fluffy. It's almost like Margarine right? Yeah, oh

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:16.240
Amazing so I haven't seen this happen before but instead of separating into butter and cream or buttermilk it actually like

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:22.570
conglomerated into some kind of softer into pure girlishness is what it did we want to see you do this so make a video of

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.029
You shaking cream into butter [mist] your videos on the internet?
