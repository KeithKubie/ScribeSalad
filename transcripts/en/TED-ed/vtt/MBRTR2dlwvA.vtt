00:00:14.157 --> 00:00:17.875
I'm going to try to shine
a historical light on our language,

00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:21.649
and tell you a story
about the electric vocabulary.

00:00:22.728 --> 00:00:26.591
It all begins over 2,600 years ago.

00:00:27.298 --> 00:00:30.207
An ancient Greek,
called Thales of Miletus,

00:00:30.231 --> 00:00:32.557
is thought to be
the first person to observe

00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:35.446
what we would today call
electrical phenomena.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.513
He discovered that a piece
of amber, when rubbed with fur,

00:00:38.537 --> 00:00:40.976
could pick up small pieces of straw.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.385
In Thales's language,
amber was called "electron."

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:48.987
For a long time, that was pretty much
all anybody knew about the subject.

00:00:49.011 --> 00:00:52.526
And nature had to wait around 2,200 years

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.316
before any new investigations were made
into amber's properties.

00:00:56.735 --> 00:01:00.159
William Gilbert, a 17th-century
English scientist,

00:01:00.183 --> 00:01:02.648
discovered that with a careful
experimentation,

00:01:02.672 --> 00:01:04.035
a number of other materials

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.015
could display the attractive
properties of amber.

00:01:07.511 --> 00:01:10.735
He also found that they could
attract objects besides straw.

00:01:11.068 --> 00:01:13.636
Gilbert named these amberlike objects

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.225
after the Greek for amber.

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:17.566
He called them "electrics."

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.219
About 40 years later, in nearby Norwich,

00:01:20.243 --> 00:01:22.976
Sir Thomas Browne carried out
similar experiments.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.841
He didn't figure out anything
different from William Gilbert,

00:01:26.865 --> 00:01:29.375
yet the way he described the experiments

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.669
coined the word we use all the time.

00:01:31.693 --> 00:01:35.161
The way he saw it, when you rub,
say, a crystal with a cloth,

00:01:35.185 --> 00:01:37.432
it becomes an electric object.

00:01:37.797 --> 00:01:39.927
And just as we speak of elastic objects,

00:01:39.951 --> 00:01:43.488
and say they possess
the property of elasticity,

00:01:43.512 --> 00:01:47.285
electric objects possess
the property of electricity.

00:01:48.653 --> 00:01:50.896
The 18th-century French
physicist Charles Du Fay

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.791
was the next person
to make an important new discovery.

00:01:54.815 --> 00:01:58.462
He found that almost any object,
except for metals and fluids,

00:01:58.486 --> 00:01:59.949
could be turned electric

00:01:59.973 --> 00:02:03.449
after subjecting them to a combination
of heating and rubbing.

00:02:03.473 --> 00:02:06.906
In addition, he found that when
two electrics are place near each other,

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.351
they sometimes attract,
and sometimes repel.

00:02:09.972 --> 00:02:11.254
With this extra knowledge,

00:02:11.278 --> 00:02:14.976
Du Fay found that there were
two distinct groups of electrics.

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:18.976
Any two objects from the same group
will always repel,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.274
while a pair of one from each group
will always attract.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.755
Despite these new discoveries,

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:28.657
Du Fay's descriptions of the physics
are all lost to history.

00:02:29.356 --> 00:02:33.563
Instead, it is the vocabulary
of a charismatic young American

00:02:33.587 --> 00:02:36.612
that we still remember
and use to this day.

00:02:37.616 --> 00:02:41.188
Benjamin Franklin heard
of the work going on in Europe,

00:02:41.212 --> 00:02:43.657
and started his own playful experiments.

00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:46.236
He quickly learned
how to make electric devices

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.145
that would De-electrify
by producing very large sparks.

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:52.175
Keen on mischievous pranks,

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:55.145
Franklin would often shock
his friends with these machines.

00:02:55.676 --> 00:02:57.705
As he built more effective devices,

00:02:57.729 --> 00:03:01.711
he likened the act of electrifying
and De-electrifying

00:03:01.735 --> 00:03:04.634
to charging and discharging weaponry.

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:08.556
It didn't take long for Franklin
and others to realize

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.314
that it was possible to link
these weapons of mischief together.

00:03:12.973 --> 00:03:15.331
Franklin, continuing with the metaphor,

00:03:15.355 --> 00:03:18.770
likened this grouping
to cannons on a ship.

00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:21.415
The gun deck on a military vessel

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:25.168
fired their cannons
simultaneously, in a battery.

00:03:25.192 --> 00:03:27.692
Similarly, this electric battery,

00:03:27.716 --> 00:03:30.175
would discharge all at the same time,

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:32.232
causing large sparks.

00:03:32.256 --> 00:03:35.346
This new technology
raised an interesting question:

00:03:35.806 --> 00:03:39.175
Was a lightning cloud
just a large electrical battery?

00:03:39.874 --> 00:03:42.661
Franklin's description
of all this was as follows:

00:03:43.098 --> 00:03:44.976
he supposed that there is a substance

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.391
he called the electrical fluid,
that is common to all things.

00:03:49.415 --> 00:03:52.012
If, say, a person rubs a glass tube,

00:03:52.036 --> 00:03:55.427
this rubbing, or charging,
causes a flow of this fluid,

00:03:55.451 --> 00:03:59.719
or an electrical current,
to move from the person to the glass.

00:04:00.163 --> 00:04:03.724
Both the person and the tube
become electrics as a result.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.818
Normally, if the person
was standing on the ground,

00:04:06.842 --> 00:04:09.229
their electrical fluid
would return to normal,

00:04:09.253 --> 00:04:12.976
with an exchange from the common
stock of the Earth,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.180
as Franklin called it.

00:04:14.585 --> 00:04:18.470
Standing on something like a wax block
can cut off this supply.

00:04:19.088 --> 00:04:22.706
Franklin said that an object
with an excess of this fluid

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.924
was positively charged,

00:04:24.948 --> 00:04:28.496
and something lacking this fluid
was negatively charged.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.974
When objects touch,
or are near each other,

00:04:30.998 --> 00:04:33.263
the electrical fluid can flow between them

00:04:33.287 --> 00:04:34.975
until they reach a balance.

00:04:35.366 --> 00:04:38.627
The bigger the difference in the fluid
between the two objects,

00:04:38.651 --> 00:04:40.885
the larger the distance
the fluid can jump,

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:42.284
causing sparks in the air.

00:04:42.728 --> 00:04:45.397
And, it is the material of the object

00:04:45.421 --> 00:04:48.872
that determines if it gains
or loses electrical fluid

00:04:48.896 --> 00:04:50.375
during charging.

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:52.975
These are Du Fay's two
groups of electrics.

00:04:53.466 --> 00:04:54.997
You might have heard the phrase:

00:04:55.021 --> 00:04:58.522
"Opposite charges attract,
like charges repel."

00:04:58.546 --> 00:04:59.696
That's why.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.437
For the next 150 years,

00:05:02.461 --> 00:05:04.879
Franklin's theory was used to develop

00:05:04.903 --> 00:05:07.110
many more ideas and discoveries,

00:05:07.134 --> 00:05:09.499
all using the vocabulary he invented.

00:05:10.197 --> 00:05:14.321
This scientific inquiry
brought forth technological advances

00:05:14.345 --> 00:05:17.792
and eventually, scientists were able
to take a closer look

00:05:17.816 --> 00:05:19.976
at the electric fluid itself.

00:05:20.532 --> 00:05:25.104
In 1897, J.J. Thomson,
working in Cambridge, England,

00:05:25.128 --> 00:05:29.976
discovered that the electrical fluid
is actually made up of small particles

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.976
named by the physicist
George Stoney as "electrons."

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.277
And so we return to the ancient
Greek word for amber,

00:05:37.301 --> 00:05:38.662
where our story began.

00:05:39.358 --> 00:05:42.051
However, there's an epilogue to this tale.

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:45.074
It was discovered
that these electrons flow

00:05:45.098 --> 00:05:48.055
in the opposite direction
to what Franklin supposed.

00:05:48.523 --> 00:05:51.576
Therefore, objects
that are positively charged

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.252
don't have an excess of electrical fluid,

00:05:54.276 --> 00:05:56.995
they actually lack electrons.

00:05:57.368 --> 00:06:00.932
Yet, instead of relabeling
everything the other way around,

00:06:00.956 --> 00:06:04.274
people have decided
to hold on to Franklin's vocabulary

00:06:04.298 --> 00:06:06.414
as a matter of habit and convention.

00:06:06.898 --> 00:06:09.448
While acknowledging
the discovery of electrons,

00:06:09.472 --> 00:06:12.521
they kept Franklin's flow
of electrical fluid,

00:06:12.545 --> 00:06:14.976
renaming it: conventional current.

00:06:15.447 --> 00:06:19.083
The electron has become
the salmon of electricity,

00:06:19.107 --> 00:06:24.107
swimming upstream in a ghostly river
of conventional current.

00:06:24.567 --> 00:06:28.084
This can be, understandably,
confusing for many people

00:06:28.108 --> 00:06:30.579
who aren't familiar
with the history of these ideas.

00:06:31.108 --> 00:06:32.672
And so I hope,

00:06:32.696 --> 00:06:35.722
with this short story
about the electric vocabulary,

00:06:35.746 --> 00:06:36.983
you will be able to see

00:06:37.007 --> 00:06:39.999
through the accident
and whimsy of this subject

00:06:40.023 --> 00:06:42.167
and can gain a clearer understanding

00:06:42.191 --> 00:06:45.178
of the physics of electrical phenomena.
