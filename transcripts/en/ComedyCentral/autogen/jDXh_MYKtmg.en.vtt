00:00:02.069 --> 00:00:04.271
WHAT'S HAPPENING OVER HERE?
- PBBT. NOTHING, MAN.

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:06.139
WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO FUNCTION.

00:00:06.173 --> 00:00:07.674
- WHOSE WEED IS THAT?

00:00:07.708 --> 00:00:10.978
- OHHH, THAT'S...

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:12.713
WE GOT--THAT'S YOUR WEED.

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:15.015
WE ONLY BUY WEED
FROM YOU, BABY.

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:17.351
- YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW
WHAT MY WEED LOOKS LIKE, MAN?

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:18.652
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:20.954
- UM...
- KARL...

00:00:20.988 --> 00:00:23.423
WE HAVE NEEDS, RIGHT?

00:00:23.457 --> 00:00:26.093
AND YOU, FRANKLY,
WERE NOT MEETING THOSE NEEDS.

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:27.895
- SO YOU WENT TO A STRANGER
FOR YOUR WEED?

00:00:27.928 --> 00:00:31.465
- NO, WE WENT TO A STRANGER
FOR GRASS.

00:00:31.498 --> 00:00:32.799
WE'RE CALLING IT GRASS NOW.

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:34.902
- GRASS? WHAT THE HECK
ARE YOU TALK--

00:00:34.935 --> 00:00:36.603
WHAT--WHAT IS HE EVEN
TALKING ABOUT?

00:00:36.637 --> 00:00:37.838
- IT WAS JUST ONCE, KARL.

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:40.674
[sad piano music]

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:42.042
IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.711
- WERE THEY...

00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:46.813
BETTER THAN ME?

00:00:46.847 --> 00:00:49.550
- NOT BETTER.

00:00:49.583 --> 00:00:51.618
JUST DIFFERENT.

00:00:51.652 --> 00:00:53.220
- NO.

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:55.589
SHE'S BETTER.
SHE'S WAY BETTER.

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:58.192
YOU KNOW WHY? 'CAUSE SHE OPENED
MY EYES TO A WORLD OF WEED

00:00:58.225 --> 00:00:59.693
THAT I NEVER EVEN KNEW ABOUT

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:01.929
WITH GADGETS AND GIZMOS
AND EDIBLES.

00:01:01.962 --> 00:01:03.197
- EDIBLES?
- YEAH.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.765
- WHAT'S THAT?

00:01:04.798 --> 00:01:07.067
- DON'T PLAY DUMB.
IT MEANS, LIKE, POT BROWNIES.

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:09.136
- POT BROWNIES? NO, BROWNIES
ARE MADE OUT OF FUDGE, BLAKE.

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:10.771
COME ON.
YOU KNOW THAT.

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:13.073
- WELL, MAYBE THAT'S PART
OF THE PROBLEM, KARL.

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:15.676
YOU EVER THINK
OF THAT, MAN?

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:17.077
- YOU GUYS ARE ACTING CRAZY
RIGHT NOW.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.912
YOU'RE ALL ACTING INSANE.

00:01:18.946 --> 00:01:20.547
YOU'RE--YOU'RE SMOKING BROWNIES,
AND YOU'RE EATING WEED?

00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:22.216
- IT'S CALLED GRASS NOW!

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:23.383
- OH, YOU WANNA YELL?
<i>LET'S YELL!</i>

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:25.252
- DON'T DO THIS, KARL!

00:01:25.285 --> 00:01:29.189
- YOU DID THIS!
NOT ME!

00:01:29.223 --> 00:01:31.558
AND WHAT'S FUNNY IS I EVEN FOUND
YOU DUDES A PRESENT,

00:01:31.592 --> 00:01:32.960
BECAUSE I WAS THINKING
ABOUT YOU DUDES.

00:01:32.993 --> 00:01:35.495
<i>JOE DIRT,</i> MAN.
IN THE DIRT.

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:37.998
FREAKIN' SEE YA.

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:39.366
I HOPE SHE WAS WORTH IT.

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.301
BECAUSE YOU THREW AWAY
SOMETHING SPECIAL.

00:01:41.335 --> 00:01:43.403
I THOUGHT WE WERE BRAJES.
[phone vibrating]

00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:44.671
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

00:01:44.705 --> 00:01:46.573
I NEED TO TRY AND TAKE
THIS PHONE CALL.

00:01:46.607 --> 00:01:49.209
[dog grunting,
phone vibrating]

00:01:49.243 --> 00:01:52.012
HELLO?
HELLO?

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:54.648
- HAPPENS WHEN YOU GIVE
AN ANIMAL AN ANIMAL.

00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:56.717
GUYS, I KNOW THIS HURTS
RIGHT NOW,

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.918
BUT IT'S FOR THE BEST.

00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:59.820
- MOMMY, IF YOU CAN HEAR ME,
