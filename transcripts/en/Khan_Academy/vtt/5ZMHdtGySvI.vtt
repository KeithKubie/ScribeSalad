00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.730
- [Voiceover] So we have blank
plus 261 is equal to 630,

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:04.970
and I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.326
and see if you can
figure out what blank is.

00:00:07.326 --> 00:00:09.550
So there's a couple of
ways to tackle this.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.115
Let's visualize it on a number line.

00:00:12.115 --> 00:00:15.283
So that's my number line right over there.

00:00:15.283 --> 00:00:17.540
And we could start at blank,

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.400
or I'll call that question mark.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.550
So we could start at question mark,

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.390
and if we add 261 to it,

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.249
so if we add 261,

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:28.980
plus 261,

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.371
we can get to 630.

00:00:31.371 --> 00:00:34.920
We can get to 630.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.020
That's the 630 right over there,

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.550
which means that if we started at 630,

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.240
if we start at 630,

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.880
and we were to subtract 261,

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.190
if we were to go the other way,

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.898
if we were to subtract
261, so let's do that.

00:00:50.898 --> 00:00:53.540
So, minus 261.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.550
Minus 261.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.620
We're gonna get back to blank.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.533
We're gonna get back to our question mark.

00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:04.270
Now there's a bunch of ways
that you can compute this,

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:05.960
but I'm gonna try to tackle it in a way

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.010
that I would actually
try to do it in my head,

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.020
or it'll simply my computation,
it's just one of many ways

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.501
to figure this out.

00:01:12.501 --> 00:01:16.741
So the way I would do it is
I would first subtract 200,

00:01:16.741 --> 00:01:18.840
so I would first subtract 200.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.343
So that's about, I'm not
drawing it perfectly to scale.

00:01:23.343 --> 00:01:25.000
So I would subtract 200,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.470
so that's minus 200 right over there,

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.650
which would get me to 430.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:30.850
I could do that in my head.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.725
I just subtracted two hundreds from that.

00:01:33.725 --> 00:01:36.969
And let's see, now I wanna subtract 60.

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:40.196
So then I would subtract 60.

00:01:40.196 --> 00:01:42.452
So minus 60.

00:01:42.452 --> 00:01:44.580
Let's see, 430 minus 60.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.709
That's 43 10s minus six 10s.

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:52.470
Well, that's gonna be 37 10s, or 370.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.095
This gets us to 370.

00:01:55.095 --> 00:01:56.640
And then we going to subtract one more.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.440
We have to subtract 260
and then we subtract one.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.710
So 370 minus one

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.700
is 369.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.830
So this right over here is 360,

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.493
369.

00:02:13.493 --> 00:02:15.190
Now, another way we could have done it

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.420
is we could have swapped the order.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.925
We could have said if
blank plus 261 is 630,

00:02:19.925 --> 00:02:24.260
we could have said 261

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.340
plus blank is equal to 630.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.470
All I did is I swapped the order here,

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.890
but we could visualize
that as a different thing

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:37.988
on the number line.

00:02:37.988 --> 00:02:40.950
So I'm going to, let me
draw my number line again.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.714
So there's my number line.

00:02:45.714 --> 00:02:48.540
And I could start at 261.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.860
So this time I'm starting at 261.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.550
261.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.942
And I wanna get to 630.

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:58.220
And I wanna get to 630,

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.440
and the amount that I add
is going to be the blank.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.133
So let's see what I have
to add to get to 630.

00:03:05.133 --> 00:03:07.870
And I'm gonna add numbers that
are easy for me to compute.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.110
So I could add nine, I could add nine.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.640
Now, why did I add nine?

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.330
Because that gets me to 270,

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.570
which is a nice, round number.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.700
And then I could add,
let's see, I could 30 here

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.709
to get to 300, so let me do that.

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:21.960
So plus 30.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.790
I'm not doing this quite to scale,

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.355
but this is going to get me to 300.

00:03:26.355 --> 00:03:28.890
And then from 300 to 630,

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.190
well I could just add 330.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.540
I could just add 330 there.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.000
So how much did I add in total?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.800
This is 39 plus 330.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.130
That's 369.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.310
I added 369.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.250
So these are all ways of
getting to the same value,

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.900
all ways of viewing the same problem.
