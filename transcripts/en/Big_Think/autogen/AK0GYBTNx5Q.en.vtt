well biases are one of the most

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399
well biases are one of the most
 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.950
well biases are one of the most
interesting phenomena in evolution and I

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960
interesting phenomena in evolution and I
 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.390
interesting phenomena in evolution and I
would go as far as saying there's

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400
would go as far as saying there's
 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.980
would go as far as saying there's
nothing that's not a bias

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990
nothing that's not a bias
 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.320
nothing that's not a bias
I mean we're biased to live in a certain

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330
I mean we're biased to live in a certain
 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.440
I mean we're biased to live in a certain
temperature range and we prefer sweet

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450
temperature range and we prefer sweet
 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.150
temperature range and we prefer sweet
food to a over a bit of food so biases

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160
food to a over a bit of food so biases
 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.990
food to a over a bit of food so biases
are essential they really guide us in a

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000
are essential they really guide us in a
 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.570
are essential they really guide us in a
broader sense so that we that we don't

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580
broader sense so that we that we don't
 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.259
broader sense so that we that we don't
hurt ourselves you know a bias towards

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269
hurt ourselves you know a bias towards
 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.089
hurt ourselves you know a bias towards
feeling solid ground rather than

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099
feeling solid ground rather than
 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.420
feeling solid ground rather than
wobbling ground the interesting thing is

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430
wobbling ground the interesting thing is
 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.420
wobbling ground the interesting thing is
really not to try to do away with these

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430
really not to try to do away with these
 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.900
really not to try to do away with these
biases but to really recognize them and

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910
biases but to really recognize them and
 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.010
biases but to really recognize them and
not to see them as something negative

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020
not to see them as something negative
 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.720
not to see them as something negative
and yet to really understand that

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730
and yet to really understand that
 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.680
and yet to really understand that
they're cloud or clear thinking and you

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690
they're cloud or clear thinking and you
 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.000
they're cloud or clear thinking and you
know that goes anywhere from

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010
know that goes anywhere from
 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.970
know that goes anywhere from
self-deception to uniqueness bias that

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980
self-deception to uniqueness bias that
 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.729
self-deception to uniqueness bias that
we think and pay and one of the first

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739
we think and pay and one of the first
 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.150
we think and pay and one of the first
one to think I'm very unique and you

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160
one to think I'm very unique and you
 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.270
one to think I'm very unique and you
know basically the brain evolved for us

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280
know basically the brain evolved for us
 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.550
know basically the brain evolved for us
to make ourselves special to think of us

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560
to make ourselves special to think of us
 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.700
to make ourselves special to think of us
as valuable otherwise we would not be

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710
as valuable otherwise we would not be
 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.850
as valuable otherwise we would not be
able to go through the strains and the

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860
able to go through the strains and the
 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.050
able to go through the strains and the
struggles and difficulties of life so

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060
struggles and difficulties of life so
 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.210
struggles and difficulties of life so
bias is in any case negativity bias

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220
bias is in any case negativity bias
 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.020
bias is in any case negativity bias
positive bias confirmation bias all of

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030
positive bias confirmation bias all of
 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.200
positive bias confirmation bias all of
these are so ingrained in us that we

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210
these are so ingrained in us that we
 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.480
these are so ingrained in us that we
don't even see them they are kind of

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490
don't even see them they are kind of
 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.420
don't even see them they are kind of
transparent for us so the way that I

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430
transparent for us so the way that I
 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.520
transparent for us so the way that I
like to look at it is the more we can

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530
like to look at it is the more we can
 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.359
like to look at it is the more we can
detect them and become aware of it it's

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369
detect them and become aware of it it's
 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.640
detect them and become aware of it it's
it's kind of a hide and seek you know

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650
it's kind of a hide and seek you know
 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.660
it's kind of a hide and seek you know
they come out of left field and the more

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670
they come out of left field and the more
 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.910
they come out of left field and the more
we can become aware of them and discover

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920
we can become aware of them and discover
 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.460
we can become aware of them and discover
them it's actually quite amusing how we

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470
them it's actually quite amusing how we
 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.149
them it's actually quite amusing how we
twist reality in a way that confirms our

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159
twist reality in a way that confirms our
 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.600
twist reality in a way that confirms our
particular view of the world and so I

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610
particular view of the world and so I
 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.330
particular view of the world and so I
don't see them as something that's

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340
don't see them as something that's
 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.380
don't see them as something that's
obstructing a healthy good positive life

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390
obstructing a healthy good positive life
 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.139
obstructing a healthy good positive life
but it narrows the window and the more

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149
but it narrows the window and the more
 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.179
but it narrows the window and the more
we become aware of

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189
we become aware of
 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.669
we become aware of
the broader we can approach and the

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679
the broader we can approach and the
 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.380
the broader we can approach and the
closer we can get to reality

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390
closer we can get to reality
 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.010
closer we can get to reality
well confirmation bias is probably one

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020
well confirmation bias is probably one
 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.930
well confirmation bias is probably one
of the most pronounced biases that we

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940
of the most pronounced biases that we
 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.449
of the most pronounced biases that we
have and anybody who has ever bought a

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459
have and anybody who has ever bought a
 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.580
have and anybody who has ever bought a
car and thought for a while about what

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590
car and thought for a while about what
 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.890
car and thought for a while about what
kind of car they want to buy they

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900
kind of car they want to buy they
 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.290
kind of car they want to buy they
probably noticed suddenly oh yeah

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300
probably noticed suddenly oh yeah
 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.030
probably noticed suddenly oh yeah
there's that car there's that car again

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040
there's that car there's that car again
 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.120
there's that car there's that car again
and suddenly the brain kind of detects

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130
and suddenly the brain kind of detects
 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.040
and suddenly the brain kind of detects
in the environment something that

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050
in the environment something that
 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.170
in the environment something that
confirms like oh yes that's that seems

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180
confirms like oh yes that's that seems
 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.650
confirms like oh yes that's that seems
like a really good car so confirmation

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660
like a really good car so confirmation
 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.860
like a really good car so confirmation
bias is really a way for us to reaffirm

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870
bias is really a way for us to reaffirm
 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.890
bias is really a way for us to reaffirm
our view of the world and to some degree

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900
our view of the world and to some degree
 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.890
our view of the world and to some degree
it's actually essential if we didn't

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900
it's actually essential if we didn't
 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.070
it's actually essential if we didn't
have some kind of confirmation bias we

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080
have some kind of confirmation bias we
 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.330
have some kind of confirmation bias we
would be lost

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340
would be lost
 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.059
would be lost
we could not piece together a world that

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069
we could not piece together a world that
 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.780
we could not piece together a world that
is coherent for us so we have to ignore

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790
is coherent for us so we have to ignore
 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.640
is coherent for us so we have to ignore
certain things and other things become a

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650
certain things and other things become a
 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.970
certain things and other things become a
little louder and confirmation bias is

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980
little louder and confirmation bias is
 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.770
little louder and confirmation bias is
different in different cultures you know

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780
different in different cultures you know
 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.089
different in different cultures you know
for some cultures in a big broad

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099
for some cultures in a big broad
 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.699
for some cultures in a big broad
shouldered person is very attractive and

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709
shouldered person is very attractive and
 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.490
shouldered person is very attractive and
in others it's a very elegant person or

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500
in others it's a very elegant person or
 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.400
in others it's a very elegant person or
a very lively person and you know and I

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410
a very lively person and you know and I
 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.559
a very lively person and you know and I
come from Germany so in Germany the

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569
come from Germany so in Germany the
 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.050
come from Germany so in Germany the
confirmation bias is towards don't make

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060
confirmation bias is towards don't make
 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.479
confirmation bias is towards don't make
a mistake you know get everything proper

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489
a mistake you know get everything proper
 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.879
a mistake you know get everything proper
and order and get it right so

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:27.889
and order and get it right so
 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:30.550
and order and get it right so
confirmation bias is really essential

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560
confirmation bias is really essential
 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.370
confirmation bias is really essential
and yet it's really valuable to

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380
and yet it's really valuable to
 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.270
and yet it's really valuable to
recognize that what we perceive and how

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280
recognize that what we perceive and how
 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.830
recognize that what we perceive and how
we view it as completely twisted by our

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840
we view it as completely twisted by our
 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.949
we view it as completely twisted by our
internal biases I believe the value in

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959
internal biases I believe the value in
 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.229
internal biases I believe the value in
becoming aware of biases is that it

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239
becoming aware of biases is that it
 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.300
becoming aware of biases is that it
gives you the opportunity of having a

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310
gives you the opportunity of having a
 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.259
gives you the opportunity of having a
little larger perspective the danger of

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269
little larger perspective the danger of
 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.509
little larger perspective the danger of
not being aware of it that we think we

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519
not being aware of it that we think we
 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.140
not being aware of it that we think we
are right so the value in understanding

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150
are right so the value in understanding
 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.270
are right so the value in understanding
confirmation biases is that when we are

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280
confirmation biases is that when we are
 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.309
confirmation biases is that when we are
in some kind of discussion or when we go

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319
in some kind of discussion or when we go
 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.890
in some kind of discussion or when we go
into a different culture that we

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900
into a different culture that we
 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.780
into a different culture that we
recognize you know the world looks

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790
recognize you know the world looks
 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.479
recognize you know the world looks
different for other people and it's not

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489
different for other people and it's not
 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.670
different for other people and it's not
that mine is right or better or theirs

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680
that mine is right or better or theirs
 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.890
that mine is right or better or theirs
is right or better and I cannot really

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900
is right or better and I cannot really
 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.900
is right or better and I cannot really
force them to see it my way

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910
force them to see it my way
 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.610
force them to see it my way
and they cannot force me to see it their

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620
and they cannot force me to see it their
 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.100
and they cannot force me to see it their
way so recognizing that confirmation

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.110
way so recognizing that confirmation
 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.190
way so recognizing that confirmation
bias is completely ingrained allows us

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200
bias is completely ingrained allows us
 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.250
bias is completely ingrained allows us
to chuckle sometimes you know when we

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260
to chuckle sometimes you know when we
 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.170
to chuckle sometimes you know when we
kind of insist on a particular way of

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180
kind of insist on a particular way of
 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.790
kind of insist on a particular way of
seeing the world whether it's

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800
seeing the world whether it's
 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.090
seeing the world whether it's
politically or whether it's social it's

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100
politically or whether it's social it's
 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.130
politically or whether it's social it's
very important it allows us to actually

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140
very important it allows us to actually
 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.400
very important it allows us to actually
listen to other people better and drop

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410
listen to other people better and drop
 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.710
listen to other people better and drop
the confirmation bias maybe for a moment

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720
the confirmation bias maybe for a moment
 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.890
the confirmation bias maybe for a moment
there's not any particular bias that I

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900
there's not any particular bias that I
 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.810
there's not any particular bias that I
would recognize it's more important than

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820
would recognize it's more important than
 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.330
would recognize it's more important than
the other but I do find the uniqueness

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340
the other but I do find the uniqueness
 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.990
the other but I do find the uniqueness
buyers especially amusing you know that

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000
buyers especially amusing you know that
 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.790
buyers especially amusing you know that
that we consider ourselves to be unique

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800
that we consider ourselves to be unique
 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.210
that we consider ourselves to be unique
and the the reason I believe that we

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220
and the the reason I believe that we
 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.240
and the the reason I believe that we
have a uniqueness bias is that we're the

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250
have a uniqueness bias is that we're the
 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.250
have a uniqueness bias is that we're the
only person that we are with 24 hours a

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260
only person that we are with 24 hours a
 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.040
only person that we are with 24 hours a
day so we have far more information

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050
day so we have far more information
 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.920
day so we have far more information
about ourselves about our bodies about

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930
about ourselves about our bodies about
 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.920
about ourselves about our bodies about
our history about our capacities so it

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930
our history about our capacities so it
 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.110
our history about our capacities so it
takes a much much more space in our

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120
takes a much much more space in our
 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.320
takes a much much more space in our
inner universe so to say and because we

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330
inner universe so to say and because we
 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.300
inner universe so to say and because we
have so much more detail about our

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310
have so much more detail about our
 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.140
have so much more detail about our
selves and our own lives it looms much

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150
selves and our own lives it looms much
 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.960
selves and our own lives it looms much
larger than anybody else so the

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970
larger than anybody else so the
 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.030
larger than anybody else so the
interesting thing about uniqueness bias

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040
interesting thing about uniqueness bias
 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.660
interesting thing about uniqueness bias
is that it's not just about ourselves

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:30.670
is that it's not just about ourselves
 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.400
is that it's not just about ourselves
but their circles of uniqueness for

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410
but their circles of uniqueness for
 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.670
but their circles of uniqueness for
instance we consider our person that we

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680
instance we consider our person that we
 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.830
instance we consider our person that we
have a relationship with as more unique

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840
have a relationship with as more unique
 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.440
have a relationship with as more unique
than other people because we know more

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.450
than other people because we know more
 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.540
than other people because we know more
about them we consider our parents of

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550
about them we consider our parents of
 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.420
about them we consider our parents of
more unique than or our siblings again

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430
more unique than or our siblings again
 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.870
more unique than or our siblings again
because we know so much more about them

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880
because we know so much more about them
 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.540
because we know so much more about them
and if you get to know somebody then

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550
and if you get to know somebody then
 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.640
and if you get to know somebody then
they become more unique than other

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650
they become more unique than other
 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.530
they become more unique than other
people you know my friends are really

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540
people you know my friends are really
 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.510
people you know my friends are really
more unique than other people's friends

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520
more unique than other people's friends
 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.460
more unique than other people's friends
you know or they're more special I'm

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470
you know or they're more special I'm
 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.750
you know or they're more special I'm
closer to them and it really I believe

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760
closer to them and it really I believe
 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.360
closer to them and it really I believe
depends all on how much information we

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.370
depends all on how much information we
 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.040
depends all on how much information we
have about them and how important

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050
have about them and how important
 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.879
have about them and how important
they're in our lives

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:10.889
they're in our lives
 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:12.949
they're in our lives
