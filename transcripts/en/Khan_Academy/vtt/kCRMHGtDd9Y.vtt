00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.320
- It's fun, challenging, and
sometimes a bit stressful

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.990
because I might have
forgotten a negative sign

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.830
or a certain decimal,
and that gets me wrong.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.830
And once I find what my mistake
was I'm literally relieved

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.670
because I learned something new

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.160
and I know to not forget that again.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.160
It really felt like I was
trying my best on something

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.790
and then all of a sudden
it just didn't really work

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.430
because I missed one little thing.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.860
So I had to practice again
and then get it all right.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.860
- It really makes me feel like
even when you make mistakes

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.740
you learn from those mistakes,

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.530
and that kinda really
benefits you, I think,

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.870
more than actually
getting the right answer

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.343
'cause you know, like you
said you said with Sophia,

00:01:01.343 --> 00:01:04.133
you get that extra missing puzzle piece.
