00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.556
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:01.556 --> 00:00:04.270
try to get a good understanding
of how the US federal income

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.950
tax rate schedule
works, and also

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.610
what people mean when
they say tax brackets,

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.190
or what does it mean
to be in a tax bracket.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.869
So let's say that I make
$100,000, and I'm single,

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:17.410
and I'm not going to go into
the deductions or anything fancy

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.950
like that.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.100
So let's say I make
$100,000 in a given year.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.640
And these numbers will change
as the tax code changes,

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.080
but the general idea
is the same thing,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.310
although the details
might change.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.509
So the way the
rate schedule works

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:39.850
is that the first $8,350 of my
$100,000 will be taxed at 10%.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.860
So the first $8,350
will be taxed at 10%.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.430
So I'll be paying, what, that's
pretty easy to calculate--

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:53.910
I'll pay $835 on
that first $8,350.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:02.810
Now, the next $25,600, or
from $8,350 to $33,950,

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.659
that will be taxed at 15%.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.850
So this amount right over here,
I will have to pay 15% on that.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.800
And so that the difference
between $33,950 and $8,350

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:26.250
is $25,600 times 15%.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.470
I'll calculate it all at
the end using a calculator.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.930
Now, the next $48,300 is
going to be taxed at 25%.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.630
So let me draw that over here.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.210
So the next-- this next
slug right over here

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.990
is going to be taxed at 25%.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.090
So this is the difference
between $82,250 and $33,950.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.270
That's $48,300.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.510
So it's going to be
$48,300 times 25%.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.990
And then finally, the remainder,
the amount above $82,250,

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.770
since I don't get into the
next bracket above that,

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.240
this part right here is
going to be taxed at 28%.

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:14.060
And let me get my
trusty calculator out

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.580
to figure out what that is.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.910
So, if that's going to be
taxed at-- so the difference

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.470
between $100,000 and $82,250.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:35.170
So $100,000 minus
$82,250 is $17,750.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:43.104
So it is $17,750 times 28%.

00:02:43.104 --> 00:02:44.520
And now I could
use the calculator

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.552
to calculate all of these.

00:02:46.552 --> 00:02:48.510
So it's going to be--
let's do it all at once--

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:57.910
17,750 times 28%-- so
I'll say that its 0.28--

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:17.030
plus 48,300 times 25%, 0.25,
plus $25,600 times 15%, 0.15.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.460
Finally, plus $835.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.790
I'm going to pay $21,720.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.230
So the sum of all
of these, in total,

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.694
I'm going to pay-- I already
forgot the number-- $21,720.

00:03:36.694 --> 00:03:39.110
And I want to make sure you
don't have the misconception--

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.960
notice, you only pay the 28%
on the incremental amount

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.310
when you enter that bracket.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.420
You don't pay this 28%
on the entire $100,000,

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.160
just on the increment
above $80,250.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.540
You don't pay the 25%
on the entire amount,

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.260
just on the increment
between $33,000 and $82,000.
