00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic.

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.580
I remember it so you don't have to!

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.160
You know, you can be too old for a lot of things, but you're never too old to be afraid.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.880
And our childhoods proved it!

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.980
We had to put up with clowns and boogeymen and all sorts of ghosts and goblins when we were growin' up.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.260
So, being the month of Halloween, I've decided to take a look back

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.320
at the Top 11 Scariest Nostalgic Moments of all time.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.420
Why Top 11?

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.320
Because I like to go one step beyond.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.480
So, get ready to cover your eyes and hide under the couch.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.060
THIS

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.840
is the Top 11 Scariest Nostalgic Moments!

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.940
*MWAHAHAHAHA*
*creepy organ music*

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.180
The Wicked Witch from "The Wizard of Oz"

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.280
For many kids, The Wizard of Oz was the first movie they ever saw.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.360
So naturally, Wicked Witch was the first villain they ever came across.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.440
And MAN, did she freak us out.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.080
With her green skin, big nose, and black attire,

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.320
this wicked bitch of the North [ya mean West?]
made us all cry out,

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.840
"There's no place like home!"

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.420
If you can believe it, this actress actually used to be a kindergarten teacher.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.480
Jesus Christ, imagine HER greeting you on your first day of school!

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.900
Wicked Witch:
Wanna play ball?

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.380
AHHHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.500
NC:
AAAAAAAAAH!

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.360
The tunnel scene from "Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory"

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.340
For the most part, "Willy Wonka" is just an innocent story about a boy who wins a golden ticket

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.720
to a factory of wonder and imagination.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.540
But it suddenly goes f**king nuts when it enters the death tunnel from Hell!

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.380
Mrs. Teavee:
I'm gonna be sick!

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.720
NC:
Every creepy image you can imagine pops up here:

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.180
Snakes, lizards, Gestapo wannabes,

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.520
even a scene of a chicken getting his head chopped off!

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.840
Mrs. Teavee:
Aaaah! Now I AM gonna be sick!

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.780
NC:
On top of that, Wonka reads out loud a scary-as-f*ck poem

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.600
and then proceeds to scream at the top of his lungs.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.420
And THAT'S not even the strange part!

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.560
The strange part is that after this scene of misery, chaos, anarchy, and death...

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.000
...they never talk about it again!

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.400
They just go on their merry way like nothing ever happened.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.740
Man, if I was in that situation, even if we got up to the part with the giant geese, I'd be like,

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.160
"Dude, what the f*ck was up with that tunnel?"

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.060
NC:
I always thought to myself, "This scene will make a LOT more sense after I grow up."

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.740
Well, I'm grown up now...

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.460
...AND IT STILL MAKES NO F**KING SENSE!

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.700
So what's the deal, Wonka?

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.920
Wonka:
There's no Earthly way of knowing...

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.260
Wh-wh-what are you talking ab—

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.700
Wonka:
...which direction we are going.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.840
Whoa, wh-what...

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.780
Wonka:
Not a speck of light is showing. So the danger must be growing.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.260
Are the fires of Hell a-glowing?

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.120
Is the grisly Reaper mowing?

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.200
YES!

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.640
The danger must be growing, for the rowers keep on rowing,

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.560
and they're certainly not showing

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.160
ANY SIGNS THAT THEY ARE SLOWING!

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.680
WAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.660
( ﾟﾛﾟ)

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.840
The Villain Song from "Care Bears in Wonderland"

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.760
Now I know what you're thinking:

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.140
How can a Care Bears movie possibly be the least bit scary?

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.640
Well, I'm glad you asked!

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.340
There's an especially gay moment where the villain of the movie sings a ukelele song about Wonderland,

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.320
because, frankly, villains need more ukelele songs.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.360
The song itself is pretty lame, when all of a sudden, THIS happens:

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.420
NC:
Didja see it? Didja see it?

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.800
Watch it again in slow motion.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.540
NC:
Holy F*CK, what is that?

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.880
It looks like something Charles Manson would shit out!

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.940
And because the scene goes by so fast, it doesn't just scare us,

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.780
it scares us on a subconscious level.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.960
I always said if you watch Care Bears long enough, you'll see the face of the devil.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.820
But I didn't think you could actually freeze-frame it!

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.160
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.980
NC:
AAAAAAAH!

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.340
The Headless Horseman from "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.380
This is the epitome of a Gothic cartoon.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.600
It has great atmosphere, creepy visuals, and a dark storyline.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.840
But it's the Headless Horseman that everyone remembers.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.000
With his creepy laugh, flaming pumpkin, and, of course, the absence of a certain facial feature.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.160
He gave us all the willies, but this scene in particular got us all creeped out.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.240
*evil laugh*

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.120
The Headless Horseman—he had every kid ducking for cover.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.780
Horseman:
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:44.800
NC:
AAAAAAAAAAAH!

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.020
The Snake from "Beetlejuice"

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.940
Even though Beetlejuice was a comedy, it was filled with ghastly images

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.260
that made kids jump joyfully out of their seats,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.020
the creepiest scene being when Beetlejuice transforms into a snake and starts tossing people around the room.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.080
Beetlejuice:
We've come for your daughter, Chuck.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.900
It was big, dark, creepy, and made us all shit ourselves with fear.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.100
This snake had us all rattling under the covers.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.800
Charles:
GEEZ—!

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.480
NC:
AH!

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.380
Delia:
He likes it.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.000
"Ghostbusters". Just... just Ghostbusters!

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.400
Everything about these films had creepy written all over it.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.560
And when your job requires you to do nothing but hunt down ghosts and goblins that plague your town,

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.760
chances are you're gonna see some scary stuff.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.740
The two scariest scenes in particular are when Sigourney Weaver is transformed into a ghostly demon—

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.280
Am I the only one that feels like this hand's copping a feel?

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.700
—and the scene where her baby is taken away by a spiritual nanny, played by Peter MacNicol.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.580
Peter MacNicol is already pretty scary.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.120
Now imagine him in drag, trying to play a Mary Poppins pedophile from Hell,

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.560
and you've got yourself a pretty nasty image.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.980
Whichever scenes scare you the most, the Ghostbusters movies definitely rate a 9.5 on the scary-shit-o-meter.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.460
*Slimer screams*

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.300
NC:
AAAHH!

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.640
The Child Catcher from "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.660
Good God, was this guy creepy.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.900
When your parents said, "Stay away from strangers with candy," this is probably the person they were talking about.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.360
Child Catcher:
Lollipop!

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.780
NC:
He embodied everything that children imagined bad men looked like.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.840
In fact, to be honest, he's a little creepier now than he was back then.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.700
He looks like one of those guys you catch on MySpace trying to pick up 10-year-old boys.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.700
Child Catcher:
Come along, kiddie-winkies!

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:15.600
*shiver*

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.700
Whatever reason he creeps you out, he's one bad customer.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.040
And my guess is, he'll be ringing your doorbell reading a court-required notice sometime soon.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:24.480
AH!

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.820
Large Marge from "Pee-wee's Big Adventure"

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.180
This is a funny movie whether you're a kid or an adult.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.000
However, there's one scene that just comes out of nowhere.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.400
It involves a truck driver named Large Marge, who starts telling a ghost story about the worst accident she's ever seen.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.500
Large Marge:
And when they finally pulled the driver's body...

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.200
from the twisted... burning... WRECK...

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.180
it looked like... THIS!

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.400
O-O

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.540
Pee-wee:
AAAHHH!

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.360
NC:
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.980
She's just telling a story, all of a sudden, "blaahaha!"

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.840
NC: I mean, it just comes out of nowhere, and catches everybody off guard, even the adults.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.640
We find out later that the Large Marge that Pee-wee was riding with was actually...

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.340
Restaurant patrons:
Her ghost!

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.600
*shivers*
At least I don't have to see that sequence again—

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.480
BLAHAHAHAH!

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.160
AAAAHHH!

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.340
Can we cut to a less frightening part of the movie?

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:15.680
Ah, that's better.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.700
Hahahaha!

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:17.720
AAAAHHHH!

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.000
Judge Doom from "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.220
Everything about this movie kicks ass, and the villain is no exception.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.480
He's tall, he's dark, he's Christopher Lloyd—right on the money.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:33.720
The best scenes, though, come at the very end, when he transforms into a half-man, half-toon psychopath.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.000
And you could count the bricks we shit after seeing this scene.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.900
If Stephen King did a biography on Mickey Mouse, my guess is he'd probably look something like this.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:42.400
Judge Doom:
Uh?

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.980
NC:
Judge Doom—he's not bad, he's just drawn that way.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:45.960
Judge Doom:
*screams*

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:46.740
NC:
*ditto*

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.160
The Clown from "Poltergeist"

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:56.580
This is back before the PG-13 rating existed, so lots of kids usually flooded to PG-rated scary films like this one.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.200
And boy, did we regret it.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.920
This clown had all of us looking at our toys funny.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.940
I used to have a Ninja Turtle doll.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.140
THAT I SHOT!

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.080
For the most part, the clown does nothing throughout the entire movie,

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.180
but all the kids are watching it, saying,

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.360
"Yeah, I know you're up to somethin'..."

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.800
"Oh, cut the crap, we both know you're alive!"

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:22.060
We had to wait the whole, entire movie for this thing to do something.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.300
And even though we waited an hour and a half for it, we STILL weren't ready.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:28.820
AAAAHHH!

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.660
And the Number 1 Scariest Nostalgic Moment is...

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.180
The Banshee from "Darby O'Gill and the Little People"

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.740
With her ghostly image, hideous complexion, and terrifying howl,

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:44.240
the Banshee was one of the scariest images that no kid should ever have to see.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.720
If you haven't seen this movie, you should. It's pretty good by Disney standards.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.620
It has great atmosphere, good characters,

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.220
and it's the only film you'll ever hear Sean Connery sing. Seriously!

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:52.720
[Aside from "Dr. No"]

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.460
Michael:
♪She is my dear, my darlin' one,♪

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.980
♪My smilin' and beguilin' one♪

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.020
NC:
And if THAT'S not scary enough for you, the Banshee surely is.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:04.780
Now the effects in this movie range from ingenious to insufferable, and the Banshee is no exception.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:08.100
Most of the time, she moves very gracefully, but other times, she kinda moves like a go-kart.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.040
*horn honk*

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.320
In fact, she's not even onscreen for very long.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.980
The rest of the scene focuses on the Death Coach, which is pretty damn creepy too.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:19.680
But it's the eerie presence of the Banshee that gets our blood boiling, even to this day.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.220
In fact, there's one scene at the end that STILL continues to scare the shit outta me, even to this day.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:27.360
In fact, I usually end up running out of the room screaming, I'm so terrified.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.780
I don't even get to finish the rest of the scene.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.220
But not today.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:36.160
Today, seeing how it's Halloween, I'm gonna stand up for myself, gonna confront my fears,

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:40.480
and I am gonna watch this scene all... the way... through...

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.360
*ghostly howling*

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.540
There's that creepy howling outside.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.100
There he goes, about to open the door.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.600
Here it comes...

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:59.280
*ghostly wail*

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:00.420
*nope*

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.120
*maniacal laugh*
