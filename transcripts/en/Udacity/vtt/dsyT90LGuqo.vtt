00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.700
Let's look at the solution
to our block number quiz.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.570
If we have a 32 B block size and
a 16-BIT ADDRESS like this,

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.550
the question is what is
the BLOCK OFFSET and the block number.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:17.110
For a 32 B block the block offset will
determine where within the 32 B are we.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.317
We need 5 bits to tell us that
because 2 to the 5 is 32.

00:00:21.317 --> 00:00:23.640
So we need 5 bits.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.660
To tell us which of the 32 bytes
are we interested in accessing.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.100
That means that the least
significant 5 bits of this address,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.630
are the block offset.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.630
So the block offset is this.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.250
The remaining bits of the address
are the block number.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.510
They're telling us which of the 32
byte blocks contains this address.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.990
So this is our block number.
