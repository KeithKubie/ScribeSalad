1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.520
Okay.
So we're,
we're studying reaction mechanisms,
uh,
this semester.

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.500
But we'd taken a little diversion to look at at reaction order,

3
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.040
how the dependence of rate on concentration gives information about,

4
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.120
uh,
about mechanisms.

5
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.900
So this is the kinetic analog of the law of mass action.

6
00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:26.901
The exponents we talked about on concentration last semester and we saw last

7
00:00:26.971 --> 00:00:30.810
time that,
uh,
that we would have rate laws,
the DDI product,

8
00:00:30.811 --> 00:00:34.890
Dt is some function of concentration raised to some power.

9
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.750
And we looked last time at zero order and first order and second order.

10
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.670
And now we're gonna look at some complex reactions and how they can get weird

11
00:00:44.671 --> 00:00:48.570
orders like fractional orders or even in verse orders.

12
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.630
So a fractional order.

13
00:00:51.631 --> 00:00:56.631
Suppose the rate is proportional to some rate constant times the concentration

14
00:00:56.731 --> 00:01:00.690
of a times the concentration of B to the one fourth power.

15
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.310
How can that be?

16
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.330
How can you have a fourth of a molecule participate in a reaction?

17
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.670
Well,
that's it.
This all depends on what,

18
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.730
when a s a reactive species in equilibrium with other species,

19
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.380
what is the dominant species?

20
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.820
Because when you add more material to a solution,

21
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.310
what you increase is the dominant species by how much you add.
If you double it,

22
00:01:29.311 --> 00:01:33.510
you have twice as much of the dominant species.
If you triple it,

23
00:01:33.511 --> 00:01:36.210
you have three times as much of the dominant species.

24
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.400
But suppose what's reacting is not the dominant species,

25
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.780
but is related to the dominant species by some equilibrium constant.

26
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.400
So for example,

27
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.470
suppose the dominant species where a tetramer four units,
right?

28
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.390
But the reactive species,
we're a monomer,
a single B unit,

29
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.980
right?
So you have the equilibrium between before and four B.

30
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.880
Now if before is dominant and B is reactive,

31
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.780
then if you double the concentration,
or actually let's say you,

32
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.000
you increase the concentration by a factor of two,
four,

33
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.070
six,
eight you increase the concentration by a factor of eight.

34
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.790
How much do you increase the concentration of before it's practically all the

35
00:02:29.021 --> 00:02:30.780
stuff.
It's the dominant species.

36
00:02:30.781 --> 00:02:35.700
So you increase it by a factor of eight by how much do you increase the

37
00:02:35.701 --> 00:02:39.840
concentration of the monomer?
B?
It's in equilibrium with it.

38
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.420
Okay.
So the dominant species is proportional to how much you add.

39
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.520
That's how much you think you have.

40
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.830
But the minor species tags along following the law of mass action.

41
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.060
So we actually last semester talked about a Tetramer,
right?

42
00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.120
That methyl lithium gives this distorted cubic tetramer right?

43
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.570
And remember it has four,
uh,

44
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.740
ether molecules associated with it if possible.
Okay.

45
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.290
But if you put in a lot more ether,

46
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.890
then it rips the rips the tetramer apart because all the oxygen's want to be

47
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.810
sharing their electrons with lithium.

48
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.530
So excess re ether lifts rips that apart first to give a dimer with two more.

49
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.670
Uh,

50
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.670
Metho lithiums are methyl ethers for Daimler Unit and ultimately to a monomer

51
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:36.160
with another methyl ether per monomer unit.

52
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.240
So each monomer now has three,
uh,
dimethyl ether.

53
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.870
So if you have plenty of dye methyl ethers,

54
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.050
then the equilibrium shifts to the right.

55
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.900
And most of the stuff is monomer,
right?

56
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.160
And if you increase the concentration by a of the material you put in,

57
00:03:54.161 --> 00:03:58.810
by a factor of eight,
you'll increase the monomer by a factor of eight.
Right?

58
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.930
But that's not what happened.
Uh,
when,

59
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.640
when you don't have the excess either available,
if you have,

60
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.790
then the equilibrium lies to the right and most,

61
00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:14.410
and when you put eight times as much ladle,
eight times as much material in,

62
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.040
you don't ladle it because it's very reactive with air and water.

63
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.880
But if you put four times increase the concentration by a factor of four,

64
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.530
this is what you increased by a factor of four.
And how do you increase that?

65
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.720
Well,
you have this equilibrium constant where the monomers to the fourth power,

66
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.190
so the bottom or to the fourth is proportional to the tetramer.

67
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.590
Or You could write the same thing.

68
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.850
The monomer is proportional to the tetramer two,
the one fourth power,

69
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.910
right?
Two,
four,
eight 16 was what I was supposed to say.
Right?

70
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.440
So if I,
if I increase the monome,

71
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.870
the Tetramer by a factor of 16,

72
00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.090
I increased the monomer by 16 to the one fourth power,

73
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.520
right?
By a factor of two.
So it would only double the rate,
right?

74
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.780
So reaction of monomer in a hydrocarbon solvent turns out to be one fourth order

75
00:05:12.781 --> 00:05:16.560
in how much reagent you add.
But,
uh,

76
00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.080
the reaction order approves then that the monomer is reactive,

77
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.000
but the Tetramer is dominant in the hydrocarbon,
right?

78
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.800
But if you have excess ether,
then the reaction shifts to the left.

79
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.320
And if you add 16 times as much stuff,

80
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.040
you increase the concentration of the modern number by a factor of 16.

81
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.960
Then it's first order in how much stuff you added.
Okay.
So that's,

82
00:05:40.961 --> 00:05:44.170
and the reaction becomes first order.
Okay.

83
00:05:44.171 --> 00:05:47.440
So that's one example where you can have a weird,

84
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.000
a kinetic rate law or weird dependence on concentration.

85
00:05:52.001 --> 00:05:54.110
Fractional.
Suppose you had a,

86
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.430
a one sixth order reaction,
right?

87
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.110
What would you infer,

88
00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:05.403
<v 1>Elisa?</v>

89
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.700
<v 0>Right,
that the array,
the dominant species is a heck summer,</v>

90
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.650
but the reactive species as a monomer.
Good.
Okay.

91
00:06:15.651 --> 00:06:18.270
Now here are two,
uh,
uh,

92
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.440
Ian Anti Immerse and R and an s configuration of this funny molecule that's a

93
00:06:24.261 --> 00:06:26.420
little bit related to amino acids.

94
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.250
Right now it has what are called Alpha hydrogens.

95
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.670
Those are hydrogens attached to a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group,

96
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:38.743
right?

97
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.900
So it turns out that a base could pull off that hydrogen leaving an anti and on

98
00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:48.890
that carbon,
which then is stabilized by Pi Star of the Carbon Eel,

99
00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.660
right?
So it's easy to pull off that age and put it back on again.

100
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.330
So that means that if you put bass in in with these two molecules,
they'll enter,

101
00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.940
convert.
Okay.
Easily.

102
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.590
Now that would lead duress musician,
if you started with all one hand,

103
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.100
right?
You'd have a reaction going one way,

104
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.330
which has a certain rate constant times the base.
Right.

105
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.650
And a reaction going the other way,
which is the same rate constant,

106
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.270
right?
Because they're mirror images times the concentration of bees.

107
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.010
Now the rate,

108
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.780
how much goes from one side to the other is the rate constant times the

109
00:07:29.781 --> 00:07:31.760
concentration,
right?

110
00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.480
So if you have a higher concentration of one than the other,

111
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:40.550
it's rate will be faster.
Right?
So as it says here,

112
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.970
that since they're identical rate constants for the two enantiomers,

113
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:48.830
that guarantees a faster rate for the major concentration.

114
00:07:48.831 --> 00:07:49.780
The major in anti,

115
00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:54.810
we're going to the minor INA Auntie more until they equilibrate they come to 50

116
00:07:55.191 --> 00:07:58.190
50 and then the rates will be equal.
Okay,

117
00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:03.070
so that's a guaranteed mechanism for Rassam.

118
00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:03.770
Ization.

119
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:07.670
You haven't Alpha hydrogen at the chiral center or the Stereo Genic Center.

120
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.810
You put bass in,
pull it off,
put it on,
and you get raw.

121
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.330
You've lost all the effort you put in to make the thing a single INA Auntie

122
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.820
Maria at the beginning.
Okay.
Incidentally,

123
00:08:19.821 --> 00:08:24.140
how do you make something a single Ena antitumor when you generate something,

124
00:08:24.141 --> 00:08:28.610
typically you make both right and left equally and with equal probability,

125
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.310
right?
Or what you have to do.
Remember as we talked about last semester poster,

126
00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:38.410
one of postures methods is to react it with something preexisting.

127
00:08:38.421 --> 00:08:41.090
That's only wanting an tumor,
right?

128
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.360
In some reversible reaction,
right?

129
00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:49.660
So you can make the pair of enantiomers and to die a stereo mers separate them

130
00:08:50.061 --> 00:08:53.540
perhaps by crystallization,
then takes them back to what you want.

131
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:58.860
That's how you get one to with it depends on having something preexisting.

132
00:08:58.861 --> 00:09:00.000
That's the single hand.

133
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.393
<v 2>Okay.</v>

134
00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:08.250
<v 0>Now these two molecules turn out to crystallize and they crystallize in crystals</v>

135
00:09:08.741 --> 00:09:12.640
that are composed all of wanting antitumor or all of the other.

136
00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.900
So if you'll let such a mixture crystallize,

137
00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:19.060
it would give 50% of one crystal,

138
00:09:19.061 --> 00:09:23.320
50% of the other crystal it would be receiving.
Okay.

139
00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:26.950
Except if you grind it.

140
00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:33.160
So there was this very interesting paper two years ago by a group in a,

141
00:09:33.161 --> 00:09:38.161
in the Netherlands nor down was the lead author about grinding a suspension of

142
00:09:39.101 --> 00:09:41.110
these crystals.
That is their crystal,

143
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:46.060
these right and left handed crystals of that compound.
When they're in solution,

144
00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.210
they can inter convert as there's base in there.

145
00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:54.190
And then so molecule comes off,
the crystal goes into solution,
Razah Mises,
right?

146
00:09:54.191 --> 00:09:56.470
And then it goes back on one crystal or the other,

147
00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.173
<v 2>right?</v>

148
00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:03.400
<v 0>So they,
uh,
uh,
they,
they started the,
the,</v>

149
00:10:03.401 --> 00:10:08.300
the experiments lasted some time,
you see up to 50 or 60 or 70 days.

150
00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:12.200
Okay.
And they looked in the solid phase,

151
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:15.710
the crystals at what the ENA antitumor excess was,

152
00:10:15.711 --> 00:10:18.500
how much more of one crystal there was than the other.

153
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.863
<v 2>Okay.</v>

154
00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:25.930
<v 0>And they started with a little bit of excess of either the s those are the blue</v>

155
00:10:26.451 --> 00:10:30.140
points or the are.
Those are the red points.

156
00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:34.050
And I noticed we have these front lights on.
I'd better turn those off to get

157
00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:36.270
<v 2>better,
uh,</v>

158
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:41.220
<v 0>definition on the slides.
Okay.</v>

159
00:10:41.221 --> 00:10:42.930
So we have red or blue.

160
00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:47.970
It can be a very tiny access like 0.04% now what would you expect?

161
00:10:48.241 --> 00:10:49.650
From what I've been telling you,

162
00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:55.010
if you had base in the solution and you start grinding to encourage the crystals

163
00:10:55.231 --> 00:10:59.040
to dissolve more rapidly,
what would you expect to happen in time?

164
00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:03.330
Suppose you started with one that's 17% excess of s.

165
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:08.570
What would happen in time?
Come on.

166
00:11:08.571 --> 00:11:09.404
Be Naive.

167
00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:11.820
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

168
00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.080
<v 0>Megan,
what do you think would happen?</v>

169
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:22.640
Can't hear it very well.
Yeah.
It would go to zero in antitumor excess,

170
00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:26.830
it would go to 50 50.
So you'd expect the curve that would look like this,
right?

171
00:11:26.831 --> 00:11:29.890
It would go along depending on how fast it is and becomes zero.

172
00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:32.200
This is what actually happened.

173
00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:40.400
<v 2>Right?</v>

174
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.780
<v 0>So it d Ras mized,
right.</v>

175
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:49.670
It became a single in anti of her,
whatever was an excess at the beginning.

176
00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.830
All the crystals became that.

177
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:54.610
<v 2>Right?</v>

178
00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:58.300
<v 0>So this is very different from what we were talking about before where the rate</v>

179
00:11:58.301 --> 00:12:01.060
law guarantees that whatever's in excess,

180
00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:05.830
we'll go more more rapidly to the minor than the minor to the major and it's

181
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:10.180
guaranteed to come out 50 50 this one goes exactly the opposite.

182
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:14.800
So this was a great puzzle.
What caused this to happen?
Right?

183
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:19.870
It couldn't be that there's faster conversion of the minor crystals.

184
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:25.210
Right.
So that if you have say more ar than s,

185
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:29.200
it's faster to go from s to our then from r to s,

186
00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:33.670
what would that say about the rate law?

187
00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:41.690
If the less concentration you have,
the fewer crystals,

188
00:12:41.691 --> 00:12:43.040
the faster it goes.

189
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.233
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

190
00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.310
<v 0>it's an inverse rate law.</v>

191
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:53.340
That certainly sounds weird,
right?

192
00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.040
But there's another interesting thing.

193
00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.100
The lines have a curious shape.

194
00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:04.170
You see what's funny about as a reaction goes along having this kind of shape or

195
00:13:04.171 --> 00:13:08.040
this kind of shape.
Remember what we looked,

196
00:13:08.041 --> 00:13:11.510
we looked last time at a first order reaction or a second order reaction.

197
00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:12.363
What it looked like.

198
00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:17.190
You started with a given starting material and what happened in time,
it became,

199
00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:21.330
it went through product,
but how did it went to zero concentration,

200
00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:25.200
but how did it go?
It went like this,
right?

201
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:30.030
Because the more of it there was,
the faster it was going,
right?

202
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.940
Halflife halflife halflife right.

203
00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.870
This seems to be backwards,
right?

204
00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:40.950
And you see it both in the fact that it goes all to one to the major one,

205
00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:45.000
and in the fact that you have these funny curves

206
00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:48.630
right now,

207
00:13:48.631 --> 00:13:53.631
the explanation is that when you're grinding,

208
00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:55.830
you make tiny,

209
00:13:55.831 --> 00:14:00.450
tiny pieces that are guaranteed to dissolve,

210
00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:02.220
right?

211
00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:07.220
So grinding accelerates dissolution by making very tiny crystals below the

212
00:14:08.131 --> 00:14:12.180
critical size that we talked about last semester.
So they'll dissolve,

213
00:14:12.181 --> 00:14:13.920
they won't grow,
right?

214
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:19.310
Except they can be rescued from disillusion by combining with another crystal of

215
00:14:21.061 --> 00:14:25.830
the same kind.
So this,
the,
the crystal here could grow.

216
00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:29.190
The crystal could grow,
not by adding one molecule at a time,

217
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:31.800
but by two small crystals coming together.

218
00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:37.470
Now that's going to be second order in how many of these little pieces there
are,

219
00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:39.780
right?
The more a little,

220
00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:43.860
if two things are coming together to A's are coming together that second order

221
00:14:43.861 --> 00:14:46.920
in a,
so the more stuff there is,

222
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:50.550
the faster it avoids dissolution.

223
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:56.960
So really it's a second order process,
right,
of,
of avoiding disillusion.

224
00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.470
But that means that if you're looking at the disillusion,

225
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.170
which allows stuff to go from one to the other,

226
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.550
that's faster if you have less stuff because you don't save it,

227
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:11.030
right?
So that's a really,
uh,

228
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:16.210
so the majority solid dissolves more slowly than the minority solid does because

229
00:15:18.021 --> 00:15:21.320
it can be saved by a second order process.
Right?

230
00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:26.270
But the key to understanding this really weird,
uh,

231
00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:30.680
phenomenon was the kinetics,
right?

232
00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:35.030
To see that the lines had these funny shapes,
right?

233
00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:40.150
That's what clued people in to the idea that it was this coalescence of little

234
00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:45.260
shards of crystals that made the thing do this and this could be of interest.

235
00:15:45.261 --> 00:15:46.520
The people who do this,

236
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:51.290
the reason they're motivated to do it other than they just think it's cool is

237
00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:56.210
people have always wondered how it is that in the biosphere things Becca had a

238
00:15:56.211 --> 00:16:01.211
single hand that all amino acids are r l amino acids and all sugars or d sugars

239
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:04.400
are most sugars at least.
Right.

240
00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:09.820
How did things get resolved in the first place when there wasn't anything pre

241
00:16:09.891 --> 00:16:12.890
resolved to do this separation we talked about?

242
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:17.360
But this can start at 50 50.
It never,

243
00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:21.290
if you have a lot of particles,
it's never exactly 50 50,

244
00:16:21.291 --> 00:16:23.480
there'll be a little bit more of one than the other.

245
00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:28.430
So one of them will be saved from disillusion a little more than the other.

246
00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.930
And ultimately that one we'll build out auto catalytically.
The more it goes,

247
00:16:32.931 --> 00:16:37.640
the faster it goes.
Right?
So that seems to be the,
the uh,

248
00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:43.130
the explanation of this phenomenon that could indeed have something to do with

249
00:16:43.131 --> 00:16:46.940
the or origin of single handedness in the biosphere.
Right.

250
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.240
But the key to understanding it was the kinetics,

251
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:52.423
the rate law.

252
00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:01.820
So we've seen the guidance that rate laws can provide for understanding reaction

253
00:17:01.821 --> 00:17:06.260
mechanisms zero with order.
That's when the key catalyst is saturated.

254
00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.770
First order is the normal business.

255
00:17:09.771 --> 00:17:13.220
Second order when two things have to get together,
fractional order,

256
00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:17.720
when things have to come apart,
right?
And negative order.
In this case,

257
00:17:17.721 --> 00:17:20.660
although you could argue that it's actually a second order,

258
00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:25.720
but it appears to be negative order,
that the minor stuff goes,
uh,
more,

259
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:30.650
more rapidly.
Okay.
So now back to what we were talking about,

260
00:17:30.651 --> 00:17:32.030
the reaction we're talking about,

261
00:17:32.031 --> 00:17:35.870
which is bond association to generate free radicals.

262
00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:37.093
And how,

263
00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:41.840
the reason we're talking about that is try to figure out how you can predict

264
00:17:41.841 --> 00:17:44.540
rate constants from things we already know.

265
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:50.310
So we were studying free radical,
uh,
substitutions

266
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:54.540
for this purpose because a,
they're simple,
they're,

267
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.120
there's minimal influence from the solvent.

268
00:17:57.121 --> 00:18:00.870
So you can just look at the molecules that are doing the reaction and try to

269
00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:04.770
understand the rates.
They're also turn out to be very important.

270
00:18:04.771 --> 00:18:07.100
These free radical reactions.
Uh,

271
00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:10.250
they're very important in atmospheric chemistry.

272
00:18:10.251 --> 00:18:13.740
So there's a lot of work done on them and say boulder,
Colorado,

273
00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:15.700
where there were the,
uh,

274
00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:20.820
atmospheric administration and the Joint Laboratory for Library Joint Institute

275
00:18:20.821 --> 00:18:25.670
for laboratory astrophysics are very interested in these kinds of things.
Uh,

276
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:30.510
there they're important didn't combustion you make free radicals also in

277
00:18:30.511 --> 00:18:33.360
oxidation reactions that we'll talk about more later.

278
00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:37.770
And in terms of strictly organic chemistry,

279
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:41.100
they provide great examples of see like activity.

280
00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:46.470
And that's a pervasive theme.
As I say here in synthesis and in biochemistry,

281
00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:50.070
almost always with any kind of complicated molecule,

282
00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:53.700
the problem is not what,
what,
what can react.

283
00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.520
There are always lots of different ways of reacting.

284
00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:01.110
The question is how you can be selective and do one thing rather than another.

285
00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:05.640
That's often the problem in organic synthesis is being selective.

286
00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:06.880
And this,
uh,

287
00:19:06.881 --> 00:19:11.881
the free radical reactions are a very simple example of showing something about

288
00:19:12.391 --> 00:19:16.470
seal activity as we'll see later in the lecture.
Okay.

289
00:19:16.471 --> 00:19:19.770
So last time we were looking at these,
uh,
this table of,

290
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.820
of experimental bond dissociation energies,

291
00:19:23.821 --> 00:19:27.690
bond in therapies as they're called,
they're a zillion of them,
right?

292
00:19:27.691 --> 00:19:31.950
And they're known very well.
But what we would like to understand is why,

293
00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:36.570
why do they have these values?
So you don't have to memorize the whole table.

294
00:19:36.571 --> 00:19:36.930
That is,

295
00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:41.820
you just have to suck it up and memorize this or he can you understand this kind

296
00:19:41.821 --> 00:19:46.200
of lore,
what,
what,
what rates should,
what the rate constant should be,

297
00:19:46.201 --> 00:19:50.100
what the energy should be for the strengths of these bonds that you're trying to

298
00:19:50.101 --> 00:19:53.190
break?
Well,

299
00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:57.870
it's very difficult to predict exactly what these energies should be,

300
00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:02.760
but often you can predict relative energies.
If you know one,

301
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:05.850
you can predict another one.
Right?

302
00:20:05.851 --> 00:20:10.851
So that's most often in in exams that I ask a questions I'd ask on exams.

303
00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:14.670
It's not a question of knowing the precise rate,

304
00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:18.210
but if you knew the rate for this,
what would the rate for this B?

305
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:21.090
And you notice that it has to do with Sila activity.

306
00:20:21.091 --> 00:20:24.740
When you have two different two processes that are analogous to one another that

307
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:29.190
can go on.
Uh,
how,
how much better should one be than the other?

308
00:20:29.191 --> 00:20:33.960
That's much easier to get the relative values than to get the absolute values.

309
00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:36.031
Okay.

310
00:20:36.031 --> 00:20:41.031
And we started last time looking at this in the case of the bonds to methyl from

311
00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:46.980
uh,
the various halogens.
I remember that it has to do with overlap,

312
00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:52.330
right?
As you make the halogens bigger,
the overlap isn't so good.
And also with,

313
00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:55.300
it has to do with energy match between the orbitals.

314
00:20:55.301 --> 00:21:00.301
We talked about this last lecture and we also talked about other cases where the

315
00:21:01.151 --> 00:21:05.470
radicals were unusual that remember had to do with starting material,

316
00:21:05.471 --> 00:21:06.850
how strong the bond is.

317
00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:11.780
But then others had to do with how stable the radicals were.
Like,
uh,

318
00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:15.530
the hybridization,
uh,
of the,
uh,

319
00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:20.620
ch and the resonance,
the Somo mixing with Pi and Pi Star,

320
00:21:20.621 --> 00:21:23.710
we talked about that last time has to do with the radical,

321
00:21:23.711 --> 00:21:28.540
whereas the hybridization that explains the strong ones has to do with the

322
00:21:28.541 --> 00:21:32.530
starting material,
how strong the CH bonds are.
So we've done that.

323
00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:36.970
Now let's look at a more subtle example,

324
00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:42.330
which is as we go from one al kill radical to another breaking hydrogens off

325
00:21:43.931 --> 00:21:46.560
from carbon,
right?
But from,

326
00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:50.680
but from a d just simple different alkanes.
Right.

327
00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:55.660
And the first thing we noticed there is that they're not very different.
Right?

328
00:21:56.830 --> 00:22:01.830
And you can explain this in by saying that the carbon carbon bond is more

329
00:22:03.911 --> 00:22:05.770
sensitive to hybridization.

330
00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:10.750
It's energy than the carbon hydrogen bond is right?
Now,

331
00:22:10.751 --> 00:22:14.920
when you go from a tetrahedral carbon,
the starting material,

332
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:19.630
you pull off an h and get a radical,
which is trigonal,
right?

333
00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:24.640
You go from sp three sp two bonds,
right?

334
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.610
And the SB two bonds,
as we saw last semester,

335
00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:31.990
overlap better and give stronger bonds.
Right?
That's fine.
That'll be true.

336
00:22:31.991 --> 00:22:34.150
There'll be stronger.
If they're bonded to hydrogen,

337
00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.540
there'll be stronger if they're bonded to carbon.
Right?

338
00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:42.190
But it turns out that carbon carbon bonds are more sensitive to the

339
00:22:42.191 --> 00:22:46.150
hybridization than carbon h is,
right?

340
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:47.680
So if you have,

341
00:22:47.681 --> 00:22:51.580
if when you're pulling the hydrogen off from your tetrahedral carbon,

342
00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:54.760
there are other carbons attached to that carbon.

343
00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.440
Then in the process of going to the radical,

344
00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:04.630
you'll get more extra stability than you would have if there had been hydrogens

345
00:23:04.631 --> 00:23:05.464
there.

346
00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:09.700
Because the carbons profit from the change in hybridization more than the

347
00:23:09.701 --> 00:23:14.290
hydrogens would have done,
right?
So that's what we see here.
That methyl,

348
00:23:14.291 --> 00:23:18.940
which has three hydrogens is is hard to form the radical,

349
00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:19.960
right?

350
00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:24.960
104.9 but it gets easier and easier and easier as you go to more and more carbon

351
00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:31.060
carbon bonds rather than hydrogen carbon bonds on the radical you're making.

352
00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:35.170
So that's one explanation that the carbon carbon is more sensitive.

353
00:23:35.171 --> 00:23:39.430
And that's to say that that's why the radical is more stable,
right?

354
00:23:39.431 --> 00:23:42.580
It has to do with the stability of the radical.
Okay.

355
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000
The other possibility is analogous to what we saw over here in the alley,

356
00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:50.840
all had benzyl cases,
right?

357
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:56.080
It was where the SOMO mixes with Pi and Pi Star on the adjacent carbon,

358
00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:02.330
right?
So here's where we're going to pull a hydrogen off here,
make it radical.

359
00:24:02.331 --> 00:24:06.980
A P orbital here.
If we had pi system here that could overlap with that,

360
00:24:06.981 --> 00:24:10.280
we mix it with Pi mixed with Pi Star and get stabilization.

361
00:24:10.281 --> 00:24:12.770
We looked at that last time.
Now of course,

362
00:24:12.771 --> 00:24:16.970
if you have a hydrogen here attached to the carbon from which the hydrogen is

363
00:24:16.971 --> 00:24:21.920
being lost,
it does it.
It's orthogonal.
It can't overlap with the p orbital here,

364
00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:26.870
but if you have a carbon here with a hydrogen on it,

365
00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:32.650
then that sigma and sigma star bond of Camh can overlap with the p orbital,

366
00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:34.783
right?

367
00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:39.350
So you can get the same kind of mixing that you get with Pi and Pi Star,

368
00:24:39.351 --> 00:24:43.610
except at sigma and Sigma Star.
So they're much further away and energy.

369
00:24:43.611 --> 00:24:46.760
The energy matches much poorer with this p orbital,

370
00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:49.820
so you don't expect it to be a very big phenomenon.

371
00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:54.110
And the changes here aren't nearly as indeed are not nearly as big as they were

372
00:24:54.111 --> 00:24:55.630
for for Benzel and,

373
00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.990
but those are the explanations that are standards that are standard for

374
00:24:59.991 --> 00:25:04.991
explaining why more substituted radicals are more stable.

375
00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:09.470
That's what people say.
So it's easier to break the bonds that is,

376
00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:13.580
they say that it has to do with this radical stability.
Right?

377
00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:18.820
Notice we're assuming that the bond association energy difference as you go

378
00:25:18.981 --> 00:25:23.480
across from methyl ethyl to ice appropriately butyl is due to differences in

379
00:25:23.481 --> 00:25:27.830
radical stability's not the differences in the starting material energy.

380
00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:32.490
Right?
Remember,
it could be either.
Okay.
And the,

381
00:25:32.491 --> 00:25:35.780
the standard explanations are in terms of the radical,

382
00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:39.320
and what I'm going to show you now is that that's not so obvious.

383
00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:45.080
Even though I think it would be interesting for you to look in these various

384
00:25:45.081 --> 00:25:49.940
textbooks that you have at this subject about free radical halogenation.

385
00:25:49.941 --> 00:25:52.760
Every one of them will have a chapter about that,
right?

386
00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:56.210
And see what they say about what the explanation is.

387
00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:58.730
Some of them won't give any explanation at all.

388
00:25:58.731 --> 00:26:01.970
They'll just say more substituted,
radicals are more stable.

389
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:05.450
But those which give an explanation,
we'll give one of these,

390
00:26:05.451 --> 00:26:09.770
but I want to show you that it's not so obvious
that that's true.

391
00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:13.490
If it were true,
uh,

392
00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:17.060
we can test it by checking more examples.

393
00:26:17.061 --> 00:26:18.890
Instead of looking only at hydrogen,

394
00:26:18.891 --> 00:26:21.860
breaking away to give those different radicals,

395
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:25.160
we could break other things away,
break away.

396
00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:28.610
There's not enough data for fluorine,
but chlorine,
bromine,
iodine,

397
00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:30.380
methyl ethyl ice,

398
00:26:30.381 --> 00:26:35.000
appropriate t butyl all can be broken away from these radicals and they all

399
00:26:35.001 --> 00:26:38.990
should show the same phenomenon if it has to do with the stability of the

400
00:26:38.991 --> 00:26:41.750
radicals rather than the starting material.
Okay.

401
00:26:41.751 --> 00:26:44.100
So that's what we're going to do is expand the,

402
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:49.110
the scope of what we're looking at using that table.
So here are,

403
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:52.500
here is our along here and x,

404
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:57.090
we're going to break x away from r and leave the are radical,

405
00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:01.920
okay?
Now what connects be x can be hydrogen.
That's this.

406
00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:04.500
Those are the data we just looked at,
right?

407
00:27:04.501 --> 00:27:08.640
And we explained it in terms of different stability of the radicals that are

408
00:27:08.641 --> 00:27:11.760
being left behind when you pull the hydrogen away,
right?

409
00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:17.130
And here it is.
Here are all the different Al Kiehl's,
right?
Methyl ethyl ice,

410
00:27:17.131 --> 00:27:18.210
appropriate t butyl.

411
00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:23.480
Here's breaking chlorine away is the green one about like the elk hills breaking

412
00:27:23.851 --> 00:27:26.220
bromine away is the red one.
And I didn't.

413
00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:31.490
Now what this shows is that that bonds to Aja dinner much weaker than bonds.

414
00:27:31.621 --> 00:27:36.480
The hydrogen and I had in his forms weaker bonds than bromine,

415
00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:39.360
than chlorine and hydrogen.
Fine.

416
00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:44.880
So that's the,
so hydrogen is stronger than RC.

417
00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.910
RC is about the same as RCL,

418
00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:53.190
but RCL is stronger than our br and ar I as the weakest,
whatever the radical,

419
00:27:53.191 --> 00:27:54.630
you're breaking away.

420
00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.033
<v 2>Okay.</v>

421
00:27:58.190 --> 00:28:02.960
<v 0>Now,
there are some obvious,
uh,
differences here that the fennel,</v>

422
00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:06.590
fennel is the group that's being broken away in the left column here,

423
00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:11.120
it's unusually hard to break away.
And we saw why that was last time.

424
00:28:11.121 --> 00:28:14.000
They have good overlap because you have sp squared,

425
00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:19.190
a CX bonds that have to be broken.
They are the strongest,
whatever x,

426
00:28:19.191 --> 00:28:23.150
you're breaking away,
that's the strongest bond.
And on the far right,

427
00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:27.590
uh,
we see that if you have Allie ill and Benzel,

428
00:28:27.591 --> 00:28:31.850
you get those resonance stabilized radicals and that's no matter what x,

429
00:28:31.851 --> 00:28:34.870
you're breaking away,
that's the best,
right?
Well,

430
00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:39.380
what we want to do is now focus on these ones in the middle and see if we can

431
00:28:39.381 --> 00:28:44.381
understand these ones where the various methyl ethyl ice of purple and t butyl

432
00:28:46.071 --> 00:28:49.660
are the radicals being left behind and see whether the data,

433
00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:54.680
the data as a whole echoes what we saw in hydrogen that more substituted

434
00:28:55.341 --> 00:28:58.400
radicals are more stable.
Okay?

435
00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:03.110
So all of these should be the same.
It'll be in that,
that is,

436
00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:07.160
it's going to be different depending on which add a more pulling away.

437
00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:11.840
But the stability of the relative stability of the radicals as we go across a

438
00:29:11.841 --> 00:29:14.660
given colors should be the same.
If that's the explanation.

439
00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:17.260
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

440
00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:20.830
<v 0>Okay.
So here's one,
we're breaking h off,
right?</v>

441
00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:24.430
And now I've blown up the scale so we can see the variation.

442
00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:26.320
So we're gonna compare it.

443
00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:31.350
These are relative bond association energies taking zero to be methyl right.

444
00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:35.380
So we see that it's four kilocalories,

445
00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:39.940
easier to break Ethel to break hydrogen away from Ethel,
uh,

446
00:29:39.941 --> 00:29:44.200
another,
uh,
two and a fraction to get,
uh,
uh,

447
00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:48.820
ice of propyl and another couple,
uh,
to get a t butyl.

448
00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:51.880
So you could say that the people do say your books.

449
00:29:51.881 --> 00:29:55.930
I guarantee you will say that those radicals as they're more substituted are

450
00:29:55.931 --> 00:29:59.830
more stable.
Okay.
But if it's true,

451
00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:04.420
it should be the same whatever we're breaking away from the radicals.
Okay?

452
00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.870
So what they tend to say,
for example,

453
00:30:07.871 --> 00:30:11.800
the Jones and Fleming book that I mentioned on page four 79,

454
00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:16.030
sp squared sigma bonds to carbon or preferentially stabilize the more

455
00:30:16.031 --> 00:30:18.730
substituted radicals.
Uh,

456
00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:22.470
the CC overlap is more sensitive to hybridization than Ch.

457
00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:26.890
That's what I just told you.
And they also say on page four,
78,
79,

458
00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:27.670
uh,

459
00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:32.590
the probability is there's probably a bit of stabilization from Somo overlapped

460
00:30:32.591 --> 00:30:36.970
with sigma and Sigma Star.
That's what I said last time.
Okay.

461
00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:40.090
Uh,
now let's see.

462
00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:44.380
So if this trend is due to radical stabilization by these two phenomena,

463
00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:48.610
then whatever x we break off,
we should show at the same trend.

464
00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:51.070
So here's when we break t beautiful.

465
00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:55.780
When we break the atom off from t butyl break the tee butyl,
pardon me,

466
00:30:55.990 --> 00:31:00.790
break t butyl away from the various radicals that is break the bond between t

467
00:31:00.791 --> 00:31:04.130
butyl and methyl between t butyl and Ethel.
Between t beautiful,
nice,

468
00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:08.560
approachable,
or between two DB oodles.
And indeed it looks pretty much the same,

469
00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:13.390
right?
Within the error,
probably these are the same trend,
so that looks good.

470
00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:17.800
Okay.
But look at the others,
right?

471
00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.890
If you break these others off,
they don't show,

472
00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:25.900
they show it's always going down,
right?
But not nearly as dramatically.

473
00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:30.760
So it can't be just the difference in stability of methyl ethyl,

474
00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:32.200
[inaudible] and t butyl.

475
00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:36.490
There has to be something in the starting material that's con contributing to

476
00:31:36.491 --> 00:31:39.220
this.
It makes a difference what it is you're breaking away.

477
00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:46.500
Okay,
now we could one t butyl being,
uh,

478
00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:51.100
is in uh,
a new,
uh,
very special compound because it has,

479
00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:55.390
it's so crowded.
So if you put two t boodles together,

480
00:31:55.750 --> 00:32:00.750
it's very crowded and that could make the starting material unstable and

481
00:32:00.851 --> 00:32:02.740
relatively easy to break the bond.

482
00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:09.090
But we can calculate how much unstability there is due to that by using

483
00:32:09.311 --> 00:32:13.300
molecular mechanics as we mentioned at the end last semester.

484
00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.750
So we can calculate strain energy in the starting material,

485
00:32:16.751 --> 00:32:18.370
use it in molecular mechanics.

486
00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:23.920
And this is the amount of strain energy account in two t beautifuls t butyl
tape,

487
00:32:23.921 --> 00:32:28.921
butyl in t butyl with icer propyl in t butyl with Ethel and in t butyl with

488
00:32:29.771 --> 00:32:33.040
methyl.
That's how much strain energy there isn't the starting material.

489
00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:38.530
Let's just look at the one there to see where it comes from.

490
00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:44.090
So here are our two t beautifuls Adjaye's a bonded to one another at with

491
00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:47.870
idealized bond lengths and angles,
right?

492
00:32:47.871 --> 00:32:50.030
And we calculate by molecular mechanics.

493
00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:53.030
If we have normal cc and ch bond distances,

494
00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:58.300
normal angles carbon's how much strain will there be due to things running into

495
00:32:59.211 --> 00:33:03.440
one another?
Because you'll notice if you make a space filling model of that,

496
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:08.150
you can see down the middle it's crunch region.
Okay.

497
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:10.130
Now how big is that?

498
00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:14.810
The van der walls energy calculated for this from these things running together

499
00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:18.560
is 26.9 kilocalories per mole pretty high.

500
00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:22.490
Now of course,
the molecule doesn't have that shape.

501
00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:27.200
It adjusts as we've mentioned last semester to minimize the energy,

502
00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:30.440
right?
So,
uh,

503
00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:35.900
what it does is adjust to that position.

504
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:40.010
So it drops the Vander walls energy from uh,

505
00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:44.210
by 16.8 kilocalories from old down to five,

506
00:33:44.211 --> 00:33:48.770
only 5.2.
That's how it does it by moving the two apart.

507
00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:54.580
But it's at the expense of stretching the bonds and bending the bonds a little

508
00:33:54.921 --> 00:33:57.380
bit to get those hydrogens apart from one another.

509
00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:02.800
So although it started with 109 degree bond angles and 1.5 to angst drums,

510
00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:06.880
it changed like this.
You can see how it moved to,

511
00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:10.400
to get the hydrogens apart,
but there's an expense to pay.

512
00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:15.880
So even though we've gotten down to only 5.2 kilocalories per mole of uh,

513
00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:19.160
of Vanderwal strain,

514
00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:24.320
there's now an increase to 4.8 kilocalories per mole from stretching and

515
00:34:24.321 --> 00:34:25.154
bending.

516
00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:30.340
So the total strain in the in two t boodles bonded together is 12.2 that is 4.8

517
00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:38.710
plus 5.2 plus 2.2 of tortional energy that's in there.

518
00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:42.020
Okay?
So that's where that number comes from.
Okay?

519
00:34:42.021 --> 00:34:46.340
So that's the 12.2 and you can do similar calculations to get these other
values.

520
00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:48.350
Now notice something interesting.

521
00:34:48.351 --> 00:34:52.250
Those are things strain in the starting material,
right?

522
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000
But notice that the range of that from 2.3 to 12.2 is 9.9 so that's as,

523
00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:06.110
that's bigger in fact than the whole range of this difference attributed to

524
00:35:06.111 --> 00:35:09.410
differences in the radicals,
right?

525
00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:11.540
That is in the case of t butyl,

526
00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:16.810
the starting material for t butyl t butyl is strained enough to explain the

527
00:35:17.961 --> 00:35:21.500
entire difference of why it's easy to break t butyl tape,
butyl,

528
00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:25.250
not the radicals,
but the starting material,
right?

529
00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:27.950
And now we can look in the case of methyl,

530
00:35:27.951 --> 00:35:32.390
how much strain was there in the starting material when methyls attached to

531
00:35:32.391 --> 00:35:34.670
these various ours,
right?

532
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:40.260
And what you see is the same that the amount of strain can explain the range of

533
00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:44.460
difference in Bond Association energies without saying the radicals are

534
00:35:44.461 --> 00:35:45.294
different at all.

535
00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:48.050
<v 2>Okay,</v>

536
00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:52.190
<v 0>so for x equals Al Keel,
methyl ethyl eyes,
appropriate t butyl,</v>

537
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:56.900
almost all of that.
Pardon me?
For the x,
that's breaking away bead methyl,

538
00:35:56.901 --> 00:35:58.670
ethyl ice appropriately t butyl.

539
00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:03.110
Almost all of the change is due to strain energy and the starting material,

540
00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:08.730
but not in the case of HR.
Because in the case of HR,

541
00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:12.520
there's very little strain in the starting material,
right?

542
00:36:12.521 --> 00:36:16.390
So there's something different going on with HR,
it's not typical,

543
00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:17.923
<v 2>right?</v>

544
00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:23.670
<v 0>So as far as I know,
no one really understands this,
why it is that way.</v>

545
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:25.890
Okay.
Now here we've,

546
00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:30.950
we've done another plot where we correct for the rx strain that is subtract out

547
00:36:31.531 --> 00:36:34.860
that strain in the starting material and then see how different they would be.

548
00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:38.160
And you'll see there's hardly any difference at all as you go from methyl ethyl

549
00:36:38.161 --> 00:36:39.810
ice.
Appropriate TB would all radicals,

550
00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:42.413
<v 2>right?</v>

551
00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:47.340
<v 0>So this,
this is an alternative to the hypothesis that radical stabilization by</v>

552
00:36:47.341 --> 00:36:51.330
substitution of methyls for hydrogens,
more substituted,

553
00:36:51.331 --> 00:36:55.110
radicals are more stable,
which I guarantee you is what your books will say.

554
00:36:55.111 --> 00:36:56.400
Whatever book you're looking at.

555
00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.870
<v 2>Okay,</v>

556
00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:02.010
<v 0>so the intrinsic cc bond strength corrected for strain is practically</v>

557
00:37:02.011 --> 00:37:06.630
insensitive to the substitution of the radicals.
But if you have ch bonds,

558
00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:10.770
they are indeed weakened by alkylation of the carbon.

559
00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:15.060
But no one understands it.
And on the other hand,

560
00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:19.770
if you have chlorine,
chlorine,
or bromine,
they go the other way.
And again,

561
00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:23.760
nobody understands it.
No one,
I know at least understands this,

562
00:37:23.761 --> 00:37:25.470
but the textbook seem to be wrong.

563
00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:29.820
So a word to the wise as you look at your different textbooks,

564
00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:34.770
okay,
now that's what we're going to say about bond energies.
Now,

565
00:37:34.771 --> 00:37:39.771
how could we predict activation energies when you're not just breaking a bond

566
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:43.890
but making a new bond that you break the old bond,
right?

567
00:37:43.891 --> 00:37:45.210
What energy should that have?

568
00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:49.050
Can we use the energies of stable structures,

569
00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:52.610
ones that we understand to the extent we,
uh,
we,

570
00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:56.130
it's clear that we don't really understand things perfectly.
Uh,

571
00:37:56.220 --> 00:38:00.630
can we infer the energies of transition states so we're able to predict

572
00:38:00.631 --> 00:38:03.270
reactivity?
For example,

573
00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:08.520
might exothermic reactions be faster than endothermic ones right now,

574
00:38:10.291 --> 00:38:11.460
let me take this,
uh,

575
00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:16.050
where the someplace I'd dropped my prop.

576
00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.430
Is there a green thing over there?

577
00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:19.503
<v 2>Wow.</v>

578
00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:24.890
<v 0>Okay.
You'll have to imagine my green thing that I thought I brought along.
It's,</v>

579
00:38:24.891 --> 00:38:29.270
I had a,
a strip,
the packing strip that comes around.
Big thing,

580
00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:32.660
big shipments.
So it's,
it's a piece of like wire.
Okay.

581
00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:36.640
So imagine that there's a wire between my hands and I'm holding it so that it

582
00:38:36.641 --> 00:38:39.580
goes like this.
Okay.

583
00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:44.680
So it's like a reaction coordinate,
right.
What I'm showing you is an,

584
00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:48.010
is an endothermic reaction.
You start here,

585
00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:51.640
you go over a barrier and you get the product right.

586
00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:55.810
Or if I lower the product,
right,

587
00:38:56.230 --> 00:39:00.130
it now looks like this,
you'd got that in your mind's eye,

588
00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:05.710
right?
So I can go back and forth knowing the energy difference between starting

589
00:39:05.711 --> 00:39:08.370
material and product.
I have some idea what,

590
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:13.030
where the activation energy might look like.
Of course this is really nonsense.

591
00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:17.650
The activation energy isn't a strip of packing strip like that.
Okay.

592
00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:19.810
But we can think of it that way.

593
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:26.190
And if that were so then you notice that an endothermic reaction would have a

594
00:39:26.441 --> 00:39:28.690
high transition state,
right?

595
00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:33.550
But an exothermic reaction would have a low transition state,
right?

596
00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:38.050
So we could go from a knowledge of the starting material on their products to

597
00:39:38.051 --> 00:39:41.140
infer something about what the activation energy was.

598
00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:46.330
As long as we're looking at reactions that are very,
very similar to one another.

599
00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:49.990
So they would have the same kind of strip.
Okay.

600
00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:55.570
So we're going to see if we can use that to understand something to predict

601
00:39:55.571 --> 00:39:59.350
things about free radical.
They can break.

602
00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:08.860
So we were not going to try to do absolute energies like this.

603
00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:12.280
That's way too hard.
Right?

604
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:15.340
But we'll hope we can at least do relative energies.

605
00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:17.920
If we look at analogous reactions.

606
00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:24.430
So how can we predict activation energy?
It's no easy task.
Opera Aore,

607
00:40:24.431 --> 00:40:28.120
especially when interaction with the solvent is important,
right?

608
00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:33.400
But often you can say something sensible about relative values of the activation

609
00:40:33.401 --> 00:40:36.430
energy or the free energy of activation.

610
00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:40.360
It's a question of compared to what you want to compare.

611
00:40:40.361 --> 00:40:44.050
Two things that are very close to one another.
Okay?

612
00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:49.060
Now this is related to what's called the Hammond postulate.
A George Hammond,

613
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:51.980
who incidentally was also a,
uh,

614
00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:55.810
was a student of Professor Bartlett who's your chemical grandfather.

615
00:40:55.811 --> 00:40:58.070
As we talked about last time,
uh,

616
00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:03.150
in 1955 formulated something that has become called the Hammond postulate.

617
00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:08.380
And what he actually said was if two states,
for example,

618
00:41:08.381 --> 00:41:13.381
a transition state and an unstable intermediate occur consecutively during the

619
00:41:13.481 --> 00:41:17.080
reaction process and have nearly the same energy content,

620
00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:22.240
they're inter conversion will involve only a small reorganization of molecular

621
00:41:22.241 --> 00:41:25.030
structures.
Here's my,
I found my prop here.

622
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:29.050
Okay,
so here's,

623
00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:36.410
here's an exothermic reaction.
Here's an endothermic reaction.

624
00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:37.453
Okay.

625
00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:42.050
Now notice that the transition state and the product are very near one another

626
00:41:42.051 --> 00:41:44.240
in energy in this case,
right?

627
00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:49.610
But they're also near one another instructor from here to here.

628
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:53.480
Right.
Whereas if it were an exothermic reaction,

629
00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:57.350
the transition state is very different from the product.

630
00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:02.180
It's like the starting material and it's very near and structure to the starting

631
00:42:02.181 --> 00:42:06.230
material.
Okay.
It's a little bit crummy,

632
00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:09.230
but I think you've got the idea.
Okay,

633
00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:14.420
so that whether that's what you would read into this necessarily,

634
00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:15.313
I don't know.

635
00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:20.890
But what is clear is that this stimulated organic chemists to begin thinking

636
00:42:21.711 --> 00:42:26.711
about transition states and to try to generalize plausibly about reaction

637
00:42:28.311 --> 00:42:32.870
coordinates,
how you might infer from starting material on product energies,

638
00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:37.490
the kind of molecules we know about to these transition states when one bond is

639
00:42:37.491 --> 00:42:39.650
being made in another broken,
for example,

640
00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:42.740
which is very difficult to to reason about.

641
00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:47.120
So here's another picture of the same thing.

642
00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:49.730
The more exothermic or reaction,

643
00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:53.210
the more similar the transition state to the starting material,

644
00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:56.900
both in energy and instructure.
So here's the starting material.

645
00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:59.870
Here's the transition state.
When it's very exothermic,

646
00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:03.110
it's close to the starting material and energy.

647
00:43:03.111 --> 00:43:06.200
It's close to the starting material and structure,
right?

648
00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:12.170
Okay.
If it's more,
if it's not very exothermic,

649
00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:17.060
then the transition stage is sort of halfway along and considerably above the

650
00:43:17.061 --> 00:43:22.010
starting material and energy.
Right?
And if it's endothermic,

651
00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:27.290
it's very,
it's,
it's near the product in energy and instructor.
Right?

652
00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:32.590
So that,
uh,
so that the,
uh,
the reaction is then,
uh,

653
00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:34.730
and the reaction is slow because of,

654
00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:38.630
because of the transition state is so much higher.
Okay.

655
00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:43.670
Now this will at least we can be fairly confident of this at least if we're

656
00:43:43.671 --> 00:43:47.180
looking at similar,
very similar reactions.
For example,

657
00:43:47.181 --> 00:43:48.500
the ones we're talking about,

658
00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:52.550
if you have an x radical come up and take him away from our,

659
00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:56.000
but we very x or we vary,

660
00:43:56.001 --> 00:44:00.860
are to make the reaction more or less exothermic,
right?

661
00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:04.460
Then we might be able to use this kind of,
of,
uh,

662
00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:08.570
of reasoning to get from one to another.
Knowing one,

663
00:44:08.571 --> 00:44:09.710
we can predict another.

664
00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:15.220
Now there's likely a continuum between starting material and product with

665
00:44:15.711 --> 00:44:19.550
respect to factors that influence the ability.
For example,

666
00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:21.170
resonance stabilization.

667
00:44:21.171 --> 00:44:26.150
You remember the allyl radical and the Benzel radical are especially stable

668
00:44:26.151 --> 00:44:29.300
because they have resonance stabilization.

669
00:44:29.301 --> 00:44:33.240
The sobo mixing with Pi and Pi Star.
Okay?

670
00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:36.990
So if we're,
if we're talking relative to,

671
00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:41.910
to just a regular old al group methyl.
So we're going to hear methane.

672
00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:44.190
Methane goes to methyl radical.

673
00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:49.310
So we make those by definition the same cause we're gonna compare relative what

674
00:44:50.071 --> 00:44:52.260
happens if we have bins,
uh,

675
00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:55.530
Benzel with hydrogen on it and the Benzel radical.

676
00:44:55.830 --> 00:45:00.000
And we see that the Benzel radical is more stable because when you get here,

677
00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:04.140
you have this resonance stabilization.
Okay?

678
00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:09.650
And this idea that there's a continuum is that the further the transition state

679
00:45:10.381 --> 00:45:15.060
is along,
the more it will experience that special stabilization.

680
00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:17.680
<v 2>Okay?</v>

681
00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:22.240
<v 0>So if the transition stage when this bond is partly broken because x is taking</v>

682
00:45:22.241 --> 00:45:26.500
Hoa,
if it were a late transition state like that,

683
00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:31.300
right?
And endothermic process than it should have a late,

684
00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:33.250
if it's a late transition state,

685
00:45:33.251 --> 00:45:36.550
it should have pretty much stabilization by resonance.

686
00:45:37.210 --> 00:45:42.210
But if it's an exothermic reaction and it's a very early transition state than

687
00:45:42.641 --> 00:45:44.680
it shouldn't have much of this,
right?

688
00:45:44.681 --> 00:45:48.790
So the idea is that you're going to have a steady increase of this.

689
00:45:48.791 --> 00:45:52.650
It might not be quite as straight line,
but at least it's steadily going down.

690
00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:55.113
<v 2>Okay.</v>

691
00:45:56.600 --> 00:46:01.600
<v 0>So the rate of the slower reaction should be more sensitive to the overall</v>

692
00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:06.200
difference in,
in,
uh,
free energy.
That is,

693
00:46:06.201 --> 00:46:10.220
if you have a very fast reaction and you move this up and down,

694
00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:13.700
change the exothermic city,
Delta g by quite a bit,

695
00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:15.500
you hardly move that at all.

696
00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:19.880
But if it's an endothermic reaction and you move this up and down,

697
00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:21.890
this will move up and down almost as much.

698
00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:25.790
So the reaction becomes less sensitive to the,

699
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:30.910
to the Delta g when you have an exothermic reaction because it happens so near

700
00:46:31.971 --> 00:46:33.020
the starting material.

701
00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:39.400
So this gives rise to what's called the reactivity selectivity principle.

702
00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:44.240
So here's an exothermic reaction.
Here's an endothermic reaction.

703
00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:47.570
It could be pulling h off from our,

704
00:46:47.571 --> 00:46:51.320
by of certain are by chlorine or by bromine,
right?

705
00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:53.390
So it could look like this.

706
00:46:53.391 --> 00:46:57.470
So this would be more reactive and that would be less reactive,

707
00:46:57.830 --> 00:46:59.300
higher activation energy.

708
00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:03.980
But consider a similar pair of reactions where you're pulling the Hoa from a

709
00:47:03.981 --> 00:47:08.450
different R and r whose bond is easier to break,

710
00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:10.190
right?

711
00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:15.080
So the radical here is more stable at least compared to the starting material.

712
00:47:15.081 --> 00:47:18.290
It may in fact be the starting materials that are different as we were talking

713
00:47:18.291 --> 00:47:22.700
about.
But so you have a certain difference here.
It's the same difference here.

714
00:47:22.701 --> 00:47:24.140
You're generated going from the same,

715
00:47:24.141 --> 00:47:26.630
starting at the same starting material to the same radical.

716
00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:30.070
It's just that in this case,
you're using bromine to pull it off.
In this case,

717
00:47:30.071 --> 00:47:31.330
you're using chlorine.

718
00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:37.170
So notice that in this stage it's not selective because no matter which of the

719
00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:40.360
compounds of the blue rh or the red rh,

720
00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:43.210
no matter which h you're pulling off with the chlorine,

721
00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:48.280
they have almost exactly the same energy activation energy,
the same rate,

722
00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:52.810
right?
But here in the case of bromine,
it's going to be more selective,

723
00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:54.310
right?

724
00:47:54.310 --> 00:47:58.720
Because you're going to have a bigger a difference because it's further along.

725
00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:04.300
And I'll stop now and we'll pick up here next time on this reactivity.

726
00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:05.980
See like activity principle,

727
00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:09.880
the idea that the less reactive it is,

728
00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:12.640
the more selective it will be.
Thanks.
