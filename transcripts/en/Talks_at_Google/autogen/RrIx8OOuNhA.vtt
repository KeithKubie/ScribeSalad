[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.897 --> 00:00:07.480
SHIRIN NESHAT:
Actually unusual for me

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.140
to talk to people who
barely know me and my work,

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.640
but also be given five minutes
to summarize my entire career

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.710
and then have a conversation.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.560
But it's actually more
interesting to talk

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.740
to people who don't know
anything about my work.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.580
But as you explained,
I am Iranian

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.750
born but I have lived in the
US, I think, now longer than

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.299
in my own country.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:35.530
And the first body
of work that I

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.700
made after being proven
to be a terrible painter

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.170
was photography.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.760
And actually, I'm
not a photographer.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.700
I don't even own a camera.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.660
I actually hire photographers.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.990
I direct the photography and
then I deal with the process

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.100
after.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.560
But I'm just going to-- since
I want to speak very little

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.780
and have a conversation, the
first serious body of my work

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.500
after 10 years of not
working at all at art

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.410
was a group of work
called "Woman of Allah."

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.410
And this is basically
a series of photographs

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.700
that I did that sort of really
focus on the Islamic Revolution

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.570
in 1979 and the role
of women in militancy

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.120
during the Islamic Revolution.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.700
And the whole concept of
martyrdom and the idea

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.150
of being a martyr
and what it meant

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.660
in terms of being in
this intersection of love

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.950
of God, and yet cruelty
and violence and death.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.950
And for most of
those photographs,

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.700
I pose myself and I
photographed friends.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.450
And this photography
continued later on,

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.800
after I made many movies, into
this book, a series called

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.230
"The Book of Kings," which
was like over 10 years later.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:00.660
And it really was about the
2009 Green movement in Iran.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.000
It was more than
10 years, far more.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.760
But again, it captures
another pivotal moment

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.690
in Iranian history.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.180
If the first one was
the Islamic Revolution,

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.360
this shows a more
modern Iranian society,

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.640
but still battling
with people who

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.290
are fighting against tyranny
and political oppression,

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.840
et cetera.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.050
So this body of work was about,
I don't know, 65 photographs.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.170
I'm going rather quickly.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.880
But what you'll see constantly
is the female body--

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.980
I mean, the male
and female body--

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.020
being a very significant
part of my photographs.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.830
And always this
inscription of text

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.150
that were poetry
by people of Iran.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.870
And so now I'm going,
again, quickly.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.430
This is another
body of work that I

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.540
did in Egypt, which was
immediately after the Arab

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.500
Spring, that sort of captured
the notion of patriotism

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.140
and the euphoria
around the revolutions

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.510
that we experienced all
over the Middle East,

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.960
yet the terrible
aftermath, which was

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.840
a lot of genocide and death.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.580
The big group of photographs
I created in 2015

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.930
and '16 was in Azerbaijan,
which previously

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.010
was a part of my own country,
called "The Home of My Eyes."

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.740
And in this series, I
basically acted more

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.300
like a documentary artist.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.590
I photographed the local
people, as Azerbaijan

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.690
being a place of
mixed ethnicities,

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.850
from Turks, Armenians,
Persians, and Russians.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.830
But all of the people
that I photographed

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.840
had common hand
postures that were

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.260
very similar to the Christian
paintings, the El Greco's

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.250
paintings.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.940
And the theme being the idea of
home, or the absence of home,

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.157
and what meant to these people.

00:03:51.157 --> 00:03:53.740
There are literally inscriptions
written all over their bodies

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.340
that are the transcripts of the
interviews that I conducted.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.800
I make a lot of videos.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.990
I've been active in
media, video since 1998.

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.620
This was my breakthrough
into the art world

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.050
with video, which won the
Golden Lion in Venice biennial.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.440
But again, it was literally
taking the aesthetics

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.660
of my photographs
but having it move

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.960
and now having music
and choreography

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.290
and a story that had a
beginning, middle, and the end.

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.800
This is another piece,
"Fervor," which again, it became

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.390
a little bit more narrative.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.690
But as you can see,
they are highly stylized

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.810
and very fictionalized.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.920
And these were all
shot in Morocco.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.550
So by now I began to shoot
videos and films outside of US,

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.380
mostly in Morocco, in Egypt,
in Turkey, in different places.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.980
So these are examples.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:51.550
That's it.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:52.650
OK.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.780
And so the next thing I wanted
to share with you is that since

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.740
2000-- no, since 2002--

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.170
I've been busy
making feature films.

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.780
I made a film called "Woman
Without Men." that was

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.010
based on a magic realist novel.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.880
That won the Silver Lion
award in Venice Film Festival.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.410
That took six years.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.630
And I just completed
this new film,

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.410
"Looking for Oum Kulthum,"
that we will show some clips.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.160
But that was based on an
Egyptian singer in Egypt.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.870
And I spent 12 years
making two feature films.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.610
And I also did an opera.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.210
So that said, we go right
to the conversation.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.550
SPEAKER: Being an Iranian
female living in New York,

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.710
this informs a lot of your work.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.450
You've lived in
exile, basically,

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:39.950
in the United States.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.470
Can you talk about what it
was like to have that happen,

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.260
and what your return
to Iran was like,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.210
given that that was
sort of the starting

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.945
point of all of your work?

00:05:48.945 --> 00:05:51.110
SHIRIN NESHAT: Well, at
the time when I grew up,

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.594
there was a lot of
Iranian families

00:05:53.594 --> 00:05:55.010
were sending their
children abroad

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:58.320
to study because
lack of, you know,

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.320
situations, colleges,
universities.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.360
And so we were all sent out.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.920
But we didn't predict
the revolution.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.260
And at that time, my father sent
me and my sisters and brothers.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.410
And they all went back.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.160
And I happened to be in the US
when the revolution happened.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.930
And so unfortunately at
that time, I was very young.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.060
I came and I was 17.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.750
And the revolution
happened, I was in college.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.640
Actually, I was at UC Berkeley.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.010
And immediately
after the revolution,

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.280
they took over the
American embassy in Iran.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.420
The hostages were taken.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.860
So there was an incredibly
strong anti-American sentiment.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.430
So I found myself alone in a
country without financial help

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.940
and without the loving
family around me.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.390
But also, against the
war, politically, as there

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.910
was a strong reaction.

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.600
So I didn't see them, not for
the 20 years, but 11 years

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.020
I didn't go back.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.140
And eventually when I went
back, I started to make art.

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.210
And then the country,
the government,

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.280
found my work problematic.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.869
And then since 1996,
I have not been back.

00:07:11.869 --> 00:07:12.410
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:14.420
And I think that
sort of leads us in,

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.250
when you said the government
found your work problematic,

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.550
your work is highly political.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:23.730
And you often talk about
having a social responsibility.

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.160
So I was wondering
if you can talk

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.010
about the idea of being
the voice of a country

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:31.310
that you haven't lived
in in a very long time?

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.580
SHIRIN NESHAT: You know you
don't have the possibility

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.320
to distance yourself from
the political reality.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.100
And the political
consciousness is

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.540
something that is not a choice.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.200
And I think that's difficult
for Americans to understand,

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.970
that if your everyday life
is defined by this and that--

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.890
for example, this
recent breakdown--

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:54.950
again, the exit of America
from the nuclear deal,

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.950
it's a huge issue for my
family in Iran, for me

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:01.030
and the future of
us as immigrants.

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:04.670
So I think the work
is a manifestation,

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:09.260
is kind of artistic reflection
on the political reality.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.480
But it's not a propaganda.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:16.280
It is rather a kind of
a fictional work that

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.340
somehow tries to shed
light on the complexity

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:20.370
of the situation.

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:23.750
And so I don't see myself
as the voice of the country,

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:28.610
but the fact that my work
has properties in the way

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:30.710
that it communicates
about the people

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.690
and to the people of Iran.

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:36.080
SPEAKER: Well, you've
made photographs.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.640
You've made short films.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.650
You've made feature
length films.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:41.120
Can you talk about
how your process

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:45.770
changes between each medium?

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:48.590
SHIRIN NESHAT: I think that
this kind of nomadic behavior

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:50.930
is a little bit
about my personality

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:56.930
because I'm extremely restless
and nervous, and always living

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:58.760
in a very nomadic lifestyle.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.770
I'm never anywhere
for very long.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:03.110
People like me, I
think a lot of us

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:06.740
are like that, and
that we tend to learn

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.740
very quickly new places,
new languages, new food,

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.190
new environment.

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:12.620
It's just a way of life.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:16.970
So we're not really fixed
at any place, any situation.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:19.910
And so somehow I feel like
this lifestyle has also

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:22.700
been my relationship
to the mediums,

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.930
that I'm not really
faithful to anything.

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:26.950
I'm not really good at anything.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:28.080
And I haven't been--

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.080
SPEAKER: We think
you're good at things.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.913
SHIRIN NESHAT: Well,
I'm not educated in it.

00:09:30.913 --> 00:09:32.870
But I spend a lot of time.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.480
Like I said, I spent
six years making a film.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.990
So I spend a lot of time
studying whatever I'm doing.

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:42.710
But I give myself the
license to feel adventurous

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:46.730
and also to struggle
and be on that edge

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:49.570
because I feel like by
embracing a new medium,

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:52.130
you're re-inventing yourself.

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:55.670
And that's often keeping
yourself excited as an artist,

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:59.720
as a human being, that even as
you get old, you feel young.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.440
And you fail.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:05.490
And I think that's been
my nature as a person.

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:08.350
And I think, in a way, it
informs the way I work.

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:14.050
SPEAKER: What's the process
over six years of making a film?

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:15.633
SHIRIN NESHAT: Well,
I do other things

00:10:15.633 --> 00:10:18.580
as well because I have to
also survive as an artist.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.310
I do exhibitions.

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:22.960
The process of the film has
been, first of all, script

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:26.100
writing, and then finding
the right producers,

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.310
then finding the money,
location scouting,

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:32.760
and actually casting, et cetera.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.700
And I think the
two films have been

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.690
the most painful
experiences I've ever had,

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:42.780
worst than giving
birth to a child.

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.180
But the point is that
at the end of it,

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.760
I feel like is a
great accomplishment.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.580
But in some ways, I think
every frame of the film

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.520
becomes a photograph.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.940
And every few minutes
becomes a video installation,

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:58.800
and that also you are
able to communicate

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:03.270
to a larger audience that are
not just gallery museum goers.

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:05.910
And you are really
thinking about the masses

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:06.960
and the general public.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.180
And I think that gives
me a great pleasure.

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.080
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.670
So I think that's
a good point for us

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:14.970
to turn to "Looking
for Oum Kulthum,"

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:18.510
which is your most recent film
project, one of these projects

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:21.780
that has taken a very
long time to complete.

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.750
Its a movie within a movie.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:26.880
Its about a Persian
director's attempts

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.660
to film the life and legacy
of the Egyptian singer Oum

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.550
Kulthum.

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:36.780
Can you give us a little
bit of the back story

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.790
about how you
discovered her, or why

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.804
she was so fascinating to you?

00:11:40.804 --> 00:11:42.220
SHIRIN NESHAT:
Well, first of all,

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.520
I have to say that even
though my work looks very

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.730
sociopolitical on the surface,
there's always something

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.240
very personal about the work.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.200
It's always been about my
experience, my perspective--

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.020
not my experience, but
the way I view things,

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:56.940
the way I frame my questions.

00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:01.710
And so it has this
very personal approach.

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:04.020
With "Looking for Oum Kulthum,"

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:07.290
Oum Kulthum is the biggest,
the most important artist

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:10.010
of the 20th century in the
Middle East, without a doubt.

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:12.330
Happened to be a woman,
happened to be gay,

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:13.680
happened to be nontraditional.

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.540
She never got married.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.070
She never had children.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:20.820
And yet she is loved by men, by
women, the Sunnis, the Shias,

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:26.670
secular, non-secular, and from
Israel to Saudi Arabia to Iran

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:29.280
to-- it's an amazing phenomenon.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:33.610
And so this film is about an
Iranian woman artist living

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:38.940
in exile questioning the
success of an iconic artist

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:43.290
from the Middle East, and
really facing the question of,

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:47.290
how can we as woman
become successful?

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:51.220
And does this mean that we have
to sacrifice personal lives

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:55.710
and issues that are deeply
traditional expectations

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:57.450
from a woman?

00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:59.120
And so this woman--

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.570
myself, I had a child,
but single mother--

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:06.120
and so how do you navigate
between romantic life

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:10.660
and traditional role as mothers,
but yet pursue your passion

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:13.600
and pursue your career
and be successful?

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.860
So it's really a
question of a smaller

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:18.360
artist to an iconic artist.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.970
And of course, this
script was impossible.

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:26.230
And so if you go in and
out of a period film

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:28.440
to the film behind that--

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.780
and highly controversial
because she

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:33.680
is the biggest artist of Egypt.

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.790
So it's been showing
in the Arab world,

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:37.491
and interesting reactions.

00:13:37.491 --> 00:13:39.240
SPEAKER: That's actually
one of the things

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.250
we wanted to ask you
about is, how was it

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:44.277
perceived in Egypt and in Iran?

00:13:44.277 --> 00:13:46.110
SHIRIN NESHAT: Well,
the Iranians are upset.

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:49.894
They say, why can't you
find an iconic woman singer?

00:13:49.894 --> 00:13:51.810
Why do you have to go
to Egypt because there's

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:56.240
no Iranian artists that's
ever reached that popularity?

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.840
And I needed a break from Iran.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.700
But I think with the
Egyptians, it's been really--

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.320
at the beginning,
they were like, what?

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.120
You?

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.800
I mean, not even
Egyptians have dared

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.320
to make a film about
her because she's

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.780
too sacred and untouchable.

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.670
And some people say,
in fact, maybe this

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:16.710
was the best way to
approach it, as a film

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:20.400
inside of a film because we
were very honest about this,

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.420
that this is an attempt.

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:24.570
This is the vision
of an Iranian artist.

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:26.070
This is not a documentary.

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:28.050
This is not a biopic.

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:29.730
This is not exactly the story.

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:31.170
But this is the
way this woman is

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:33.930
struggling to tell the story.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:36.110
And I went with the
film to Tunisia.

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:39.000
It opened in Egypt, in Lebanon.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.590
It's opening in Morocco.

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:43.580
And of course, in a small scale.

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:47.940
But it's interesting that the
film is finding its audience.

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.460
And I think it is
not ever a film that

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:51.980
would have a huge audience.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.620
And it is not targeting
a commercial audience.

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:58.070
But I think it's
something that would last.

00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:01.570
It would have a life
longer because it's really

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:03.300
an artistic project.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:06.660
It's not meant to
be anything that you

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:09.370
will see in Union Square.

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:12.010
What do you call
the movie theater?

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:13.246
SPEAKER: Regal Cinema.

00:15:13.246 --> 00:15:15.120
SHIRIN NESHAT: Yeah, if
it's lucky somewhere.

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.765
SPEAKER: You did take
it to Toronto, though.

00:15:16.765 --> 00:15:17.370
Out to the film festival.

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:18.536
SHIRIN NESHAT: Yeah, Venice.

00:15:18.536 --> 00:15:22.200
And it will open in MoMA
for a week in July 26.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:26.940
And it will have a week run,
which I'm very happy about.

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:29.240
SPEAKER: So go see it.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.840
What was it like
to sort of take it

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.190
to the Toronto Film Festival?

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:34.080
What was it like?

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.850
You've done a lot
of film festivals.

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:37.900
You've taken things
on the circuit.

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:39.120
How does that work for you?

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.286
SHIRIN NESHAT: I think this
one made me very nervous

00:15:41.286 --> 00:15:43.930
because first of all, second
film is always very difficult.

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:46.800
So it was an Arab story.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:47.640
And I'm not Arab.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:50.220
So a lot of the
audience often are Arab.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.680
And then you're
like, oh, are they

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.320
going to throw tomatoes at me?

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:59.220
And also that is a
very artistic film.

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.740
So you always have in the mix.

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:01.910
It's always sold out.

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:06.890
The screenings are full because
people love her and everything.

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:11.460
And it's always a great mix
of receptions and critics

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:17.300
who don't like it, who like it,
absolutely don't relate to it,

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:18.655
to those who appreciate it.

00:16:18.655 --> 00:16:21.000
So like everything
I've done, it's never,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.240
ever like praise
completely or destroyed.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.730
But I'm still going on fine.

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:27.940
So it's a mix.

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:31.440
But I think slowly it's
finding its audience.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:35.610
SPEAKER: And in terms of the
story and the main character,

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:38.070
the film seems to have
some reflection of you

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:41.190
in terms of it's
a female director.

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:47.640
She encounters some push
back from being a female,

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.140
from being Persian.

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:51.954
Is this personal?

00:16:51.954 --> 00:16:53.620
SHIRIN NESHAT: It's
about my experience.

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:57.930
It's about my own
struggles to make

00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:00.180
this film, my own shortcomings.

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:02.380
Even the script we
wrote is problematic.

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:03.840
It's not a perfect script.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.740
And this woman also
struggles with the script.

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.640
It is just impossible
to know how

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:13.560
to go under the skin of this
incredible, incredible woman

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:15.369
that was a myth, you know.

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:16.530
It was not even a human.

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:20.339
And she actually wanted
to remain as an image.

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:23.520
So what I asked for
was an impossible task

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:29.440
to devour and demystify a
myth that was just impossible.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:32.630
So in this film, I tried
to be really honest about,

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:36.510
I chose a very difficult
subject and I didn't completely

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:38.400
succeed.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.890
But what did I learn
about this from her?

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:42.120
And what was the angle?

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.430
What was the obsession about?

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:47.550
And I think then when
you get very intimate

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:51.030
about the process, there's
honesty about the film

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:55.500
that if you are
that kind of person,

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.860
you understand this film by no
means tried to be pretentious

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.690
or trying to
compare me with her,

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:05.340
but really showing the
artistic practice involving

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:10.830
a lot of struggles and failures
of an artist, but also doubts.

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:13.080
And I think that's something
that we don't give credit

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:17.610
to the artist, that the
process, it's often painful.

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:21.230
And it involves taking risk
and that doesn't always

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:22.890
succeed in a positive way.

00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:25.030
But that is part of the process.

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:27.330
And that's all I tried to show.

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:31.140
And even the film as at the
final, it's not a perfect film.

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:32.850
And I'm the first one to say it.

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:36.840
But I think that's
what it was all about.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.450
SPEAKER: What do you think
is so imperfect about it?

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:40.950
SHIRIN NESHAT: The
script, I think.

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:45.390
Because again, the
way that we try

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:49.200
to navigate between different
periods and the story

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:53.550
of the Iranian woman versus
the story of this iconic artist

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:56.550
and how to balance everything
between the political reality

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:59.130
when she lived, her
own political reality

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:02.940
as a woman in exile, there's
a lot of information.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.970
There's a lot of
metaphorical meanings

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:11.170
that we wanted to weave
into the story about woman,

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:13.770
about being artists
that are living

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:16.380
within political
reality that affects

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:19.500
their work and their
success and failures,

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.780
and me as an exiled
artist, she as the one

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:25.230
who became very loyal
to the political leaders

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:27.070
in order to stay successful.

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:28.830
So there was just
so much intentions

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:31.860
that we tried to build
into the narrative

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:36.410
that maybe it just
was imperfect.

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:37.800
And I think that's OK.

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:38.970
SPEAKER: It's totally OK.

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:41.280
And I think one of the
things that's interesting

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.730
is obviously this fits
into your larger practice

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:49.800
in terms of an Islamic
female protagonist.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.950
But you often talk about that
you're more interested in form

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:54.630
than you are in the content.

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:57.330
And so I was wondering if you
can talk a little bit about how

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.070
making narrative
film sort of fits

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:02.640
into your larger practice
of photography, of sort

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:06.650
of short, experimental
film, and if you think

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:09.006
you were successful there.

00:20:09.006 --> 00:20:11.630
SHIRIN NESHAT: I'm glad you said
that because very often people

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:14.690
just focus on the theme
because I'm Iranian and I'm--

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:16.760
but in fact, I think
I consider myself

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.730
among some of the
Western, also, artists

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:24.530
who are beginning to break away
from the museum and gallery

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:27.440
walls and try to
experiment with what it's

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.740
like for a visual artist to tell
the story, what kind of form

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:34.040
would it take without
mimicking conventional cinema,

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.620
but also not making
things that are completely

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.210
incomprehensible.

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:40.070
I asked the director
of the opera

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:42.170
last year at Salzburg
Festival, Aida,

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:47.240
with Anna Netrebko and
Riccardo Muti, the conductor,

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.985
what is the nature
of ambitiousness

00:20:49.985 --> 00:20:51.200
and experimentation?

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:55.280
But I think that is
happening more and more.

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:58.680
Both the film festivals,
the music festivals

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:03.440
are really welcoming artists
coming from other mediums

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:06.110
to experimenting with this.

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:10.340
And I have to say
that I do photography,

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:14.730
I do video installations, I do
film, I'm making a new film.

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:18.470
And I still do
performing arts, and not

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:20.930
because I'm good at
all of these things,

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:22.640
because I enjoy the process.

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:26.360
And I think it's
good to give yourself

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:30.860
the goal of being able
not to stay stagnated

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:32.614
within one form of work.

00:21:32.614 --> 00:21:34.280
I could have stayed
with those pictures,

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.321
with writing calligraphy
for the rest of my life,

00:21:36.321 --> 00:21:40.610
make a bundle of money and
make zero money making films.

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:44.420
In fact, I put everything
I have from the photography

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:45.500
into the film.

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:49.280
So it's a kind of stupid because
there's-- money never plays

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.180
in the equation.

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:53.882
And so I think that's
a decision I made.

00:21:53.882 --> 00:21:55.340
SPEAKER: It's a
true labor of love.

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:56.214
SHIRIN NESHAT: It is.

00:21:56.214 --> 00:21:58.240
And I stand behind it.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.686
And I will never be very rich.

00:22:00.686 --> 00:22:02.060
SPEAKER: You
mentioned the opera.

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.444
Something that you said
that I really thought

00:22:04.444 --> 00:22:06.110
was interesting was
you said, "Sometimes

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:10.469
the boundaries between Aida
and myself are blurred."

00:22:10.469 --> 00:22:11.510
What do you mean by that?

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:13.300
What's your
relationship to Aida?

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:17.650
SHIRIN NESHAT: Aida is the
story of an Ethiopian princess

00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:19.240
in exile in Egypt.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:22.040
And the director of
the music festival

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.710
invited me because
Aida, just historically,

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:28.790
has been highly problematic
opera for a lot of Middle

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:34.820
Easterners because it's the most
cliche and orientalist opera.

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:39.530
And that sort of badly
stereotypes the Middle Eastern,

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:42.740
even in the ancient times,
Egypt and Ethiopians,

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:46.610
make them into this
very barbaric--

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:49.640
and then the Westerners
are the glorified--

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:53.600
it's written by an
Italian composer, Verdi.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.550
And so he found it
very interesting

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:57.140
that if I could take this--

00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:59.400
which was a huge task--

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:03.530
this narrative and sort of maybe
a new reinterpretation of it,

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:09.650
that somehow kept the
grandiose of the classical Aida

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:12.860
and didn't compromise
the value of it,

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:17.480
but yet was able to address
the kind of cliche and sort of

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.250
didn't have the
elephants and the horses

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:21.710
and the people painted
black walking--

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:23.090
so I took three years.

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:24.020
And I had to do it.

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:26.810
It's also very controversial.

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:30.200
It was never done in this way.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.200
But it was completely
successful in the way that

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.510
was really highly attended.

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:39.260
But it was also
very controversial.

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.870
SPEAKER: That sounds
like a huge undertaking,

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:44.210
as are a lot of your films
now that you're doing.

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:46.910
You're doing really
elaborate projects.

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:50.840
And I want to turn back a little
bit to your work with film.

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:53.420
One of the films or short
films that you started with

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:54.620
was "Turbulent."

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:58.550
You went to women without men,
that you mentioned before.

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:01.640
What's sort of happening on
your path with film right now?

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.850
And they have this undercurrent,
or at least Turbulent does,

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:06.650
about music.

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:09.020
And you talk about
the power of music.

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:12.760
So you're a visual artist
who is using music.

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:14.690
SHIRIN NESHAT: Yeah, I
mean, I think, again,

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:17.450
because so much of my work
is about the sociopolitical

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:19.670
religious realities,
music brings

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:22.430
with it something very gutteral,
very emotional, something

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:24.380
that doesn't need translation.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:27.210
I think that helps,
in a way, neutralize

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:32.100
some of that political
content of my work.

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:36.260
And because I think my work
is as much about existential,

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:38.810
universal, timeless,
and emotional issues

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:42.200
as it is about today's realities
and political realities.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.540
And I just want
to take this point

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:47.240
and just mention
that another reason

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:52.100
that I go toward a very stylized
or surrealistic narrative--

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:55.730
"Woman without Men" was based
on a magic realist novel--

00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:58.430
and the reason I
feel so comfortable

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:01.940
with dreams and
surrealism is because it

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:04.220
allows you to make
reference to reality,

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:08.230
but yet also stay in another
place that sort of gives you

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:09.460
some space from that.

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:11.429
And at the current
film that I'm working,

00:25:11.429 --> 00:25:13.470
I think is the first time
I really talk about it,

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:14.930
is called "Dreamland."

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:17.200
And it's really,
in a summarize way,

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.540
it's about the
surrealistic novel

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:24.100
that would be shot in the US
about Iranian people spying

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:27.000
on Americans' dreams.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.430
And it's absurd.

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:30.100
It's a political satire.

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:32.800
But it really is,
it's institution,

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:36.160
this kind of Iranian colony
that is the future of Trump

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.200
doing with Iranian people.

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:41.400
I would say refugee camp
full of Iranian people,

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:44.290
but sort of oddly
and ironically, there

00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:46.690
is an institution
within this colony

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:49.990
that it's actually a
room for interpretation

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:52.000
of American people's dreams.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.180
And there's a woman who,
every day, goes on the highway

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:57.470
to a small little American town.

00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:02.320
And her job is secretly she goes
as a census worker door to door

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:05.110
to people's homes,
asking information.

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:08.330
At the end, she says, and
what is your last dream?

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:09.240
People say, dreams?

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.710
Do we have to tell our dreams?

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:13.930
Say, yes, it's part of
the survey for Washington.

00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:15.460
So she's a spy.

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:18.100
But she carries their
photographs and their dreams

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:21.850
back to that colony so they
can interpret the dream.

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:25.720
So my idea, again, of
creating a narrative

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:29.590
that there is symbolically
in an absolutely

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:33.490
absurd and satirical
way it sort of critiques

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:37.425
this tension between two
countries-- the superpower

00:26:37.425 --> 00:26:42.640
who dominates the world
and the fanaticism that

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:46.180
exists in the absurd
Iranian government.

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:49.330
And that the humanity in
between the two parts--

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:53.170
and so this is the
story we're doing.

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:56.820
And I'm hoping we
can shoot it in 2019.

00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:57.550
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:59.190
Well, we look forward
to seeing that.

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:01.940
And there are so many
dichotomies in your work,

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:05.500
including this sort of play
with reality versus sort

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:11.350
of these more magical,
fantastical sort

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:13.750
of aesthetics that you even
bring into "Oum Kulthum."

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:19.510
And there is a sort of tension
between the beauty and also

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:23.770
the undercurrent of what
you're having to say.

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:25.840
SHIRIN NESHAT: I think
you put your finger

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.310
on absolutely the right thing.

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:28.930
Every single thing
I've ever done

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:31.060
is about the notion
of opposites.

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:33.730
The paradoxical
men, women, east,

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:36.580
west, mysticism, and violence.

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:42.310
And "Woman Without Men" was the
orchard in the city of Tehran.

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:44.050
I think that's
the only way I can

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:48.410
think in general about the
good and evil and all of that.

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:51.470
And so I never see
anything in one way.

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:53.740
SPEAKER: You were named
artist of the decade

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:56.270
by "Huffington
Post" at one point.

00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:57.040
That's a big deal.

00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.570
And you've received
a lot of awards

00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:00.069
and you've worked
on so many things.

00:28:00.069 --> 00:28:03.670
And I'm just curious,
at this point,

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:06.790
what accomplishments
are you most proud of

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:08.290
and what are you
looking [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:08.950
SHIRIN NESHAT: It's
interesting, every time

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:12.170
somebody says nice thing about
me, I think, but, really?

00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:17.380
Because I always consider
myself a struggling artist.

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.970
I think it's a
good thing, maybe.

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:24.350
And I everything that I do
is so hard to accomplish.

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:28.010
And we work so hard, like
I work seven days a week.

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:31.550
And so I never see myself
as a success story.

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:34.690
And it always blows my mind when
people say flattering things.

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:38.170
I even criticize my work
more than necessary because,

00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:41.200
not to be humble, but
I just see it that way,

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.700
that it deserves criticism.

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:46.372
So I'm very flattered when
people say nice things.

00:28:46.372 --> 00:28:48.580
SPEAKER: Well, there are a
lot of nice things to say.

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:52.000
I think we should, at
this point, roll the clip.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.744
And then we can
open it up to Q&amp;A.

00:28:54.744 --> 00:28:56.410
AUDIENCE: So I'm
saying, I'm from Egypt.

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:58.820
And growing up, I always heard
about her sexual rendition

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:01.240
as a rumor, not, like,
a confirmed fact.

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.490
So I was wondering what do
you have to say about that,

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:06.097
and whether the movie addresses
the issue at all or not.

00:29:06.097 --> 00:29:06.930
SHIRIN NESHAT: Yeah.

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:09.160
I mean, I'm really
glad you brought

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:12.460
that up because first
of all, every Egyptian

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:18.760
you speak to has a different
explanation or impression

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:21.370
and relationship to Oum Kulthum.

00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:24.670
So what I found, also, about
her sexual orientation,

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:26.570
everyone said
something different.

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:30.730
Some people say she absolutely
was in love with so-and-so.

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:33.910
But she did eventually
marry her doctor.

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:37.390
At the end, when she died,
she was married to him.

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:40.510
And she adopted a son.

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:43.600
And many people say
that she was absolutely

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.940
working with men, but
in love with woman.

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:50.790
And at the beginning we did
a lot of research about that.

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:57.160
And we, indeed, there was a lot
of images and videos of her,

00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.670
really, the time that she
laughed a lot and seemed--

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:03.190
because when she was performing,
she was always very rigid.

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:06.790
The time that she was seem
most relaxed was around woman,

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:08.000
you know.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.032
It seemed like she
really felt comfortable.

00:30:10.032 --> 00:30:11.740
Of course, it happens
for a lot of woman,

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:14.080
just even if you're not gay.

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.900
But I think everything
hinted at the fact

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:20.069
that for her conservative
environment that she lived,

00:30:20.069 --> 00:30:21.610
it was absolutely
out of the question

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:24.100
that she could be open about it.

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:27.610
But also the Egyptians
didn't really wanted

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:31.130
to devour her personal
life in that way,

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:33.090
like the way we do
with celebrities here,

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:35.440
which I really respected.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:39.010
Some people I talked to
said, it didn't matter to us.

00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:40.870
Some people said,
oh, no, she was not.

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:42.830
And some people
say, yes, she was.

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:47.750
But in general, I find that
the status that she reached,

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:50.740
it's wildly different.

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:53.800
You have Michael Jackson
here, I mean, his sexuality--

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:58.510
like, the biggest American
icon as a pop artist.

00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:01.360
But you understand
that he really

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:05.110
was devoured, in the way,
for his celebrity status.

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:08.770
But Oum Kulthum, they
just loved her music.

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:13.420
And it didn't matter if she was
a woman or a man or gay or not.

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:16.690
And that's what I admired
about her and her relationship

00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:20.770
to her audience, that they
didn't destroy her like the way

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:21.370
we do.

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:25.930
You know, Amy Winehouse,
Whitney Houston, Edith Piaf,

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:27.700
Billie Holiday.

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:29.530
Every great artist
that we build up,

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:33.970
we bring down because we
just-- oh, she was very freaky.

00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:38.260
But in reality, like I said,
I've found that she has this

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:43.860
very sacred place that you
just cannot take away from her.

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:47.230
And people were really
the most religious,

00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:50.110
conservative community
just left her alone

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:52.020
because they loved her.

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:55.130
And I think that's so rare.

00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:58.030
And it honestly is something
I took a lot of pride

00:31:58.030 --> 00:32:01.900
that we in the Middle
East have an artist

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:04.010
in that level of
popularity where

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:06.000
four million people went--

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.780
it was one of the
largest funerals

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:11.770
ever in the history of
Egypt, after Nasser, I think.

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:14.440
In America, in the West,
you have never, ever

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:18.130
seen this many people go for,
even for Michael Jackson,

00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:19.180
to a funeral.

00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:22.030
The artist just
never that popular.

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:29.006
And in a way, it didn't
matter her sexuality so much.

00:32:29.006 --> 00:32:31.579
I hope-- long answers.

00:32:31.579 --> 00:32:33.120
SPEAKER: Any other
projects you would

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:35.578
like to tell us about that are
forthcoming beyond the movie

00:32:35.578 --> 00:32:37.950
that will have to wait a
couple of years to see?

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:39.616
SHIRIN NESHAT: Well,
the movie will also

00:32:39.616 --> 00:32:42.540
have that art component and
I'm working on some exhibition

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:43.670
in relation to that.

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:45.175
But it will be confirmed soon.

00:32:45.175 --> 00:32:47.520
So it will be both for
New York and Los Angeles.

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:52.069
So hopefully it
will be out in 2019.

00:32:52.069 --> 00:32:53.610
SPEAKER: Well, we
look forward to it.

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:55.005
SHIRIN NESHAT: But thank you
for spending your lunchtime

00:32:55.005 --> 00:32:55.990
instead of eating.

00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.890
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:32:56.890 --> 00:32:58.390
SHIRIN NESHAT:
Really appreciate it.

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:02.040
[APPLAUSE]
