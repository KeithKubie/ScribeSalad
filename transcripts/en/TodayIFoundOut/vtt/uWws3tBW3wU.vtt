00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:40.280
Standing at a foreboding 8,848 metres (or
29,029 feet) high, Mount Everest is recognised

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.710
as the Earth’s highest mountain.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.690
While Everest isn’t generally considered
to be the most difficult peak to climb (that

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.000
honor probably belongs to either Annapurna
in Nepal or K2 on the China/Pakistan border),

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.979
it is the most famous and, as such, sees the
most people attempting to scale it each year.

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:04.360
But can anyone just show up and start trekking
up the mountain?

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.060
In a word- no.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.970
The first thing you’ll need is to be over
16 on the Nepali side and over 18 on the Tibetan

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.970
side.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.470
The second thing you’ll need if you want
to climb Everest is money- a lot of it.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.520
The exact cost of climbing the mountain varies
wildly depending on a number of factors including

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.780
from which side of the mountain you want to
start, how many people you’re attempting

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.750
to climb with, and what you’re looking for
in terms of support.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.409
A bargain basement cost a non-native could
theoretically get away with would be in the

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.149
range of $20,000-$25,000.

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:43.729
A more realistic price tag would be closer
to $40,000-$60,000 from the Nepal side and

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.590
about $30,000-$40,000 from Tibet.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.400
This covers things like Sherpa guide fees,
oxygen bottles (which cost about $500-ish

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.539
a bottle with a minimum of about 5-6 needed
by most), gear, supplies, travel, performance

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.030
enhancing drugs (about two-thirds of climbers
use these according to Dr. Luanne Freer, founder

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.379
of the “Everest ER”), etc.

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:07.319
If you really wanted to skimp, you could get
away with not using extra oxygen, but this

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:12.160
isn’t recommended as about 40% of the people
who die in the attempt at climbing Everest

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.590
do so trying to do it without oxygen tanks.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.599
This is despite the fact that only about 3%
of all climbers make the attempt without extra

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:20.599
oxygen.

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.560
Further, such an attempt will likely result
in, at minimum, a small amount of brain damage.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.560
In contrast to the penny pinchers, if you
want an ultra-premium package from a given

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.269
guide-organization, including Sherpas to carry
every little thing, meals prepared for you,

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.290
plenty of bandwidth to Skype people back home
as you summit (yes, there is WiFi all the

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.970
way up these days), many oxygen bottles stored
along the way, etc. you can pay as much as

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.930
$200,000+ per person to climb the mountain
in style.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.819
It should be noted, however, that even with
such a package, you’ll still need to be

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.010
in exceptionally good shape and have a great
deal of experience in extreme mountain climbing

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.239
if you want to have a realistic chance at
actually making it to the top.

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.260
On that note, another thing you’ll need
is a permit to climb Everest, which you can

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.499
apply for from either Nepalese or Tibetan
authorities, depending on which side of the

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:13.159
mountain you want to make your attempt on.

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:17.049
As for the cost of these permits, which is
included in the aforementioned price estimates,

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.879
up until recently this was largely dependent
on the size of the group you were planning

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:22.879
to climb with.

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:27.000
For instance on the Nepalese side, a group
of seven people could purchase a permit granting

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.090
them permission to climb for about $10,000
per person.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.439
In contrast, for a person wanting to buy a
permit just for themselves, this used to cost

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:37.609
a staggering $25,000.

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:44.130
However, the Nepalese government recently
slashed the price to $11,000 in 2015 and ceased

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.999
giving any sort of group discount.

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:50.099
This change is meant to discourage people
from traveling in large groups as congestion

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:54.359
at the summit has become a bit of a problem,
with the result occasionally being people

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:59.000
having to abandon their attempt- or try again
the next day if they have the supplies- if

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.960
the wait was too long near the top.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.560
(Note- the permit fee for someone from Nepal
is drastically cheaper at only $750 per climber.)

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.489
As for the less popular Tibetan side, the
permit there will currently cost you $7,000

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:12.769
per person.

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:16.950
The money from these permits goes to the respective
government of the country you’re climbing

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.709
from and is partially spent on maintaining
the various camps on the way to the summit

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.530
and paying the staff who work there.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.550
Said staff are also responsible for cleaning
and maintaining at least parts of the mountain,

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.419
a job that’s exactly as dangerous as it
sounds, with several Sherpas having been killed

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.030
over the years cleaning trash from the mountain’s
higher areas.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.330
One thing that isn’t guaranteed to be collected,
however, is your body if you die too far up.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.160
As such, there are around 200 bodies still
up on the mountain from the near 300 or so

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.700
people who’ve died in the attempt at climbing
Everest in the last century.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.140
green_bootsSome of these bodies at one time
or another functioned as something of additional

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.040
navigation markers, though not to be fully
relied on given they occasionally disappear

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.120
off the path.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.480
For instance, “Green Boots“, an unknown
Indian hiker’s body, marked a certain point

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.980
from 1996 to 2014, at which point the body
disappeared, presumably having been tossed

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.730
over a cliff or the like in the best burial
possible given the circumstances.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.520
The body of American Francys Arsentiev was
removed from the path in this way in 2007,

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.150
nine years after her death.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.510
(More on her exceptionally sad story in the
Bonus Facts below.)

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:32.060
On this note, any group wishing to climb Everest
on the Nepal side also has to pay a $4000

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.009
deposit that is only returned if the individual
returns with their trash.

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:40.150
This fee is meant to discourage people just
throwing their garbage onto the mountain as

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.150
they trek.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.490
This isn’t just a problem with having to
send people up to collect the garbage, but

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.160
also because the mountain is revered as holy
by some Tibetan and Nepali people.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:54.130
But let’s say that you’re an expert climber
who has all the gear, experience, and know-how

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.880
to conquer Everest, but don’t want to pay
for permission to climb it.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.410
What exactly is stopping you from just climbing
it when you please?

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.660
Mainly that it’s a really bad idea on several
points.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.810
First, if caught, you will incur a massive
fine and some legal troubles.

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.330
A second thing to keep in mind is that the
money from permits, along with paying for

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.530
the upkeep of the various camps, also pays
for potential rescue and evacuation teams

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:24.220
who are on standby in the not totally unlikely
event something goes wrong.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.170
Obviously rescue isn’t generally possible
in the higher regions unless someone carries

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:32.090
you down to base camp, but the teams are there
for when an attempt can be made.

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.040
However, the Nepalese government note that
it is under no obligation to rescue those

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.050
who are trespassing on Everest and, as such,
anyone who gets into distress without getting

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:46.220
a permit faces the very real possibility that
no one will bother to come help them.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.440
Further, given that such a trespasser would
likely be attempting to climb the mountain

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.840
with virtually no support (few guides are
willing to take on a non-permitted climber),

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.610
it is entirely likely said individual would
get in life-threatening trouble, regardless

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.230
of how experienced they are.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.440
A third and decidedly less depressing reason
that climbing Everest without a permit is

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.970
a bad idea is that, if you manage to make
it to the top of Everest and then climb back

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:13.420
down without being caught, you won’t be
recognised as having done it.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.880
This may or may not be something you particularly
care about.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.610
Something you will care about, however, is
that there are reports of Sherpas beating

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:24.180
up people they find trying to climb Everest
without a permit.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.650
As one permitted climber who witnessed such
a thing noted,

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.440
I did see the permitless chap being ushered
down the hill.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.690
The Tibetan rope fixers were sent up to get
him.

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:35.650
I saw them bringing him down the ropes from
the North Col to [advanced base camp].

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:36.930
It was disgraceful.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:39.080
They literally kicked him down the ropes.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:43.400
It was a disgusting example of a pack of bullies
egging each other on and literally beating

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.460
him down the hill.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:50.260
It was absolutely unnecessary as he was offering
no resistance and was scared out of his mind.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.140
The Sherpas are not to be trifled with either.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:57.160
In one incident in 2013, a couple climbers,
who reportedly treated a Sherpa more than

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.760
a little disrespectfully, were nearly killed
by a mob of dozens of Sherpa guides at the

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.760
base camp.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:06.450
They were only saved when other climbers intervened
long enough for the pair to make an exceptionally

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.920
dangerous rapid retreat down the mountain.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.540
As one of the climbers stated,

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.500
We got kicks and punches and Ueli got a rock
in the face.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.580
One of the Sherpas pulled a knife on Simone,
but he managed to turn and the knife hit his

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:17.580
hip belt….

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.380
There was a… period where we all thought
we were going to get stoned to death.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:24.880
As to why he thought it happened, said climber
stated, “There’s an underlying feeling

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.900
among the Sherpas that they’ve been treated
quite badly by Westerners and that clients

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.550
don’t have any respect for them.

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:35.320
If you look around at how incredibly luxurious
some base camps are, you can see their point…”

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.750
So to sum up: Can just anyone climb to the
highest peak Earth has to offer?

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.919
Not really, unless you happen to be an adult
in great shape, have a lot of extra cash to

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:47.560
burn, proper documentation, and feel like
giving the Fates a 2%-3% chance to kill you

00:08:47.560 --> 00:09:39.770
within a couple 
week period.

00:09:39.770 --> 00:10:04.610
The 
first 

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:09.240
American woman to technically summit Everest
without the aid of oxygen tanks was the aforementioned

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.330
Francys Arsentiev in 1998.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:16.910
However, she is not credited with the accomplishment
because she didn’t make it back down.

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:20.650
When her husband, Sergei, went back alone
to look for her after he noticed she was missing

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:24.610
from base camp after summitting, he encountered
other climbers who stated they’d encountered

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:27.180
his wife near a dangerously slippery rock
face.

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:31.350
They gave her oxygen, but ultimately had to
abandon her when the oxygen ran low.

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:33.470
Sergei was never seen alive again.

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:38.120
Amazingly, despite being exposed to the elements
near the summit all night, and with no extra

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:42.500
oxygen, the next day Francys was found still
alive, lapsing in and out of consciousness,

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:43.500
begging for help.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.590
The climbers who found her the second time
abandoned their summit attempt and tried to

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:47.590
help her.

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:50.720
However, they were ultimately forced to leave
her behind and return to camp as attempts

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:55.060
at carrying her even a matter of metres were
too exhausting in the thin air.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.130
Efforts to contact base camp for help failed.

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:59.970
The mystery in all of this was what happened
to her husband.

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:04.110
The following year, this puzzle was solved
when Sergei’s body was discovered.

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:08.220
Near where his wife’s body lay on the extremely
dangerous slope, he had slipped and fallen

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:09.220
down the mountain to his death.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.110
The pair were survived by their young son.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:16.190
As mentioned, for the next nine years Francys’
body lay where she died, passed by countless

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:17.190
climbers.

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:21.470
This all changed in 2007 when an expedition,
led by one of those who were forced to abandon

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:23.830
her, set out to “bury” her body.

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:28.050
They were ultimately successful, lowering
her body down off the path where it remains

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:30.590
to this day.

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:34.940
Despite the many deaths that have occurred
on Everest, only around 4% of people who’ve

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:37.730
attempted climbing the mountain have died
in the attempt.

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:42.900
In the last decade, that number has shrunk
to under 2% and the odds are now closer to

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.080
1% if you use oxygen tanks.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:49.230
The reduction in deaths in recent years has
been largely credited to better equipment,

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:53.279
better support as climbing the mountain has
become more commercialized, and improvements

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:57.640
in technology, such as access to the internet
as one makes the ascent, which is particularly

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.990
helpful when monitoring the weather and the
like in real time.

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:22.670
In contrast, the mountains Annapurna and K2
boast death rates of about 25% and 23% respectively.
