00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.160
[inaudible].

2
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:04.721
<v 1>All right,</v>

3
00:00:04.721 --> 00:00:09.721
so we've been talking a bit about the tech component of this grand cultural war

4
00:00:09.971 --> 00:00:12.950
that's going on.
You guys cool that you're,

5
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.340
you're a small company or you're funded on Patrion which were funded on Pedro

6
00:00:17.341 --> 00:00:18.400
and it's pretty awesome.

7
00:00:18.401 --> 00:00:22.750
You have people that voluntarily pay you to support your content and make you

8
00:00:22.751 --> 00:00:26.980
grow.
I know how validating and rewarding it is and all that stuff,

9
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.520
but you find yourself often up against the big boys,
right?

10
00:00:30.521 --> 00:00:33.640
Like bots funded to a hundreds of millions of dollars by different things and

11
00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:35.640
you're being critical of them here.
Yeah.

12
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.770
So it does get me to back to something that I started with before about where

13
00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:42.970
does it come from for,
for you to just be brave.
I don't want to,

14
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.990
I don't want to belittle that part of it that there's a new internet developing

15
00:00:46.991 --> 00:00:49.780
and I think is people that are doing this sort of thing.

16
00:00:49.781 --> 00:00:51.490
It's not these well funded,

17
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.350
well oil machines that we're watching them crumble.
You know,
I just,

18
00:00:56.351 --> 00:00:57.220
you sent me this morning,

19
00:00:57.221 --> 00:01:02.020
this thing about boxes ad rev is off by 15% or something and it's like we've got

20
00:01:02.021 --> 00:01:05.860
slim trim companies and I think I really believe that's the future economically

21
00:01:05.861 --> 00:01:09.760
of this.
Yep.
As well as in terms of protecting the ideas.

22
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.730
<v 2>Yeah.
So we,
uh,
a pretty,</v>

23
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.630
we have a pretty amazing story.
Um,
we,
um,

24
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.780
I started by myself and I ran the website for maybe a year or even a year and a

25
00:01:22.301 --> 00:01:25.270
half before I got my,
um,

26
00:01:25.271 --> 00:01:29.620
assistant editor on board who's now sort of the managing editor and he's

27
00:01:29.621 --> 00:01:32.980
extraordinarily talented,
extremely hardworking.

28
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.160
So I'm very indebted to him for all of that.
Jonathan,
Jonathan,
Hey,

29
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.260
I'm in my other editor,
Jamie.
Okay.
Yeah,
yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.

30
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.100
Let's give credit where credit's yeah.
Yeah.
And,
um,
am I contribute,

31
00:01:45.101 --> 00:01:47.830
is that all so amazing?
Yeah,
but we,

32
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.600
I hate now as of 20,
uh,
2018 September,

33
00:01:52.601 --> 00:01:57.601
we're getting up to 1 million unique visitors a month with a staff of all part

34
00:02:00.911 --> 00:02:03.940
time staff of six or the six or seven people.

35
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.170
And we are getting almost a million uniques a month.

36
00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.390
I am aware of magazines that have a budget of millions of dollars.

37
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.280
Yeah.
That can not compete with our traffic and who have staffs of star,

38
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.060
like staffing capacity of 30 40,
50 people.

39
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.150
So we're extremely lane but we're hardworking.
Uh,

40
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.970
and we're nimble and innovative.
Like I'm very,

41
00:02:30.971 --> 00:02:33.880
I'm always thinking about innovations to the business model.

42
00:02:33.881 --> 00:02:36.040
What can we do that's different?

43
00:02:36.041 --> 00:02:41.041
I think just following in the footsteps of the old model is probably a recipe

44
00:02:41.351 --> 00:02:45.580
for failure.
And I truly believe that advertising is on the way out.

45
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.580
I know people can still make some money through advertising,

46
00:02:48.581 --> 00:02:53.581
but I think advert advertising gives you a vulnerability because now you see

47
00:02:54.971 --> 00:02:59.971
these activists trying to like target brands if their brand is next to some

48
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:05.950
content that activists don't like.
So I think advertising is just,

49
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.210
I think it's Vaughn,
there's a vulnerability associated with it.
And

50
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.240
<v 1>is it almost a fake vulnerability though?
Because I always think when,
you know,</v>

51
00:03:14.241 --> 00:03:16.370
they always try to boycott had it.
He,
for example,

52
00:03:16.371 --> 00:03:18.940
and it's like all of the people trying to boycott him,

53
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.290
putting aside whatever he said on that given instance,

54
00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.300
they don't watch him in the first place.

55
00:03:23.301 --> 00:03:28.070
And yet the advertisers still feel that they have to bow to the mob.

56
00:03:28.071 --> 00:03:29.840
And I always find that to be a strange thing.

57
00:03:29.841 --> 00:03:32.960
Like there's very few people who like entity who are,

58
00:03:32.961 --> 00:03:36.450
who are so shocked by something he said that they want to boycott it.
Yeah.

59
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.080
It's always people who hate him in the first ways that don't watch.

60
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.340
So there's an odd piece of this that's like slightly disconnected from reality,

61
00:03:43.341 --> 00:03:43.630
I think.

62
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.490
<v 2>Well,
Kay,
um,</v>

63
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.530
corporations and companies in general are skiddish and conservative and they

64
00:03:50.921 --> 00:03:55.630
want to protect their reputations and they,
they're afraid of,

65
00:03:55.631 --> 00:04:00.400
um,
any kind of controversy.
And,
um,

66
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.790
I agree with you that the,

67
00:04:02.791 --> 00:04:07.450
these activists on social media who are targeting companies,

68
00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:10.510
they're a tiny,
tiny minority of the population.

69
00:04:10.511 --> 00:04:14.020
Most people don't care or buy into this stuff,

70
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.370
but corporations is,
it's probably some PR person who's like,
Whoa,

71
00:04:18.371 --> 00:04:22.840
we don't want any controversy.
Yeah,
let's detach ourselves.
Um,

72
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.370
but you know,
it,
that kind of,
um,

73
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.980
timidity and,
um,

74
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.190
lack of strength and lack of spine is not something that is part of Colette.

75
00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:42.811
So we very much conscious of if we ever get mobbed and we do get mobbed,

76
00:04:44.591 --> 00:04:49.090
sometimes we don't apologize.
We don't,
we don't,
um,

77
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.090
we don't give into the heckler's veto basically.
Yeah.
And I,

78
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.880
I really think it's important for,
um,
uh,
corporations,

79
00:04:57.881 --> 00:04:58.661
company leaders,

80
00:04:58.661 --> 00:05:03.661
anyone in a leader's leadership position to grow as spawn in the era of social

81
00:05:04.481 --> 00:05:09.481
media and to not take any of this outrage seriously.

82
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.930
Yeah.
Yeah.

83
00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.900
<v 1>Not Take it seriously or not take it.
I mean,
I think we sort of,</v>

84
00:05:13.901 --> 00:05:17.980
we have to take it seriously because it is sort of infecting a lot of society,

85
00:05:17.981 --> 00:05:22.370
but maybe not take it as if it's necessarily right,
just because it's outrageous.

86
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:23.100
Is that fair?

87
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.000
<v 2>Yeah.
I,
you can save the,
um,
recent example,</v>

88
00:05:27.001 --> 00:05:29.790
an editor of the New York review of books,

89
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.820
amber I met was fired because he published an article,

90
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.600
uh,

91
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.600
by Canadian radio journalists who was a credibly accused of many cases of sexual

92
00:05:42.061 --> 00:05:46.110
assault.
And I think the radio journalists was like,
is um,

93
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.190
a bad dude,

94
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.730
but the editor was sacked for publishing his article within like the space of

95
00:05:55.051 --> 00:05:56.070
two days or something.

96
00:05:56.071 --> 00:06:01.071
So there was a social outrage phenomenon and it's all wrapped up with me too.

97
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.070
And then he's just fired just like that.
And it's like,
okay,

98
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.190
take some time out to consider it.

99
00:06:10.191 --> 00:06:14.270
Like listen to the feedback from your readers or from people on social media,

100
00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:16.760
but when did we start making decisions?

101
00:06:16.761 --> 00:06:20.540
So suddenly these important decisions that affect people's livelihoods,

102
00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:22.470
that's what I find,
um,

103
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
astonishing that people in leadership positions just sort of throw all caution

104
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.780
to the wind and just say,
okay,

105
00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:32.870
we're going to sack someone because some people on Twitter on happy.

106
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.110
<v 1>Yeah.
And also the guilt by association part of this,
right?
I mean it's,</v>

107
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.540
it's possible for a slim trim operation that you have,

108
00:06:38.541 --> 00:06:39.920
you might find out in 10 years,

109
00:06:39.921 --> 00:06:42.260
you might try it out then one of the guys you're working with now,

110
00:06:42.261 --> 00:06:44.030
three years ago did,

111
00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:49.031
did something awful and then they'll use that to try to tar you and the danger

112
00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.060
of that or that you sat down with somebody and now we can put out a chart that

113
00:06:53.061 --> 00:06:55.380
links that person to this person.
Did that person,
this one.
Yeah.

114
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.710
We're in an age of the Internet within six steps.

115
00:06:57.711 --> 00:07:01.040
You can lead anybody to Kevin Bacon or Barack Obama.
It's like,
it's,

116
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.360
it's pretty ridiculous.

117
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.333
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

118
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.960
And the guilt by association is e F or,

119
00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.230
I mean it's a fallacy but it is powerful and we,

120
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:16.350
we do find ourselves tainted and it's tricky and I think we have to,

121
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:22.060
every situation we have to judge on a case by case basis.
Um,

122
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.750
and,
and you probably right,
it probably is going to happen,

123
00:07:25.751 --> 00:07:30.010
but I trust my readers and um,
I,

124
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.470
I feel like they know who we are.

125
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:37.390
They know they're aware of our values and they can make the appropriate

126
00:07:37.391 --> 00:07:38.920
judgments at the time.

127
00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:42.460
<v 1>Yeah.
So,
all right.
So even though we've spent most of the time here and,</v>

128
00:07:42.461 --> 00:07:43.920
and most of the things that you guys are writing,

129
00:07:43.921 --> 00:07:47.400
talking about what sort of going on with the modern left and frustrations that

130
00:07:47.401 --> 00:07:49.860
everyone knows that I have with these guys.
Yeah.
Um,

131
00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:51.650
let's talk about the parts of their right that,

132
00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:56.760
that you actually find a scary or untoward or whatever you want to call it.

133
00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:00.720
What do you think the alt right is at this point?

134
00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:04.590
Like if someone says,
you give me the definition of all right,

135
00:08:04.591 --> 00:08:06.090
what does that even mean to you at this point?

136
00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.570
<v 2>Uh,
well,
I,
um,</v>

137
00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:12.540
consider them to be the white nationalists that uh,

138
00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.213
um,

139
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:18.740
that one in if ethno state and they,

140
00:08:18.741 --> 00:08:22.410
they're pretty morally repugnant and that pretty scary.

141
00:08:22.411 --> 00:08:24.060
And they engaged in some,

142
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:29.210
in quite vicious trolling a send death threats.
Um,

143
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:31.260
the journalist's Cathy young for example,

144
00:08:31.261 --> 00:08:36.261
was one of the first people to write an article criticizing the bigotry of the

145
00:08:36.721 --> 00:08:40.140
outright.
And she had,
um,
death threat called into her home.

146
00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:44.880
And,
uh,
the,
the,
the,
they're pretty scary,

147
00:08:44.881 --> 00:08:46.530
but I think there a small group.

148
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:49.230
<v 1>Yeah.
How are we able to quantify that?</v>

149
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:50.930
Because that's one of the things that like,

150
00:08:50.931 --> 00:08:53.510
I think people are just very confused that they're making it.

151
00:08:53.511 --> 00:08:57.120
See the media makes it seem,
because they call everyone all right or far right,

152
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.900
that there's this massive group,
I can only talk about this in a,

153
00:09:00.901 --> 00:09:03.270
an American Lens,
but maybe,
maybe it's a little different Australia,

154
00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:07.660
but that there's this massive group of white nationalists who are coming for,

155
00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:09.870
to turn America into some sort of ethno state.

156
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.760
Now I'm not saying there aren't racist.

157
00:09:11.761 --> 00:09:15.570
Of course there are racists and of course there are bad people and people using

158
00:09:15.571 --> 00:09:18.600
these tactics,
but I believe it's just a tiny sliver.
And then,

159
00:09:18.601 --> 00:09:19.560
and then on top of that,

160
00:09:19.561 --> 00:09:22.710
you have both sort of the meme makers in the shit posters and the rest of them.

161
00:09:22.711 --> 00:09:26.340
Yeah.
Those guys,
you may not like what they do,
but they're not there.

162
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.850
They're having fun in their eyes and a lot of ways they're not just the evil

163
00:09:29.851 --> 00:09:30.684
racist.

164
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:34.700
<v 2>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I think a mistake was made,
um,</v>

165
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:39.480
back when Milo was around and I think he,

166
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:45.110
he started using the term alt right and he might not have been aware of where

167
00:09:45.391 --> 00:09:50.220
that term originated and actually originated with the white nationalists.

168
00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:51.750
And um,

169
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.540
<v 1>you think Milo was using it more in the way that I just laid it out of just sort</v>

170
00:09:55.541 --> 00:09:58.380
of these shit posting me,
make something,

171
00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.920
look without acknowledging the other people.

172
00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:04.340
<v 2>I don't know if he was aware of where the term originated on art,</v>

173
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.500
but it was a huge era,
uh,

174
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:12.080
Arab for people who are just into,
um,

175
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:13.460
shit posting.

176
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:18.490
It was a huge area era for them to use that label for themselves because unless

177
00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:23.450
you're,
what in my view,
unless you are a white nationalists,
you're not an,

178
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:26.390
you're not an all right.
It,
I mean they had,
they,
the,

179
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:30.380
the label I think came about in 2007 and they,

180
00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:35.420
I think it was Richard Spencer who created the alt right journal or something.

181
00:10:35.421 --> 00:10:40.421
So it was a big mistake for people who just want to have fun online and he wants

182
00:10:42.011 --> 00:10:44.240
to,
um,
you know,

183
00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:48.950
just like push back against some of these PC orthodoxies.

184
00:10:48.951 --> 00:10:51.620
It was a huge mistake for them to use the term for themselves.

185
00:10:51.621 --> 00:10:56.621
And that's given license now for critics to apply the term on everybody who,

186
00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:02.930
who pushes back against PC dogmas.
Um,

187
00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.750
and that's really unfortunate.
Yeah.
But you know,

188
00:11:05.751 --> 00:11:09.020
we have to just say it over and over again.

189
00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:12.200
Like these people are repugnant and we,

190
00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:15.950
we don't want to have anything to do with their ideology.

191
00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:19.700
The ideal is all ideologies authoritarian.

192
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.310
It's racist.
It's,
um,

193
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.930
an and they engage in very scary vicious behaviors.

194
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:31.830
<v 1>Yeah.
So absolutely.
I will co-sign all of that.
Yes.
For the record,</v>

195
00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:32.610
of course,

196
00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:35.880
this is a repugnant ideology and these people are racist and all those things.

197
00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:41.330
So I'm less concerned about that because I do believe it's a small sliver that

198
00:11:41.851 --> 00:11:45.910
doesn't have real institutional power.
Now,
maybe it's going to gains,
I mean,

199
00:11:45.911 --> 00:11:49.020
I think there's evidence that at least in eastern Europe that some of these

200
00:11:49.021 --> 00:11:49.741
ideas,

201
00:11:49.741 --> 00:11:53.620
partly as a pushback to the immigrant immigration problems that maybe is gaining

202
00:11:53.621 --> 00:11:55.540
some power.
Um,

203
00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.800
but are you concerned that it has a bigger institutional power?

204
00:11:59.801 --> 00:12:02.980
Because I think the stuff that we're often talking about is because we're

205
00:12:02.981 --> 00:12:06.550
worried about institutional power and structural power,

206
00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:10.510
not just that there were mean and bad people out there,
which yes,

207
00:12:10.511 --> 00:12:14.680
there are many bad people out there and they will always be mean and bad people

208
00:12:14.681 --> 00:12:15.130
out there.

209
00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:18.670
<v 2>Yeah.
Because my background is,</v>

210
00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:20.170
so recently in academia,

211
00:12:20.171 --> 00:12:24.770
I focused a lot on universities and the ideologies that are popular within the

212
00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:28.210
university.
So that makes me focus on,
um,

213
00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.810
left wing ideologies such as critical theory,

214
00:12:31.811 --> 00:12:35.740
poststructuralism and Marxism.
Um,

215
00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.500
if I was in a different context,

216
00:12:38.501 --> 00:12:43.420
I might focus more on right wing ideologies and the effect that they have on

217
00:12:43.421 --> 00:12:45.040
institutions.
And I'm sure,

218
00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.120
<v 1>so you're given a little nod to the postmodern.
Is there,</v>

219
00:12:47.121 --> 00:12:50.630
because you're showing that your own bias is a little part of how you look at

220
00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:52.910
<v 2>yeah,
yeah,
absolutely.
Yeah,
yeah,</v>

221
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
I'm sure if I was closer to institutions that have more of a right wing

222
00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:00.340
ideological influence,

223
00:13:00.341 --> 00:13:04.940
so I would be criticizing that more criticizing those influences more.
Yeah.

224
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.570
Um,
being Australian is,

225
00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:14.240
uh,
in Australia,
our,

226
00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:19.480
our conservative or right wing ideologies are quite different to America.

227
00:13:20.421 --> 00:13:23.780
So,
um,
you probably already know this,

228
00:13:23.781 --> 00:13:27.440
but we have universal health care.
We have gun control,

229
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:29.270
we have a welfare state.

230
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:33.320
So if I lived in a country where we didn't have those things,

231
00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:37.070
I would probably be advocating for the right.
Um,

232
00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:42.470
but you know,
a lot of this is context specific and you criticize what,
you know,

233
00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:46.480
sorry,
a part of the reason why I criticize the,
um,

234
00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:49.490
what Jordan Peterson calls,
um,

235
00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:53.480
postmodern near Marxism is because I've experienced it.

236
00:13:53.481 --> 00:13:58.070
I see it all of the time in academia,
in academia,
academic settings,
and,

237
00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:01.050
um,
I worry about the impact of that,

238
00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:05.210
that ideology is having on media,
the law,

239
00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:08.480
um,
and just the broader culture.

240
00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:09.470
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

241
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:14.240
Are you hopeful that some of the good ideas that we've talked about here are

242
00:14:14.241 --> 00:14:15.680
going to win out?
That,

243
00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:18.770
that seems to be one of the biggest questions I get at public events now.

244
00:14:18.771 --> 00:14:23.150
Like I think there is a sense that we've woken up a certain amount of people.

245
00:14:23.151 --> 00:14:25.850
You know,
this Peter's in tours selling out every theater.

246
00:14:25.851 --> 00:14:28.970
Thousands and thousands of people literally all over the world will be in

247
00:14:28.971 --> 00:14:33.340
February,
in Australia in February.
Yeah.
Um,

248
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:38.300
but I think there's still a concern of like how much worse cake yeah.

249
00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:39.560
Before it gets better.

250
00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:43.960
<v 2>Yeah.
And that's a question people ask me as well.
And I the,</v>

251
00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:47.890
I mean,
I didn't have an oracle,
I can't see the future.

252
00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:52.920
And all I can say is that I'm doing my very best to counter bad ideas and that

253
00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:57.710
it's,
it's actually anybody who's concerned.
I mean,

254
00:14:57.711 --> 00:15:02.711
they have some responsibility and I think everybody should think about sharing

255
00:15:03.771 --> 00:15:08.770
the risk.
So,
you know,
when Charlie Abuse People truly,
right?

256
00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.250
Yeah,
yeah.
You know,

257
00:15:10.251 --> 00:15:15.251
in Charlie Hebdo happened and the mainstream media in Europe and the UK and

258
00:15:16.881 --> 00:15:20.780
America I think didn't want to publish that cartoon of Muhammad,

259
00:15:20.781 --> 00:15:25.730
which got those men and women killed.
Douglas Murray came out and said,

260
00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.130
do it shit.
The risks.

261
00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:31.710
<v 1>That's when I became aware of that.
That's one of his best moments is incredible.</v>

262
00:15:31.711 --> 00:15:33.060
It's on youtube.
Yeah.

263
00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:37.360
<v 2>That was,
uh,
uh,
something that impacted me a lot as well.</v>

264
00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:39.750
And you know,
I,
it,

265
00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:43.420
anyone who's concerned about the way our culture,

266
00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:45.160
broader western culture is headed,

267
00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:50.460
needs to think deeply about how they can make a little bit of difference by

268
00:15:51.731 --> 00:15:52.900
sharing the risk.

269
00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:57.610
Just speaking honestly in conversations with friends speaking honestly and

270
00:15:57.611 --> 00:15:58.960
openly in the workplace,

271
00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:04.210
normalizing conversations and um,
yeah,
just,

272
00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.830
just taking on a little bit of race.

273
00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:09.410
<v 1>Yeah.
What does that tell you about the slide that has occurred in the West?</v>

274
00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.910
Is this just a,
um,

275
00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:18.220
is it an infection of success or something that we could be so successful that

276
00:16:18.381 --> 00:16:22.070
even taking a little risk seems awful to people?

277
00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.190
<v 2>Eh,
he humans,
ah,</v>

278
00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:29.660
very conformist and most people are,
it's unfortunately,

279
00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:32.930
um,
and a lot of what we're talking about,

280
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:37.250
these bad ideas that are being promoted.
I only promoted by a tiny,

281
00:16:37.251 --> 00:16:40.280
tiny minority of people,
but they're very noisy,

282
00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.590
loud and aggressive.

283
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:48.670
And the problem is simply the silent majority not being feeling too intimidated

284
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.050
to sort of push back.

285
00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:58.880
And if we can encourage those who are in the silent majority to push back

286
00:16:58.881 --> 00:17:02.930
against it locks on both sides,
both the hard right and the hard left.

287
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:08.360
Um,
I think,
oh,
create a much healthier civil society.
Yeah.

288
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:12.320
But it's about empowering the moderates to speak freely,

289
00:17:12.321 --> 00:17:16.100
speak openly and,
and,
and not feel afraid,

290
00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.860
like ashamed of the moderate views.

291
00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:19.251
<v 1>Right.</v>

292
00:17:19.251 --> 00:17:24.251
They've also turned via words like civility and moderation or thought of as bad.

293
00:17:24.351 --> 00:17:29.060
Now you're offensive or you,
you don't want to murder half the people,
you know,

294
00:17:29.061 --> 00:17:31.900
you're not Thanos from Avengers.
You must be evil.

295
00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:37.000
<v 2>Yeah.
I mean
those people that people who are gay,</v>

296
00:17:37.001 --> 00:17:41.110
that civilities is a bad thing.
And um,

297
00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.980
<v 1>we see a lot of this now by the way,
that civility is a bad thing.</v>

298
00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:45.450
A lot of think pieces about this.

299
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.321
<v 2>Well,</v>

300
00:17:46.321 --> 00:17:51.321
I would argue that some unrepresentative of the broader population,

301
00:17:51.541 --> 00:17:56.541
I know that media and certain parts of media and universities have been captured

302
00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:02.370
by cultists in a way,
and they have these crazy ideas.

303
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:07.400
But I would be careful about generalizing those ideas to the broader population

304
00:18:08.641 --> 00:18:11.930
because I think most normal people are pretty chill.
Yeah.
I mean,

305
00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.210
I haven't spent enough time in your country to to know,

306
00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:16.990
<v 1>no,
I,
I think you're right.
I mean,</v>

307
00:18:16.991 --> 00:18:20.710
I'm out there going across the country realizing that there are so many,

308
00:18:20.711 --> 00:18:23.170
just decent good,
yeah.
People,
yeah.

309
00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:26.980
The hysterics and the way that I said earlier about how social media has leaked

310
00:18:26.981 --> 00:18:30.400
into reality or something.
Yeah.
It's making everyone feel crazy,

311
00:18:30.401 --> 00:18:34.660
but I am meeting these incredible people all over the country that they just

312
00:18:34.661 --> 00:18:36.640
want to live and let live and yeah.

313
00:18:36.641 --> 00:18:40.030
Maybe I don't know your feelings on abortion for example.
Maybe we agree.

314
00:18:40.031 --> 00:18:44.290
Maybe we don't.
It just seems that actually seems irrelevant at the moment.

315
00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:45.300
Yeah.

316
00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:49.000
That that sort of says saying we touched on briefly right before we started that

317
00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:50.230
politics,

318
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:54.940
I was saying how I'm not that interested in politics per se at the moment,

319
00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:58.240
even though this is all framed within a political lens,

320
00:18:58.241 --> 00:19:00.760
that I'm much more interested in culture.
Yeah.

321
00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:05.100
Is that how you feel about this and is that always how you felt about this or

322
00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.130
has something shifted?

323
00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:11.240
<v 2>Definitely.
I've never been particularly interested in partisan politics,</v>

324
00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:15.230
but I think that politics is downstream of culture,

325
00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:20.360
so the ideas that are popular within a culture then get reflected in your

326
00:19:20.361 --> 00:19:21.200
politics.

327
00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:26.260
So if you want politics to be a certain way and to be a bit healthier and less

328
00:19:27.741 --> 00:19:28.580
dysfunctional,

329
00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:33.610
you want to impact the culture first because culture is bigger than politics.

330
00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:35.440
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

331
00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.860
Is there a danger that we're just in this like locked cultural war now so that

332
00:19:38.861 --> 00:19:40.510
our politics can never get better?

333
00:19:40.511 --> 00:19:44.860
Like we sort of have this othera authoritarian leftism and now we've got Trump.

334
00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.440
These are,
these are the cultural fights that we're having now.

335
00:19:47.441 --> 00:19:49.510
There's a couple of us in this spot,
right?
Yeah.

336
00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:53.320
But like that it's all politics is going to come from those two things at the

337
00:19:53.321 --> 00:19:58.180
moment.
Yeah.
Then politics sort of is almost irreparably damaged.

338
00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:03.050
<v 2>Yeah.
Look,
I don't know what the future holds for the United States.</v>

339
00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.120
From an outsider looking in it,

340
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:10.330
it does look quite scary that the level of tribalism,

341
00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:13.610
that's,
that seems apparent.
Just the,

342
00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:18.670
and the amount of hate and distrust that each side has for the other.

343
00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.680
It's quite scary.
Um,

344
00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:26.300
I just hope that if the worst happens to the United States,

345
00:20:26.301 --> 00:20:27.440
we will always have,

346
00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:32.680
we will have outposts where western civilization survives and thrives.

347
00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:35.720
New Zealand,
Australia.

348
00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:39.290
<v 1>Yeah.
So basically going back to what I said at the beginning,</v>

349
00:20:39.291 --> 00:20:40.820
it's good to be surrounded by water.

350
00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:42.440
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.
We'll be,</v>

351
00:20:42.441 --> 00:20:46.620
we'll be an outpost and we'll pay the extra room in your house.
Yeah,
yeah,

352
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.470
yeah.
We're going to keep,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

353
00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:54.670
A lot of people are going in New Zealand and buying houses there in case the

354
00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:55.630
worst happens.

355
00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:59.640
<v 1>Oh God,
I don't want to end on this terrible.
We've got to bring this back.</v>

356
00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.190
All right.
So there's concern about that.
Yeah,
of course.
Like,
right.

357
00:21:03.191 --> 00:21:04.690
If you want to go down that rabbit hole,

358
00:21:04.691 --> 00:21:08.980
you could look at all of these ideas that I truly think are the ideas that could

359
00:21:08.981 --> 00:21:12.520
unravel western society of free thought and all the things.

360
00:21:12.521 --> 00:21:13.930
That's why I talk about them so much,

361
00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:17.080
but there is a counter and then that's what we got to keep doing.

362
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.570
So bring the bring can bring it home on a positive note please.

363
00:21:19.571 --> 00:21:23.230
Before people start buying real estate in New Zealand or you were just trying to

364
00:21:23.231 --> 00:21:24.830
help the market in Australia there?
No,

365
00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:27.840
<v 2>no,
we don't need any help in the housing market.
We,</v>

366
00:21:27.841 --> 00:21:31.980
I'm optimistic because I see the amount,

367
00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.890
the positive reception that I get through quizlet,

368
00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:39.540
our audience grows every month.
Um,

369
00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:43.500
more and more people are contributing to our website,

370
00:21:43.501 --> 00:21:46.560
feeling brave enough to write their thoughts down and send it through.

371
00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:48.000
And the thing is,

372
00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:53.570
every individual has the power to change the world of ideas.

373
00:21:53.611 --> 00:21:58.260
If you've got an idea and you can articulate it and write it down and send it in

374
00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:01.950
or um,
articulated on in,
in some other fashion,

375
00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:07.730
you do have the power to transform and impact this,

376
00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:12.120
this culture,
and to make a huge difference.
So that's,

377
00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.810
that's incredible.
And that makes me feel happy and optimistic.

378
00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:19.680
<v 1>All right.
That is how we can get,
we can't end it on the seasteading.</v>

379
00:22:19.681 --> 00:22:22.740
We're going to know what a world kind of thing for more on Claire's work.

380
00:22:22.741 --> 00:22:26.380
Check Out colette.com and they are also on patriotic.

381
00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:31.150
<v 2>Okay.</v>
