00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.990
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washington D.C.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.920
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: My
name is Mark Walker.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.940
My stage name is Professor Horn.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.890
And I've been performing Punch
and Judy now for about 25 years.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.210
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: For those
who aren't really familiar

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.900
with what Punch and
Judy shows are,

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.920
would you mind giving
us a little overview?

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.330
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: Yes, it's
a very funny puppet show,

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.460
and I think it's one of the
things that attracts me to it.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.040
It's -- they say
that authentic Punch

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.620
and Judy shows have several
elements to it, one of which is

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.460
that it would have use of
a slapstick in the show.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.020
It would also -- the performer
would also use a swazzle.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.280
That's S-W-A-Z-Z-L-E.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.030
And it's a little device.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.740
It's made of metal and tape.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.130
And you balance it on your
tongue, and it's almost

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.430
like a reed instrument.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.620
So, when you -- it
has to be wet.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.290
And as you speak, the words
come through there, and it's --

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.370
that's how Mr. Punch talks.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.890
But they say if it doesn't
have that, technically,

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.460
it's not considered a
Punch and Judy show.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.640
There are some basic
characters to the show.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.190
Of course, there's Punch, Judy,
the baby, the police officer,

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.230
and there are other characters
such as Joey the Clown,

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.230
a crocodile, and
sausages, and so forth.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.880
But no two Punch and
Judy shows are alike.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.210
There are some similarities
in that when Punch comes up

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.050
and meets Judy, they have
-- they bring out the baby.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.030
There's some sort of
interaction between them.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.760
Something usually happens to the
baby, and then there's a call

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.810
for the police officer.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.600
And then from there, it
just goes in a million

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.390
and one different directions.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.440
It's left up to the performer
to take it from there.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.800
And not all shows
actually have a crocodile.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.910
It can. Most shows do.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.540
But I've seen some shows
end with the devil.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.760
So, it's -- and again,
a lot of variety in it.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.810
And that's what makes
it kind of fun, too.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.110
[Inaudible], so.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.410
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: And
Punch and Judy shows,

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.880
the roots go back
many centuries.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.180
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: Yes.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.920
Well, it was first seen in
England in -- on May 9th, 1662.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.880
There was a man named
Samuel Pepys.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.180
He was a journalist.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.480
He kept a diary.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.940
And he noted that there was
this very funny puppet show.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.800
And at the time, it was
actually marionettes, and it --

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.160
it just took a long
time, hundreds of years,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.130
for the show to evolve.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.800
And of course, there
was no Judy in the show.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.330
She came about later, as did
some of the other characters.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.000
The devil, and so forth.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.950
But the devil and
Judy, her name was Jo,

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.210
were the earlier
puppets in the program.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.140
And as time went on, again, it
took hundreds of years to evolve

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.290
from marionettes
to glove puppets,

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.860
and for these characters to
be introduced into the show.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.450
And like -- even like
the -- there's like --

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.200
like you have the police
officer, but back then --

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.310
if you ever saw the movie,
Oliver, there's a character

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.610
in there who's known
as the Beetle.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.150
And he was sort of like -- I
guess it would be their version

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.700
of a police officer back then.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.580
So, they would introduce
this Beetle character

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.240
and they would call
for the Beetle.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.140
He would come up, and again,
there were interactions.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.530
But as that character
became out of fashion,

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.050
then they put the
police officer in.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.430
So, the show was always
moving and evolving.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.700
And there's always novelty
scenes in the show, too.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.690
I was telling somebody
where it was --

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.550
I've seen some of the shows,
they have a baby Trump puppet.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.820
And he has a long, red
tie, and his hair is,

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.330
you know, going to the side.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.280
And I've seen them where they
would introduce characters.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.420
They would -- the devil
would be in the show

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.760
and they would rip
the devil's mask off,

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.250
and he was Darth Vader.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.120
So, you could do with the
show whatever you want to do.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.840
And that's part of the fun
with it, I think, you know?

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.510
But-- .

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.970
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: In
England, before we get to Punch

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.740
and Judy here in the U.S.,

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.020
what were the main
functions of the tradition?

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.120
Where would you come across it?

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.470
How has that changed over time?

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:36.770
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: Well, initially,

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.080
the show was seen
on the streets.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.890
I mean that was it.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.060
They appeared at
fairs and so forth.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.930
And sometimes they weren't
necessarily the main attraction,

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.230
either.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.720
They were used to bring
people into the fair.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.180
That's how it began.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.170
But most of the shows,
the earlier shows,

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.960
they were actually
intended for adults.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.650
And if you look at some of
the prints and engravings,

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:02.950
you will see, most of the --

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.350
not to say their children
are not there, and not to say

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.060
that they weren't laughing,

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.800
but the performer would
often plate the adults

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.340
because they were the
ones that had money.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.580
And the performer
had another person.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.770
Usually it was a
two-person thing,

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.030
when they became glove puppets.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.910
Sometimes it was
a family member.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.270
If the performer was married,

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.050
hid wife would there,
the son, or whoever.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.780
But if it was -- he
was working by himself.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.200
There was always another person.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.140
It could be a friend, or
somebody could pick up,

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.930
and it was called the
Bottler, B-O-T-T-L-E-R,

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.880
I think that's how
I spelled Bottler.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.450
And that performer,
I mean, he was --

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.860
he assisted the entertainer.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.910
His job was to help
draw a crowd.

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.110
And sometimes he would bang on
a drum and play some panpipes.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.610
But actually, during the show,
his job was to take a bottle,

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.080
and go throughout the audience
and take up a collection.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.220
That's basically what
he did, you know?

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:09.100
So, and again, it just evolved
and then, as I mentioned earlier

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.330
in the talks, but
you know, the --

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.080
his image became
the [inaudible],

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.490
as we moved into
the Victorian times.

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.840
And that's when they
cleaned up the shows.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.270
A lot of the times,
the shows were --

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:29.680
they didn't have red and
white striped puppet theaters.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.430
[Inaudible] called fit-ups,
F-I-T-U-P-S, fit-ups.

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.020
And a lot of times, they
used what was called ticking

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.730
which was a material
to cover mattresses.

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.840
A lot of times, it would be like
blue and white check material,

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.540
and that was what you
know, before they came

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:49.920
with the red and
white, you know?

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.610
And -- but, I'm not
rambling here [inaudible].

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:54.910
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
[Inaudible] yes.

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.140
This is so fascinating.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.630
Well, tell us about the roots
of the tradition in the U.S.,

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.190
or when it migrated over
the Atlantic [inaudible].

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:09.030
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: Yes, it was -- I
think Punch was here about 1742.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.820
It was seen in -- I'm sorry.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.270
It was seen in Philadelphia,

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.050
and I think there was
an advertisement for it.

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.680
They called it Punch and Joan.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.330
And they advertised that
the figures were about two

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.660
or three feet high,
which would lead you

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.600
to believe they were
marionettes.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.900
And it was.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.200
It's called Punch and Joan.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.500
You could see, it
had not evolved

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.070
into a true Punch
and Judy, as of yet.

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.150
And then in some of
the work that I did,

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:42.470
I said there was a book,
Maryland as a Palatinate,

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:46.790
they mention a Punch
and Judy in Annapolis,

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:49.760
and that was before the
American Revolutionary War.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.420
And then I found a
Colonial newspaper.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.130
The name escapes me.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:57.610
But I know that Punch was
actually in Fell's Point,

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:02.800
Maryland, but that was also
done as a marionette show.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.940
And that was -- like
somewhere like 1750, 1760.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.850
So, it was here very early.

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:15.140
And they said that George
Washington in his records,

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.610
or journal, that
he bought a ticket

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:19.310
to see a Punch and Judy show.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:21.080
So, it does go back.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.360
And it was seen throughout
-- and there was a performer,

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:28.510
Albert Walker, he actually did
the show during the Civil War

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:30.490
at one of his -- I don't
have it on display,

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:33.320
but I have one of
his broadsides.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.050
But he did the show
in the Civil War.

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:37.480
Interesting thing, his puppets,

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:42.280
they only had one
arm on each side.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.810
They called it Economies
of Scale.

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:46.920
The audience only saw one side,

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.370
so he had one arm
facing [inaudible].

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:54.950
It was stupid, but
that's what he did.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:56.340
But the shows played all around.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:00.080
They were very big in
circuses and circus side shows.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.170
That's where they
really picked up.

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:04.440
And a lot of times, with
the circus side shows,

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.400
they called it a 10-and-1-show
where you would go in

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.740
and pay money, and you
would see these 10 acts

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.760
for whatever it was, a dime,
and they would have a magician,

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.290
a fire eater, but one

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.800
of the performers was
always a Punch and Judy man.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.880
And many of the guys were not --

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.630
well, they were full-time
entertainers, but not --

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:28.760
they did other things
other than Punch and Judy.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:34.020
And if you were to study magic
history and Punch and Judy,

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:39.840
you see there is a correlation
between most of the Punch

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:44.750
and Judy men, not all, but
many have been magicians.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.050
I can't explain that.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.100
You know, it's just
one of the allied arts.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.810
I guess that's the
best way to explain it.

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:52.110
And-- .

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:53.410
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
And you started

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:54.710
out as a magician as well.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:56.010
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: That's correct.

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:57.310
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
And you still are.

00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:58.610
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: Right,
that is correct.

00:09:58.610 --> 00:09:59.910
And over in England
too, where they have --

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:02.070
and you didn't see it too much
here, but a lot of the Punch

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:06.700
and Judy men are magicians,
and also ventriloquists.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:10.420
And there was two performers.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.250
One, George Horn, he was a
magician and a ventriloquist.

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:17.490
He actually worked with two --
he actually had two figures.

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:19.020
Actually, had the one figure.

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:22.980
He sold me, and I kind of regret
selling it, but it was made

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:30.660
by Frank Marshall, which is a
very famous Chicago -- a carver.

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:34.720
And I sold it, and it was bought
-- I sold it for like $2,000.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.980
I only paid $300 for it.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:38.850
But it was sold to a collector.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:42.220
And one time I was watching a
movie called "Rock the Cradle,"

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:47.370
and it starred Bill Murray, and
there was Oscar in that movie.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:49.090
Bill Murray was using Oscar.

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:52.190
I almost fell out of my seat
when -- "There's Oscar."

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:53.630
And I remember I
had pictures of him

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:55.240
in my house, you
know what I mean?

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.410
But I just thought
that that was so funny.

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:01.220
But that, again, the idea of
a magician, ventriloquist,

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.210
Punch and Judy man,
not too much here,

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:05.590
but over in England,
you still see that.

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:07.940
They call it the Triple Threat,

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.520
where you could perform
all three of those skills.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.690
You know, so.

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:14.240
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: Well,
let's take it to Baltimore.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.540
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: Okay.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:16.840
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
To the particular Punch

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.040
and Judy show tradition
that you are continuing.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.700
It has a long legacy
in Baltimore.

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.000
The Horns.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.300
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: Right.

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.600
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: Excuse me,

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.350
Horn's Punch and
Judy Show, 1897?

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:28.650
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: Right.

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:31.920
There's a name -- a man
named James Edward Ross,

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:35.040
and he performed the show

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.660
at a place called Pat
Harris's Dime Museum.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:44.060
And he was there for a
number of years, but his --

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:47.370
there was an amusement
park, no longer exists,

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:49.850
it was called Riverview,

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:54.230
and he was there every
Sunday performing.

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:57.040
Of course, it would be
during the summertime, okay.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.850
And he was there for many years.

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:02.360
But he also performed -- he
actually performed at a lot

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:06.940
of the embassies in Washington
D.C. Performed at a lot of them.

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:11.110
And they performed at
Young's Million Dollar Pier

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:12.410
in Atlantic City.

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:13.710
He was there.

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:15.570
And they said that when
he performed on this pier,

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:20.510
they actually had during the
show, they also had seals.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:21.810
A seal act.

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:24.030
And they would applaud
during the show.

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:26.140
And I thought that was so funny.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:28.810
Seals applauding during
his Punch and Judy show.

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:33.250
But, yes but he was there for
many years and like I said,

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:37.260
Theodore Roosevelt saw his
show and absolutely loved it.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:45.020
But there was a young gentleman,
George Horn, and he saw Rosella,

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:48.780
and he went to Riverview
all the time to see him,

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:51.570
and talk to him, and he
learned the show from him.

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:54.220
He learned the basics from
him, is what happened.

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.390
And Rosella actually taught one

00:12:56.390 --> 00:13:00.310
or two other performers
how to do the show.

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:02.590
But what happens is,
is you learn the show,

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:07.220
it's almost like you also
-- it's like a soup starter.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:10.250
You get it, here's the
basic thing, you take it,

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:12.650
and then you work
with it from there.

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:14.410
And it's really getting
a recipe.

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:16.590
You get a recipe and say,
"Oh, it's this," and say, "Oh,

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:18.190
but you know, it
would taste better

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:22.520
if I just added a little bit of
sage or I added this in there,

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.270
or [inaudible], or
Old Bay," you know?

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:26.010
You can throw Old Bay in there.

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:27.780
But it's -- and that's
how it works.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.020
And I think that's the way it's
supposed to be meant to be.

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:34.760
You know, you start with
a basic thing, add to it,

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:38.920
and then make it better by
the time you're done with it.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:44.770
Now, for me, what I did is I --
because I was really into magic

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:48.250
and magic history, and I
had written a couple magic

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:49.550
history books.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:54.220
So, as I was getting into
Punch, I decided I was --

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:57.900
I saw what happened in the
magic collecting world,

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:03.100
where in the -- let's
see, my mom died in '87.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.530
Somewhere around '87, '89,

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:08.790
the magic collecting
world went crazy.

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:12.780
Posters that you
could buy for 3, $400,

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:15.280
were now selling
for 3 or 4 thousand.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.880
It just went crazy.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:21.380
And I have some of those
now, but I had a --

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.360
I saw what happened
in the magic world,

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.400
and I thought, "You know what?

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.870
I don't hear a lot of talk
about Punch and Judy,"

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:30.880
and this was actually
pre-internet days, right?

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:35.640
Because I think that
came a little bit later.

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.680
And so, I just started to go
out and collect whatever I could

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.570
on Punch and Judy and books.

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:43.590
And as I read this stuff, I
-- read through their scripts

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:45.490
and say, "Now, that's
a good idea.

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:47.910
Maybe I could take this --
oh, that's a good joke."

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:49.210
Maybe I would take that.

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:51.710
And the one joke I have
in my show about the --

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:54.200
with the devil [inaudible],
"Well, if you're the devil,

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.570
let me shake your hand."

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:56.870
And, you know, "Why is that?"

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:58.270
"Because I'm married
to your sister."

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:02.050
Well, that was an old
joke that was given to me

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:04.600
by -- who's the guy's name?

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.830
Oh, it escapes me right now,

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:11.410
but he was a famous
-- it'll come to me.

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:12.710
Yes, the performer.

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:15.560
But he was from New York.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.050
And his son told
me about that joke.

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:19.510
So, I thought, "What
a great joke.

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:20.810
I haven't heard that."

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:22.120
So, I added that to the show.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.850
And it -- and some
of it's also me, too.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:27.800
You know, I would hear things
or funny things would happen

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.230
and I would add it
into the show.

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:32.530
But I did keep some stuff
that was from Rosella.

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:35.410
That whole bit about the
devil, "You better not tell,"

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:36.710
and the monkey and all that.

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:39.550
That came from the
Rosella, George Horn show,

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:42.420
that I kept in there as
some of the features.

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:44.810
But some of the things,
like I said, I added it.

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:47.330
I saw some things done in
England, and I thought,

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:48.630
"Oh, that's pretty funny."

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:50.490
And I didn't copy it, per se.

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:53.350
I added you know,
my own bits to it.

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:56.900
And -- but by doing a lot of
research too, I was able to --

00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:00.710
you know, there was
another performer.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.130
He used that joke about,

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:06.620
his name's Punch Jr.
Jr. Jr. Jr. Get it,

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:08.030
he's part of the Punch line.

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:09.610
Which I thought was very funny.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:12.060
And apparently, that
was used in a show,

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:15.630
and the performer was deceased,
and I had done research

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:17.060
on the performer, and I
thought, "What the heck?

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.360
That's a great line.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.660
I'm going to use that."

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:20.960
And I don't think I'm the
only one that does that.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.790
I think other performers, they
pick up a line here, a joke,

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:27.130
a gag or whatever, and you put
it in a show, and if it sticks

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:30.240
and it gets a good laugh,
you know, you leave it in.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:34.160
And sometimes, it's
often been said you --

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:38.010
you have to give a
joke a while to --

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:42.200
you shouldn't disregard
a joke just

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.640
because the first audience
doesn't laugh at it.

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:49.920
Sometimes you just also have to
get the timing of it down too.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:54.020
You know, it's just like
you say this, you wait two

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:56.500
or three seconds, and
then you say this.

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.560
And by doing that,
you know, you get it.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:59.860
But again, you've
got to work it out.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:03.030
Sometimes, you may get
a bad audience, too.

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:06.100
Never give up on a joke,
just right away, anyway.

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:08.810
But, anyway, that's
[inaudible] to it.

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:10.370
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: Well,
going back to George Horn,

00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:13.450
one of my favorite aspects of
the history of Horn's Punch

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:17.130
and Judy show, is how you
first came across him.

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:20.220
And in the 1960s?

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:21.520
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: Right, right.

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.820
I was--

00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:24.120
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
East Baltimore?

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:25.420
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: Right,
so what happened,

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.150
it was the summer of '63.

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:31.310
And I went to -- I lived

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:35.710
around Patterson Park
in East Baltimore.

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:40.770
And I went to a Catholic
School, and we had the nuns.

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:43.820
But this one year, I happened to
have a lay teacher, [inaudible],

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.070
and she was a very nice lady.

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:49.590
And she said, toward the end of
the school year, "We're going

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:51.370
to have a summer picnic.

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:52.670
And we're going to you know,

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:54.040
I'm going to invite
everybody to it."

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.340
So, [inaudible], "Yes,
right, I'll never --

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.030
she's never going
to want to do that."

00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:01.370
But then one time, during
the summer, some of the --

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:03.200
because I didn't live that
far from school and some

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.090
of the neighborhood
kids, "Hey, don't forget,

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:06.580
we're having this party."

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:11.460
So, I went over, and it was on a
Saturday, and I still remember,

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:15.830
we had hot dogs and sodas
and we played dodgeball,

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:18.080
and then we walked over.

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:23.390
It was around Baltimore
Street and Lakewood Avenue,

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:29.150
and it was George horn, and he
had his Punch and Judy cabinet

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:31.840
or fit-up there,
and he did the show.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.820
And I just remember
-- I can't remember --

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:37.270
I actually cannot remember
too much about the show,

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:39.000
but I do remember
his puppet theater.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.300
I thought, "Oh, that's
really neat.

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:41.600
That's neat."

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.340
Yes, but he did something
-- I sometimes do it,

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:47.370
and he's the only
one I ever saw do it.

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:50.900
He would bring out the
crocodile puppet at the very end

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:54.580
of the show, and he said, and
this is why I never forgot it,

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:58.480
he said, "If you let the
crocodile give you a very gentle

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:02.150
bite on the fingers, you'll have
good luck for a whole year."

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:03.730
And I thought, "Oh,
that's what I want.

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:05.820
You know, I want good luck
for the rest of the year."

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:07.120
So, I did that.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.420
And I still do that sometimes,

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.350
if it's a smaller
crowd, manageable.

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:14.590
Or if something happens
and I have to stretch

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:17.850
for some particular reason,
you know, somebody's --

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:19.360
you know, Santa Clause is there.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.430
"Can you hold off
and do something

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:23.870
for another you know,
15, 20 minutes?"

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:25.170
I'll do that, you know?

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:26.760
So, that's a great little thing.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.600
But alright, so,
what was I saying?

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:30.900
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: Well,
you first met him [inaudible].

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:32.200
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: Oh,
yes, yes, yes.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.150
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: You
came across this show.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:37.370
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: So,
what happened was,

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:39.190
I remembered his name

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:42.680
and I think I discovered
the yellow page --

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:45.560
of course, they don't --
they're going out of style now,

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.800
the yellow page phone
directories.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.100
And I saw his name.

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.230
It was listed under "Magicians."

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:54.270
And I said to him -- I
called him up, and I said,

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:55.820
"Do you have any
puppets for sale?"

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.320
And he, "Oh, I might
have a couple."

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:00.500
And I said, "Well, I'd like
to come over and visit you."

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:03.910
So, I talked to my parents and
they kind of humored me along

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:07.310
and you know, I just
kind of lost interest.

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:11.790
But there was a book out that
I got out of the library.

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:13.090
It was Punch and Judy

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:16.940
by Ed Emberly [phonetic],
I think is his name.

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:18.780
It was a children's book.

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:22.060
Had these wonderful
illustrations of Punch and Judy.

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:24.940
He also, I think he
was the illustrator.

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:30.050
And I checked that book out of
the library, I know, 30 times.

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:32.400
And it would go back in and
I would get it out again,

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.750
and go back -- and I used to --

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:37.400
as a kid, I used to dream
about doing this show.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.090
But I was also getting
magic books out.

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:41.390
You know, [inaudible] a kid.

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:43.120
[Inaudible] got like a
thousand things going

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.670
on at the same time.

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:49.490
And so, what happened was,
I didn't think too much more

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:56.210
about Punch and Judy
till it was about 1985,

00:20:56.210 --> 00:21:01.020
and I was at the house and my
mother said something to me.

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:04.660
She said, "Mark,
there's something coming

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:06.410
up on television about puppets."

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:09.380
And I had no idea what it was.

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.710
And I took a VCR tape.

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:13.430
What do you call them now?

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:14.730
I don't know what
they're called.

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:18.800
But I shoved it into the
recorder and I hit Record.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:23.360
And it came up, and there
was a three-minute segment

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:27.010
on the weekend Saturday news.

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:30.410
And it was all about
Punch and Judy.

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:31.710
It was from England.

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:33.010
I actually still have that.

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:34.480
I kept that.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:39.030
And it was John Stiles
who is probably one

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:42.560
of the world's most
famous Punch and Judy men.

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:47.010
He was a couple years ago,
he was awarded the MBE,

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:49.920
Member of the British
Empire by the Queen

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.580
for his work with
Punch and Judy.

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.170
There's a couple movies out,

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:58.050
102 Dalmatians, he
worked for Disney.

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:01.040
And [inaudible] Polar Express.

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.410
The scene was actually
cut, but if you look

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:04.710
in there, there is a scene.

00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:08.050
He actually, Tom Hanks,
flew him to California.

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:10.530
He was there for like
a week doing that.

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:15.910
And he also did it with Roman
Polansky's Oliver Twist.

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:17.740
There's a little scene
of Punch and Judy.

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:20.430
So, he's a well-known
Punch and Judy man.

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:26.330
But when I saw this, this clip,
a lightbulb went off in my head.

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:29.840
And I said, "George Horn."

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.550
So, had it not been for
seeing this with John,

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:35.430
I would have never -- probably
would have never performed Punch

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:36.730
and Judy at all.

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.030
But it took two things.

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:40.810
It took George Horn and
it took this film clip

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:42.210
about John Stiles.

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:46.160
The two of them had to come in
and hit me at the right time,

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.230
and that's what did it.

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:52.820
And my niece had a birthday
coming up, and I was not married

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:55.650
at the time, and I
always did something fun

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:56.980
for their birthdays.

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:58.750
So, I called George
Horn up and told him.

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:00.330
I said, "Look, I saw your show

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:02.270
when I was a kid,
and ba, ba, ba."

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:04.830
So, I hired him,
and the kids were

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:07.220
in hysterics watching this show.

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:10.700
And I said, "What
a fantastic thing?"

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:14.120
But I looked at him, I mean, his
stage didn't look anywhere near

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:19.980
as good as this one, but
it was just such a fun act,

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:23.870
and I thought, "You know,
that's what I should be doing.

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:25.440
I really should."

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:31.750
So, his wife died probably
a couple months later,

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:33.740
and I called him up
and I'd be coming

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:36.500
over his house about
once a month.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:39.020
And I would take
him out to dinner.

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:40.520
And I would just
go over his house.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:41.820
I didn't want anything.

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:43.120
Just hanging there with him.

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.980
I didn't -- I asked him
about Punch and Judy,

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:50.270
and he also knew a lot about the
history of magic in Baltimore.

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:52.310
He had been around, what was it?

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:55.580
Since 1902, I think?

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:57.230
He'd been around for everything.

00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:58.880
I mean, he knew Howard Thurston.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.110
I mean Howard Thurston
came to his house once.

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:03.300
And -- that's a famous magician.

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.980
So, that's what happened.

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.750
I would come over there, and
then -- I said to him once,

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:11.310
I said, "Look, never
stop performing.

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:12.820
I think you have
a wonderful act.

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:14.610
You should always do it.

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:19.160
But, the day you decide
that you want to retire,

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.630
I'd be interested
in taking over."

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:24.710
And then one day, he called me
up, out of the blue, and said,

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:28.140
"Mark," he goes, "I think
I'm about ready to retire."

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:31.260
So, I think I bought
the show for about $300.

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:32.560
I said, you know,
"What do you want?"

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:33.860
He said, "Three hundred."

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:36.310
But I actually gave him an
extra $100 because I just --

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:40.700
and then, I worked with him,
and then he started to teach me

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:43.380
about the swazzle,
and then the show,

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:47.460
and we went over the script
and it was a lot of that.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:50.810
So, I basically did his
show verbatim for a while,

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:53.290
because it's like -- I mean,
that was my soup starter.

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:54.930
I didn't know what to do.

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:57.820
You know? And the weird part
about doing the show first,

00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:03.140
it took me about six months
to memorize the script,

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:05.760
but then you had to
get the timing of it

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.450
down in front of
a live audience.

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:12.530
And that's where it took
probably another year

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:14.550
or so for that to connect.

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:17.170
Because otherwise, you're just
doing this stuff, and you know,

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:19.800
people are -- they might
be laughing, or you've got

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.650
to figure out how to
get a laugh out of this.

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:26.550
And it's, again, it's
getting that timing down.

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:29.310
And you can only do that in
front of a live audience.

00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:30.700
You can practice all you want,

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:33.480
but unless you're actually
there working in front

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:36.020
of a live audience,
you cannot get that.

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:41.280
So, we -- that took a year -- a
little bit better than a year.

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.620
But then even from there,
it was always learning.

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:44.920
Learning something else.

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:46.220
Trying something else.

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:47.570
And you know, [inaudible].

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:50.220
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: And that's
a core aspect of the tradition,

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:52.770
that it's passed down and
usually there are apprentices

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:54.070
and obviously masters--

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:55.370
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: Correct.

00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:56.670
Yes.

00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:57.970
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: -like
George Horn was to you.

00:25:57.970 --> 00:25:59.270
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: Right,
that is correct.

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:00.570
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: And
it's really interesting.

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:01.950
You know, you feel that it
took a year to really feel

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:04.880
that you were mastering, or you
had a good handle on the show?

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.180
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: Well,
I would just say,

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:09.110
I was always a slow learner.

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:11.390
Probably took me a
little bit longer,

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:14.840
but I was having fun
too, and learning it.

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:17.860
And -- but at the same
time as I was doing it,

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:22.270
I was envisioning doing
something more than that.

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:26.990
And because I had some
puppets and his stage was beat

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:28.290
up -- kind of beat up.

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:30.400
So, it was then --
it was a case of --

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:33.190
I still have his
stage and his puppets.

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:34.720
But I wanted to rebuild that.

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:37.570
And then take it
up a few notches.

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:43.170
And then, I went over to
England, I think the year

00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:44.470
after my son was born.

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:47.160
So, that would have been '96.

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:50.560
And I went over and had a
whole new set of puppets.

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:53.110
Not these, but some
other puppets.

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:54.490
And I had them made.

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:55.790
And I came back.

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:58.670
And then -- then I
started to really improve

00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:00.990
and get with it and do stuff.

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:02.730
And again, you're never done.

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:04.030
You're never done.

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:05.650
You aren't, you know?

00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:07.000
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: Well,
that's what fascinates me,

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.950
this idea that you know, what
you learn, what are the skills

00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:14.660
for instance, the puppet
making, and the timing sounds

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:17.300
like a core aspect of
what you need to practice.

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:18.600
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: Right, right.

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.120
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: And again,
receive from your master.

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:23.720
But let's talk about
the puppets.

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.020
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: Sure.

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:26.320
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
So, who made yours

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:27.620
and what does it entail and--

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:28.920
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: Right.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.220
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
-what makes a good puppet?

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:31.520
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: Well,
I have several sets.

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:35.170
I get all my sets
are made in England.

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:38.840
And I feel that they
make the best puppets

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:43.720
because they're not -- you
could be a good carver,

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:46.570
you could be an excellent
carver, but still,

00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:50.040
not make a good puppet,
because it's --

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:55.880
I feel that the best
puppets come from people

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:58.450
that are actually
performing the show.

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:01.860
They understand all the
nuances with it, you know?

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:05.950
Like it's good to have a
puppet that's well-balanced.

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:09.170
Some of the heads, you can't
see it, but they'll drill holes

00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:14.430
in there and use filler material
to make the head lighter.

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:19.110
And you -- a person -- a regular
carver, would not know that.

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:23.900
You know? And when I had a new
set of puppets made, I didn't --

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:27.450
my older sets were
made with glossy paint.

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:29.920
And I just thought -- I'd seen
that like sometimes under light

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.740
and it's that little
bit of glare.

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:34.580
So, I wanted semi-gloss
paint on there.

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:37.030
But again, these are these
little things you pick up

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:40.010
and then I also wanted
all my puppets lined.

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:42.510
That it wasn't just
one piece of fabric.

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:44.590
It was two sets in there.

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:47.180
And these little tricks of
the trade, you don't know,

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:50.720
but you finish your puppet show,
you turn the puppet inside out,

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.290
and it's two reasons why.

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:56.300
One is to dry the puppet
out in case you sweat

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:57.600
or whatever it is, but it's also

00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.760
to protect the puppet
in transport.

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.160
So, it's covered by cloth.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.330
Otherwise, the heads
are hitting one another.

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:08.460
So, it's these little things
you don't think about too much.

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:11.740
But I had my one set
that I'm using now,

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:16.320
was made my a wonderful carver.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:19.270
The name Jeff Felix [phonetic].

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:21.090
And -- where's he live?

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:25.360
Oh, he lives right on
Wembley [phonetic].

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:27.950
Yes, somewhere in England.

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:34.890
And yes, he actually worked
for Henson and Disney,

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:37.750
and for Henson, I think
he did the -- what was it?

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:39.540
A couple Muppet movies.

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:42.440
Muppets Treasure Island,

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:45.070
and I forget what other
one he did for them.

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:48.550
But yes, but he -- he's
a wonderful carver.

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:53.050
Unfortunately, he had a
stroke about a year ago.

00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:58.250
So, I'm not sure -- it's like
we used to exchange emails.

00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:00.110
He can't even use email now.

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:02.800
So, I haven't talked
to him in a while.

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.360
And I kind of miss
talking to him, you know?

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:08.390
But it's -- I try to
communicate with this sister,

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:10.150
so she can get the
messages to him.

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:17.000
A couple of my puppets were made
by another person from England,

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.980
Brian Clarke [phonetic].

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:21.190
He actually made my
puppet stage for me.

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:23.100
He made the boxers.

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:25.530
And he -- but he's
a good carver.

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:28.880
But there are other -- some
of the performers that are

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:30.870
out there, they're still --

00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:32.450
you know, they're
good carvers as well.

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:34.380
But again, they understand it.

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:35.820
And they can make the puppets.

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:37.120
So.

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.420
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: And
how about the theater set,

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:39.930
which is what I would
call it, but I've learned

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:41.230
that it's called a fit-up.

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:42.530
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: A
fit-up, that's correct.

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:46.890
Yes. There's various
different types.

00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:50.420
They have some that
are very portable,

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:53.030
where it's like you just
set it up and, [inaudible],

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:55.220
it'll set up in a
matter of minutes.

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:56.620
It's probably -- I
think they're made

00:30:56.620 --> 00:31:00.840
of a very lightweight aluminum,
and they could just set it

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:02.240
up right away, you know?

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:04.560
And I will say one
thing that has happened.

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.000
Years ago, most of the Punch

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.580
and Judy performers
worked standing up,

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:12.850
and the puppets were worked --

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:15.230
they would have their
hands up in the air.

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:18.930
So, imagine, you're standing
all the way up, and your --

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:22.750
the opening there, where the
puppets are being seen, I mean,

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:25.230
you're working like
this the entire show.

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:26.700
And I thought to myself,

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:28.830
"There's no way I
could do that."

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:32.570
But more and more,
that's being dropped,

00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:35.210
and most of the guys
now are doing like I do,

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:39.130
and it's where you work with the
puppets in front of your face.

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:43.000
So, I stand up, and
they're right at this level,

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.950
and I can see through
the curtain.

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:47.020
So, you can see if
a puppet's drooping.

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:50.230
You know, you try to
keep some movement going.

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:53.570
But more and more, that's
what they're doing today.

00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:57.990
And you can get you
know, the puppet stage

00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:59.490
as elaborate as you want.

00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:02.390
This was probably one
of the deluxe made.

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:05.180
And it was made by Brian Clarke.

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:07.100
And I went over there,
and I didn't know it,

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:09.000
but Brian was testing me.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.300
I had the money.

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:12.770
I have to give him credit.

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:17.200
He said, I found out later,
even though I had the money,

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:23.890
he wasn't going to make this for
me, unless I used the swazzle,

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:26.080
because to him, that's
the only true Punch

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.090
and Judy man uses a
swazzle for Punch.

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:32.310
And he told Jeff, and I
found out later, he said,

00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:34.110
"I'm not going to make
it if he [inaudible]."

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:38.060
So, he'd be willing to turn down
a couple thousand dollars just

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:39.360
on that principal alone.

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:42.160
But that just shows you
that's how serious he is.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.710
Some of the performers
over there [inaudible].

00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:46.070
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: You've
been bringing up so many names

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:49.250
of performers from the past,
also those who are still working

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:52.480
or those who carve the puppets.

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:53.780
How do you all know each other?

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:55.080
What is the culture?

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:57.440
Do you have meetings or-- ?

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:58.740
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: Well,
there's a group

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:02.720
out that's called the
Punch and Judy Fellowship.

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:05.590
And even that, that took me
years to track that down.

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:08.510
Of course, that was before
the internet, you know?

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:12.830
It's -- I had heard about it,
and somebody told me about it.

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:14.520
And then I had to
write to somebody.

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:15.820
They sent me the address.

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:18.640
Of course, you go online
today, everything's online.

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:22.360
I said, there are no
secrets in the world.

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:25.420
But that is -- they have a
publication called The Swazzle.

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:28.440
But it's for the Punch
and Judy Fellowship.

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:31.480
And I actually --
I tracked down --

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:38.990
I went after with a vengeance, I
got every issue of The Swazzle,

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:42.670
dating back to like
the early 70s.

00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:46.030
And I have a complete
file of that.

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:47.470
And -- it was a complete file.

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:49.550
I was really getting
into the periodicals.

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:52.920
So, I got the animations.

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:54.900
I think I have one

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:59.300
of the largest Punch periodical
collection in the world,

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:01.710
because I've seen some
of the other performers.

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:04.170
I'm not saying I have the
biggest book collection,

00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:06.990
but as far as the
periodicals are concerned.

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:08.290
There was another publication.

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:10.640
It was called The
Magical Digest.

00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:13.420
And it was owned by a guy
named Oscar Oswald [phonetic],

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:16.140
in England.

00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:17.800
And there were very few sets.

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:20.250
And I know that I have
a complete set of that.

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:23.360
And actually, got a set from
our friend John Stiles, too.

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.690
You know, just a gift to him,

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:26.820
because I'm really
good friends with him.

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:29.620
But that's how the
-- more or less,

00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:31.560
it's communicating that way.

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:33.660
And they have their puppet
festivals over in England.

00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:36.370
They have a big May
Day Festival.

00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:39.390
They used to have
one in fall, but --

00:34:39.390 --> 00:34:42.030
I think I was over
there -- I can't recall.

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:44.560
Was it a May Day Festival
or the fall of the year?

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:47.280
But I went over there, and you
just hang with all the guys.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:50.440
I mean, they're very accepting.

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:52.100
I mean, they kind of
think, "Oh, this guy came

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:53.400
from America," you know?

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.400
And but there's guys that would
travel from Italy, you know,

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.960
all around, and so forth.

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:01.040
So, I've gotten to
know a lot of them.

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:04.120
I've been to their houses too,
a couple -- more than once.

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:07.190
And but you know, you
talk shop and stuff.

00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:09.350
But then after a while, they
just become your friends.

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:11.630
So, you don't even have
to talk about puppets.

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:12.930
Just, "Hey, what are you doing?"

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:14.230
You know, "Ba, ba,
ba," so forth.

00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:15.530
But, you know.

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:16.830
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
So, it sounds like Punch

00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:18.670
and Judy's thriving in the U.K.

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:19.970
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: In
the U.K., yes.

00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:23.540
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: How is
it doing here in the U.S.?

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:24.840
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: Just okay.

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:31.090
Part of the reason is,
is the man isn't there.

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:33.850
And I also think it's
a marketing problem.

00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:38.600
And I've often had that -- I've
known that for a long time.

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:41.330
Most -- if you say
Punch and Judy,

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:43.330
you'll often hear two things.

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:46.410
One, "What is that?"

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:48.930
Or two, "Oh, that's a
violent puppet show."

00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:50.620
That's usually what you hear.

00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:53.640
And so, it's very
hard to overcome that.

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:56.090
I mean, I've figured out some
ways how to get around it,

00:35:56.090 --> 00:36:02.010
but -- and market myself,
but it's also a little bit

00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:05.060
with political correctness
as well.

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:06.360
I know a performer,

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:08.320
Fred Greenspan [phonetic],
real nice guy.

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:13.330
He lives in Palm
Beach, and I was --

00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:16.140
I stopped down to
see him in January.

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:17.440
And we were talking.

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:20.400
And he left New York
because of --

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:23.790
well, there was a variety
of reasons, but he just said

00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:28.010
where he could no longer bring
out a slapstick in the show.

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:32.050
And all of a sudden, they
didn't want to see, like a devil

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:34.250
on the show, or the crocodile.

00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:36.240
And it was -- it's
like after a while,

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:38.270
it was like, "Give me a break."

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:40.950
But like for me, I
won't bend on that.

00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:43.740
You know? It's going to
have those characters.

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:46.450
And I will say this, I've
learned some lessons.

00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:51.960
I've learned Punch and
Judy is best not performed

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:57.490
at daycare centers,
and children museums,

00:36:57.490 --> 00:37:00.800
because what happens is you
run into helicopter parents,

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.640
and teacher -- educators.

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:03.940
And it's like, "Oh, no.

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.240
Joey can't fall down.

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:06.540
Oh, no, no, don't fall down."

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:09.660
You know? And it's just that
where somebody does fall down,

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:11.970
[inaudible], "Hey, maybe
I won't run next time."

00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:13.800
You know? That type of thing.

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:18.850
But it's -- by staying
away from those two venues,

00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:20.690
I've had no complaints.

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:22.780
None, at Festival.

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:25.110
Alright, I did have --
alright, let me just say this.

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:27.200
Once in a blue, blue moon.

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:29.950
Once every five or six years.

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:33.320
Once I was doing a --
performing a Christmas show

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:36.390
and the children were
laughing their heads off.

00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:38.930
And this lady came
up to me in the back

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:40.630
and she's pulling on my leg.

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:43.140
Now, I'm doing a show and
I've got a microphone on.

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:44.630
And she goes, "Mr.
Horn, Mr. Horn."

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:48.140
And it's -- you know, so you've
got these puppets up in action.

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:49.440
"Yes, yes?"

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:50.740
"You're scaring the kids."

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.040
I'm like, "What?

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:53.340
What are you talking about?

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:54.930
They're out there
laughing their heads off."

00:37:54.930 --> 00:38:00.760
So, at the end of the
show, the -- what was it?

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:05.300
The guy who hired me, I was
talking with him and he said,

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:07.120
"What did they say to you?"

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:09.560
And I said, "Well, they said
I was scaring the kids."

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:11.500
And he said, "Scaring the kids?"

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:13.490
He goes, "What is
she talking about?"

00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:18.200
And I mentioned something to
her about the Three Stooges,

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.990
and she said, "Oh, I
hate the Three Stooges."

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:23.720
And I said that to him,
and he goes, "What?

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:25.960
She doesn't like
the Three Stooges."

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:29.170
He says, "I'm never going to
let that idiot in here again."

00:38:29.170 --> 00:38:31.800
So, I mean, there's the
kind of crazy stuff.

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:35.190
But I have to say, that
rarely, rarely ever happens.

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:37.240
I hear no complaints
at birthday party.

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:38.540
None. None.

00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:41.360
I perform in Fells
Point on a street.

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.270
Of course, I never
hear anything there.

00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:45.730
Festivals, I never
hear any complaints.

00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:49.260
And I've performed in a lot
of, you know, some museums,

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:52.800
upscale museums, art
museums, and so forth,

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:55.660
and I don't get any
complaints about it.

00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:57.650
But it's -- I think
when you, again,

00:38:57.650 --> 00:39:01.270
when there's very young
children, and you know,

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:04.420
parents that hover over
their children and so forth,

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:07.670
and educators like that, I think
sometimes you run into issues.

00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:09.960
So, I just try to avoid
those issues, that's all.

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.270
So, you know.

00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:13.720
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: I know it's
a Baltimore based tradition,

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:17.350
this particular Horn show,
but is there a connection

00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:19.130
to Fell's Point,
the neighborhood

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:20.630
on the harbor in the city?

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:22.860
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: Well, like I
said, there was a show there.

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:24.280
It was -- and I've --

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:27.890
I only found this out like
about a year ago, and the fact

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:32.240
that there was a Punch show
down there in the 1700s.

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:37.610
So, when I first started out,
I thought, because I liked

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:41.840
that area, I thought, "You
know, I'm going to go down here.

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:44.110
It's -- go down at
Christmas time."

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:46.670
And I don't know what
possessed me to do this,

00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:48.640
because I wasn't
connected with anybody.

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:51.440
But I went and set up
on a street corner.

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:53.330
They had a parade
of lighted boats,

00:39:53.330 --> 00:39:55.260
and I set up and did my show.

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:57.520
I got a big reaction.

00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:00.650
So, then I became
known down there and --

00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:03.400
people, and then I got booked

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:06.270
for the Fell's Point
Fun Festival.

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:09.310
So, this went on and on and on.

00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:15.040
And then, probably about
five years ago, I thought,

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:19.190
"I'm either going to take
this show up a few notches,

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:21.730
or I'm going to maybe
stop performing

00:40:21.730 --> 00:40:23.300
down there altogether."

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:29.290
So, I sent the letter out to
a lot of people, what was it?

00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:33.550
Business leaders, people that
owned properties and so forth

00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:35.040
and said, "Look,
this is the dream.

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:38.340
I want to come down here,
and perform my show.

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:43.000
And the whole idea is to have
something for the children,

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.880
and so forth, and you know,
I'm willing to be, you know,

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:52.560
as far as put a banner up saying
my show is sponsored by you."

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:54.850
So, I sent it out to
all these individuals.

00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:57.530
But -- and there was
this one gentleman,

00:40:57.530 --> 00:41:00.090
his name was Dominic
Echenstein [phonetic].

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:01.390
He's from Switzerland.

00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:05.550
And he had a -- there
was a hotel,

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:10.410
the Admiral Fell Inn [phonetic],
and what happened was, is I --

00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:15.140
he asked me to do
some shows, and he --

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:17.370
then he said, he
was going to pay me.

00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:19.080
And I said, "No,
forget about it."

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:22.660
And again, I thought
he just worked there.

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:26.930
I had no idea he owned the
hotel and he was very wealthy.

00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:29.080
So, years later when I
sent these letters out,

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:32.910
I sent one to him, and
Dominic called me up and said

00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:36.210
that he would like
to sponsor my show.

00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:37.510
So, that's what happened.

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:40.830
He sent me to England for
two weeks, and I was able

00:41:40.830 --> 00:41:44.240
to get the show of my dreams
built, and I perform now

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:48.210
at Fells Point about two
or three times a month.

00:41:48.210 --> 00:41:50.610
And I perform for free.

00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:55.640
And I actually have things that
I -- have a banner that says,

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:57.690
"Sponsored by Dominic
Echenstein,

00:41:57.690 --> 00:41:58.990
the Admiral Fell
Inn," and I give

00:41:58.990 --> 00:42:01.360
out these little finger
puppets that has his name

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.380
on it, and the hotel's name.

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:05.170
So, it's a very good
will gesture.

00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:08.200
And actually, they give me free
valet parking, which is great.

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:09.500
Oh, what's not to like?

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:10.800
I pull up.

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:12.100
They take my car.

00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:13.400
They park it.

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:14.820
And they deliver it
right to me at the end.

00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:16.820
I mean, this is like a
-- you know, it's like,

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:18.940
what a great gig
this is, you know?

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:23.040
So, I'm there for -- I
think I've just completed my

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.340
first year.

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:25.640
I've got about another
five to go.

00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:27.630
So, but I like doing
it, and they like it.

00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:30.970
So, it's -- that's my connection
with Fells Point, you know?

00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:32.270
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: One
of my favorite questions

00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:37.570
to ask masters in any tradition
really, is why do they do it?

00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:41.380
Why do you -- I mean, just from
listening to you all day today,

00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:44.840
it's obvious you have a lot
of passion for not only magic,

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:47.920
but obviously Punch and Judy
shows as well, and the puppetry

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:50.600
and all the knowledge and
skills [inaudible] behind it.

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:51.900
What is it?

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:55.360
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: I think the
key thing for me is that,

00:42:55.360 --> 00:43:00.340
and you look around and see
something that was around

00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:02.940
and then it no longer exists.

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:05.440
I walk around some
shopping districts

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.810
that -- when I was a child.

00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:09.770
And it looked like
a bomb went off.

00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:11.920
I mean, these stores
no longer exist.

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:16.910
A lot of things that I --
certain stores, people --

00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:19.340
neighborhood characters,
they're gone.

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:25.940
And but when I saw this show,
I just -- I thought to myself,

00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:30.870
"If I walk away from that,
that show's gone forever."

00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:33.540
And you know, "I
can't save the world,

00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:35.190
but I could save one thing."

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:37.740
And that's, I think,
what caused it.

00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:42.840
The other thing too is that,
well, it's somewhere --

00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:49.780
it was in the early 80's, that
movie came out, Home Alone.

00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:52.380
And I remember, you
couldn't get tickets to get

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:53.680
into the movie theater.

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:56.000
I had two nieces, and
I took them in there.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.140
And unless you were there,
you wouldn't understand it.

00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:02.680
I heard children laugh like I'd
never heard them laugh before.

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:06.110
And the reason for it,
it was slapstick comedy.

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:09.900
And I didn't know about Punch
and Judy at that point, see?

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:12.100
So, when -- and I always
said, "That's the kind

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:14.670
of laughs I really want
to get in my show."

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:17.440
It's one thing to get a
couple laughs, but I really --

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:19.820
I thought, that true
laughter here,

00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:23.540
little kids just
spontaneous laughter,

00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:25.640
that's what I was aiming for.

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:29.790
And when I saw George
Horn's show years later,

00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:32.140
and I heard that,
I said, "That's it.

00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:33.440
That's it."

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.690
So, it was a combination of
those two things, you know?

00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:37.480
Plus, I'm kind of
like a nostalgic guy.

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:41.040
I am. You know, I'll
admit that, you know?

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.930
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
That's surprising.

00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:47.460
So, who's apprenticing to you?

00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:52.000
How is it going to
be carried on?

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.390
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: I
don't necessarily know.

00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:54.690
Now, two things have happened.

00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:59.250
One is, years ago,
I was approached

00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:01.920
by Maryland Traditions.

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:08.340
And my son, this is -- to me,
this is an interesting story.

00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:11.650
So, somewhere -- well,
he was born in '95.

00:45:11.650 --> 00:45:16.890
My son has actually seen my show
-- my son, he'll be 23, but --

00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:22.960
I would say my son has seen the
show several thousand times,

00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:25.360
because he would go with
me to every show he could,

00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:26.870
except birthday parties.

00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:28.170
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
Wait, thousands?

00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:30.030
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: Several
thousand [inaudible].

00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:31.330
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: What?

00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:35.320
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: And I actually
have it on video somewhere,

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:38.800
but when he was about 5 or
6, I brought the show back

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:42.490
and I just put -- I put it
there, without the top on.

00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:48.650
And he stood up on a chair and
did my whole show, you know,

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:50.640
for 15 minutes, from
start to end.

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:53.930
And he was saying some stuff --
I had a joke there about Viagra.

00:45:53.930 --> 00:45:56.170
He had no idea what
I was talking about.

00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:59.010
But I mean, it was a
joke and he did that.

00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:02.160
And every once in a while, he
would say, "Dad, what's next?"

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:04.190
And I would give him the line,
and then he'd, [inaudible].

00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:06.080
And he would do that.

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:09.230
My wife and myself, we
were just besides our self

00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:12.100
that he knew the show.

00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:17.340
So, when Maryland Traditions
approached me, I just said,

00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:21.890
"You know, my son, you
know, I'd be willing

00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:23.190
to teach the show to him."

00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:25.730
So, that's what happened.

00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:27.790
And we got this award,
and actually,

00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:29.090
that's how I went to England.

00:46:29.090 --> 00:46:33.110
I took him and my wife, and
we went to England and we went

00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:34.410
to a Punch and Judy festival,

00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:36.460
but he could do the
show for a while.

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:39.780
But his interest has kind
of swayed a little bit.

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:43.860
I mean, he's a chef now and --
but he does do standup comedy.

00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:47.280
I think I rubbed off to him
in some respects, you know?

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:48.580
I mean, I would like
for him to do it,

00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:50.260
but I don't think you
should force anybody.

00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:52.220
It's got to come from within.

00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:54.740
But I have actually -- I have --

00:46:54.740 --> 00:47:00.010
I'm not releasing it any time
soon, but I've written something

00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:04.110
about Punch and Judy, the
American Punch and Judy Show,

00:47:04.110 --> 00:47:07.080
where I've taken --
I've recorded all of it,

00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:12.100
as far as like what you should
do, you know, if you're working,

00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:14.790
you know, in this
situation, and so forth.

00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:16.570
So, one day, that'll
go to somebody.

00:47:16.570 --> 00:47:18.490
Maybe I'll teach a
course in Punch and Judy.

00:47:18.490 --> 00:47:19.790
I don't know.

00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:21.090
But that's further
down the road.

00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:22.990
You know? But I've taken
those steps to do that.

00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:26.250
So, it's hopefully all
is not lost, you know?

00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:28.040
So, I would hate to --

00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:29.810
I wish somebody would
have given me this,

00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:31.690
and that would have been
what I started with.

00:47:31.690 --> 00:47:34.180
But a lot of it I had
to learn on the fly.

00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:36.540
Yes. So.

00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:38.230
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: I
guess I'm dying to ask,

00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:43.190
"How racy can your show get?"

00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:46.030
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: Well,
they have -- racy.

00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:49.860
I mean, you could do with it
-- I mean, I have some jokes --

00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:52.960
I actually hold back some jokes.

00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:54.910
I'm not going to say them here.

00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:57.030
And I mean, I don't think
they're necessarily bad.

00:47:57.030 --> 00:48:02.420
I mean, there are some that
I've used, and again, I don't --

00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:06.160
they're suggestive,
innuendos, I would say.

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:10.230
And but I've had a couple
people, I mean just,

00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:13.370
almost spit their water out
when they would hear lines,

00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:16.870
but you know, I try to
be a little bit careful.

00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:18.750
They have these things
-- I don't go to them,

00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:21.600
but they're called Puppet Slams.

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:27.120
And they're actually meant
for an all adult audience,

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:32.470
where you will come and put
on a puppet show, for adults,

00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:35.370
and you could use
adult material.

00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:38.170
And I've been asked to do that,
but I've just -- I don't know.

00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:43.230
I just -- I'm not really a
-- I like Punch and Judy --

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:44.530
or let me just say this.

00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:46.580
I love the Muppets,
but I would never want

00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:48.320
to do that type of show.

00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:49.710
I like marionettes.

00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:51.640
I would never want
to do that show.

00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:56.420
It's just something about Punch
and Judy, that just got to me.

00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:59.340
And I have no desire
to do any other kind

00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:01.890
of puppet show, but
Punch and Judy.

00:49:01.890 --> 00:49:08.640
I'll admit, it's -- you know,
it's it for me, you know?

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:09.940
So.

00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:11.240
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
Just for later,

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:13.390
when we get some good
footage of all your items,

00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:15.540
I'd just like to ask you
about your collection.

00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:17.160
How you've amassed it and what--

00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:18.460
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: Sure.

00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:19.760
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: -what
has driven it and what --

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:22.130
maybe some items you have in it
that you could talk about now,

00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:23.660
and then we'll look
at in a little bit.

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:24.960
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: Sure, yes.

00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:26.260
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
Well, I mean,

00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:29.430
some of the things you
know, a lot of the items --

00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:32.080
well, thank goodness
for eBay, you know?

00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:33.940
That's where I found
some things.

00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:40.800
Other things, I -- this one item
over there, it's a French print.

00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:45.060
It was the goofiest story.

00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:50.020
I was with my son in
Harford County, Maryland.

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:53.950
We went to an antique mall
-- a mall with antiques.

00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:56.100
And I said to him,
"Wouldn't it be funny

00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:58.820
if I found something
with Punch and Judy?"

00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:02.200
And the next thing I
know, I found this print.

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:05.200
Then it had some
kind of stain on it.

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:08.560
So, I went to a professional
restorer,

00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:09.860
called Garro [phonetic].

00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:12.070
And all the magicians use Garro.

00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:15.160
And I said, "I want
to put it on linen,

00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:16.460
but I want you to clean it up."

00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:21.080
And when they did, all
the color came off of it.

00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:22.740
I almost died.

00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:24.910
I thought, I mean that's --

00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:26.210
"I didn't want the
color to come out.

00:50:26.210 --> 00:50:29.840
I just wanted you
to clean it up."

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:34.320
That took me eight
years to find this.

00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:37.800
And I just determined
to get this,

00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:39.650
and I went after it
with a vengeance.

00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:42.790
And I was at a magic
collectors' meeting,

00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:45.930
and I knew it was from France.

00:50:45.930 --> 00:50:49.150
And I was at this meeting, and
there was this guy from France,

00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:53.110
and I said -- he had
broken English and I talked

00:50:53.110 --> 00:50:55.800
with him, and he had it.

00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:57.730
But he didn't want to sell it.

00:50:57.730 --> 00:51:01.680
So, we went back and forth,
back and forth, and finally,

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:04.690
I think in January or
something, he said,

00:51:04.690 --> 00:51:06.180
he'd be willing to sell it.

00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:08.290
My wife's not here, is she?

00:51:08.290 --> 00:51:14.640
Okay. But it was a lot of money.

00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:17.610
I was determined to get
it, and he sold it to me,

00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:18.910
so I got it back again.

00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:21.940
But -- just don't tell my wife.

00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:23.840
Anyway, that's the story
with that one, yes.

00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:25.140
So, I found that one.

00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:27.340
Other ones I found, you
know, it's here and there.

00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:28.640
It's hit and miss.

00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:32.300
You know, one of the
things, a Victorian scene,

00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:37.020
I actually bought that while I
was in London on my honeymoon.

00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:40.970
Cecil Court, there was a
place there, like a Pleasures

00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:44.000
and Past Times, or
something like that.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.690
But I bought that one there.

00:51:45.690 --> 00:51:48.220
Other ones I picked up on eBay.

00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:50.430
A guy named Jonathan Reynolds

00:51:50.430 --> 00:51:54.430
who had a place called Dramatis
Persona [phonetic], and he dealt

00:51:54.430 --> 00:52:02.420
in rare books -- all dealt
with the theater and so forth.

00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:04.560
I don't know if Jonathan's
still around, but that one there

00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:07.400
from Portugal, from
1828 with the Queen,

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:10.150
Queen of Portugal,
I got that from him.

00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:13.210
I think I only paid 300 for it,
but I bet that thing's worth

00:52:13.210 --> 00:52:14.760
about a thousand dollars today.

00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:16.250
I've never seen another one.

00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:18.920
I've showed it to friends over
in England, and they say, "Wow.

00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:20.860
What a nice piece," you know?

00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:22.980
But you know, it's like --
again, you pick them up here,

00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:27.620
you pick them up there, and
all my walls on my house,

00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:28.920
I have them all displayed.

00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:30.430
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: So,
you kind of have like a --

00:52:30.430 --> 00:52:32.270
a bit of a museum at home?

00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:33.600
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: I mean,
it's sort of like that, yes.

00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:37.820
But there's certain rooms my
wife won't get me go into.

00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:39.600
She kicked me out
of the powder room.

00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:41.780
I'm no longer in that one.

00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:44.830
I mean, when you come into
the house, it's all there.

00:52:44.830 --> 00:52:47.280
You know? But it's --
she won't let me go --

00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:50.210
I said, nothing in the kitchen,
nothing in the powder room,

00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:55.260
and then there's like a family
room there, nothing in there.

00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:58.050
But I have the parlor
and the dining room

00:52:58.050 --> 00:52:59.590
and so forth, you know?

00:52:59.590 --> 00:53:01.000
Plus, I actually
have lot of stuff.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.580
I just don't have it
displayed, because it's --

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:06.270
and I have some filing cabinets.

00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:08.600
You know, I've got a lot of
Punch and Judy in there, too.

00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:10.870
So, a lot of it's just
packed away, you know?

00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:13.270
But it's -- anyway.

00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:14.770
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: Why
are you collecting now?

00:53:14.770 --> 00:53:16.920
This is my last question.

00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:19.480
Just in general.

00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:20.780
What's the need?

00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:22.410
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: I don't
think there's a need.

00:53:22.410 --> 00:53:26.820
I mean, you know, I've written
a lot of articles about Punch

00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:31.280
and Judy, and I've
written, you know,

00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:33.560
in the Swazzle publication.

00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:37.590
I wrote that whole story
about George [inaudible],

00:53:37.590 --> 00:53:40.060
was such a huge hit with them.

00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:45.440
You could -- you will find
nothing written about that man.

00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:50.650
Nothing. But I found his -- was
it great nephew, or somebody?

00:53:50.650 --> 00:53:51.950
Or a relative.

00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:53.450
And that's how I was
able to trace this.

00:53:53.450 --> 00:53:56.140
And that -- they still
talk about this story,

00:53:56.140 --> 00:53:59.100
because he was considered
to be a god over in --

00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:03.110
probably one of the best
Punch and Judy men in America.

00:54:03.110 --> 00:54:07.440
And -- but they still talk
about him today over in England.

00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:10.790
So, it's like finding this
stuff and writing these stories,

00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:14.620
and yes, it's like putting
puzzles together, you know?

00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:16.240
You get a little
bit of information,

00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:18.110
you do a little research.

00:54:18.110 --> 00:54:21.870
There's another guy, his
name's Dagmar [phonetic],

00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:27.390
and there is a film clip, it was
an opera, "Naughty Marietta,"

00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:28.690
I think is the name of it.

00:54:28.690 --> 00:54:30.310
But there's a little
scene in there,

00:54:30.310 --> 00:54:32.890
of him doing a Punch
and Judy show.

00:54:32.890 --> 00:54:34.680
But it's probably only
about two minutes long.

00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:36.690
But I've been doing
some research on him.

00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:38.500
So, I'll probably
write an article

00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:40.500
in the Swazzle about him.

00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:43.380
So, I mean, some of it's just
to write articles or stuff.

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:46.550
So, I mean, it's just collecting
it and preserving it, saving it.

00:54:46.550 --> 00:54:50.330
You know? But yes,
today, I don't know

00:54:50.330 --> 00:54:52.370
if I would do it all over again.

00:54:52.370 --> 00:54:53.680
But I have no regrets.

00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:55.890
None whatsoever, you know?

00:54:55.890 --> 00:54:58.770
So, I mean, cataloging
it and so forth,

00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:01.920
so my wife knows what all
the stuff is, you know?

00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:04.700
So, it's -- so she
doesn't say, "Oh look,

00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:06.160
you know, a bunch of letters."

00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:07.460
Throw them out.

00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:08.760
It's like, "God, do you
know what's in there?"

00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:11.120
You know, it's all these
letters written by this guy.

00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:14.230
I mean, I've had letters
-- I actually have a --

00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:17.520
it wasn't Punch and Judy,
but I've got a postcard

00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:20.270
from John Waters [phonetic].

00:55:20.270 --> 00:55:21.990
He's talking about
one of my books

00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:25.460
and saying how much he liked it,
and you know, a couple letters

00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:29.090
from Teller, of Penn and Teller,
how much of a fan he was of one

00:55:29.090 --> 00:55:30.970
of my books, and so forth.

00:55:30.970 --> 00:55:32.610
And I wanted to keep
all that together,

00:55:32.610 --> 00:55:34.010
so my wife doesn't
say, "Oh, look at this.

00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:36.900
Old correspondence," and
just throw it out, you know?"

00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:41.470
So, yes, I mean it's
-- you know?

00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:42.770
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: So,

00:55:42.770 --> 00:55:44.320
anything you feel I should have
asked you or you'd like to add?

00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:46.390
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: Do
you have time?

00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:47.690
You guys got time, or what?

00:55:47.690 --> 00:55:49.810
We running out of time?

00:55:49.810 --> 00:55:52.050
&gt;&gt; Could we just ask
a quick question--

00:55:52.050 --> 00:55:53.350
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: Sure.

00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:54.650
&gt;&gt; -as a lay person?

00:55:54.650 --> 00:55:55.950
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: Yes.

00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:57.250
&gt;&gt; And you speak
directly what I ask?

00:55:57.250 --> 00:55:59.830
Can you just describe
what a swazzle is?

00:55:59.830 --> 00:56:01.130
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: Yes.

00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:04.090
So, a swazzle.

00:56:04.090 --> 00:56:08.340
It's about the size
of a postage stamp.

00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:11.060
But just imagine two of them.

00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:13.950
Okay? And they're made of metal.

00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:17.330
They used to be made out of
aluminum, until they found

00:56:17.330 --> 00:56:20.280
out you're not supposed
to use that.

00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:23.610
So, the good ones are
actually made out of silver.

00:56:23.610 --> 00:56:24.920
So, I actually had mine made

00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:28.170
over in England from
a silversmith.

00:56:28.170 --> 00:56:29.950
And they're curved.

00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:35.750
And what happens is, is you use
this -- it has to be cotton.

00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:40.480
It's a cotton twill tape,
and you run it through there,

00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:42.160
around this other piece.

00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:43.460
You wrap it around.

00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:48.690
And then you tie a piece
of thread around it.

00:56:48.690 --> 00:56:53.060
And then you dip it in water,
and then put it in your mouth,

00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:57.490
and as you blow through
it, it makes this sound.

00:56:57.490 --> 00:56:58.790
It's like a reed.

00:56:58.790 --> 00:57:00.780
You know what a reed is, right?

00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:03.590
And you speak, and you
speak through that,

00:57:03.590 --> 00:57:06.900
and that's what gives you
Mr. Punch's voice, you know?

00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:10.120
But they'll drive you
crazy, the swazzles,

00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:12.860
because sometimes it's --
you'll have to make them three,

00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:15.180
four, five, six times.

00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:16.480
You try it.

00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:21.230
It doesn't -- they say the good
ones is that when you blow,

00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:26.920
where you can get the right tone
from the front and the back.

00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:30.860
And if you can get that,
that's a good sound.

00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:33.180
But and then the other
thing is you have to,

00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:35.560
usually when you're making
it, you're actually dipping

00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:43.410
that twill tape, it's a --
like a herringbone, cotton,

00:57:43.410 --> 00:57:44.850
twill tape or something.

00:57:44.850 --> 00:57:47.230
But you're going to have
to dip it in hot water.

00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:48.530
So, you -- and that's --

00:57:48.530 --> 00:57:50.370
and then after it
shrinks a little bit,

00:57:50.370 --> 00:57:52.470
that's when you use it
to make your swazzle.

00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:54.730
But that's what gives
you Mr. Punch's voice.

00:57:54.730 --> 00:57:56.030
Yes.

00:57:56.030 --> 00:57:57.330
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: And
how long do they last?

00:57:57.330 --> 00:57:58.630
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: A good while.

00:57:58.630 --> 00:57:59.970
A good while, you know?

00:57:59.970 --> 00:58:03.110
You know, I should actually
have spares with me.

00:58:03.110 --> 00:58:05.630
You know, they say that you
should have two or three spares.

00:58:05.630 --> 00:58:08.750
I don't. And I feel
ashamed, because --

00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:12.540
I haven't swallowed one yet,
and a lot of people have.

00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:17.070
And they actually say you're not
a good Punch and Judy performer

00:58:17.070 --> 00:58:19.820
until you swallow one.

00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:22.650
But I'm kind of glad that --
I hope I go throughout my life

00:58:22.650 --> 00:58:25.930
without swallowing one
of those, you know?

00:58:25.930 --> 00:58:31.790
We won't get into what you have
to do afterwards, but yes, yes.

00:58:31.790 --> 00:58:34.070
That's about it with that.

00:58:34.070 --> 00:58:35.660
I have some stories if
you want [inaudible]?

00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:37.200
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: I
want to hear stories, yes.

00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:38.660
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: Alright, okay.

00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:39.960
Some stories.

00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:44.980
I had a call once to do a
Punch and Judy show for a --

00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:49.370
this guy called me up and
said, "Hey, I want you to do --

00:58:49.370 --> 00:58:50.670
it's a birthday party."

00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:51.970
And I said, "Okay."

00:58:51.970 --> 00:58:56.650
And I said -- he says, "My
son, though has a handicap."

00:58:56.650 --> 00:58:59.690
He didn't say what it
was, and I didn't ask him.

00:58:59.690 --> 00:59:02.290
And I went to his house, and he
was -- they were very wealthy.

00:59:02.290 --> 00:59:03.590
He was a doctor.

00:59:03.590 --> 00:59:07.100
And his son, I guess it's
okay to say it here, right?

00:59:07.100 --> 00:59:09.010
His son had no ears.

00:59:09.010 --> 00:59:11.880
And that was his thing.

00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:15.940
But his father made for him,
some kind of device that went

00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:21.170
over his head, like a
headset, so his son could hear.

00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:30.080
And during the show,
his son was acting up.

00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:34.250
And afterwards, the father said,
"I have never seen my son get

00:59:34.250 --> 00:59:36.680
so excited about a
show in all my life."

00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:41.380
You know? And it kind of touched
me when he did that, you know?

00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:44.260
And that was one
experience that I had.

00:59:44.260 --> 00:59:49.720
And another time, some guy
said, "I have this event.

00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:52.830
We're celebrating our
100th anniversary.

00:59:52.830 --> 00:59:55.800
I'd like for you to
come out to perform."

00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:57.100
And I said, "Sure."

00:59:57.100 --> 00:59:58.400
I said, "Well, what
kind of event is it?"

00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:00.930
And he goes, "Well,
we're a funeral parlor,

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:03.210
and we're celebrating
our 100th anniversary."

01:00:03.210 --> 01:00:04.700
So, okay, okay.

01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:08.100
So, it was in the fall of
the year, and I was coming

01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:10.830
to the event, and I said,
"Oh, where will I perform?"

01:00:10.830 --> 01:00:12.130
He goes, "Oh, outside."

01:00:12.130 --> 01:00:13.430
I said, "Okay."

01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:15.080
So, I was coming to the event,
and it was pouring down rain.

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:19.840
And I'm thinking, "Oh, he's
going to cancel for sure."

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:21.140
So, I get there,
and I said, "Well,

01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:22.440
I guess you're going to cancel?"

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:23.740
And he goes, "No, no, no.

01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:25.670
We're going to move it indoors."

01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:28.790
So, I went in, and that's
where I was performing it,

01:00:28.790 --> 01:00:32.570
in one of the viewing rooms,
my Punch and Judy show.

01:00:32.570 --> 01:00:35.830
And for the longest time, I
didn't want to ask the guy,

01:00:35.830 --> 01:00:39.020
like you know, where's
all the bodies, you know?

01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:40.320
But because -- I
found out later,

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:43.130
because it was their
100th anniversary,

01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:46.220
they had closed the
shop down for a week,

01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:48.370
so they could repaint
and put you know,

01:00:48.370 --> 01:00:51.110
new carpet in and so forth.

01:00:51.110 --> 01:00:54.280
But, I always thought
that was a good one.

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:58.360
I had one booking that
I did for many years.

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:01.070
I did it for about
five or six years.

01:01:01.070 --> 01:01:05.640
I was actually hired
by a group of lawyers.

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:09.580
And I won't tell you the name of
the program, but I would perform

01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:13.570
for very, very good
money, three shows a year.

01:01:13.570 --> 01:01:16.010
And then what would
happen is, the people --

01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:19.300
the children would come
in and watch my show,

01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:20.900
and then they would
leave the room,

01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:23.580
and they would be interviewed.

01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:27.190
And the whole purpose
was, they were being --

01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:31.830
they were talking to
lawyers, people studying law.

01:01:31.830 --> 01:01:35.590
And it was to test their
memories, to see how much

01:01:35.590 --> 01:01:37.650
that they could remember.

01:01:37.650 --> 01:01:41.180
And it was basically to check,
I guess for, if they were --

01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:43.210
like child abuse or something.

01:01:43.210 --> 01:01:45.460
And like how good
was their memory?

01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:48.210
And the people interviewing
me, had not seen the show.

01:01:48.210 --> 01:01:50.760
They were asking them, and
then they're saying, "Oh,

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:52.580
this crocodile came in.

01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:53.880
There was this monkey."

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:55.180
But that was the whole idea.

01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:56.580
They were -- they talked
about the magic show,

01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:58.150
but the Punch and Judy as well.

01:01:58.150 --> 01:02:00.360
But, I really thought that
was a pretty good one.

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:04.750
And another time, a couple
years back, it was Captain --

01:02:04.750 --> 01:02:07.410
what was it, Captain
John Smith, was that it?

01:02:07.410 --> 01:02:09.260
But they had a big celebration.

01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:11.900
What was it, 300
years, 350 years?

01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:17.460
And while I was there, they
put me at this spot, and said,

01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:20.110
"This is where I
want you to perform."

01:02:20.110 --> 01:02:26.150
And what happened was,
I was next to a gallows.

01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:30.210
And they would bring a guy
up, and hang this person.

01:02:30.210 --> 01:02:32.510
Of course, he had a
brace on and everything,

01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:36.010
but they would bring him up on
the thing, put him up there,

01:02:36.010 --> 01:02:39.420
pull the thing, and the guy
would just drop and hang.

01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:41.570
And then they would say,
"And now we're going

01:02:41.570 --> 01:02:43.720
to have our children's
entertainment."

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:45.170
So, I followed that.

01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:48.360
And I just thought that that --
how bizarre is that, you know?

01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:50.120
And it's like, how
do you follow that?

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:51.470
You know? But that
was just another one

01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:53.540
of those crazy things, you know?

01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:56.410
But I've had all kind of like,
crazy things like that happen.

01:02:56.410 --> 01:02:57.920
And there were fun things too.

01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:00.490
And I actually think
that's another reason why I

01:03:00.490 --> 01:03:01.790
like to perform.

01:03:01.790 --> 01:03:05.230
I get to meet people,
like you guys.

01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:09.080
And it's, go places I
would never go otherwise.

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:13.620
And anyway, that's part
of the fun business of it.

01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:15.260
You know, so.

01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:16.560
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
Well, thank you so much.

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:17.860
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: Thank you.

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:19.160
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: That
was absolutely wonderful.

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:20.460
&gt;&gt; Mark Walker: Well, thank you.

01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:22.150
So.

01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:25.830
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
