Simpson remained with the show

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.590
He hosted the Donnie Simpson

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.870
That million dollar number has
been out there for so long.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.170
It's so funny to me.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.280
I just laugh every time I hear it
because it's just, I don't know,

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.080
I mean, it, it, what it are?

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.050

but that's not why we do it.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.080
[ Laughter ]

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.790
But it's nice that
they pay you for it.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.780
As a matter of fact, I was
just telling the guys Thursday,

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.010
during Thursday and
Friday show, I said,

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.320
I even said it on the air I think.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.610
I, it's just still amazing to
me that they pay me for this.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.100
You know, because I
have so much fun.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.360
You know, I just love what I do.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.600
You know, we sit there, man, shoot,
especially Thursday and Friday.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.590
We got the TV on, we're
watching the Master's.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.540
We got Teddy Pendergrass
and Luther playing.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.930
You know, telling jokes
and having fun.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.230
It's like, wow!

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.540
And you get a check at the
end of the day, you know,

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.100 position:56%
and I've been blessed to get away
with that for all my life, you know.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.190
Since I was 15, I've worked four
hours a day, five days a week,

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.550
no weekends, all the
fun I can stand.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.030
I mean, I, you know, it's
like God is so good to me.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.050

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.610
He is. I'm telling you.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.490
Oh, so, well she kind of told
you how it started, so you know,

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.230
I guess I should give
you some background.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.110
I started, I, Detroit boy.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.770
Born and raised in Detroit.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.350
Home of Motown.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.260
And growing up in Motown was
such a special occasion for me.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.460
It was just, wow!

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.450
You know, we used to watch
every Cadillac that went by,

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:25.270
just hoping that you'd see
Diana Ross or Marvin Gaye or one

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.600
of the Temptations or
one of their cousins.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.280
That would have been just as cool!

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.600
That's exciting too.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.430
Barber, anybody, anybody
that knows them, you know.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.600
And so, wow!

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.510
I'm skipped way ahead here
because I want to say this.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.250
That it's just amazing to me
that all these years later

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.560
that these people are
friends of mine.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.700
You know, that I just don't quite
understand how that all happened.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.750
You know, it's just,
well, here's a video

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.250
that so many people have
mentioned that it's on YouTube.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.420
It's with me and Aretha
Franklin on Video Soul,

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.660
and I don't remember how
the conversation started,

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.040
but somehow it went
to Curtis Mayfield,

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:13.000 position:56%
and we were doing a two-hour special
at Aretha's house, and so she start,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.370
I'm sitting there with her at her
piano, and she just starts singing.

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.500
Someone mentioned my favorite song
is The Makings of You, and she,

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:26.080
add a little sugar, honeysuckle
and, and I just started crying.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.360
I just started crying because there
was so much in that moment for me.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.400
You know, it was like
how did I get here?

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.960
How, how did this happen?

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.680
You sitting on the
queen's throne, one on one,

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.730
greatest voice I've
ever heard in my life,

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.660
singing to me, one
on one, in my ear.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.330
How did this, how did this happen?

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.040
I'm not worthy, you know.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.970
Surely they're going to put me
out of here in a minute, you know.

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.490
But it's just, but you know what,
I guess God puts you exactly

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.860
where he wants you to be, and so,
you know, I'm grateful for it.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.360
I, I still don't quite understand
how it has all happened, you know,

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.560
for this little boy from Detroit
who admired these people so to grow

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.050
up to become, you know,
their friends and, you know,

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.750
to, it's just, I don't know.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.220
It's overwhelming to me.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.520
It really is.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.770
To be here today, to see
this kind of welcome is,

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.210
it's just, it's overwhelming.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.880
When I came back to radio after
five and half years' retirement,

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.270
I mean all of the, the, the press
and the attention and stuff,

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:33.820
it was just, I, I, I don't know.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.690
I guess I never get used to it.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.370 position:56%
It's just, when I retired, you know,

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.010
and to see it on the front
page of the Washington Post.

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:44.800
You know, above the fold.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.100
I'll never forget.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.400
I got --

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.080
[ Laughter ]

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.380
Seriously.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.680
You know, I picked up
the paper that morning.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.980
I saw that.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.280
Immediately tears just
came to my eyes

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.810
and I just said, so
it was like that?

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.840
You know, because,
you, you know, when,

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.800
when you do what you
do, you do what you do.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.620
You know, it's just, I, I'm
rambling, but that's what I do.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.110
I'm sorry.

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:13.390
But there is a, a line from
Elton John song, Rocket Man,

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:17.760 position:56%
that I love so much where he says in
all the science I don't understand.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.280
It's my job five days a week.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.230
You know, people look at,
you know, he's a rocket man,

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:25.800
you know, he's an astronaut.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.350
It's just what he does.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:29.830
You know, it's just what I do.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:33.820
And so you, I'm blessed
that I have gotten to do it.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:40.870 position:56%
You know, I took off five and a half
years where I ran a shovel service,

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:43.010
shoveling grandbabies
back and forth --

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:44.310

And --

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:48.210
[ Laughter ]

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:49.510
-- and I was good at it too.

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:50.810
Shoot!

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:52.110
[ Laughter ]

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:53.410
In the summer I was a pool boy.

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:55.040
[ Laughter ]

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.340
I was good at that.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.730
I'm still for hire, you know.

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:04.510 position:56%
We do the G-rated version, then I do
the adult version in Speedos, but --

[ Laughter ]

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:11.700
-- but, but, you know, it was, when
they worked out the deal for me

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.980
to come back, they,
my, my best friend.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.720
I can't call him my agent or
attorney because he's neither.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.560
He's just my boy, but he's
done all my contracts.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.090 position:56%
And he says well, you know what,
there's, the only reason for you not

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:28.650
to do this now is because
you just don't want to do it.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:32.020
I mean is there a reason you can
think of that, to not do this?

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:37.040
I said yeah, well, I can't pick
Norah up from school at three.

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.060
[ Laughter ]

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.190
He said well, you can
shout her out on the radio.

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:43.510
She'd probably like that better.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:46.070
[ Laughter ]

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:49.890
So, you know, so, you know, I take
them to school in the morning and,

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:52.880 position:56%
and I get to play music for them in
the afternoon, which is pretty cool.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:58.350
I was asked to talk about
some people here in D.C.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:04.360
that have impacted my life
and so I guess one I'd

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.600 position:56%
like to lead with, he's not a local.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:11.770 position:56%
He's a, he was transported here just
like me, but that's President Obama,

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:14.110
you know, whom I admire greatly.

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:21.510
I have, until 2008, I would all,
the answer to the question who was,

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:24.070
what's the most important
day of your life.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:25.370
Well, it was two.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.560
It was the birth, the days of
the birth of both my children.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.010
Until that man was
elected president.

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:31.310
[ Laughter ]

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:32.610
Then, yeah, for real.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:33.910
That's, yeah --

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:35.210
[ Applause ]

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:37.380
That became the greatest
day of my life, you know.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.040
It really was because
that was so much more

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.630
than about me and my family and my.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.870
And that was about us, you know,
as a people and as a country.

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.490
Not, and I mean not
just black people

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:49.700
but just this country
moving forward.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.930
You know, it was just
that important to me.

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:56.080
And I got a chance to meet him
on the golf course last year.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.040
He was, he came over
to say hello to me.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.400
I was like, wow!

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.010
Ok, cool!

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:03.310
[ Laughter ]

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:05.390
And it, and I got it tell you,
it was so funny because we talked

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:07.860
for like a couple of minutes,
and then we was leaving,

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.160
you know, you know out brother.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.110
We pretty physical, you know,
so I was like alright man, cool!

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:14.510
You know, hit him in the
chest like that, you know.

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:18.050
[ Laughter ]

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.520
And, and I'm walking
off, and I go, like,

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.510
did you just hit the president?

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:27.190
[ Laughter ]

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:30.900
But you know, but then immediately
it was like, you know, yeah, but,

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.470
he was cool with that, you know,
because he understood, you know,

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:37.090
that you mean something to him.

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:39.510
I mean he means something
to you, right!

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:42.090
[ Laughter ]

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:44.630
I got, don't care to twist it.

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:45.930
Yeah, but so, he, you know,

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:47.800
he understood that,
that, that you know.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.610
He understands his
place in our history.

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:51.890
There was no doubt in
that moment for me.

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:56.050
And, but, but what an honor.

00:10:56.050 --> 00:11:01.040
Wow! Another one would
be Chuck Brown, you know.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.880
Yeah. Chuck's, Chuck, I
still, I love that man.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:12.070
I just, you know, I share a wall
with him and President Obama

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:16.570
and Bill Cosby down at
Ben's Chili Bowl, and,

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:18.150
which is pretty cool to me.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:20.170
But Chuck was just
such a cool brother.

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:24.550
Listened to my show every
morning, four hours every morning,

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:26.790
every morning, was
just the coolest guy.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:31.700
I still have not been able to
bring myself to watch his Unsung.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.490
It's taped, but I haven't, they
asked me to be a part of it

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:35.790
and I just wouldn't do it.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:37.090
I just, I don't know.

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:39.330
It was kind of emotional for me.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.880
And so, but, but I will watch it.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.770
But Chuck was just such a,
just such a cool brother,

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:50.990
and so about D.C. You know, and
I, and I guess that takes me

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:54.100
to the third person which
is Mayor Marion Barry,

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.010
who was totally about D.C.

00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:58.310
[ Applause ]

00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:59.610
You know, yeah.

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:01.690
And, and people around the country
sometimes don't understand it.

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:03.820
They go you know how you
support that guy, you know.

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.060
It's like, shoot, man, please.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.830
It's a D.C. thing.

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:14.440 position:56%
You just, you know, he was about the
people of D.C. long before he took

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.820
over the mayor's position.

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:20.020
You know, he was always about D.C.,
and I admired him greatly for that.

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:25.150 position:56%
You know, I remember, you know, I
mean we all know what happened with,

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:29.910
with the crack smoking thing, and I
remember calling my dad in Detroit

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.860
that night because I was so upset.

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.730
You know, I just, I just get tired

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:37.250
of seeing us get torn
down, you know.

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:40.360
And so that night I called
my dad and I was crying.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.230
I was just, you know,
telling him what happened.

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:44.170
They had this thing
on video tape, dad.

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:46.370
Well, blah, blah, blah,
went on and on.

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:51.510
Finally my dad said, Mmmm.

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:58.140

00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:59.940

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:08.180
So I'm, I'm in the process of
writing a book now, and that's part

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:11.870
of what I want to write about, and
it's just called Mmm, that part,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.450
because, because when you live that
long and seen that much, you know,

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:20.210
you come, it's like [inaudible].

all live to Mmm.

those guys so,

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:42.300
and so many times I've
heard people say to me, wow!

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:45.770
Actually somebody asked me in an
interview just recently, is it,

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:49.830
you know, it's like three
people that represent D.C. You,

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:52.210
Chuck Brown, and Mayor Barry.

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:55.210
And it, it's so what is that,
what does that mean to you?

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:57.510
I said that means I'm next.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:16.110
I'm next. I mean I hope it's a
long time, but that's a fact.

That's a fact.

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:18.880

see I just rambled, but you know, I,

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:31.070
I have to say this, that
death I do not fear.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:33.280
It's always been fascinating
to me that the thing

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.360
that we are all guaranteed
we fear the most.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:39.820
And, but, you know, I used
to be, but I remember.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.170 position:56%
I was very young, I think at 22, 23,

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:45.840
when President Anwar Sadat
was assassinated in Egypt.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.480
And I remember seeing
an interview with him,

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:52.860
and it was two days
before he was assassinated,

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.030
and you know, he knew it.

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:57.930
You know, I mean pretty much like
Dr. King the night, you know.

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.530
The mountain top speaks, you know,

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:01.870
where he just, you
saw it in his eyes.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:05.390
I was like, you know,
you, you just knew.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:08.160
And so they asked him about
it because these reports were,

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.110
you know, it seemed eminent, and
he said, they asked was he afraid.

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:14.150
He said absolutely not.

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:18.070
There's no man who can
take me before my time.

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:19.550
That was so deep to me.

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:21.240
I'm like you could, you
could pull the trigger,

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:25.130
but God sent you, he's
bringing me home.

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.520
That's, you know, and I don't
mean to start preaching,

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.170
but that's how I feel about that.

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:34.480
You can pull the trigger, but, so
with that I say, you know, I, I,

I love, I love this journey
so much that I'm on here.

said, I stand here ready

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:47.790
to go right this minute
because I don't fear that.

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:11.190
But, but I've had a blessed career.

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:13.330
You know, to start in
radio at the age of 15,

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:14.940
especially in a major market.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:18.240
Detroit was the fifth largest
market in the country at the time,

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.620
and that's where I got my start.

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:21.360
I mean it was, now it's 48.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.330
People left there like
crazy, you know.

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.250
The, the automobile
industry has just suffered

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:27.320
so much through the years.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.080
But, you know, I always
felt so blessed that,

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:33.100
you know, I got to start so young.

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:38.410
Most of the guys that I was
competing with for jobs in radio,

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:41.780
you know, most of them had
done their stint in the Nam.

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:44.490
You know, they're 22, 23 years old.

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:49.520
You know, shoot, at 22, 23 I had
eight years' experience, you know,

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.420
in a major market in Detroit.

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:55.740
I mean, I was a tough
candidate, you know,

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.550
when they called me to come here.

00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:06.110
Wow! It was to Disco 93,
and I thought no way.

00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:07.420
I'm not doing that.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:08.800
A disco station?

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:12.070
Because to me disco meant just
stringing songs together, you know.

00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:14.220
No involvement from
the DJ, whatever.

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:20.330
But my oldest brother had always
taught me to always listen.

00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:21.820
You know, you have
to listen at least,

00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:24.840
so I decided to come
here and talk with them.

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:26.580
You'll love this.

00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:27.880
They fly me in.

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.700
They pick me up at the
airport and take me

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:33.010
for the interview at
Arlington Cemetery.

is Washington, boy!

This is, this is so
clandestine you know.

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:49.320
Why here? And it was so weird.

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.930
But they took, you know, I listened
to the radio station and found

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:56.830
out it was a little more than
disco and decided to come.

00:17:56.830 --> 00:18:00.620
The station I was at, I felt like
I had accomplished everything

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.930
that I could there, that
there was, you know, there,

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:07.790
it was the biggest station in that
chain, and this is owned by NBC,

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:10.220
so I felt that there were a
lot more opportunities there.

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.960
I was making $13,000
a year in Detroit.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.880
I came here making $28,500.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.180

they didn't tell me the cost

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:25.060
of living was three times as much.

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:29.710
I was broke.

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:31.010
Oh my goodness.

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:32.310
I struggled, man.

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:33.610
I'm telling you.

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:34.910
I struggled so hard that first
couple years because, you know,

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:36.210
I also lost my side hustle.

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:40.420
People didn't know who I was, so,
you know, you're not MC-ing shows

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.820
and you know, no, no, ain't
no side money coming in.

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:45.120
So it was tight, man.

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.620
I remember I had taken
these pictures.

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:50.060
I had these pictures developed.

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:52.050
Everybody here remembers
pictures developed.

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:54.080
[ Laughter ]

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.650 position:56%
Yeah, you talk to some they wouldn't
have any idea what you're talking

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:58.190
about now.

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:00.360
[ Laughter ]

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:05.230 position:56%
But they were the last pictures of
my grandfather and I couldn't afford

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:06.630
to get them out of the shop.

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:08.710
It was $28.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:10.500
And I'll never forget that.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.640
And this went on for
about three months.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.870
They kept calling me, and finally
I got enough money together to go

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.740
up there and get the pictures,
and they had destroyed them.

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.420
You know, it was gone.

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:21.720
It was gone.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:26.330
But, but you know, it's
stuff like that helps

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:28.320
to keep you grounded, you know.

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:33.730 position:56%
It's, you know, it's like, well an
old saying I heard that the best way

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:37.510
to teach your kids about
money is to not have any.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:40.050
[ Laughter ]

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:42.240
They learn the value
of it real fast then.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:46.510
And so, you know, I think
we've all had those experiences

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:50.780
and those struggles, and you
know, it's, God turned things

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:52.490
around very quickly
for me after that.

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:56.050
And I've been very blessed through
the years to live a life that is,

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:58.960
that is just unimaginable to me.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.560
You know, it's just, you know,

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:05.250
I mean so many years I started
living beyond what my dreams were

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:10.380
that, I don't know, it's just,
you know, it's just God's will.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:14.150
And I thank Him for the
light that He's given me.

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:18.770
And, and, and I should say not
just, you know, financially.

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:23.910 position:56%
That's secondary to the wife He's
given me, to the kids He's given me,

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:26.570
to the grandkids that
He's blessed me with.

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:31.040
You know, I, He's just put such
wonderful people in my life that,

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:35.500
you know, I was thinking
about this because last night.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:40.270
Well yesterday Bob Johnson invited
me to a fundraiser that he had

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:42.620
for Hillary Clinton, so I go
there and here I'm sitting

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:44.570
at a table next to Hillary Clinton.

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:45.870
You know, it's just like, wow!

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.170
This is cool.

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:48.470
I never met her.

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:49.860
I met her husband a few times.

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:51.590
But, so then we went

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:54.790
out to celebrate Bob's
70th birthday last night,

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:56.620
and so I was thinking
about this this morning.

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.700
You know, Bob's historic figure.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:03.910
He's our first black billionaire,
and, and, but then I was thinking

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:06.420
about those things I
just listed to you.

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:11.400
My wife and my kids, and I
said you know what, I don't,

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.570
I can't say I'm richer than him,

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:16.680
but I can tell you this,
I'm just as rich as him.

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:21.240
You know, that this is worth, you
can't put a value on what I have.

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.670
You know, a billion dollars.

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:24.290
Give me a choice of
those two things,

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:29.200
I'm going to take this every time,
you know, because in the end,

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.030
we leave here with the
exact same amount of money.

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:34.040
[ Laughter ]

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.820
That don't mean nothing.

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:37.120
It really doesn't.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.420
It really doesn't.

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:42.610
So you know, I'm just so blessed
to have the love of my family,

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:44.900
the love of my people, you know.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:48.490
I just, you know, you all
fill me up today, you know,

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:50.850
just having me here
to be a part of this.

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:53.010
Again, the reception
I got coming in,

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:55.110
it's just, it's, it's overwhelming.

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:56.410
And I appreciate --

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:58.510

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:13.010

I set you up, brother.

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:14.310

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:16.060
We're already up here dapping
each other up and stuff.

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:18.110

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:19.410
So yeah, he came with Donnie, man.

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:20.990
That was a set-up.

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:23.260
[ Laughter ]

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:25.850 position:56%
Yeah, but I, I was told to leave
some time for questions and answers,

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:29.970
so I'll do that, but, but
thank you for having me.

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:32.010
I really, really appreciate it.

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:42.230
So anybody got a question.

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:44.390
Ok, go ahead, brother.

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:46.790

than, than a question.

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:49.040
This is to say thank
you to this man.

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.920
A lot of you know me as
ebaby [phonetic], a poet.

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:57.220
May 8 of 2004 there was a
young lady, seven years old,

00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:00.090
Chelsea Cromartie was
killed by a stray bullet.

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:01.400
Donnie was at the funeral.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.700
The mayor was at the funeral.

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:04.760
A lot of people at the
funeral, and the father asked me

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.380
to perform a poem called
Da-ah's Angel.

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:11.640
Donnie got in touch with people
through the radio for me to come

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.070
up to the station so he could
play it that next morning

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:17.790
so all of his fans can hear me.

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:19.670
That boosted my career a lot.

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:20.970

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:22.270

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:23.570
and I made sure I was the
first one here and I sat there.

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:24.870
This is not a set-up.

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:26.170
I know [inaudible] wasn't.

that group, but there was this guy,

00:23:58.030 --> 00:23:59.940
he always called you his brother.

of who, you know, what's his name

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.480

you all looked so much alike.

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:14.660
I tell, we had picture, a
picture taken that was so,

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:18.010

looked at them and just go --

near close like me and J.T.

Cool brother, J.T. Yes, ma'am?

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:42.720
&gt;&gt; Woman #1: Two, well, one
question and one comment.

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:53.780
The question is how have you
seen the music industry change.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:56.080
&gt;&gt; Donnie Simpson: Sorry.

00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:03.300
&gt;&gt; Woman #1: Over the years,
the opportunities to be paid

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:10.420 position:56%
and also how radio has gone from
the regular radio to, you know, the,

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:17.760
the one that we have in the stereo
with all of that to the computer

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.090
and streaming and all of that.

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:21.400 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Donnie Simpson: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:24.430
&gt;&gt; Woman #1: So I'd like to
hear your resposne to that.

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:26.500
And also my favorite memory

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:29.440
of you is Teena Marie
singing to you by the piano.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.740
&gt;&gt; Donnie Simpson: Wow!

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:32.040
Yeah. Yeah.

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:33.340
&gt;&gt; Woman #1: That was very nice.

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:34.640
Thank you [inaudible].

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.940
&gt;&gt; Donnie Simpson: Wow!

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:37.240
Wow! You know, I'd actually
forgotten about that,

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:38.760
and then the morning after
Teena died, somebody posted on,

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:41.200
on Facebook and I saw
it and went wow.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.520
I just, I forget about,
you know, I, I don't know.

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:47.520
I never think the go-to
video that, well,

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:50.650
you got video with
all of these people.

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:53.280
But yeah, that was really special.

00:25:53.280 --> 00:26:01.220
She was, Teena was really, really
cool, something, something special.

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:03.750
But you know, for me, well,

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:08.710
you asked about the
music industry and radio.

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:12.070
You know, it's, it's funny,
Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:16.060
and I have had this conversation

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:20.150
about how our industries
parallel each other.

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:25.370
And, and I was struggling
with what they have become.

00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:29.690 position:56%
You know, that so much of the
creativity has been taken out of it,

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:32.330
out of, you know, you know, music.

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:35.380
Especially when you
talk about R&amp;B music.

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:38.130
You know, it's pretty
sad state to me.

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:43.060
And it, and it bothers me that,
you know, we just, you know,

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:48.090
used to be the top 30
songs in the country

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:50.370
on the Billboard hot
charts you'd see the O'Jay's

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:52.970
and Teddy Pendergrass, and
of course, Michael Jackson.

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:57.120
But you know, you had real soul
music that charted all the time,

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:00.330
and it just doesn't happen anymore.

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:02.830
You know, I mean if, if you want
to call Rihanna soul, you know,

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:04.130
it's just, you know, not for me.

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:05.660
It's not R&amp;B.

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:07.340
It's not R&amp;B.

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:12.730
And so, you know, so, so I hate
that, but you know, with radio,

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:15.820
it's been stripped
of its personality.

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:17.720
You know, broadcast radio.

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.710
And what happened was that they,

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:22.060
there was a new rating
service called PPM.

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:24.840
Well, it was a new ratings system.

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:29.240
For years it was done by diary
where they would send you a diary.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.550
You would keep it for two weeks.

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:36.460
You were supposed to write down
what radio station you listened to

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:39.060
and how long you listened.

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:40.360
That didn't happen.

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:43.400
What happened is you go, God,
I forgot to send this thing in.

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:47.830
Let, alright, well last Thursday
I listened to WKYS for 14 hours.

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:49.490
So it was imperfect.

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:51.200
So I get, so they tried to come

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.970
up with something that
could correct that.

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:59.710
They came up with these
little boxes that you wear.

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:01.010
It looked like a pager.

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:02.790
And it picks up whatever
it's hearing.

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:05.290
Now, problem with it is that it
may not be your choice of radio.

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:08.700
If we're sitting in the
Cheesecake Factory chilling,

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:10.000
whatever they playing,

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.800
this is getting all the credit even
though I don't want to hear this.

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:14.100
You know. We go to Old
Navy shopping, same thing.

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:15.400
You know. So that's imperfect also.

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.700
But what happened was
that, for black stations

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:18.000
in particular across this country.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.300
I mean the impact was immediate.

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:20.600
Stations that were perennial
number ones for 25, 30 years,

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:21.900
went from number one
to 15, 16th place.

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:23.200
Immediately.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.500
It was unbelievable.

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:25.800
Never seen anything like it.

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.100
And then radio stations
that, we had the first book,

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:28.400
we had a radio station
here came up number one.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:29.700
What was it?

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:31.000 position:56%
Oh, WFRE. We're radio people sitting
in this going who the hell are they?

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.300
[ Laughter ]

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:33.600
Number, never heard of them.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:34.900
And so a country and western
station from Frederick, Maryland,

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:36.740
was number one in D.C.
I'm like, come on, man.

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:38.040
You got --

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.340
[ Laughter ]

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:40.640
Come on, man.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:41.940
I'm telling you.

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:43.240
It was, it was that deep.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.740
I remember having this conversation
with Stevie Wonder one night.

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:47.510
And I'm not dropping names, but --

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:50.360
[ Laughter ]

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:51.660
-- but really.

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:52.960
We, we were talking.

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.260
We were hanging out.

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:55.560
We were talking about it, and I
asked him how was his station.

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:58.680 position:56%
He owns a station, has since the mid
70's in California, in Los Angeles.

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:03.050
And I said how is, I can't
even think of the call letters.

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:05.240
Kindness, love, joy, KJLH.

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.150
Kindness, joy, love, and happiness.

00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:09.490
I said I, how, how are
you doing with KJLH?

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:10.990
He says man, we're getting killed.

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:13.500
He said this, man this
PPM thing is crazy,

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.300
and anybody believes this is crazy.

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:16.600
This is ridiculous.

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:18.130
I said I know, man.

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:21.470
I said, you know, this
is like trying,

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:24.320
take radio from black people.

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.750
You know, and, and there
were inquiries into that

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:28.640
because it seemed so calculated.

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:33.210 position:56%
But, so anyway, in response to that,
radio stations got to the point

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:35.770
where they started trying
to just program music

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:37.670
because they wanted
to get those hits.

00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:40.660
When you're in Old Navy
and the Cheesecake Factory

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:43.440
and they figure they got
a better chance of doing

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:48.480
that with music playing than
with someone talking, ok.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.800
That's one of the problems.

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.830 position:56%
The other problem, and this is
probably bigger than that, actually,

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:57.790
is that all of the advertising
dollars went to the internet.

00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:02.710
Ok? So, you know, that impacted
us in terms of salaries and stuff.

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:04.510
Jim Vance, to drop another name --

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:10.170
[ Laughter ]

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:11.920
These's my boys.

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.370
[ Laughter ]

00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:15.670
These's my boys.

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:18.180
So yeah, me and Vance were
talking about it one night and just

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:22.410
about how, like, you know, in radio
and television because of this,

00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:26.500
because those advertising
dollars had gone to the internet

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:29.590
that salaries were coming down.

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:34.470
And the kind of numbers that
I posted as a personality

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:36.740
for local radio, you'll
never see again.

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.250
It'll never happen.

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:39.930
Because the money is not there.

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:41.230
It's just not there.

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:42.530
It's gone to the internet.

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:44.130
They found an alternative
way to advertise.

00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:45.990
And Jim Vance and I were
talking about the fact

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:50.020
that we were lucky that, in our
business, we were in radio and TV,

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:52.280
we were just experiencing pay cuts.

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:57.170
Print was closing their doors
because of this same issue.

00:30:57.170 --> 00:31:03.970
So, so when you have
less revenue to pay,

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:06.360
you want to cut down a personality.

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.610
If, if you can, if you can
prove that it's just music,

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:11.800
if I just play these three
songs in this order every day,

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.630
then you don't need
to pay Donnie Simpson.

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:18.030
Yeah. But, what they're finding
out is that well, maybe we do.

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:20.040
[ Laughter ]

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:23.390
You know, because the, the only
thing, you know, from, this is,

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:25.430
this is not rocket science.

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:29.300
From day one I learned that the
only thing that makes you listen

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:32.800
to me other than the
guy next to me is me,

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.240
is the way, the way it's presented.

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.670
We all get the same records.

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:38.290
You know, you can hear
the same music anywhere.

00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:43.390
You know, and, and, and to me,
when, for radio to try to make it

00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:48.300 position:56%
so music intensive, to take, to take
the personality out of it at a time

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:50.500
when you can least afford
to be music intensive.

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:54.140
Man, I got all the music
I can stand right here.

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:57.700
In my iPhone, my iPad,
Pandora, Spotify.

00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:00.280
Good luck out playing music to me.

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:02.510
You know, I need somebody
to present it to me,

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:04.170
to do something different with it.

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:06.630
So that's the state of radio.

00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:07.930
That's, sorry.

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:09.230
Yes?

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:10.530
&gt;&gt; Woman #2: I wondered
since you started off

00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:11.850
in Detroit [inaudible]
Detroit is in such bad shape --

00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:13.150
&gt;&gt; Donnie Simpson: Yeah.

00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:16.270
&gt;&gt; Woman #2: -- have you
done any humanitarian things

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:18.930
to help [inaudible]
back on its feet?

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:20.230
&gt;&gt; Donnie Simpson: I
just try to stay away.

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:21.530
[ Laughter ]

00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:23.330
No.

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:27.050
[ Laughter ]

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:28.870
No, I'm sorry.

00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:30.200
I'm sorry.

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:33.310
No, no. Well, you know
what, I mean I, I,

00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:35.520
I am home a couple times a year.

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:41.400
Part of a, this is not Detroit,
but it's kind of Detroit,

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:47.870
but have involved in a project to,
to bring some clean water to Flint.

00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:49.970
I mean that's, you know,
even the people of Detroit,

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:51.740
as bad as things are
in Detroit right now,

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:53.880
that's been Detroit's
focus is Flint.

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:57.230
You know, trying to
save, help save Flint.

00:32:57.230 --> 00:33:00.210
But you know, I mean I've
been asked to come back home,

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:02.850
make appearances in
Detroit, which I do.

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:06.370
You know, I've always
supported Detroit.

00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:09.340
You know, I'm, people here always
say how long you been here.

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:11.600
I go, you know, 40 years now.

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:12.900
Well you a D.C. boy.

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:16.010
I say I could be here 140
years, I'm from Detroit.

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:17.310
[ Laughter ]

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:21.770
You know, that, that's, and
when I'm done, send me back.

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:26.460 position:56%
Right. But you know, so yeah, I mean
I've always been a part of Detroit

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:28.470
and a part of things
to try to help it.

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:29.770
It's a bad situation there.

00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:33.060
I mean make no mistake
about it, but you know.

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:35.800
The former mayor was a very
good friend of mine, Dave Bing.

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:39.190
Dave, well a lot of people
know him from basketball.

00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:40.490
He played in NBA.

00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:42.840
He's from D.C. D.C. boy.

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:46.310
So Dave would have me back
to be a part of things to try

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:50.550
to help Detroit, you know,
as, as much as we can.

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:51.850
Yeah, but it's bad.

00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:56.510 position:56%
I mean it's, you know, the
population has gone from 2.6 million

00:33:56.510 --> 00:34:01.160
to 800,000 in 30 years
in Detroit, you know.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:03.790 position:56%
There are blocks, you go there where
it's, you know, where there used

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:05.380
to be 40 homes, now there's two.

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:09.390
You know, I mean it's just,
it's like a bomb dropped there.

00:34:09.390 --> 00:34:11.420
It, it's really, really sad.

00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:13.860
But, but you know what,
I'll say this, too, though,

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:17.510
that those two homes that
you do see, look at the lawn.

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:20.170
[ Laughter ]

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:21.470
Proud. Proud.

00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:23.710
You know, it's a proud
city, and, and yeah.

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:27.360
So you know, it, it's tough but
people haven't given up hope.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:31.510
You know, so, oh, is that it.

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:34.050
[ Laughter ]

00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:38.990
Well, hey, thank you all again.

00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:41.720
God bless you!

00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:43.020
Thank you!
