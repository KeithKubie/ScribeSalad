dramatic difference and that just
 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.610

I look at them as almost unattractive
 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.650
I look at them as almost unattractive
just because of the nightmares that they

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660
just because of the nightmares that they

that they sort of project if you look at

the National Health Service in England I

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910
the National Health Service in England I
 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.240
the National Health Service in England I
know people think of that as like how

competitive health health care market
 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.260
competitive health health care market
becomes much more attractive than a
