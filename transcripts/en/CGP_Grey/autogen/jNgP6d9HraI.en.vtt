00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.140
 1066! The start of the royal family on these beautiful islands. Well, there were kings and mini 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.380
 statues before and druids before, and Pangea before, but we have to start somewhere 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.730
 and a millennium ago is far enough - if Ethelred let the Undecided out, 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:14.660
 then so be it. 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.540
 William the Conqueror conquered in the 'Norman Conquest' - Norman standing for * French *. 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.160
 Because it was the days of yore, they had many children, but to keep it simple, this tribe leaves 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.390
 tree many of them out on every branch because not every child matters. 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.129
 For example, Willem had three children that we think are important: Willem II, Hendrik I and Adela. 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:35.390
 If you have watched the royal succession video - if not, click here - then you know 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.210
 that formal rules for passing the crown will be established, but for now it is one 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.309
 'free-for-all', home-team advantage for the eldest son, but never forget: greater-army diplomacy. 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.870
 After the death of William the Conqueror, William II became king. 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.820
 William II did not marry, and one day with his brother he died in a "hunting accident" 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.350
 that Henry I gave the crown. 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.030
 Henry I had at least 26 children, of whom only two were 100% legitimate. He stated that his 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.909
 daughter after him (after his son died in a shipwreck) and swore his knights 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:03.199
 Honoring Empress Mathilda by inserting a needle through their hearts, hoping to die, stabbing a needle in their eye 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.430
 - * but * when Henry I died while Mathilda was in France, many ignored this while her 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.220
 cousin Stephen rushed to Westminster, using faster army diplomacy, to be the first to be crowned. 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.610
 Empress Mathilda possibly came back and started a decades-long civil war - that 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.690
 an impasse was because turtling was an effective RTS tactic in the 1100s. 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.060
 While she ruled part of the island, but because Mathilda never had an official coronation 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.600
 its status as a monarch has been challenged. 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.590
 Well, because Stephen's children were either dead, or uninterested, or a nun - his crown went 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.250
 after his nephew, Hendrik II, who had four sons: Hendrik de Jonge, Richard Leeuwenhart, 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.170
 Jan without Land ... and Guffrey (guess who died before his turn). 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.400
 Henry II saw the history until then of conquest, assassination (perhaps), capture, wear and tear 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.690
 war - and decided to wait until after the death of the current king before sorting out 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.490
 of the next king did not work. 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.300
 So Henry II changed the system and Henry the Younger crowned him, with which 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.290
 the rule of two called: one is none. Two is one. If it is important, you need a backup. 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.590
 It was a good plan for stability, helped by the popularity of the young king, but unfortunately 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.960
 - the apprentice rebelled against the master, united his brothers - what still caused 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.890
 a civil war of disputed monarchs, during which Hendrik the Younger died of dysentery, Hendrik 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.729
 the Elder died of a fever and Richard I took the crown. 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.079
 After Richard, Jan and four eldest son successions came in a row: from Jan to Hendrik III (place 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:17.730
 Magna Carta here) to Eduard I (de Stelt) to Eduard II to Eduard III. 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.819
 In fact, Ed II was overthrown by Isabella of France AKA, the she-wolf of France AKA 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.590
 his wife. After the removal of her husband, she worked as a regent for their son. All of 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.170
 these arrows skip a bit of complexity. 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.689
 Eduard III had five sons: Eduard the Black Prince, Lionel, Jan, Edmund and Thomas, 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:36.139
 none of whom would wear the crown. 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:39.969
 When Edward III died, his throne would have gone to the Black Prince, but he was then 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:43.719
 dead, so the crown went to his boring son Richard, now the second. 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:46.629
 There is some drama lama fuss around Richard the second where your English teacher 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:50.670
 you might be forced to read about it - but, spoiler alert, the end of history is always the same: 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.670
 greater army diplomacy, this time from Henry IV who gets the crown and Richard II 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.180
 hunger in captivity. 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.480
 Another Hendrik before we arrive at the Rose War: 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.200
 A war that brings fear (and boredom) into the minds of history students throughout the nation 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.069
 those dealing with * this * family tree get 'simplified' to explain why everyone was angry, 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.269
 but the shortest version ever is that the great-great-grandsons of Eduard III fought each other, even though 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.310
 one of them was dead for part of the fight, but we can't talk about that now 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.290
 so from Henry VI to Eduard IV to Hendrik VI to Eduard IV. End. 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.650
 Edward IV, on his deathbed, left the crown to his son. But since he was twelve he needed protection, 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.029
 so Richard, his "best" uncle in the world, promised to take very good care of him. 

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:31.999
 Eduard V quickly disappeared under suspicious circumstances that cause Richard 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:32.810
 Richard became the third. 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.299
 But he did not remain king for long because Eduard III's great-great-great-grandson, 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.499
 Henry VII took the crown, attached a ring to Elizabeth of York to that royal 

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:45.680
 to get identification and begotten Henry VIII - splitter of churches and women. 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.029
 Henry VIII thought it was high time to formalize the rules of inheritance, he wrote 

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:54.689
 out in his will - which actually said: oldest boys first, only girls if none 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:56.719
 are boys - and Parliament approved the rules. 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:00.859
 This should have made everything tidy, but we almost entered the horrible one 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:01.969
 messy time ... 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:06.809
 ... Because Hendrik's son lived just long enough to ruin it - inheriting the throne 

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:10.980
 At the age of 9 there was, of course, a cunning patron who arranged it all, but he decided at the age of fifteen 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.260
 that his father's rules were stupid and his sisters were stupid and that his cousin, 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.479
 Lady Jane Gray, instead, had to be the next monarch. 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:22.680
 Then he died and Lady Jane Gray became queen with her sweet sixteen, sort of - on a disputed 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:29.169
 status way for nine days, until she was beheaded by Maria, the first, really official, nobody 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:30.389
 doubt the queen. 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.690
 Maria had no children and passed on the crown to Elizabeth I who was the second 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.470
 became a queen in a row ... to have no children either. But, no problem because Lady Jane was Gray 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.229
 at the ... o. Yes. 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:45.720
 Well, this is the point where we acknowledge, Scotland exists. They have their own 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.310
 did a royal thing that for our purposes joins the British branch when the great-great-granddaughter of Eduard III 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.580
 got married in it in the 1400s and then goes like: Jacobus, Jacobus, Jacobus, Jacobus, Jacobus, Maria queen 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.650
 der Schotten, Jacobus. Which brings us back to the 1600s. 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.090
 Importantly enough, the sister of Henry VIII also married in this line of the family, some English 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.780
 gives legitimacy points in the eyes of the English Parliament, which asked for the James of Scotland 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.419
 to borrow, which made him king of two countries with two numbers in his name, depending on where 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:13.580
 your vandaang counts. 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.879
 Jacobus had a son, Charles I, and you would think that this unification of the monarchs means that 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:19.879
 the terribly messy time is over. 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:20.919
 But no. 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:22.169
 Because Cromwell. 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:27.580
 Cromwell did not like kings and beheaded Charles I. He declared: no more kings and he made himself 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.669
 the Lord Protector, which was in no way like a king - even though he was the boss and 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:35.039
 it was a hereditary position that he passed on to his son. 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:39.960
 But the Cromwells didn't stay - mainly because his son was a rural squire 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.560
 rule 0 did not follow: keep the army happy - what the son of Charles, Charles II, allowed 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.449
 restore the monarchy. 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:51.210
 Charles II had many children, all of whom were bastards, leaving his brother, Jacobus 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:56.979
 II was the next in line. But James was * Catholic * and since Hendrik had split the church, had 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:02.919
 Catholics little popularity. But well enough, he had decent Protestant daughters, one of whom 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:07.879
 was married to a Dutch prince, who by nature was the grandson of Charles I. 

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:11.169
 Extra English legitimacy points, plus, who doesn't love the Dutch? 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:16.220
 With James so unpopular and Willem and Maria so popular, the army and nobility invited 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.479
 the royal chief about to "invade" and James II fled. 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:24.879
 Willem and Maria reigned as co-monarchs, but without children the crown went to Queen Anna, 

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:29.669
 who also did not produce heirs, but not for lack of effort - she was 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:31.090
 * seventeen * times pregnant. 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:36.610
 Now that they were back in a situation without royalty, the Parliament decided that it was really 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:41.599
 Seriously it was time to lay down the inheritance rules to prevent pretense from all 

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:44.689
 branches of this messy tree started fighting for the crown. 

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:49.110
 Parliament did a royal 'reboot' to clean up the mess, and they defined Sophia of Hanover - 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.639
 Jacobus' granddaughter two numbers as the new starting point for all claims to the crown. 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:57.389
 The rules finally remained, ending the terribly messy time. 

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:01.409
 George I, the son of Sophia, was the first king under the new rules, and then his son George II, 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:05.939
 to George III, and even though he lost America and his mind, no fear, the rules are here, 

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:10.030
 and so the crown went calmly further down the family tree, to George IV, who none 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.629
 had surviving children, after Willem IV who had ten children - all bastards, 

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:18.909
 then through his dead younger brother to Queen Victoria who started her reign in 

00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:23.610
 1837 and who made it just over the finish line of the 20th century. A little double 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.250
 was an impressively long time given the state of medical technology at the time. After the end of her 

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.419
 period, the crown went to her son Eduard VII to George V ... 

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:34.569
 to Eduard VII who * finally * breaks through this neat (and rather boring) line of legacy 

00:07:34.569 --> 00:07:39.949
 commit a scandal: marry a citizen. An American citizen! American one 

00:07:39.949 --> 00:07:43.060
 citizen who was * divorced *! *Twice* 

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:43.849
 :: Gasp :: 

00:07:43.849 --> 00:07:48.229
 The divorces were actually a problem and incompatible with the role 

00:07:48.229 --> 00:07:53.270
 of the monarch as Head of State * and also * the Church of England in the 1930s. Edward resigned 

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:58.639
 to his brother George VI - who was unwilling to take the crown, and then too 

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:03.669
 the Second World War and the subsequent demolition of the British Empire had to oversee - what health 

00:08:03.669 --> 00:08:09.180
 of the young king, who died at the age of 56 and left the crown to Elizabeth the Second, in 1952 

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:15.499
 at the age of 25. Seven years older than Victoria, her great-great grandmother, was on her coronations 

00:08:15.499 --> 00:08:20.719
 day, but in September 2015, Elizabeth became the tallest reigning queen in not only 

00:08:20.719 --> 00:08:22.930
 the Briste history, but also in world history. 

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:27.789
 From Elizabeth II the crown will continue to Charles, the longest heir apparently in the British 

00:08:27.789 --> 00:08:30.599
 history to his son William, to his son George. 

00:08:30.599 --> 00:08:59.220
 And that, is a brief history of the royal family.
