00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.449
The Kurds they're a world's largest
ethnic group without a country. They're

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.750
spread across one of the most volatile
regions in the world. And you've

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.710
definitely heard of them. Kurdish
militias across Iraq and Syria have

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.910
gained some popularity in the United
States, but there still isn't much

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.410
support for an independent Kurdish state.
Why is that the case? Well it's

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.800
complicated
hey guys I'm Sunna this is AJ plus and

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.029
this Sunday I want to talk about why
making a Kurdish state happen is gonna

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:35.730
be tough so the Kurds have been getting
a lot of international attention in the

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.860
last few years because of their role in
the conflicts in Iraq and Syria Kurdish

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.059
militias have been battling Isis Syrian
rebels the Iraqi and Syrian government's

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.649
to stake claim to land and to also
protect Kurdish communities and October

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.020
2017 Kurds in Iraqi Kurdistan took part
in a referendum in which 93% of those

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.039
who voted chose independence but the
Iraqi government called a referendum

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.690
illegal and non-binding and while the
referendum was considered a big moment

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.500
in Kurdish political history what
happened in Iraqi Kurdistan didn't

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.610
necessarily represent the direction of
all Kurdish people and Annisa coogee a

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.490
lecturer at UC Berkeley breaks down why
that's the case

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.920
there is no single Kurdish independence
movement after the world war 1 Kurdistan

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.460
was divided into 4 nation-states Iran
Iraq Turkey and Syria so with that let's

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.030
roll back a bit and look at how the
Kurds have ended up where they are today

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.710
the Kurds are the fourth largest ethnic
group in the region and make up sizeable

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.869
minority populations across Iran Iraq
Syria and Turkey despite having big

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.960
numbers they didn't get their own state
after the fall of the Ottoman Empire

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.189
when the United Kingdom and France were
busy carving up the region the infamous

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.460
sykes-picot agreement split the Ottoman
Empire into nation-states

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.670
but it didn't really care about how
ethical a diverse the region actually

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.649
was the Kurds left out of sykes-picot
had negotiated their own state under the

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.180
Treaty of 7 but that didn't work out the
treaty was supposed to split modern-day

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.740
turkey into different zones including
one for the Kurds but it wasn't ratified

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.580
thanks to one Turkish nationalists led
by Kemal Ataturk Turkey's first

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.530
president Riek
captured all of modern Turkey from the

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.150
Europeans fast forward to the 1930s 40s
and 50s when we start seeing countries

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.680
across the region and gain independence
from European colonialism a huge part of

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.890
pushing back against European
colonialism was the cultivation of

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.450
various nationalisms pan-arabism for
instance turkeys camel ism or Iranian

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.200
nationalism all of this meant that
Kurdish sovereignty was either not a

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.120
priority for pan Erebus leaders in Iraq
and Syria or was a threat for Kamala's

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.799
Turkey and for Iran that meant that over
the 20th century the Kurds across these

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.760
four countries saw a lot of
marginalization there was displacement

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.690
political repression loss of rights and
massacres and it's not as though the

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.040
Kurds didn't resist their oppression
time and time again they did now the

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.000
brunt of the state violence faced by
Kurds was in Turkey in Iraq in Turkey

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.959
the government forcibly displaced over a
million Kurds after several Kurdish

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.129
revolts in the 1920s and 30s Kurdish
language and culture was banned and

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.760
violence against a Kurdish population
including torture and destruction of

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.810
villages was widespread Kurds in Iraq
saw the height of state repression in

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.709
the late 80s and early 90s under the
leadership of Saddam Hussein the Iraqi

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.489
government / saw several massacres of
Kurdish civilians during the iran-iraq

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.209
war the government accused Kurdish
fighters along the Iranian border of

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.470
assisting the Iranians and led what was
called the unfiled campaign it lasted

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.519
two years and claimed thousands of
Kurdish lives by the end of the 1980s

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:41.620
Iraq in the 90s saw the first Gulf War
Kurdish civil war and hundreds of

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.060
thousands of Iraqi deaths as a result of
the international sanctions then we get

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.349
to the early 2000s where there was the
American invasion of Iraq so that brings

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.979
us now to today a push for Kurdish
independence and the resistance to it

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:58.030
Iraqi Kurdish journalist Abdullah hueso
told me how it's important to think of

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.290
Kurdistan as more than just a political
aspirations so the idea of having a

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.879
Kurdish state is not only political
dream it's actually part of the culture

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:11.949
of Kurds it's part of their identity
they have been raised with thinking that

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:15.280
Kurds deserve a statement so who's
standing in the way let's start with

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.859
Turkey and Iran Iran and Turkey are very
much against the establishment of a

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.980
Kurdish state
even outside of the borders because they

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.560
feel that if there is a Kurdish
political entity anywhere in the Middle

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:37.470
East this would threaten the so-called
national unity of these two countries

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.389
turkey considers groups like the PKK aka
the Kurdistan Workers Party to beat

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.470
terrorist groups and threats to national
security Turkey also fears an

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.850
independent Kurdish state in Iraq would
be used as a base for the PKK to launch

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.060
attacks on the Turkish military and
civilian populations Turkish

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.169
nationalists see Kurdish aspirations
inside its borders and outside as a

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.729
threat to while Turkish state identity
remember I mentioned how back in the

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.750
1930s Kurds were barred in Turkey from
speaking their own language and

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.650
practicing your own culture well it was
only in 2012 that they were allowed to

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.130
teach their own language and culture in
private schools

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.479
then there's Iran Iran also has no
interest in seeing an independent

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:22.139
Kurdish state given its own Kurdish
population in the country's Northwest as

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.250
well as its relationship with Iraq
currently Iran has very close relations

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.970
with the Iraqi government seeing it as a
buffer between itself and hostile

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.570
regional neighbors a Kurdish state that
would be seen as friendly to the United

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.440
States and Israel isn't exactly the most
tantalizing thought for the Iranians

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.789
then we've got Iraq and Syria both
embroiled in conflict following the

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:46.260
Krenim the Iraqi government responded by
launching an offensive to take the city

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.610
of Kirkuk which had been under Kurush
control since 2014 who waste by the way

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.479
says that Kirkuk is central to Kurdish
statehood

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:59.580
a vital part of any kurdish project for
statehood not only because of its wealth

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.229
and its oil which is actually very
important for for any any kurdish state

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:08.639
especially economically but also
historically worse thing without per

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:14.070
cube a quarter state would be very poor
even culturally then there syria workers

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.510
have seen some reforms in recent years
and workers forces have been integral in

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:22.740
the battle against Isis in 2011 as
protests were spreading across Syria the

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.970
government granted around 300,000
undocumented Kurds citizenship

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:31.770
citizenship that was stripped back in
1962 but serious Kurds are seeking a

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:36.310
federal system in the country similar to
Iraqi Kurdistan's autonomous

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.520
as for the Americans while they've
supported the Kurds throughout the

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.210
decades they don't actually support a
Kurdish state according to the official

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:46.840
line a Kurdish state in Iraq where the
movement is the strongest who would mean

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.639
further destabilization of a vital US
ally but its closest ally in the region

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:55.419
Israel has actually been vocally
supportive of an independent Kurdish

00:06:55.419 --> 00:07:00.219
state Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
sees Kurdistan as a potential ally for

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:04.599
Israel in a region where it feels
surrounded by well not that many allies

00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:09.879
so what is the likelihood of there being
a Kurdish state anytime soon or at all

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:15.719
well according to ways not too likely
Kurds have realized without have seeking

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:19.300
support from their regional and
international powers it's almost

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.349
impossible to build a state especially
that Kurdistan is a small region and

00:07:23.349 --> 00:07:27.759
it's landlocked surrounded by hostile
countries so for that it's very

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:31.960
difficult to build a state without
building a strong diplomatic approaches

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:36.249
it's also worth noting that not all
Kurdish populations follow the Iraqi

00:07:36.249 --> 00:07:40.270
Kurdish movement for independence per se
when you look at other parts of

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:45.580
Kurdistan for instance the Turkish part
the Syrian part in both parts - Kurdish

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:49.000
nationalist movement is not asking for
independence actually they are seeking a

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.789
solution within the existing borders so
they are trying to democratize the state

00:07:54.789 --> 00:08:00.009
so that no curse would have a favorable
environment and as the QG also says that

00:08:00.009 --> 00:08:05.370
lack of political cohesion is because of
weak leadership it has a lot to do with

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:11.830
the fragmentation of the Kurdish society
along tribal regional and linguistic

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:17.469
lines and again the inability of the
Kurdish leadership to bring all the

00:08:17.469 --> 00:08:23.710
segments together to create one voice
which would carry the curse - initially

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:28.300
the Kurds have a long history of not
only marginalization but of resisting

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:32.199
that marginalization but given how the
Kurdistan region is surrounded by

00:08:32.199 --> 00:08:36.099
hostile countries lacks political
cohesion and even agreement on the

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:40.089
nation's future it's not very likely
that the world's largest nation without

00:08:40.089 --> 00:08:46.060
a state will be getting one anytime soon
so we barely scratched the surface when

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:49.480
it comes to the Kurdish independence
movement encouraged politics in general

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.570

communities that are searching for
