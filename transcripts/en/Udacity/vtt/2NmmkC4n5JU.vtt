Alright, now we can actually dive in and

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.930
give a definition for PAC-learnable. So, a concept class,

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.640
C, is PAC-learnable by some learning algorithm, L, using

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.760
its own representation of hypothesis, H, if and only

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.190
if that learner will, with high probability, at least

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.090
1 minus Delta, ouput a hypothesis h, little h,

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.470
from its set of hypothesis. That has error less

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.040
than or equal to epsilon, so it's very accurate.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.120
And it needs to be the case that the time that it takes

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.259
to do this. And the number of samples that it needs draws from

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.070
this distribution D is relatively small. In fact, bounded by polynomial in one

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.460
over epsilon, one over delta and the size of the hypothesis space n.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.306
&gt;&gt; Okay, so in other words you're saying something is

00:00:44.306 --> 00:00:51.182
PAC-learnable if you can learn to get low error, at least

00:00:51.182 --> 00:00:54.330
with some high confidence you can be fairly confident that you will have

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.300
a low error in time that's sort of polynomial in all the parameters.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.910
&gt;&gt; Exactly, and you can see here that this, this epsilon and delta

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.239
actually giving us a lot of wiggle room, if you really want to

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.930
have perfect error. Or perfect certainty. Then these things go to infinity. So,

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.160
you just, you need, you need to look at all the possible data.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.220
&gt;&gt; Mm.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.780
&gt;&gt; So, yeah this is really going to only give us partial guarantees.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.780
&gt;&gt;

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.200
Okay. Sure. Okay, I think I understand that. .
