00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.060
- Hey everyone, I hope you're having

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.810
an amazing day or evening.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.970
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in
Sapporo on the island

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.790
of Hokkaido in Northern Japan.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.470
And tonight for dinner, you've
heard of Japanese barbecue,

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.334
Japanese barbecue is very
popular, it's amazing.

00:00:13.334 --> 00:00:18.290
But in Hokkaido, in Sapporo,
they have a special type

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.583
of Japanese barbecue which
is called Genghis Khan.

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:25.172
(upbeat music)

00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:35.390
So actually, I'm on a
family trip in Sapporo,

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.510
but Ying and her sisters,
they're off shopping,

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.320
and so I thought this
would be a perfect time

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.050
to go eat some Genghis Khan barbecue.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.010
Again, Japanese barbecue is wonderful,

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.140
it's amazing, I love Japanese barbecue.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.370
But you won't typically find lamb cooked,

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.320
used as Japanese barbecue
except in Sapporo.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.420
So this is gonna be a first for me,

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.990
we have just arrived to the restaurant.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.853
And we're gonna go have
some Genghis Khan barbecue.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.203
Kay, this is the spot I believe.

00:01:11.657 --> 00:01:14.324
(door creaking)

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.303
Hello just one, yeah.

00:01:27.081 --> 00:01:30.260
(mutters) And then draft beer please.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.010
Okay so you immediately
step inside of here,

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.020
you can smell the lamb
smoke, it's all lamb,

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.952
Genghis Khan, they serve lamb barbecue.

00:01:36.952 --> 00:01:40.560
Some say because it is lamb,
and lamb's not typically

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.094
eaten in Japan,

00:01:42.094 --> 00:01:44.780
but it's typically
considered from Mongolia.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:45.840
And then number two, some say

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.090
it's called Genghis Khan
barbecue because of the metal

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.852
grate that they use to grill

00:01:50.852 --> 00:01:54.770
which resembles a
Mongolian warrior helmet.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.708
As soon as you step inside, you sit down,

00:01:57.708 --> 00:01:59.500
they put a metal grate on your table,

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.150
they fill it with onions,
they put a piece of fat on.

00:02:03.988 --> 00:02:06.655
(meat sizzling)

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.650
And you gotta beer with me a little bit,

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.540
it's really kinda tight in here,

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.210
and I'm trying to like only film myself

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.830
so that everybody can eat in private,

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.670
but this is an amazing environment.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.645
It's so smokey, it's so warm in here.

00:02:40.645 --> 00:02:44.040
(meat sizzling)

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.550
Dip it into the sauce,

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.390
you can eat it half
raw, I think it's fine.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.300
And it looks like a soy sauce,

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.100
but there's also sesame seeds in it.

00:02:52.582 --> 00:02:55.665
(distant chattering)

00:02:56.803 --> 00:02:58.053
Wow,

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:01.003
it's so tender.

00:03:02.787 --> 00:03:04.950
It's so smokey, and that's
actually quite lean,

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.080
and then that sauce is like,
it's like soy based sauce,

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.340
but you taste the sesame seeds in it.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.710
Oh that is stunning, oh wow that's tasty.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.377
(speaking foreign language)

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.950
I put some of the chili
and some of the garlic

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:42.973
into the sauce.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.120
I'm just blown away by the
tenderness of that meat,

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.160
it's unbelievable.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.660
And I think you can even
cook it just rare as well.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.615
Plus I'm gonna try my
next piece more rare.

00:03:57.615 --> 00:04:00.282
(meat sizzling)

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.750
Okay, this is more of a
rare piece of the lamb.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:18.520
That's stunning.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.220
It's so flavorful, the sauce
is amazing, this environment,

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.363
like the whole like, smokey
lamb grill atmosphere.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.610
Okay, the onions.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.673
Mm,

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.040
oh it's delicious too.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.973
Oh, she is chopping up an
entire piece of lamb over there.

00:04:47.679 --> 00:04:50.429
Can I have a plate with the bone?

00:04:53.483 --> 00:04:55.170
(speaking foreign language)

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.570
That first plate went
down so fast and so easy,

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.380
I immediately ordered another plate,

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.838
this one I got with the rib.

00:05:00.838 --> 00:05:03.505
(meat sizzling)

00:05:42.863 --> 00:05:45.390
Okay, that's definitely a fattier cut

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.583
than the first plate that I had.

00:05:47.583 --> 00:05:48.900
The first plate that I had,

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.070
it tasted juicy, and it's so ultra tender.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.737
(meat sizzling)

00:05:57.746 --> 00:06:00.329
(upbeat music)

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.670
Okay time for my rib,

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:08.960
and I love how they wrap it in a napkin

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.041
so that you can hold it by
the bone like a drumstick.

00:06:12.041 --> 00:06:14.624
(upbeat music)

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:19.850
Wow,

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.790
the juicy tenderness
is almost unbelievable,

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:23.940
it's so good.

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.053
Okay, one more plate.

00:06:26.414 --> 00:06:27.680
Can I have one more?

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.513
One more bone,

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.903
thank you.

00:06:30.903 --> 00:06:34.557
(speaking foreign language)

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:42.979
(meat sizzling)
(distant chattering)

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.943
One more plate of lamb joy,
I just couldn't resist.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.220
It's just as good as the plate before.

00:07:11.127 --> 00:07:13.794
(meat sizzling)

00:07:21.048 --> 00:07:23.215
Every bite is spectacular.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.070
It's all good, but this
drumstick is just unbelievable,

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:33.770
it is, you have to get the
lamb drumstick, final bite.

00:07:39.429 --> 00:07:41.096
It just bursts with,

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:45.130
the ribs have a little bit more
of a lamb pronounced flavor,

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:47.900
the rest of the meat is
just so neutral tasting.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.840
So juicy, so tender, so
like ultra flavorful,

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.290
that is spectacular.

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:55.280
And one of the reasons why it's so good

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.059
is because she slices
it right in front of you

00:07:57.059 --> 00:08:00.310
before you grill it, it's so fresh,

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:03.133
it's so clean, it's so unbelievably good.

00:08:08.415 --> 00:08:09.248
Oh, to drink like soup?

00:08:09.248 --> 00:08:11.194
- Soup.
- Okay, thank you.

00:08:11.194 --> 00:08:12.861
Thank you very much.

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:16.000
She takes your sauce, she actually like

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.730
dumps out a little bit if
you have too much stuff,

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:20.330
sauce left, puts in some
hot water into your sauce,

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.670
and that makes the soup, that's
the final thing you drink

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:23.753
to wash it all down.

00:08:26.989 --> 00:08:28.800
Mm, oh yeah it's very light.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.480
She did like take out a
little bit of my sauce

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.000
so that it's not too strong.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.330
But that's good, that's like,

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.890
it has a little bit of
lamb residue left in it.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:36.890
You taste the sesame seeds,

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:41.130
you taste the soy sauce base

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:44.060
kinda I think flavor of it,

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:45.480
but then very light
because of the hot water,

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.167
it has (stammers) diluted it,

00:08:48.167 --> 00:08:49.874
and that's a good way to end.

00:08:49.874 --> 00:08:52.291
(slurps) Ah!

00:08:56.492 --> 00:09:00.159
(speaking foreign language)

00:09:05.189 --> 00:09:07.856
(door creaking)

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.803
Oh wow, I'm just blown away.

00:09:12.803 --> 00:09:16.310
That was one of the most memorable

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.200
meals I can think of
that I've had in Japan.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.380
So good, the meat was so good,

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:25.110
the atmosphere was just
absolutely spectacular.

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:27.960
I loved the entire like smokiness of it,

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.410
the lamb, oh man, that was amazing.

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:32.480
The bar counter seating,
you get to see everything

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.620
that they do.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:37.080
They make your fire, they
put the Genghis Khan helmet

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.600
grill right on top, they
fill it with onions,

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.600
it happens so fast, as
soon as you sit down.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.990
And then yeah, that meat wow,

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:47.910
it will blow your taste
buds off your tongue.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.270
This place is called Sapporo Genghis Khan,

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:50.810
and this is the main branch.

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:52.840
A couple things to know,
it's all bar counter seating,

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.340
it's really small, it's
only about 10 seats.

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.880
But luckily, I think if
you come at a non-peak hour

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.930
or time, you usually don't
have to wait too long.

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:02.550
I got right in, but
luckily I got right in,

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:05.797
and then right as I got there
it just filled up completely.

00:10:05.797 --> 00:10:09.540
The plates of meat are 1000 yen
each, so I got three plates,

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.100
they go down so easily.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.090
Yeah, this is an amazing little place,

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:14.697
I love it, it's on the upstairs floor.

00:10:14.697 --> 00:10:16.579
But you walk in, it
looks like a warehouse.

00:10:16.579 --> 00:10:19.190
More and more people are coming in now,

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:22.270
but such a, such an amazing place.

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:25.448
My mouth is just, it's
rejoicing now with flavor,

00:10:25.448 --> 00:10:27.600
and with smokiness lamb-iness.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.170
And also I filmed a few more videos

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:30.767
on the Sapporo Hokkaido trip,

00:10:30.767 --> 00:10:33.750
some amazing seafood, so
I'll have all the videos
