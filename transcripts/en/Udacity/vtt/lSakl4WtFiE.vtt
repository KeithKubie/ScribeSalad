So now I hope you understand the running time of look

00:00:03.198 --> 00:00:06.296
up well enough to be able to answer this question. This is

00:00:06.296 --> 00:00:09.140
definitely a fairly subjective question. And the question is, is our

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.760
look up fast enough? So the possible answers are yes, that it

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.440
is fast enough, that it depends on how many key words

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.500
there are in the index, that it depends on how many url's

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.500
there are, meaning the number of different pages that we crawled in

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.460
our web crawl. That it depends on how many look-ups we expect

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.570
to need to do. Or no; that it's not fast enough.
