JOHN MERRIFIELD: Hey, everybody.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.410
Welcome to Talks at Google.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.854
Is everybody excited
to see Lindsey?

00:00:07.854 --> 00:00:10.730
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.250
Well, just as a little
introduction in case people

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.460
don't know who Lindsey is,
she has over a billion views

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.220
on YouTube.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.740
She was just-- we're
here for the book, right?

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.027
It is now a "New York
Times" top 10 bestseller.

00:00:26.027 --> 00:00:26.921
Yeah?

00:00:26.921 --> 00:00:29.156
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:29.156 --> 00:00:32.450
And with no further ado, we want
to welcome Lindsey Stirling up

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.010
on the stage.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.739
Welcome, Lindsey.

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:34.655
LINDSEY STIRLING: Hey.

00:00:34.655 --> 00:00:35.206
Hi.

00:00:35.206 --> 00:00:37.640
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.140
Hey.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.830
Thank you, guys, for the warm
welcome, and the nice remarks.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:48.580
I appreciate that.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.830
JOHN MERRIFIELD: Well, it's
kind of like welcome home.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.210
I mean, welcome back to Google.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.376
LINDSEY STIRLING: Thank you.

00:00:53.376 --> 00:00:57.160
Yeah, you know, I owe all my
success to this platform that

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.610
has been great been
created by Google,

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.550
so this is like home
for me, I guess.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.630
JOHN MERRIFIELD: So tell us
over here about your new book,

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.297
"The Only Pirate at the Party,"
which is a lovely title.

00:01:09.297 --> 00:01:10.580
LINDSEY STIRLING: Thank you.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.560
JOHN MERRIFIELD: Can you
first take us back to violin,

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.970
and talk to us about
how you started violin,

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.852
and when you knew music is
something you wanted to do.

00:01:19.852 --> 00:01:21.560
LINDSEY STIRLING: So
I started the violin

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.450
when I was six years old, and
it was because my parents,

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.900
they used to play classical
music on this old record

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.620
player in our
house all the time,

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.870
and they would take us to
orchestra concerts in LA

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.520
at the time was where we lived.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.810
And I noticed that
the violinists,

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.990
they got all the
solos, they got to play

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.332
the fast, interesting parts.

00:01:40.332 --> 00:01:41.790
And so I started
begging my parents

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.490
for lessons when I was tiny.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.550
And I started when I was six.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.280
And it was always
something I loved,

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.840
and something that I always
saw as a glorified hobby.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.900
I went to college, actually, for
something completely different,

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.760
just because I always
wanted to keep it my hobby.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.290
I was always wanted
to love music.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.020
I never wanted to resent it.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.590
And then when I was sitting
in class at college,

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.140
all I could think
about was music.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.470
I was studying to
be a therapist,

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.810
and I was spending all my
free time at open mic nights

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.100
and with bands,
and I just realized

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.880
I'm always going to regret this
if I don't chase after this.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.250
I have to give it a try.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.640
And thank heavens I did.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.990
JOHN MERRIFIELD: Worked
out all right, I think.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.409
So you talked about your
parents briefly there.

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:25.950
Can you tell us a
little more about--

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.203
and you say this in your
book-- about your parents

00:02:27.203 --> 00:02:29.070
and the influence
they had on you

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.210
younger, and that motivation?

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.370
LINDSEY STIRLING: Yeah.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.000
My parents were
always so supportive

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.730
of me and my sisters, all
of us expressing ourselves,

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.190
and expressing our creativity.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.220
And whether it was my mom
teaching me how to sew,

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.950
or them encouraging me to
pursue music, or my dad,

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.110
he was a writer, and he would
read as bedtime stories scripts

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.810
that he had written when
he was trying to make it

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.770
in the movie business.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.710
And so I just grew up with this
idea that creativity is life,

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.210
and creativity is therapeutic.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.880
It's everything.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.210
It's fun it's joyous.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.540
And also, I think the fact
that my dad chased his dream

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.290
when he was young.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.430
And he had all these stories
about going places, and meeting

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.763
people, and shaking their hands.

00:03:14.763 --> 00:03:17.760
And I remember I'd tell my
dad, even when I was tiny,

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.577
Dad, I want to live
a life like you.

00:03:19.577 --> 00:03:20.410
I want to go places.

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.770
I want to shake people's hands.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.870
And I think I attribute a
lot of where I'm at today

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.760
because my dad
chased his dreams.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.970
And even though it almost
gave me more courage

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.220
to chase them because he
felt like he was better,

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.570
even though he didn't
get his, necessarily,

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.690
at the time he was
chasing them, he still

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.230
had all these amazing stories
and was better for it.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.410
And so I was like,
well, even for trying,

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.842
it's OK to try and not get
exactly to where you want,

00:03:44.842 --> 00:03:46.050
because you'll get somewhere.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.520
JOHN MERRIFIELD: Yeah.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.937
So your family has
a writing gene.

00:03:47.937 --> 00:03:49.020
LINDSEY STIRLING: It does.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.480
I'm in a family of
literary writers.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.400
My parents were
both English majors.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.570
My sister Brooke
wrote my book with me,

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.850
or was the writer of the book.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.015
And so--

00:03:59.015 --> 00:04:00.632
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:00.632 --> 00:04:02.465
JOHN MERRIFIELD: And
Brooke, give us a wave.

00:04:02.465 --> 00:04:05.596
You're going to come up here a
little later and talk further.

00:04:05.596 --> 00:04:08.036
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:10.830
LINDSEY STIRLING: I
can't steal the credit,

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.714
because she's in the room.

00:04:12.714 --> 00:04:14.010
Just kidding.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.760
JOHN MERRIFIELD: So what
are your thoughts on-- a lot

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.589
of YouTubers are writing books.

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:21.290
Was that a motivation
for you as well?

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:22.520
Or what are your
thoughts on that?

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.800
LINDSEY STIRLING: Actually,
we started the book

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.383
three years ago, and
I'm sure they all

00:04:25.383 --> 00:04:27.730
started theirs years before.

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.050
We all probably were working on
them silently at the same time.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.300
And I think it's really awesome
that my YouTube friends,

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.870
they're my peers, we
all started together

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.690
in this weird world
of YouTube, where

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.920
we were the rejects of the
entertainment industry.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.585
We were seen as, oh,
they're YouTubers.

00:04:47.585 --> 00:04:49.170
We were the freak category.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.350
And so it's so cool to
see these people that

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.040
are my friends-- we're like a
little sorority that's grown up

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.760
together-- and to see
Grace get a show on TV,

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.300
and then to see Miranda
on "Jimmy Fallon"

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.600
and a writing a
book, and everybody

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.820
doing these amazing
things, and winning awards.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.377
It's like go team, internet.

00:05:08.377 --> 00:05:10.210
We're a family, and so
it's really exciting.

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.668
And we all have
each other's books,

00:05:11.668 --> 00:05:13.810
and we send them to each.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:14.639
It's a family.

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:15.680
JOHN MERRIFIELD: Awesome.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.430
And so within your book,
what was your main motivation

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.570
to start out and think, I've
had this amazing career.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.860
Let's write a book, talk
a little further about it.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.540
LINDSEY STIRLING: Yeah, well, I
wanted it to be several things.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.360
I wanted people to read it,
and laugh, and enjoy it,

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.840
and be filled with positivity.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.385
But at the same time, I think
one of the big motivations

00:05:37.385 --> 00:05:40.210
to write the book was I felt
like I had some experiences

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.790
and stories that I wanted to
share, because here at meet

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.070
and greets and at shows,
people will ask me questions.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.970
And it's a very quick
process at a meet and greet.

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.460
You don't get to spend an
hour chatting with someone.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.010
And girls would whisper to
me, I struggle with anorexia.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.140
How did you get through it?

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.640
And what do you say to
someone in that moment?

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.110
And so it just made me
think over and over again,

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.660
gosh, when I was going through
depression and anorexia,

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.720
I felt so isolated and so alone.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.710
And people are
very afraid to talk

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.150
about those kind of things.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.260
And it took me a
really long time

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.500
to even realize I had a
problem, because I thought,

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.240
no, depression I
don't have that.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.140
That's not me.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.140
But the thing is, I think
that this is something

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.420
that a lot of people,
unknowingly or knowingly,

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:24.180
go through.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.420
And so I wanted to
bring awareness to it,

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.472
and also provide,
hopefully, hope for someone.

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:31.180
Like when I felt
hopeless, hopefully they

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.160
can find hope, and realize
that they can get through it,

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.640
and they can be who
they want to be.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.829
JOHN MERRIFIELD: Now, you have
a chapter called "Life with Ed."

00:06:40.829 --> 00:06:42.370
Do you mind talking
a little bit more

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.147
about the title of that
and that experience?

00:06:45.147 --> 00:06:46.230
LINDSEY STIRLING: Totally.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:49.460
So "Life without
Ed" is a book that I

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.810
read when I was
struggling with anorexia,

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.220
and it was probably one of the
most helpful books that I read.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.810
I read a lot about anorexia
when I realized I had a problem.

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.190
And it was a book where it
separated the eating disorder

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:02.820
and this girl.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.580
Her therapist had taught her
to call her eating disorder Ed.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.850
And so for the first time
I realized, oh my gosh,

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.700
my eating disorder isn't me.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.350
It's not my brain.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.670
This is something
that has come into me,

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:17.260
and it's something
that I can get out.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.664
It's a separate part of my
brain that I can say, go away.

00:07:19.664 --> 00:07:21.955
And in and this book, she
talks to her eating disorder,

00:07:21.955 --> 00:07:24.020
and she calls it, and
she personifies it.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.430
And so these voices that
would come into her head

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.263
telling her negative
things, and telling her

00:07:28.263 --> 00:07:30.790
that she was
worthless, or whatever,

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.446
she would talk
back to this voice

00:07:32.446 --> 00:07:33.820
with the other
side of her brain,

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.430
and say, no, I'm not worthless.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.100
And she would have
these conversations.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.610
And as much as it sounds
schizophrenic and multiple

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.600
personality
disorder, I did this.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.470
And it allowed me to feel
like I had the ability

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:48.210
to take control
over my brain again

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.740
and kick out this very
unhealthy part of myself.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.250
And you know, it's still there.

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:54.640
It's still a little part of
me that will always be there,

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.330
but I know how to
talk to it now.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.340
And it actually hides
most of the time.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:00.710
It's usually not there.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:03.870
And when I first learned
about an eating disorder,

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:05.480
and I first started
researching it,

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.410
I was so upset, because I read
that it's an incurable disease.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:10.970
And I was like,
who wants to hear

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.700
that the worst part of
yourself is incurable

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.300
and you're always
going to have it?

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.540
And now I understand why they
say that, but at the same time,

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.120
it's not a part of
my everyday life.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.720
It's not a part
of my weekly life.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.120
When I get really stressed
out, Ed starts to come back,

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.760
and I know how to talk to
it and tell it to go away.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.950
And so that's why I
wanted that chapter

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:32.500
to be in there, because I wanted
to express that it is curable.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:33.530
You can get rid of it.

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:34.870
You can take things
out of your life,

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:36.539
and you can determine
who you want to be,

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:38.830
and you don't have to let
the hard things we go through

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:39.743
determine who we are.

00:08:39.743 --> 00:08:40.659
JOHN MERRIFIELD: Yeah.

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:41.169
That's awesome.

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:41.730
Thank you.

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:43.710
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:50.070
So in that same experience,
opening up about that,

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:52.980
you're a great role
model for other people.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.810
Do you mind talking a little
bit about your core principles

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:57.500
and that influence on your life?

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.820
LINDSEY STIRLING: Yeah, you
know, a lot of people ask me,

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.670
oh, how do you try
to stay grounded?

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:06.260
My life has literally
flipped upside down

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:07.990
in the last four years.

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:09.830
I'm in a completely
different place

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:12.190
than I ever thought
I would ever be in,

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:16.110
and everything from my personal
life to my professional life

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:17.770
has just changed.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.980
And the one thing, I think,
that's kept me very consistent

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:21.950
is two things.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:27.050
It's my family and my spiritual
beliefs, my religious beliefs.

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:31.550
I was raised in a very,
very religious family.

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:35.030
We went to church every week,
and we had specific principles

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.720
and guidelines.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.270
And I decided when I started
to see my career taking off,

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:40.640
it scared me.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.840
And I thought, what if I change?

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.430
I like the person that I am.

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:48.050
I like Lindsey, the
core of the person

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:50.250
that my parents raised me to be.

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:52.655
And I don't want to
become something I'm not.

00:09:52.655 --> 00:09:54.780
I don't want to become a
scary-- you hear about how

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.684
people change, and you
know, Justin Bieber

00:09:56.684 --> 00:09:57.600
fell off the deep end.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.420
You're like, ahh, what do I do?

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.480
And so I made a decision.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.890
And it was almost like
a promise to me and God.

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:06.687
And some people
call it-- I think

00:10:06.687 --> 00:10:09.020
most people that are artistic
have a belief in something

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.060
greater than themselves.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.910
And to me, it's God.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:13.310
And I made a promise
to God that I

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:15.120
would stay true
to the principles

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.820
that I had right then,
my standards of dress,

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.545
my standards of lifestyle,
and my spirituality.

00:10:21.545 --> 00:10:24.170
And as long as I've kept
that in the forefront

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:27.180
of my life and a foundation,
as much as everything else has

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:30.000
changed, my religious
beliefs and my family

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.650
have kept me feeling like
I'm the same Lindsey that I

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:36.860
have grown up to be,
and that I want to stay.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.840
And I plan to keep that as
a foundation of my life.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.704
And I think it's kept me sane.

00:10:41.704 --> 00:10:42.620
JOHN MERRIFIELD: Yeah.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.650
There's a funny
chapter in your book.

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:47.200
This is the only spoiler I give.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.150
But it's where you say
the chapter on drugs,

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:50.810
and rock 'n' roll,
and everything,

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:52.310
and then it's one
sentence, and it's

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:54.550
like, I didn't do any
of that, so moving on.

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:55.550
LINDSEY STIRLING: Right.

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.390
JOHN MERRIFIELD: And
that was a good chapter.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:57.660
LINDSEY STIRLING: Thank you.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:58.180
Thank you.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:00.554
It was the easiest in the
audio book, when I got to that.

00:11:00.554 --> 00:11:01.780
It was like, chapter down.

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:02.955
Yes.

00:11:02.955 --> 00:11:04.330
JOHN MERRIFIELD:
Now, do you mind

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.810
talking a little bit about
the chapter "No Man's Land"?

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.192
I think it starts leading up
to the title and everything.

00:11:09.192 --> 00:11:10.150
LINDSEY STIRLING: Yeah.

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:11.840
You know, there
was another theme

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.820
that I wanted to
bring up in the book,

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.760
that it's OK to be different.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.860
And one of the first
chapters in the book

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.720
says that sometimes
being different

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.890
feels a lot like being alone.

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:25.562
And it's not like I've gone
through my life being like,

00:11:25.562 --> 00:11:27.770
I want to look different,
and I want to be different,

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.460
and I want to be quirky and
weird and have stand out.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:34.940
A lot of times, I just feel
like every single person

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:37.960
is different when we're true
to our authentic selves,

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.830
and that's OK.

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:43.300
It's Acceptance is very
different from fitting in.

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.300
Fitting in is changing
yourself to fit with what

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:46.670
someone else wants you to be.

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:49.014
And acceptance is being
accepted by those you

00:11:49.014 --> 00:11:50.180
love for who you really are.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:52.500
And so "No Man's
Land" was a chapter

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.170
I talked about how
sometimes I feel

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:56.840
like I'm in the middle of
two very different worlds.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.470
There's my religious
side and the side where

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:02.270
I like to be frugal,
and I drive the same car

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:03.370
I drove in high school.

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:05.560
And there's that side of myself.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:06.530
And then there's this--

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:07.585
JOHN MERRIFIELD: You
really drive the same car

00:12:07.585 --> 00:12:07.880
since high school.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.360
LINDSEY STIRLING: Well,
actually in the book I do.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.880
My car died a couple months ago.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:11.880
JOHN MERRIFIELD: I know.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.024
I thought it had died.

00:12:13.024 --> 00:12:14.940
LINDSEY STIRLING: And I
was very sad about it.

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:16.621
It died on the 405,
and I just sat there

00:12:16.621 --> 00:12:17.620
on the side of the road.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.328
It was the third time
it died in a month,

00:12:19.328 --> 00:12:20.880
and I was like, we're done.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:21.560
JOHN MERRIFIELD: We're done.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.768
LINDSEY STIRLING: We're done.

00:12:22.768 --> 00:12:26.440
But when the book was completed,
I had the same-- so it's a lie.

00:12:29.494 --> 00:12:31.160
So there's that side
of myself, and then

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.160
there's the side of myself
that I'm in the music industry,

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.510
and a lot of that
industry sometimes

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:39.550
falls in the sex, drugs,
and rock 'n' roll.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:41.760
Not everybody, but
that's the stigma

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.910
of a lot of what you
come into contact with,

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:47.290
and I feel sometimes
like I toe the line

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:48.610
of two very different worlds.

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:51.110
And I'm in the middle, and
either side a lot of times

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:53.337
can't understand the other.

00:12:53.337 --> 00:12:54.920
But at the end of
the chapter, it also

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:58.520
talks about how it's OK.

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.750
My tour manager writes me
this letter that I realize,

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.260
yes, sometimes maybe I do feel
like I'm in no man's land,

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.100
but there are people
that understand me,

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.100
and there are people that
I've surrounded myself

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:10.944
with that get it, and love
that about me, and respect it.

00:13:10.944 --> 00:13:12.860
And so I've just learned,
over and over again,

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:16.370
even in these times when I'm
like, oh I feel like I'm alone,

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:18.740
there are always people that
that's why they love you,

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.570
is for the things that
make you different.

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:23.054
And no one's really
in no man's land.

00:13:23.054 --> 00:13:24.500
JOHN MERRIFIELD: Wow.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:28.140
So YouTube being your main
platform, you write about this,

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.000
but it's a very public
platform, right?

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.708
That you can comment,
people can comment.

00:13:31.708 --> 00:13:32.904
You can see that.

00:13:32.904 --> 00:13:34.570
Tell us about how
when you first started

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:36.305
getting really big
on YouTube, how

00:13:36.305 --> 00:13:38.630
you dealt with maybe the
comments, the good, the bad,

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:40.070
And how you went through that.

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:41.476
LINDSEY STIRLING: Yes.

00:13:41.476 --> 00:13:42.600
You know, it's interesting.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.970
I have some friends that are
YouTubers that say, oh, you

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:48.140
get used to the comments.

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:52.350
You just ignore them, and it
doesn't matter at some point.

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:55.241
Maybe I'm different, but I
feel like the hurtful comments,

00:13:55.241 --> 00:13:56.990
they're always going
to hurt a little bit,

00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:58.849
especially when they
you in that spot

00:13:58.849 --> 00:14:00.640
that you're sensitive
to, that you're like,

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.225
oh, I was hoping nobody
would comment on that.

00:14:03.225 --> 00:14:04.830
Everybody has their
little things.

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:06.830
I don't know if any of
you watch "The Bachelor,"

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:09.160
but the gal was
talking about her toes.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:09.930
JOHN MERRIFIELD: Yeah,
she started crying, right?

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:11.030
LINDSEY STIRLING: She's
starts crying about her toes.

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:13.155
JOHN MERRIFIELD: Not that
I watch it, but my wife--

00:14:13.155 --> 00:14:14.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:14.740
LINDSEY STIRLING: Caught ya!

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:15.510
Your wife, right?

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:16.607
Your wife.

00:14:16.607 --> 00:14:18.190
Anyways, I thought
that was hilarious,

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:19.487
but that's a sidenote.

00:14:19.487 --> 00:14:21.820
But yeah, everybody has their
things that are just like,

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.890
oh my gosh, not that.

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:26.020
But you learn that
there is so much more

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:28.350
good than there is ever bad.

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:31.280
There's a ton of really
positive comments,

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:33.570
and then there's one
that may be really nasty.

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:36.160
But why is it that we
let the bad stick out

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.730
so much more than the good?

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:41.690
And so it's just
trying to refocus.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:44.494
Because there's always
different places of your mind

00:14:44.494 --> 00:14:46.160
where you can go, but
there's one stage.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.300
And things come in and out,
thoughts come in and out

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:49.490
all the time, and it's
what thoughts are you

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:50.220
going to entertain?

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:51.010
What thoughts are
you going to let

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:53.150
stay on the stage of your
mind, and which ones are you

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:54.399
going to kick off really fast?

00:14:54.399 --> 00:14:56.950
And so I've learned
to just you take it

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:58.990
all with a grain of
salt. You move on,

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:00.720
and try to focus on the good.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.497
And especially as you get
bigger and bigger as a YouTuber,

00:15:03.497 --> 00:15:04.830
you get more and more your fans.

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:06.430
And I have my
little Stirlingites,

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:08.580
and they will defend
me to the death.

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:10.780
And if there's a
negative comment,

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:14.859
I usually don't see it, because
they defend me so hardcore.

00:15:14.859 --> 00:15:16.900
How dare you say that
Lindsey's hair looks messy.

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:17.714
Whatever it is.

00:15:17.714 --> 00:15:20.380
JOHN MERRIFIELD: So I would like
to invite you sister Brooke up.

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:23.176
If you don't mind, we
can invite Brooke up.

00:15:23.176 --> 00:15:25.596
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:31.410
LINDSEY STIRLING:
Brooke, Brooke, Brooke.

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:33.230
BROOKE PASSEY: Thank you.

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:34.500
JOHN MERRIFIELD: Well,
welcome, Brooke, to the stage.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.620
BROOKE PASSEY: Thank you.

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.911
JOHN MERRIFIELD: So I would
love to talk to both of you

00:15:37.911 --> 00:15:39.820
a little bit about
writing this book.

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.940
Now, I know it took
a few years, but how

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:43.860
was it, tour life
and the balance,

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.180
and writing this book together.

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.555
Just would you mind talking
a little bit more about that?

00:15:47.555 --> 00:15:50.240
BROOKE PASSEY: Yeah, it
was difficult at first

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.170
because, she's traveling
around the world,

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:54.740
and we don't live in the
same state in general.

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.800
So we did a lot
of it over Skype.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:01.060
Almost-- I just feel like
90% was written via Skype.

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:03.380
So we would just
try and find times,

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:06.730
and she's like in a
completely different timezone.

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:08.350
So I'd get up really
early, and she'd

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:10.750
stay up late after
a show, and we'd

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:12.153
Skype at really weird times.

00:16:12.153 --> 00:16:13.902
JOHN MERRIFIELD: Or
Google+, occasionally.

00:16:13.902 --> 00:16:15.500
Google hangout.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.340
BROOKE PASSEY:
Actually, yes, we would.

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:18.335
We would use Gmail.

00:16:18.335 --> 00:16:19.200
JOHN MERRIFIELD: I'm joiking.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.491
LINDSEY STIRLING: We actually
did, because it depended.

00:16:21.491 --> 00:16:23.500
In different countries,
one would be stronger

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:24.520
than the other.

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.770
BROOKE PASSEY: Yeah, we're
like, Skype is not working.

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:27.791
Let's go to Gchat.

00:16:27.791 --> 00:16:29.916
LINDSEY STIRLING: So there
you go, our little plug.

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:37.020
The superior platform,
if you know what I mean.

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:37.780
But it was funny.

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:38.970
I remember several nights.

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:41.180
We're both really
tired, and we're like,

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:42.190
I can't understand you.

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:44.074
It's all broken up.

00:16:44.074 --> 00:16:45.740
I think I understand
what you're saying.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:46.989
BROOKE PASSEY: Yeah, I got it.

00:16:46.989 --> 00:16:48.180
Just move on.

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:50.680
JOHN MERRIFIELD: So tell us a
little bit more about-- again,

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.280
you talk a lot about your
relationship and everything.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.512
Tell us a little more
about that and how

00:16:54.512 --> 00:16:56.887
it developed, and especially
as you started touring more,

00:16:56.887 --> 00:17:00.102
doing more, how you
kept that intact.

00:17:00.102 --> 00:17:01.060
LINDSEY STIRLING: Yeah.

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:04.750
Well, Brooke and I have been--
we shared a room as kids.

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:05.960
We were best buddies.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.925
We were roommates in college.

00:17:07.925 --> 00:17:09.050
She's come on tour with me.

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:11.174
So Brooke, it was great to
have her write the book,

00:17:11.174 --> 00:17:14.410
because she's been there through
almost every stage of my life

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:18.319
and seen it firsthand,
known the people.

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:20.440
But it talks about
in the book how

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.245
there was a time--
our relationship is

00:17:22.245 --> 00:17:24.619
throughout the book, and you
see that there's a time when

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:25.909
we lost that a little bit.

00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:28.200
And it was when I was going
through my eating disorder,

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.070
and I lost sight of everything.

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:33.030
And our relationship was
probably the biggest loss

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:35.800
that I had from my
eating disorder,

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.777
when we became like
strangers, basically.

00:17:37.777 --> 00:17:40.110
BROOKE PASSEY: We were living
together in the same room,

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:43.520
and somehow we just
totally drifted.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.410
And we didn't even know
each other anymore.

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:48.197
So writing the book was
actually really cool.

00:17:48.197 --> 00:17:49.780
But by the time she
asked me write it,

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:51.870
we had mended that a little bit.

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:53.960
But the process of writing
it was really, really

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:57.910
cool, because it was almost like
a healing for the both of us

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:00.780
at the same time, because we
got to work together and just

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.300
relive all that
and go through it.

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.010
It's been really, really cool.

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:05.800
LINDSEY STIRLING:
The good and the bad,

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.700
we both cried when
we read that chapter.

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.130
BROOKE PASSEY: Yeah,
we're laughing and crying.

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:13.532
LINDSEY STIRLING: Oh my
god, this is so good.

00:18:13.532 --> 00:18:14.505
I feel it.

00:18:14.505 --> 00:18:16.380
JOHN MERRIFIELD: And
this is your first book?

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:16.990
BROOKE PASSEY: It is.

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:18.030
It's my first book.

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:18.310
JOHN MERRIFIELD: Wow.

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:19.670
Yeah, not bad. "New
York Times" bestseller.

00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:20.711
LINDSEY STIRLING: I know.

00:18:20.711 --> 00:18:21.916
She's a bestselling author.

00:18:21.916 --> 00:18:24.411
JOHN MERRIFIELD:
Yeah, that's great.

00:18:24.411 --> 00:18:26.906
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:31.104
So we would love to take some
questions from the crowd,

00:18:31.104 --> 00:18:31.770
if you have any.

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:33.560
And we'll have some microphones
that we pass around.

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:35.601
I want to talk to you a
little bit about college.

00:18:35.601 --> 00:18:37.080
And you're graduating
soon, right?

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.570
LINDSEY STIRLING: I
graduated just last fall.

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:40.695
JOHN MERRIFIELD: Last fall?

00:18:40.695 --> 00:18:41.316
That's great.

00:18:41.316 --> 00:18:41.774
LINDSEY STIRLING: I did.

00:18:41.774 --> 00:18:42.398
I'm a graduate.

00:18:42.398 --> 00:18:43.606
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:43.606 --> 00:18:44.980
That's right.

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:47.347
I was working on my internship.

00:18:47.347 --> 00:18:49.180
I left school right
when I-- All I had left.

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:50.690
JOHN MERRIFIELD: You
had to do an internship?

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:51.910
LINDSEY STIRLING: All I
had left was an internship,

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:53.930
and they would not let
me graduate without it.

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:57.600
So I was doing little
internship projects

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.975
while I was on my last
tour for the last year.

00:19:00.975 --> 00:19:03.220
JOHN MERRIFIELD: What did
you do for your internship?

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:07.170
LINDSEY STIRLING: So I'm
now a recreation management

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:09.886
therapist, everyone.

00:19:09.886 --> 00:19:11.260
So for my internship
I had wanted

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:12.650
to work with at-risk youth.

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:16.100
And so I would have treatment
centers bring out their youth,

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:20.077
or I'd go speak to them on tour
days, or I'd have them come out

00:19:20.077 --> 00:19:22.410
and come to sound check, and
I would do a little speech,

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:24.280
and talk to them, and
answer theirs questions.

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.696
So that's how I
did my internship.

00:19:25.696 --> 00:19:26.655
And it was really fun.

00:19:26.655 --> 00:19:27.650
JOHN MERRIFIELD: That's awesome.

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:28.400
LINDSEY STIRLING:
And it was funny.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.990
I was at graduation and
wearing the cap and gown

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:32.520
and everything, super excited.

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:33.625
And I was at BYU.

00:19:33.625 --> 00:19:35.791
And all these people were
whispering in front of me,

00:19:35.791 --> 00:19:37.560
and then someone tugged
on my little cap,

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.101
and they were like,
why are you here?

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:43.670
I'm graduating.

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:45.020
I'm not wearing this for style.

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:45.595
JOHN MERRIFIELD:
You're just going

00:19:45.595 --> 00:19:46.705
to bust out and
start playing violin.

00:19:46.705 --> 00:19:47.342
BROOKE PASSEY: They
thought you were doing

00:19:47.342 --> 00:19:48.365
a music video or something.

00:19:48.365 --> 00:19:49.906
LINDSEY STIRLING:
Yeah, they're like,

00:19:49.906 --> 00:19:51.861
is it an impromptu music video?

00:19:51.861 --> 00:19:52.360
Yes.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.810
Yes, I wanted the cap and gown.

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:55.030
JOHN MERRIFIELD: So why was
that important for you, though?

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:57.404
I mean, obviously you are well
established in your career

00:19:57.404 --> 00:19:59.216
and doing well, but
why still graduate?

00:19:59.216 --> 00:20:01.090
LINDSEY STIRLING: You
know, I worked so hard.

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:02.620
I put myself through college.

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:05.590
I worked really hard to work
a day job, go to school,

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:06.840
and pursue music.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.180
And it was something
my entire life,

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:11.130
I always knew I would graduate.

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:13.180
I always knew I
would have a degree.

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:15.080
And also, it was
something I believed in.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:19.260
I really did want to become
a recreational therapist.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:22.722
And so I couldn't live with
the fact that I was so close

00:20:22.722 --> 00:20:24.680
and I had something that
was so important to me

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:25.597
that I never finished.

00:20:25.597 --> 00:20:27.346
And so I was like, I
will get that degree.

00:20:27.346 --> 00:20:29.085
And everyone told
me also-- I always

00:20:29.085 --> 00:20:30.919
get inspired and
motivated when people

00:20:30.919 --> 00:20:31.960
say I won't do something.

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.216
And everyone's like, oh
you'll never come back.

00:20:34.216 --> 00:20:35.382
And I was like, yes, I will.

00:20:35.382 --> 00:20:35.882
Yes, I will.

00:20:35.882 --> 00:20:36.792
I'll get that degree.

00:20:36.792 --> 00:20:39.042
JOHN MERRIFIELD: Yeah, we
saw that with "America's Got

00:20:39.042 --> 00:20:39.667
Talent," right?

00:20:39.667 --> 00:20:41.110
LINDSEY STIRLING: That's right.

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:44.320
I will come back,
and you'll invite me.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:45.570
BROOKE PASSEY: You'll like it.

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:46.680
LINDSEY STIRLING:
And you will love it.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:47.490
JOHN MERRIFIELD: That's awesome.

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:49.300
So we have a question
from the crowd.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.008
AUDIENCE: So I wanted
to ask a little bit

00:20:51.008 --> 00:20:54.370
about the transition from
classical to not classical

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:55.984
and how that happened.

00:20:55.984 --> 00:20:57.900
So I was classically
trained as a piano player

00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:59.771
and then became a
computer programmer,

00:20:59.771 --> 00:21:02.145
which is a little bit different
as well, but actually not

00:21:02.145 --> 00:21:02.730
too uncommon.

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:04.740
I think a lot of
us here do that.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.740
But I want to hear about
classic violin to your style.

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:09.930
LINDSEY STIRLING: Yes, so
I'm very grateful that I

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:11.140
was classically trained.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:13.910
Because those chops as
a classical musician,

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:15.780
that's important stuff.

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:17.890
That's the foundation
of my playing.

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:19.800
But I just got really burnt out.

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:22.050
And I remember, it was right
before I went to college,

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:24.310
and I was trying to decide
whether I wanted to study music

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.730
or not.

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:26.438
Like I said, I was
trying to keep it fun,

00:21:26.438 --> 00:21:28.540
but I was like, I don't
enjoy this anymore.

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:30.410
I don't love it, and
I used to love it.

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:31.930
And it made me really sad.

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:33.842
And so it just
clicked in my head.

00:21:33.842 --> 00:21:36.300
Well, I need to play the kind
of music I like to listen to.

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.440
And so I started jamming
with stuff on the radio,

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:42.080
and I started to play with
bands and write my own music.

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.610
And I just really started
to take music into my hands,

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:46.470
rather than just
molding into what

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:48.540
the violin was supposed to be.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.590
And my passion just
got reinvigorated.

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:53.990
It became more and more fun,
and I started moving to music.

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:56.230
It looked really
awkward at first.

00:21:56.230 --> 00:22:00.580
And then it just evolved from
there, where I found my sound.

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:01.717
And that's when I started.

00:22:01.717 --> 00:22:03.300
I was like, I'm going
to make an album

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:04.760
with this weird, random sound.

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.880
And it turned out, I
guess, really great.

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:08.910
It worked.

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:10.890
JOHN MERRIFIELD: And
you said had literally

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:13.364
practiced dancing and playing in
front of your roommates, right?

00:22:13.364 --> 00:22:14.155
BROOKE PASSEY: Yes.

00:22:14.155 --> 00:22:16.030
LINDSEY STIRLING: Yes.

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:16.872
I can't believe--

00:22:16.872 --> 00:22:19.330
BROOKE PASSEY: She actually
used their bedroom to practice,

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:20.880
because ours was too messy.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:21.433
LINDSEY STIRLING:
Oh, I didn't know

00:22:21.433 --> 00:22:22.960
you were going to say that.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.168
JOHN MERRIFIELD: I don't
know if that's in the books,

00:22:25.168 --> 00:22:26.630
so it's a good tidbit.

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:29.020
LINDSEY STIRLING: Good
times, good times.

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:29.690
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:31.330
Thank you so much
for coming today.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:32.630
So I have a question.

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:35.790
So you mentioned that
your faith really helped

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:37.310
when you were sick at the time.

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:40.902
So would you please elaborate
more, and in what specific way?

00:22:40.902 --> 00:22:41.860
LINDSEY STIRLING: Yeah.

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:42.850
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:45.490
LINDSEY STIRLING: I had been
brought up my whole life

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:48.600
to believe that I was a daughter
of God, and that he created me,

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.450
and he loved me.

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:53.900
And anything that you create
we think is beautiful.

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:55.937
If you have a child, you
think it's beautiful.

00:22:55.937 --> 00:22:57.020
I'm a new mother of a dog.

00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:59.060
I think she's beautiful.

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:02.430
But anyways, anything that
you are a parent of, you love.

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:05.380
And so I really had to
delve back into that.

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:08.450
At this time when I felt
unlovable, and I felt ugly,

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:10.410
and I just thought
I was worthless,

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:13.070
I had to remember that
I'm a child of God,

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:15.060
and I had to rely on
that, that he loves me,

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:18.970
he thinks I'm beautiful,
and I need to love myself,

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:20.350
so that I can go out.

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:22.120
Because you can't
love anyone else.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.130
You can't give any
energy to someone else

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:26.409
unless you first are
OK with who you are.

00:23:26.409 --> 00:23:27.950
And so I had to heal
myself so that I

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:29.870
could go out and be
the kind of person

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:32.510
that God wanted me to be.

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:33.370
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:34.470
I'm Ian.

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:36.530
I just wanted to
say I'm a huge fan,

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:38.730
and I'm actually
a figure skater.

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:41.010
And I don't know if
you know, but there's

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:43.590
a huge following for you in
the figuring skating community,

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:45.131
where a lot of
skaters are using some

00:23:45.131 --> 00:23:49.120
of your music for their
numbers, primarily

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.250
"Crystallize" and "Element."

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:54.160
I'm working on trying to do
something with "Anti Gravity."

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.368
LINDSEY STIRLING: Oh, really?

00:23:55.368 --> 00:23:56.851
That's cool.

00:23:56.851 --> 00:23:58.850
AUDIENCE: But one of
things I wanted to ask you,

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:02.070
you mentioned something earlier
about the music industry.

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:06.520
And I'm curious, when you
started creating your album,

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:10.604
was there any pressure
in terms of the direction

00:24:10.604 --> 00:24:12.520
that some of the songs
had to be created with?

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.311
Was there a compromise
that had to be done,

00:24:14.311 --> 00:24:16.870
or just everything was
organic, and it was like,

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:20.100
this is what I want, and
nobody tell you what to do?

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:21.950
LINDSEY STIRLING: Yeah.

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:25.620
Well, it was at the time
my biggest disappointment.

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:28.151
I could not get a record
label, and I didn't understand

00:24:28.151 --> 00:24:29.400
much about the music industry.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.072
But in my mind,
how it worked was,

00:24:31.072 --> 00:24:32.696
you had to get a
record label if anyone

00:24:32.696 --> 00:24:34.040
was going to hear your tunes.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.890
And then luckily, right
while this was going on,

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:39.620
I discovered the
wonderful land of YouTube,

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:41.510
and realized, oh my gosh.

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:43.702
Because I kept hearing,
you're just too different.

00:24:43.702 --> 00:24:46.035
People wanted to put me in a
box of what was successful,

00:24:46.035 --> 00:24:47.365
and they're like,
you're way out there.

00:24:47.365 --> 00:24:49.060
And this is what
we know will work,

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:50.790
and you're way over there.

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:53.134
And so people were trying
to get me to compromise

00:24:53.134 --> 00:24:55.300
my music in the weirdest
ways, ways that I was like,

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.090
that would never work for me.

00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:58.650
That's not who I am.

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:00.830
And so I just kept waiting.

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:02.870
I just kept writing,
waiting, hopefully,

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:05.610
for someone to love
what I was writing.

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:07.630
And then, like I said,
I discovered YouTube.

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:09.570
And I was so excited
because I realized

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:12.350
very quickly that here
is a land where I can

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:14.889
make my music in my own way.

00:25:14.889 --> 00:25:16.180
I could do it on my own timing.

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:17.804
I can do it the way
I want, and there's

00:25:17.804 --> 00:25:18.971
people that want to hear it.

00:25:18.971 --> 00:25:20.762
I don't have to wait
for someone to tell me

00:25:20.762 --> 00:25:23.150
I'm good enough, because all
these people are clicking

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:24.760
on the links, and
they're liking it,

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.092
and I can see the
iTunes sales spiking

00:25:27.092 --> 00:25:28.300
every time I release a video.

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:32.190
And so, no, it was all just
the music I wanted to create,

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:35.851
and my fans told
me they liked it.

00:25:35.851 --> 00:25:38.100
And that's the cool thing
you realize on the internet.

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:39.440
There's a niche for everything.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:43.609
And so what you create,
create it and they will come.

00:25:43.609 --> 00:25:44.900
JOHN MERRIFIELD: What are they?

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:46.000
The Stirlingites,
is that what it is?

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:46.960
LINDSEY STIRLING:
Yes, the Stirlingites.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.560
JOHN MERRIFIELD:
Stirlingites, all right.

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.101
LINDSEY STIRLING:
I didn't make them.

00:25:50.101 --> 00:25:51.407
They made themselves that.

00:25:51.407 --> 00:25:53.240
JOHN MERRIFIELD: Another
question back here.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.840
AUDIENCE: So there's also
the unfortunate niche

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.654
of people who want to
say terrible things

00:25:56.654 --> 00:25:57.320
on the internet.

00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:59.060
And you mentioned
this a little bit,

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:02.430
but I'm curious, being on the
receiving end, not a lot of us

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:04.910
are on the receiving end as
much as you are, probably,

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:07.290
of all kinds of comments.

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:09.540
First of all, why do
you think they do that?

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:12.030
But secondly and
more importantly,

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:16.555
what can we do as just
humans to help the problem?

00:26:16.555 --> 00:26:18.430
What can we do as Google
to help the problem?

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:20.860
In your opinion, what
can be done about this?

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:22.820
Because it's pretty
terrible, and sometimes

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:26.840
it makes me ashamed
to be a human.

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:29.490
LINDSEY STIRLING: I
know what you mean.

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:34.090
With this new age of an
extreme amount of technology,

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:37.940
I just think human
interactions have

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:40.797
become less important
and less precious.

00:26:40.797 --> 00:26:42.380
And people feel like
just because they

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:44.750
don't have a face
to that comment,

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:47.275
just because they have a
picture of a Pokemon character

00:26:47.275 --> 00:26:50.480
as their icon and their
name is like Skittle27,

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.130
it's OK to say
really mean things,

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:55.040
because there's no
accountability for it.

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.260
And so that's why
I think people are.

00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:00.240
And also, I've just realized
people want to be heard.

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.240
Everyone wants to feel
like they have a voice.

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.830
People are craving
connection, and I

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:06.090
think the more this
digital age takes off,

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:08.799
people crave it more
and more, wanting

00:27:08.799 --> 00:27:10.590
to have an identity,
wanting to be noticed,

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:11.090
wanting to be heard.

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:12.798
And so I think that's
why a lot of people

00:27:12.798 --> 00:27:14.460
will say really nasty things.

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:17.534
And then when people like my
little Stirlingites to defend,

00:27:17.534 --> 00:27:18.450
that's what they want.

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:21.620
They want to fight and
get that interaction.

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:24.000
But I've just thought a
lot about this lately.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.950
Even in stores, like when I'm
checking out at Walgreens,

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:29.600
how often am I on
my phone and not

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.760
even like looking at the
person that's helping me?

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.360
And they ask, do you
want to donate $1?

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.170
I'm like, sure.

00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:39.000
You don't even look up at
people anymore half the time.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.140
And so I've tried to
make a conscious effort

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.020
in my interactions,
whether it's online,

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:46.090
to be personal with
people, or whether it's

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:48.340
in person, to actually look
people in the eye and say,

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:51.570
how was your day?

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:53.160
I think we're all
craving connection,

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:57.172
and people reach out in
weird ways sometimes for it.

00:27:57.172 --> 00:27:58.880
AUDIENCE: If you could
do a collaboration

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:01.500
with any other artist, past
or present, alive or dead,

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:02.970
who would you pick and why?

00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:04.580
LINDSEY STIRLING: Alive or dead?

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:06.930
That's so hard.

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:09.150
OK, I've got two that are dead.

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:10.340
One of them is a no-brainer.

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:11.970
Michael Jackson, oh my gosh.

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:13.820
I would have him give
me a dance tutorial,

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:16.470
and we would do a
remake of "Beat it."

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:17.869
JOHN MERRIFIELD: Oh wow.

00:28:17.869 --> 00:28:19.910
LINDSEY STIRLING: And
then, also, my other one, I

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:23.980
would love to do a comedy
sketch with Lucille Ball.

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:25.230
I love Lucille Ball.

00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:27.340
She's my hero.

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:29.007
What about you, Brooke?

00:28:29.007 --> 00:28:30.090
BROOKE PASSEY: I'm nobody.

00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:31.839
I don't like being in
front of the camera.

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:39.349
LINDSEY STIRLING: We're the
same, but really different.

00:28:39.349 --> 00:28:40.099
It's really funny.

00:28:40.099 --> 00:28:41.548
OK.

00:28:41.548 --> 00:28:42.992
JOHN MERRIFIELD: That's awesome.

00:28:42.992 --> 00:28:43.700
Another question?

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.158
AUDIENCE: This
question is actually

00:28:45.158 --> 00:28:47.610
coming more from my mother,
who has actually been a violin

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:49.410
teacher for 40 years now.

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:53.490
And she has very much fallen
in love with your music,

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:56.720
and also her students
have as well.

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:59.230
And so she wants to thank
you for that, first of all,

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:02.230
for motivating a lot
of very young people

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:05.050
to basically increase
their motivation

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:08.140
to learn how to play the
violin, and to actually

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:11.400
continue to want to do that.

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:14.280
And it's really fun
to watch her play that

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:16.170
along with your students
like at old folks

00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:19.310
homes and different places,
watch the old folks get up

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:21.690
and start dancing
and things like that.

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:24.270
But the question
that she has is she's

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:26.810
been taking a lot of your
arrangements and your pieces

00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:29.970
and trying to simplify them
a little bit so that younger

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:31.270
people can play them.

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:33.462
And so the question
is, is that something

00:29:33.462 --> 00:29:34.670
that you've considered doing?

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:37.640
Have you consider making--
because a lot of your pieces

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:42.150
are very difficult. So
that's the question,

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:45.520
is have you ever considered
creating even simpler versions

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:46.697
of the music that you have?

00:29:46.697 --> 00:29:49.030
LINDSEY STIRLING: You know,
that's such a good-- I have.

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:53.445
I want to make a violin tutorial
method, like a series of books.

00:29:53.445 --> 00:29:55.360
There's pretty
much one out there.

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.660
It's pretty much one
method that everybody uses.

00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:59.740
And so I wanted to
replace it, but to be

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:04.370
a supplement to that method
and intersperse my songs along

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:06.810
with classical violin songs.

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:08.240
And yeah, simplify some of them.

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:11.400
I have not done it yet, but
it's definitely something

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.110
that I really wanted to do.

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:16.380
So it's on my list.

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:19.200
AUDIENCE: I'm wondering
what's the good and bad

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.910
of moving from what you
were doing to getting

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:24.250
professional management?

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:30.510
LINDSEY STIRLING: Oh,
well, it's been very great.

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:33.600
So when I started, I was doing
literally everything myself,

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:37.979
from thinking of the video
ideas and the creative side

00:30:37.979 --> 00:30:39.520
that I still do and
still love to do,

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:42.830
but also, anytime someone
ordered a piece of merchandise,

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:44.530
I was the one that
rolled up the poster,

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:45.990
stuck it in an envelope,
wrote a thank you note,

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:48.406
and stuck in there, went to
the post office and mailed it.

00:30:48.406 --> 00:30:53.060
I did everything, and
it was overwhelming.

00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:54.234
I couldn't I couldn't focus.

00:30:54.234 --> 00:30:56.150
I stopped being able to
focus on the creative,

00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:58.940
and I was starting to
just run dry of ideas

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:00.810
because I was so overwhelmed.

00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:03.437
And so getting with
a management company,

00:31:03.437 --> 00:31:05.020
it was actually a
really cool process,

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:06.853
because when I was
searching for management,

00:31:06.853 --> 00:31:10.230
I was very much like,
don't try to change me.

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:11.420
I'm the way am.

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:12.730
I like to be very hands-on.

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:15.320
And also, YouTube is the base.

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:16.560
I don't want a record label.

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.350
And so I was
looking for somebody

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:21.230
that could take who I
was, and then just add

00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:23.862
their knowledge of the
actual real music industry

00:31:23.862 --> 00:31:24.570
and how it works.

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:26.380
And so it's this
amazing thing where

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:27.820
we've learned from each other.

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:29.421
I found the right
management company.

00:31:29.421 --> 00:31:31.170
My manager's right
back there in the back.

00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:32.350
Adina, give a wave.

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:34.365
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:38.100
I would say that the
hard thing about it

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:39.755
is just finding
the right manager.

00:31:39.755 --> 00:31:40.990
It was really hard.

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:43.320
I was managerless
for quite a while

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:45.220
because I was searching
for the right fit.

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:46.590
It's like dating, you know?

00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:48.217
It's like looking
for-- because I

00:31:48.217 --> 00:31:50.550
felt like I was going on all
these dates with management

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:51.510
companies and meetings.

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:53.595
And then finally, when
you find the right people,

00:31:53.595 --> 00:31:54.970
it clicks, and
it's been amazing.

00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:58.510
But yeah, that process
was exhausting.

00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:01.060
AUDIENCE: I know you've worked
with an old friend of mine,

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:02.660
Devin Graham.

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:04.510
I went to high school with him.

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:05.832
We shot a video together.

00:32:05.832 --> 00:32:06.790
LINDSEY STIRLING: Nice.

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:08.730
AUDIENCE: And I know
you've worked with him.

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:11.860
I think you still do, your
latest Final Fantasy video,

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:13.600
I think.

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:17.350
And you also had a relationship
with him for a good while.

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:18.630
How has--

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:20.386
JOHN MERRIFIELD: Sorry.

00:32:20.386 --> 00:32:20.879
Just throwing that one in there.

00:32:20.879 --> 00:32:21.865
LINDSEY STIRLING: Am I blushing?

00:32:21.865 --> 00:32:22.365
Yes.

00:32:22.365 --> 00:32:25.450
JOHN MERRIFIELD: You dated him,
in case you didn't know that.

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:26.622
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I know.

00:32:26.622 --> 00:32:29.700
It's not there anymore,
but you're still working.

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:32.230
You're still working
with him after the fact.

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:35.880
And I just wanted to know
how, having worked with him,

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:40.110
how easygoing, or was
it difficult to work

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:43.040
with other celebrities?

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:43.707
Like YouTubers?

00:32:43.707 --> 00:32:46.040
You were saying you have many
friends who are YouTubers.

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:50.240
How does working and having
a relationship with one

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:53.350
affect your career?

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:55.882
LINDSEY STIRLING: Yeah,
I actually met Devin.

00:32:55.882 --> 00:32:58.090
He's the one that introduced
me to the YouTube world.

00:32:58.090 --> 00:32:59.100
He contacted me.

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:01.480
I saw this little video I had.

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:04.500
And it was my "America's
Got Talent" video he saw.

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.130
And he reached out
to me, and was like,

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:07.972
I think you would do
really well on YouTube.

00:33:07.972 --> 00:33:09.680
And I was just like,
I didn't understand.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:10.513
I was like, YouTube?

00:33:10.513 --> 00:33:11.690
I don't get it.

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:13.530
And so he actually taught this.

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:17.839
He used to teach classes
on here's YouTube.

00:33:17.839 --> 00:33:19.380
Be introduced to
the land of YouTube.

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:20.846
This is how you be a YouTuber.

00:33:20.846 --> 00:33:22.220
And I went to one
of his classes.

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:24.110
He invited me, and
I was like, wow.

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:24.640
What?

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.460
And my life was
changed in that moment.

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:27.840
And I was like, this is
what I'm going to do.

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:30.089
And so I owe so much to Devin
Graham, because not only

00:33:30.089 --> 00:33:32.100
that, we started
working together a ton,

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:35.270
we started dating.

00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:37.000
But it was amazing.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.050
The two of us were chasing
our dreams together,

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:41.100
and we are getting to
travel the world together,

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:43.032
and both doing what we loved.

00:33:43.032 --> 00:33:45.240
And we would help each other
with our projects, which

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:48.480
was amazing, and really hard
to end a relationship, though,

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.224
that's based on everything.

00:33:50.224 --> 00:33:51.640
We were each other's
best friends.

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:52.270
We were dating.

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:54.980
We were also each other's
coworkers, pretty much.

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:56.250
We did everything together.

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:57.750
And so I remember
thinking my career

00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:59.490
was over when we ended it.

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:03.030
I was like, OK, that was the
worst decision I ever made.

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:04.780
I didn't know how I
was going to continue,

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:06.400
because he was my
cinematographer.

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.820
He was my partner-in-crime.

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:10.880
And so it was really interesting
to renavigate the waters.

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.429
How do I do this
without the guy that

00:34:13.429 --> 00:34:15.790
taught me everything I
know, and has helped me

00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:17.420
every step of the way so far?

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:19.260
But like I said,
I owe everything

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:22.496
pretty much that I have to
what Devin Graham did for me,

00:34:22.496 --> 00:34:23.620
and he's an amazing person.

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:25.699
So here's to Devinsupertramp.

00:34:25.699 --> 00:34:27.085
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:30.645
JOHN MERRIFIELD: So what's
next for Lindsey Stirling?

00:34:30.645 --> 00:34:31.900
LINDSEY STIRLING: What's next?

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:35.159
You know, this book is what's
been next for so long, so it's

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:36.239
crazy that now it's out.

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:38.989
And now I'm working
on an album, and I'm

00:34:38.989 --> 00:34:39.989
really excited about it.

00:34:39.989 --> 00:34:41.655
I'm about halfway
done with it, and it's

00:34:41.655 --> 00:34:44.295
going to come out in
June, fingers crossed.

00:34:44.295 --> 00:34:47.219
It's my self-proclaimed
deadline.

00:34:47.219 --> 00:34:49.120
But yeah, and I'm super
stoked about that.

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:51.659
We'll be touring and doing
festivals through the summer

00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:52.659
and touring in the fall.

00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:54.723
So that's pretty much
what's next for me.

00:34:54.723 --> 00:34:55.639
JOHN MERRIFIELD: Cool.

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:57.353
Well, thank you so much
for your time, Lindsey.

00:34:57.353 --> 00:34:58.319
This was really good.

00:34:58.319 --> 00:35:00.402
LINDSEY STIRLING: Yeah,
thank you guys for coming.

00:35:00.402 --> 00:35:03.632
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:06.000
Hey, guys.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.440
Thank you so much for
watching today and joining us.

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.700
I also wanted to talk a
little bit about a charity

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:11.660
that I support.

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:13.590
It's called Operation
Underground Railroad,

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:15.140
and it deals with
human trafficking.

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:16.890
And this group goes
in, and they save kids

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:19.140
from human trafficking
and slavery.

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:21.150
And it's a huge issue
today that a lot of us

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:23.240
don't like to talk
about, and it's amazing.

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:24.080
It saves lives.

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:26.340
So you can click the
upper-right-hand corner

00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:28.390
to donate, and also to
find out more about it.

00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:29.940
Thanks, guys.
