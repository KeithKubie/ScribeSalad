00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.150
There's been a lot of talk
lately about the fiscal cliff,

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.262
which sounds very dramatic.

00:00:06.262 --> 00:00:07.720
And what I want to
do in this video

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.370
is at least lay
out the numbers so

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.920
that we're all on the same page.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.380
And then the next few videos,
think about the implications

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.310
or how the negotiations between
the president and Congress

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.210
might actually work out.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.930
So the first thing to
frame this conversation

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.150
is just where the
budget is right now.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.590
And so let me draw
a little graph.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.570
So let me make this axis right
over here represent our budget.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.090
I want to make it
as big as possible

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.270
so that we can get a little
bit of granular detail

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.080
on how much the budget
might move based

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.620
on how the
negotiations work out.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.010
So let's say that this line
is roughly $4 trillion long.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.780
So that's $4 trillion,
and halfway would

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.970
be about $2 trillion.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.060
And then in between two and
four, you've got $3 trillion.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.045
And then $1 trillion would be
right over here, $1 trillion.

00:01:00.045 --> 00:01:01.420
And then I'm going
to do some bar

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.640
charts to show the
different scenarios.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.470
And as I do this, keep in mind
the size of the US economy.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.520
The US economy is
approximately $15.5 trillion.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.970
So that is roughly our
GDP, depends on which year

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.380
you're measuring.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.840
But that gives us at
least a frame of reference

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.420
for what chunk of
GDP we are talking

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.480
about when we talk about
the federal budget.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.780
So let's start with the 2012.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.360
Let's start with
the 2012 budget.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.130
So in 2012, the US government
is spending $3.6 trillion.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.950
So let me make my graph a
little bit more granular.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.170
So this would be 3.5.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.600
So 3.6 is going to
be right around here.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.040
So let me draw that.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.670
And I'll do it in this purple
color for the expenditures.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.880
So this is how much the
federal government spent

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.500
or I guess is spending in 2012.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.539
So just like that.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.430
All right, there we go.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.290
So that's expenditures.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.810
Now you are probably
aware that we

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.280
don't have all of the revenue.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.770
We didn't bring in the
$3.6 trillion in taxes.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.140
So this right over
here is $3.6 trillion.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.090
Our revenue that we get through
tax revenue and other things

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.010
is somewhat less.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:36.300
It, in 2012, was on the
order of $2.5 trillion.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.150
So I'll draw that
right over here.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.680
So $2.5 trillion.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.900
I'll do it in this green color.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.910
So this is how much
revenue was brought in.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.340
So let me write this down.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.280
This is $2.5 trillion.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.920
Now let's think
about how much might

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.350
get spent under the
different scenarios.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.270
So first I'll lay out a rough
approximation of Obama's budget

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.770
proposal for 2013.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.390
So Obama in 2013.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.590
So on the spending side, he
sees, or he would like to see,

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.700
spending go up by $200 billion.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.040
So let's see this.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.315
So on the spending side, we're
going to add $200 billion.

00:03:26.315 --> 00:03:27.690
And the next few
videos, we could

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.880
talk about the pros
and cons, the arguments

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.690
for and against
something like that.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.670
So let me draw that.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:46.280
So relative to the 3.6,
we're now that 3.8.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:53.090
So you have a spending increase
of-- so plus $200 billion.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:59.140
That gets us to 3.8 billion
in total expenditures.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.080
If my best estimate of what
the Republicans in Congress

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.020
would want.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.150
So let's write.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.130
Let's say, a Republicans in
2013 is that they would actually

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.730
ideally want spending
cuts from these levels.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.190
So let's draw that out.

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.860
And roughly on the order
of about $100 billion.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.527
So roughly on the
order of $100 billion.

00:04:20.527 --> 00:04:22.026
They might even
want more than that,

00:04:22.026 --> 00:04:23.550
but let's just go
with that for now.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.720
So that gets us to a
budget of $3.5 trillion.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.680
That's about that
right over there.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.900
$3.5 trillion.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.960
So once again, relative
to 2012, you're

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.070
going down by $100 billion.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.820
Let me make clear.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.020
You're subtracting $100 billion.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.290
Now in the fiscal
cliff scenario,

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.660
the spending will be similar
to the Republican ideal right

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.230
over here.

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:00.521
So let me write this over here.

00:05:00.521 --> 00:05:01.350
Fiscal cliff.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.020
We are also spending.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.820
We are cutting on the
order of $100 billion

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.200
in government expenditures.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.070
So let's draw that.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.900
So at least on the
expenditure side.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.440
And these are all very rough.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.830
I'm sure the Republicans
who would agree and disagree

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:19.330
with this.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.980
But I'm trying to get
my best sense of kind

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.050
of an aggregate view on things.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.560
So the fiscal cliff.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.220
We are also cutting
spending by $100 billion.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.770
Now let's go to the
revenue side of things.

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.890
In all of these scenarios for
2013, and just to be clear,

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.280
the fiscal cliff
that's also for 2013.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.570
And all of these scenarios,
we get the same revenue

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.370
that we got in 2012.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.220
So let me draw that.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.590
Plus we get about
another $100 billion

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.400
from the growth in the economy.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.700
As the economy grows, and
even if your tax rates are

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.360
held completely
constant, you're going

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.600
to get more revenue for
the federal government.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.160
You get about $100 billion
from the federal government.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.190
And so that gets
us to $2.6 trillion

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.170
without changing anything.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.300
So let me just shade all
of these in really fast.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.570
So shade that one in.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.440
Shade that one in.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.490
And then, shade that one in.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.600
Now, as you've probably
heard on the news,

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.790
Obama would like to
extend the Bush tax

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:45.960
cuts for the middle class.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.330
And he considers a
middle class of those

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:53.140
who are making less than
$250,000 for a family.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:58.440
But he would like to not extend
the Bush tax cuts on the rich.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.330
And he would like to actually
include a few other tax

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.850
increases, also on the wealthy.

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.810
And so you would get
an increase of revenue

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:11.170
under Obama's plan
of $300 billion.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.680
This is once again, very rough.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.750
Probably $50, $60 billion that
I'm not fully accounting for,

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:21.710
but it'll give you
the rough picture.

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.020
So this is $300 billion.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.790
And what Obama's doing here, or
what at least in the proposal,

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:31.200
as far as I can believe,
none of this is that simple.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.240
What they're talking
about right over here

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:44.250
is extend tax cuts for middle
class, which my best reading,

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:48.120
seems like we would lose a
little under $200 billion

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.270
of revenue.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:53.280
But then we keep the tax
cuts or we let the tax cuts

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.140
on the wealthy expire.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.050
So that gets us 200 of this.

00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:59.940
And then there are
other tax increases

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.230
and another removing
loopholes and whatever

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.700
else they increase
this to $300 billion.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.470
So let's compare the deficit.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:12.130
So this gets us to,
in the Obama scenario,

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:16.020
we end up with $2.9
trillion in revenue.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:17.970
So let's compare
what the deficit did

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:21.180
from 2012 to
Obama's budget plan.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:25.590
So in 2012, if you
take $3.6 trillion,

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:32.409
subtract out $2.5 trillion,
there is a gap $1.1 trillion.

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:33.850
This is the deficit.

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:38.230
This is how much the government
has to borrow in 2012.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:41.169
Under Obama's budget,
what would it be for 2013?

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:44.049
Well we're spending
$3.8 trillion.

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:47.040
We are getting a $2.9 trillion.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:51.165
So you have a gap
of $900 billion.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:57.060
So there is some of
the deficit reduction,

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.510
although the deficit
is still quite large.

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:01.780
The deficit reduction
is $200 billion.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:05.430
$100 billion of that came
from the economic growth.

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:10.580
And then, the rest is coming
from, or a good chunk of that,

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:13.396
is coming from increased taxes.

00:09:13.396 --> 00:09:15.520
Depending on how you view
it, either increase taxes

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.600
on the wealthy or not
letting the tax cuts

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.850
expire on the wealthy.

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.690
Now let's think about
the Republican situation.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.300
Well, you have $2.6
trillion in revenue.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.040
And you have $3.5 trillion.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.190
Let me write this down.

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:44.420
And once again, you have on the
order of a $900 billion gap.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.540
So in terms of
deficit reduction,

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.230
these things look
pretty similar.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:50.570
You have a very similar deficit.

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:52.507
Obama is increasing spending.

00:09:52.507 --> 00:09:54.090
And he would argue
that he's investing

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:56.110
in things that might help
stimulate the economy,

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:58.270
or invest in America
for the future.

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:00.810
And then he's making it
up by letting the tax cuts

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:03.480
on the wealthy expire
for the most part.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.820
The Republicans want
to cut spending.

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:08.520
But they're also letting
the tax cuts continue.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:13.410
So you essentially have the
same level of deficit reduction.

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:17.980
Now I think we are ready to
talk about the fiscal cliff.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.910
The fiscal cliff, we're
spending hundreds billion less.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:25.450
And then we are also letting
all of the tax cuts for both

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:27.500
the wealthy, those
who are earning

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.170
at a family level
more than 250,000.

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:33.800
And for the middle class,
we're letting them all expire.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:39.170
And so you have the revenue
increase by $400 billion.

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:41.290
So this goes up by $400 billion.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.980
And so that takes us
roughly, once again,

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.080
this is all rough,
to about $3 trillion

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:53.610
in revenue and $3.5
trillion in expenses.

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:57.040
And so your deficit, under
the fiscal cliff scenario,

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:02.090
the deficit is going
to be $500 billion.

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:03.880
Now you might say,
hey, this is great.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.480
Everyone talks
about the deficit.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.050
The deficit is a scary thing.

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:09.890
We are borrowing from
the future and all that.

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:13.030
Why are people so afraid
of the fiscal cliff?

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:15.770
The reality is that if
you take $500 billion

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:16.730
out of the economy.

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:22.660
So $100 billion through spending
cuts and then $400 billion

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.550
from tax increases.

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:25.990
So the government
is deleveraging.

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:28.031
But that money's being
sucked out of the economy.

00:11:28.031 --> 00:11:30.530
And you could argue that there's
just kind of a multiplier

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:34.120
effect as well, that might
endanger what's already

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.260
a very precarious
risk of recovery.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:40.690
That the recovery is really
just starting to happen.

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:43.680
And if we were to suck all of
this money out of the economy,

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.960
that's what the
argument would be,

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.100
then that might throw us
into another recession.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:51.340
Or that might make the
recovery that much weaker.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.117
In the next few
videos, we'll discuss

00:11:53.117 --> 00:11:54.450
that in a little bit more depth.

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:57.460
See what people are saying
the impact might be.

00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:00.734
And what the arguments
might be in either case.
