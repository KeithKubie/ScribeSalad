00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:00.834
(logo clicking)

00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:02.135
- We all wish we had a dope car.

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.136
Right, Teddy?

00:00:04.136 --> 00:00:06.739 align:start size:97% position:3%
So today, I'm gonna show
you how to get one for free.

00:00:06.739 --> 00:00:08.307
(beatboxing) Free car!

00:00:08.307 --> 00:00:11.110 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Teddy] I would not cheat
on you with no albino!

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.112
- First, find a car
that no one needs.

00:00:13.112 --> 00:00:15.515
If a guy has a car this
nice, he has other ones.

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:16.448
He doesn't need em all.

00:00:16.448 --> 00:00:17.684
- [Teddy] So, you don't think

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:18.918
he's gonna notice
a missing Cadillac?

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:20.052
- No.

00:00:20.052 --> 00:00:21.287
The cool thing about locksmiths

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:22.388
is they don't check to
make sure it's your car

00:00:22.388 --> 00:00:23.656
before they unlock it for you.

00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:24.590
- [Locksmith] Wait, what?

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:25.524
- [Teddy] Oh, no, you good, bro,

00:00:25.524 --> 00:00:27.560
just keep doin' your thing.

00:00:30.997 --> 00:00:32.198
- Bro, we're in.

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:33.399 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Teddy] Dog, we don't
even have the keys.

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:34.834
- Why would we need the keys?

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:36.502
Oh, yeah, to...

00:00:36.502 --> 00:00:37.970 align:start size:97% position:3%
Okay.
- Why I gotta think for you.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:38.805
- [Video] Hotwire a car,

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:39.772
okay?
- Okay.

00:00:39.772 --> 00:00:41.340
- [Video] So take your red wire.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.509
- [Teddy] Find a red wire, dog.

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:43.976
- There's no wires.

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:45.144 align:start size:94% position:6%
How I'm gonna hotwire this
- Dog, just stop...

00:00:45.144 --> 00:00:45.845 align:start size:88% position:13%
- with no wires?
- Oh snap, he's coming,

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:47.113
he's coming!

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:48.081
Get in the back.
- Shut the doors.

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:49.315
- [Teddy] Get in the back.

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:52.051
- So, at this part,
be really quiet.

00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:54.287 align:start size:84% position:16%
Don't make any noise.
- Shh!

00:00:54.287 --> 00:00:55.555
Shut your punk ass up.

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:56.522
- Shut up.

00:00:56.522 --> 00:00:57.590
- You got me in this trunk.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.891
He's closin' the door.

00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:00.993 align:start size:88% position:13%
Why are we in the trunk?
- Okay, shh, shut up.

00:01:00.993 --> 00:01:02.929
- [Teddy] Why are you lying
down in my man position?

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:05.064 align:start size:97% position:3%
Why you got an arm...
- I don't know where we are.

00:01:05.064 --> 00:01:06.165
- [Teddy] Why he got books?

00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:07.200
- Stop askin' questions.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.734
- Back here in the garage.

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:11.304
Like I always say, before
you earn, you gotta learn.

00:01:11.304 --> 00:01:12.872 align:start size:81% position:19%
It's not enough
to just want to...

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:13.739
What the hell?

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:14.974
Who are you?

00:01:14.974 --> 00:01:16.408 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Teddy] Ain't you
the dude from YouTube?

00:01:16.408 --> 00:01:17.643 line:0%
- And if you join my program,

00:01:17.643 --> 00:01:18.811 line:0%
you can be making
60 grand a month

00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:20.379 line:0%
like these two right here.

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:21.948 align:start size:81% position:19% line:0%
- Ha, so how do
we get this again?

00:01:21.948 --> 00:01:24.250 line:0%
- Shut up, bro, don't
ask any questions.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.984 line:0%
- Don't ask.

00:01:25.517 --> 00:01:26.920
- Food is way too expensive.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.787
Right, Teddy?

00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:28.988
- Right.

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:29.922
- So we're gonna
show you how to get

00:01:29.922 --> 00:01:31.657
free food from delivery.

00:01:31.657 --> 00:01:32.759
(beatboxing)

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.227
Free food!

00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:35.861
- [Teddy] That song trash.

00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:36.795
- [Man] Bro, tape me.

00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:38.264
- [Teddy] I like nature, my bad.

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:39.665 align:start size:97% position:3%
- We gotta go to a place where
there's a lot of rich kids

00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:41.100
and they're too lazy
to walk three blocks.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.334 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Teddy] We came
to fraternity, what?

00:01:42.334 --> 00:01:43.402
I thought we was
going to Brentwood.

00:01:43.402 --> 00:01:44.336 align:start size:84% position:16%
- No.
- I'm tryin' to see

00:01:44.336 --> 00:01:45.637
OJ's house.

00:01:45.637 --> 00:01:46.872
- Blend into your surroundings.

00:01:46.872 --> 00:01:48.341 align:start size:84% position:16%
I got the snapback,
the headphones,

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:50.043
the cutoff tee, the
basketball shorts,

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:51.411 align:start size:88% position:13%
the socks, the slides...
- And don't forget

00:01:51.411 --> 00:01:52.878
the classic red cup, breh.

00:01:52.878 --> 00:01:54.146
- True.

00:01:54.146 --> 00:01:55.447
Now you just gotta wait
for the delivery guy.

00:01:55.447 --> 00:01:58.284
- [Teddy] Horseshoe E K, what?

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:00.352
Ricky Ricardo out
here delivering...

00:02:00.352 --> 00:02:02.021 align:start size:75% position:25%
- Are you Josh?
- Yeah.

00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:03.222 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Teddy] And he
just gave it to him,

00:02:03.222 --> 00:02:05.424
he didn't even ask
for no ID or nothin'.

00:02:05.424 --> 00:02:07.526
- And that's how you
get free delivery food.

00:02:07.526 --> 00:02:08.761 align:start size:88% position:13%
It's that easy.
- Oh, that's what's up.

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:09.795
Hey who's... is
that your friend?

00:02:09.795 --> 00:02:10.629
- [Frat Boy] Is that my food?

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:11.464
- What?

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:12.431
- [Frat Boy] Come on!

00:02:12.431 --> 00:02:13.265
- Teddy!

00:02:13.265 --> 00:02:14.199
Teddy!

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:15.501
- [Teddy] I found security, bro.

00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:16.669 align:start size:84% position:16%
You finna get beat up.
- And that's

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:17.837 align:start size:81% position:19%
how you get
- Better give him

00:02:17.837 --> 00:02:19.138 align:start size:84% position:16%
the food, man.
free delivery food.

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:20.272
- Nobody takes my roast beef.

00:02:20.272 --> 00:02:20.973
(shouting, camera cutting out)

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.209
- Coffee is way too expensive.

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.644
Right, Teddy?

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:26.178 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Dog, my tiddy meat's
sweatin', can you hurry up?

00:02:26.178 --> 00:02:28.214
- Okay, so we're gonna show
you how to get free coffee.

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:29.215
(beatboxing)

00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:30.149
Free coffee.

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:31.417
- [Teddy] And yo songs be trash.

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:33.385 align:start size:88% position:13%
Why you out here lookin'
like a do-rag model?

00:02:33.385 --> 00:02:34.821
- I gotta look intimidating.

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:36.221
That's why I got the
do-rag, the chain,

00:02:36.221 --> 00:02:38.557
the tall tee, the timbs, tears.

00:02:38.557 --> 00:02:39.993
- [Teddy] You don't
know what those mean.

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:41.461
- Lil Wayne has em.

00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:42.995
Just wait until they call
out something you want

00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:43.963
and then take it.

00:02:43.963 --> 00:02:45.197
No one will stop you,

00:02:45.197 --> 00:02:46.599
cause everyone at the
coffee shop is a bitch.

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.368
- Almond no-whip
mocha for Shannon.

00:02:49.368 --> 00:02:50.403
- And it's that easy.

00:02:50.403 --> 00:02:51.671
- [Teddy] Wow.

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:52.871
- And that's how
you get free c...

00:02:52.871 --> 00:02:54.307
- Excuse me, bro.

00:02:54.307 --> 00:02:55.842 align:start size:97% position:3%
I think you took my coffee.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:57.076
(Teddy laughing)

00:02:57.076 --> 00:02:59.112 align:start size:88% position:13%
I didn't know it was...
- What's up, homie?

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:00.746
How you get punked by
a dude named Shannon?

00:03:00.746 --> 00:03:02.281
(laughing)

00:03:02.281 --> 00:03:03.916
- Usually, that works, but
it didn't work this time,

00:03:03.916 --> 00:03:05.584 align:start size:84% position:16%
cause I actually don't
like almond milk,

00:03:05.584 --> 00:03:07.186 align:start size:94% position:6%
so I let him...
- But you like tiddy milk,

00:03:07.186 --> 00:03:08.287
cause you're a little baby.

00:03:08.287 --> 00:03:09.521
- You the one with tiddies.

00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:10.990
- [Teddy] Oh, you body-shamin'?
