Thank you for sharing your responses. I will

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.600
be providing feedback on the discussion forums periodically. Now,

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.310
here's one way in which we can solve

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.850
this problem. We have to write a program that

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.040
somehow looks at the right folder and gets

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.790
for us all of the filenames from that folder.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:22.470
So let me write this down. As the first step we have to get all the file names.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.970
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.450
Once we have all of the file names, for each of the file name, what we want the

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.100
program to do is rename those files. So as a second

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.770
step, for each file, we want to rename it.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.100
And by rename I mean remove all of the numbers from

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.420
the file name. Let's build this. I encourage you to follow along.
