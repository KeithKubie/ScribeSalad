[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.290
SPEAKER: I'm excited to
open up our talk today

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.430
and to introduce you to
two incredible leaders.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:13.880
Let's start with this.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.289
How do real people succeed
in the real world of work?

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.330
Kind of a loaded question,
but how do they do it?

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.280
What is their secret sauce?

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.820
That's the question that
bestselling author Joanna Barsh

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.400
sets out to answer,
but not by talking

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.930
to well-established CEOs
or motivational gurus.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.850
Instead, she dives
into the trenches

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.860
with some of today's
brightest and boldest up

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.660
and coming leaders.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.307
With over 30 years at
McKinsey and Company

00:00:40.307 --> 00:00:41.890
and three books to
her name, we really

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.120
have a lot to learn from Joanna.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.650
She's here to distill the
stories of over 200 rising

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.780
leaders from 120 companies
around the globe,

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.360
all with the aim
to help Millennials

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.120
grow through the
challenges we face at work.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.310
We're also joined
by Amy Yury, who

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.610
is a 15-year veteran
of Google and has

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.840
held multiple leadership
roles on the advertising

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.670
side of the business.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.160
Amy currently oversees
developing video ad products

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.110
for Google Marketing
Solutions globally.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.350
She is also a founding member
of the Women@Google Leadership

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.480
Board and hosted
Joanna back in 2012

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.855
at one of the first
Women@Google Leadership Summits.

00:01:18.855 --> 00:01:21.230
Without further ado, I'm going
to bring Joanna and Amy up

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.370
to the stage.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.550
Joanna is going to dig into
some of the key learnings

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.620
from her recent book
before being joined

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.750
by Amy for a fireside chat.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.750
I just ask that you make sure
you're sitting next to someone,

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.210
as there is an activity
that will take place

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.040
during Joanna's talk,
and it's important

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.570
that you've got a buddy.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.115
And without further ado, let's
give Joanna a warm welcome.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.890
JOANNA BARSH: Well, thank you.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.190
And I can see the
gentleman over there,

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.310
you sit next to that
nice lady, right one--

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.001
and I'm here.

00:01:56.001 --> 00:01:56.500
Yeah.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.000
If you're sitting
by yourself, just

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
squidgy over, which
is a technical term,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.590
for sitting next to somebody.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.710
And the two of you are like
back to back, front to back.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.760
Now you should sit on
this-- sit together.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.840
Come on.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.140
This-- it won't
be painful, and it

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.330
won't take much time,
because I've only

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.340
been given 10 to 15 minutes.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.600
So I'm going to talk like a New
Yorker, really, really quickly,

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.080
and see if I can get you
curious about yourself,

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.710
about the challenges that
you're facing at work,

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.570
and maybe we can have a
conversation about that very,

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:30.170
very shortly.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.730
So let's start with the first
risk, which is you're here.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:34.840
You took a risk.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.760
Today was a big day
in New York, and we

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.660
are proving that terrorism
is nothing to New Yorkers.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.660
So we've already
jumped off a cliff.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.250
What does it feel like?

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.200
What about your work?

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.310
Think about the risks that
you could be taking at work

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.410
and you may be thinking
about or avoiding.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.710
So what risk are
you taking today,

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.140
given that the subways
are now working again.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.810
So that's no longer a risk,
that you couldn't get here.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.020
Think about it during this talk.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.760
I started out in 2015
after 30 something years,

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.790
as Taylor said, at
McKinsey, to actually talk

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:13.670
to younger people.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:14.620
Why?

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.740
Because it's really
awful talking

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.300
to CEOs who have made it.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.990
They have their stories,
men and women alike,

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.540
and they've been media trained.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.940
And so it's very hard to
actually get to know them.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.640
Younger people don't have
their stories finished yet.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.320
It's very exciting.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.761
You don't know how
it's going to turn out

00:03:34.761 --> 00:03:36.010
after you've interviewed them.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.830
So I thought it was
a fabulous idea.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.980
I reached out to
100 or so companies.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.280
There are about 15
start-ups in the group.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.470
There are also individuals
who are actors, artists,

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.490
scientists, lawyers, doctors,
not your normal big company

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:55.120
employees.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.400
Every single one
of these people was

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.320
considered by the
person recommending

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.260
them to be high
performing, high potential.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.850
So that's the base.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.630
And I also talked to
another 55 HR professionals

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.550
about them, which
was very enjoyable.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.120
And we'll see what came
out of that in a moment.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.089
And I basically said,
what defines you?

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.850
Let's talk about your
childhood and how you grew up

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.410
and what you think of now.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.700
What's coming to you now.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.760
It's kind of a deep
psychological interview

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.700
which worked pretty--

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.880
I found some interesting
things out about people.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.030
And then I asked them about
what is a high point at work

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.100
or low point at work
in the last year.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.040
And I just collected those
and got those stories,

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.200
which are amazing.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.040
I also asked people, what do
you think about Millennials?

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.590
And I got an earful.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.420
What do you think about women?

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.920
Interesting.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.544
We could talk about that later,
why I asked that question, what

00:04:49.544 --> 00:04:50.600
do you think about women.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.140
And I meant it in a
truly collegial way.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.610
And what do you
think about work.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.240
So we have a whole battery
of what Millennials think.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.860
And it is myth busting.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.190
But first, the
weird thing happened

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.700
that this group of people,
which I had not thought about,

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.700
turns out to be the most
diverse group of people

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.710
ever that I think have
appeared in a book.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.320
So they're from
all over the world.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.080
They're people working in the
US from 80 different countries.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.010
I'm sure in this room we have
a similar dispersion of where

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.870
people come from
and what experiences

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.660
you've had in life already,
and that's part of diversity.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.990
They also-- I met
married people,

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.270
single people, single
people with children,

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.430
married people with
children, people working

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.810
every function you can imagine.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.190
People who didn't go to college.

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.740
People who went to
premier colleges.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.600
You name it, I met those people.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.370
So that, to me, says we've
got an interesting pool

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:46.150
of experiences.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.160
What can we learn from them?

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.616
Well, here's the
first thing we learn.

00:05:51.616 --> 00:05:52.990
A lot of people
make their living

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.370
off of talking
about Millennials.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:55.485
I do not.

00:05:55.485 --> 00:05:57.610
First of all, I don't really
make a living anymore.

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.250
But secondly, when
I talk to people,

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.170
I generally talk
about leadership.

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.060
So you probably
recognize these words

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.390
that people talk about when
they talk about Millennials.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:13.120
My favorite being
the trophy hunter.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.920
But as one Millennial told me,
let's just think about lazy.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.810
I'm sure in the baby
boomer generation,

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.920
there are plenty of
lazy people as well.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.210
So before we cast
aspersions on Millennials,

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:26.740
let's look at every generation.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:27.550
So I did.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.940
And this is what I learned
as well about older people,

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.280
myself included.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.790
And I like the slow, because
I am a little bit slower

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.620
these days, at 64.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.070
But nonetheless, this
is complete bullshit.

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.667
So you already knew that.

00:06:43.667 --> 00:06:45.250
I haven't taught you
anything new yet,

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.250
so I'm going to keep going.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.040
This is what they told me.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.210
To me, if you think about
your life in these terms,

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.040
it's pretty scary.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.730
Right?

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:59.030
You're at a place, and
you've just made a mistake.

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.120
And you know that mistakes
are not an option here.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.460
Or that you wake up
every day and say,

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.100
I don't even know
why I'm working here.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.010
Because work has
no passion for me.

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:11.780
And everybody says I
should have passion.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.010
What about pressure?

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.110
You all have deadlines.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.200
Pressure is the kind of
thing that destroys health.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.900
It boils over, and
then you lose sight

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.910
of what it is that's
really important to you.

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.080
What if you were working
with bullies and villains,

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.057
and I wrote tough characters.

00:07:28.057 --> 00:07:30.140
But come on, for the record,
we know who they are.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.190
They're assholes.

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:32.480
Why are you working for them?

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.330
What if everybody says you
have to have a sponsor,

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.190
and you know in
your heart, there

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.884
is no sponsor in the
people around you.

00:07:39.884 --> 00:07:41.300
And you don't know
how to get one.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.830
You're not even
sure you want one.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.540
You just got a bad review.

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.040
Literally whacked
you over the head,

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.748
and then the person
giving you the review

00:07:47.748 --> 00:07:49.820
says, well, what do
you think about that?

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:50.585
It's like, what?

00:07:50.585 --> 00:07:52.370
What do I think about that?

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:54.230
Then you're given an assignment.

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:55.100
You're a superhero.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.780
You feel really
good about yourself.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.710
And it turns out, it's
Mission Impossible.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:01.550
Nobody's ever succeeded
doing that before,

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:03.200
but you've got the job.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.200
And my favorite of all
favorites, you wake up,

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.090
and everything sucks.

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:09.310
What is everything sucks?

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:11.050
That's a military
term, by the way.

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:12.380
It comes from the Army.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:17.090
What this means is that
your job is going badly.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:20.060
Your relationship just exploded.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.820
You have been gaining
weight at a steady pace,

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:26.030
as you're badly eating, since
you're not sleeping enough.

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:27.980
And then finally,
even your mother

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:29.700
calls you up to yell at you.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:30.200
Right?

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.780
So everything sucks
in that scenario.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:37.669
And then the final chapter of
this book is work just isn't--

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:40.700
you have passion,
but not for this.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:41.830
Work doesn't feel worth it.

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:42.530
What do you do?

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:44.360
Do you go, or do you stay?

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.050
Do you wait it out or not?

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:49.610
So those are all the challenges
that are in this book.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:53.990
And every story in this
book is, if you would,

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:56.120
instant experience for you.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:59.840
So you don't need to be
64 years old and thinking

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.140
about your whole life
deeply, as the other training

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.310
that I do for Google.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:05.740
You can just read the story.

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:07.790
So I give you the story of Greg.

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:08.810
Let's meet Greg.

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:10.250
He's a sports writer.

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:16.130
He has a dream job writing
for a famous magazine.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.670
He's what he likes
to call a bro.

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:20.625
So Greg's a bro.

00:09:20.625 --> 00:09:22.610
A very bright one.

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:25.670
And lo and behold, six months
into his job, his father

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:30.420
is hospitalized with a failing
heart and probably will die.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:31.514
So Greg quits his job.

00:09:31.514 --> 00:09:32.680
Doesn't even think about it.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:36.470
He moves into the hospital to
help his father run his finance

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:37.670
business.

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:40.970
The father needs a heart,
but he is not very high

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:44.910
up on the donor list,
and time is running out.

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:46.070
So what does Greg do?

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:49.100
Greg says, I'm going to
find out about donations

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:52.340
and see if I can
solve this issue.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:53.700
And that's what he did.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:54.980
He got into it.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:58.250
And then he realizes the
entire industry of donations

00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:59.450
is an old boys' club.

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:02.090
None of the CEOs of
any of these businesses

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:05.300
want anything to do with
Greg, who's a 26-year-old guy.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.280
He says he looks like he's 12.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.910
So he doesn't have
a lot of gravitas.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:13.797
But he comes out
of this situation--

00:10:13.797 --> 00:10:16.130
there is good news here, and
I'll get to it in a minute.

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:21.020
He comes out of this situation
able to change his job,

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.990
help his father, and start
a new business, which

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:25.470
we'll talk about.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:28.980
But before I get to the
punchline of that story.

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.850
one of the tools that comes
out of this chapter, which

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:34.640
is bringing others
on board is something

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.890
that I learned from Greg.

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:38.930
And so I want to
test it out on you.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:41.760
Are you OK being guinea pigs
for the next two minutes?

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:42.260
OK.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.810
The guy in the back says
fine, so the rest of you

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:45.570
please come along.

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:46.820
Here's what we're going to do.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:48.170
Pair up.

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:53.540
And if you're a trio, then one
of you can be the observer.

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.640
And you sort of Dr.
Freud-like, just

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.880
sit there like this during
the next two minutes.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.710
One of you will be a speaker.

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:02.960
One of you will be a listener.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:06.590
And if, again, as I said, you
don't want to do this exercise,

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:09.170
listen in to somebody
who's doing it.

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:10.650
You'll learn a lot.

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:13.040
Speakers, you know
who you are, you

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.170
are the one who's
willing to talk

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:19.617
to the guy or lady next to you
about something that seriously

00:11:19.617 --> 00:11:20.450
is important to you.

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.870
It probably is
bothering you right now.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:27.980
So you're going to get two
minutes of free coaching.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:31.620
Listener, there is only
one thing you have to do,

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.181
which is listen.

00:11:33.181 --> 00:11:33.680
OK?

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:34.370
That's it.

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:35.750
Everybody ready?

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:37.740
You got your pairs?

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:38.390
Go.

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:39.772
I should hear noise now.

00:11:39.772 --> 00:11:42.664
[CHATTER]

00:11:47.484 --> 00:11:50.360
Sh.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.000
OK.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.390
Who amongst the
listeners said something?

00:11:58.390 --> 00:11:58.930
Spoke.

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:02.300
Said anything, like ah, uh,
eh, yeah, that happened to me,

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.270
or yeah.

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:09.640
How did it feel to listen
without saying anything.

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.940
Did anybody succeed
in the two minutes?

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:13.880
She did?

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.490
So what did it feel like?

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:17.660
Just shout it out.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.530
AUDIENCE: It feels
like I wasn't relating

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:22.630
to her by not saying anything.

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:24.760
JOANNA BARSH: It's hard
not to say something.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:26.140
That's interesting.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:31.210
Did anybody who is among
the speakers, did you find--

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:34.510
what did you find,
speaking for two minutes?

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:35.950
Having the floor.

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:38.830
Did anybody have the floor
for the whole two minutes?

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:39.370
Yeah?

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:41.410
What did it feel like?

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:42.730
AUDIENCE: Weird.

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:43.610
JOANNA BARSH: Weird.

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:44.320
I love it.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:44.820
Weird.

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:45.580
It felt weird.

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:46.581
What was weird about it?

00:12:46.581 --> 00:12:47.913
AUDIENCE: There was no response.

00:12:47.913 --> 00:12:48.760
JOANNA BARSH: Yeah.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:53.500
Oh, it's like we-- it's very
hard to talk for two minutes.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.410
But did anybody have a
different experience?

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:58.210
You got to talk for
two minutes, and--

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:00.660
AUDIENCE: I was like, I have
a lot to say about this.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:01.610
JOANNA BARSH: Yes.

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:02.620
Yeah.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:07.390
Isn't it wonderful that somebody
is listening for two friggin'

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:08.860
minutes?

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:10.120
You felt the same way?

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:10.745
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:13:10.745 --> 00:13:13.003
It was good to sort of
vent and just get it out

00:13:13.003 --> 00:13:14.470
and to think about it.

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:17.830
JOANNA BARSH: And have
somebody hear you and see you.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:20.950
So I have done this
experiment last week in Dubai,

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:22.900
and I found that
half the room thought

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:26.800
it was weird and really
hard to fill two minutes,

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.920
and the other half thought
it was like 10 seconds.

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.570
It just flew by.

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:33.980
So there's a right answer here.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:39.700
But the act of listening is the
most powerful leadership skill

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:40.660
you can develop.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.850
So if you have a
team, and you truly

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:47.920
can listen with your heart,
not from our normal stance

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.010
of listening, which is I
wonder if that person's

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:51.640
right or wrong.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.080
I wonder if I'm
learning something

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.520
I didn't already know.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.749
What I'm going to say
to that person is--

00:13:56.749 --> 00:13:57.790
where you stop listening.

00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:59.620
The minute the
voice in your head

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.630
starts, you are no
longer listening,

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:03.720
even if you think you are.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:08.830
So learning to just listen from
their stance, not from yours,

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:11.020
is a huge skill.

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:14.310
So that's the tool.

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:15.670
What happened to Greg?

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:18.910
Well, you notice that Greg
is no longer a sportswriter.

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:22.300
He is now a founder
and CEO of a nonprofit

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.490
which is called Organize.

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:25.750
Of course, right?

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:26.500
Organs.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.220
Donating.

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:27.940
Organize.

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:28.930
There you go.

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:35.050
And it turns out, as Greg's dad
was on the way to the hospital

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:40.660
with his wife to have an
end-of-life counseling session,

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:45.850
a 26-year-old in Massachusetts
died in a car accident

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:47.860
or a motorcycle accident.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:51.760
And while he was HPV positive,
his heart was in good shape,

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.060
and therefore Greg's
father was the next person

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:58.180
on the list at this
hospital, got the heart,

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:01.280
and survived, which
is pretty amazing.

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.270
But that's actually
not the story.

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:08.690
The story is that Greg learned,
as he started up Organize,

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:13.990
to listen and stop
selling his ideas.

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:19.210
And he shifted from telling
people to asking people,

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:22.390
and that made all the
difference to the donors

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:23.620
that came on board.

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:28.300
What he learned is that if
you actually engage people

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:31.660
with the problem, I have
this really hard problem

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:32.800
I'm trying to solve.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.450
Can you help me?

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:38.230
People's brains get
engaged so fast.

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:40.450
They can't stop thinking
about your problem.

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:42.520
And now they're on
board, and it turns out

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.390
the money is the easy part.

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:47.110
So that is what
Greg learned, and he

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:51.730
managed to bring a guy named Al
Roth on board who won a Nobel

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:55.560
Prize for designing markets.

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.390
He was teaching at
the time at Harvard.

00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:58.960
He's now somewhere else.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.710
I haven't tracked him down.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.190
But this is a very cool story,
to bring someone like that

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:04.350
on board to a start-up.

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:07.520
So Greg learned that lesson.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.580
So now you've got listening,
and you've got asking,

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:13.810
but what else could you do
if bringing people on board

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:16.390
is your challenge of the day?

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:18.610
Start with your intention.

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:21.280
Start as you go into a
meeting, or you go talk

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.260
to members of your team.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.060
What is it you really
want to create?

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:29.290
If you have that squared
away, then everything

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:31.036
will fit into that framework.

00:16:31.036 --> 00:16:32.410
Most of us don't
start with that.

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:34.780
Most of us just start
with I'm just here,

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.400
and let's see what happens.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.920
Stand in the other
person's shoes,

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:40.360
which you know how to do.

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.889
The hard part is to
let go of judgment.

00:16:43.889 --> 00:16:46.180
We always stand in their
shoes, and then we judge them,

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:47.304
because we're human beings.

00:16:47.304 --> 00:16:48.620
Everybody does that.

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:51.370
But if you can learn
to stop judging

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:53.510
and get curious
about that person,

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:57.130
you will actually create a
connection that is very strong.

00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:58.930
You don't have to love them.

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:00.850
You just have to try
to understand them.

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:05.200
Listen from their center,
not your own center.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.970
And ask really good questions.

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:11.140
A good question is a
question that doesn't just

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:14.560
have a yes or no answer,
pretty often does not

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:18.220
start with the word
why, and opens up

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:21.829
possibilities for solutions.

00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:24.369
So what are you
trying to create is

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:28.300
a great question to somebody who
you might be having a conflict

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:28.840
with.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:32.240
Tell me more about what
you're trying to create.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.550
Be present, not dominant.

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:34.400
What does that mean?

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.610
Well, we know what
dominant means.

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:38.870
It means I am the smartest
person in the room,

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:40.630
so I'm just going
to keep talking.

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:43.290
And being present means I'm
alert and focused and here

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:44.940
with you.

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:46.140
Which is better?

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.450
If you want to connect to
people, it's pretty clear.

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:51.810
Being present is going to get
you a lot more connections

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:53.730
than big dominant.

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:58.870
And the final to do is
to use silence as a tool.

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:05.960
Silence is really uncomfortable.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.540
It is also weird.

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:10.430
And all of us fill it.

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:13.820
If you learn to not
fill it, the good thing

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:16.256
is, somebody in your
team will fill it,

00:18:16.256 --> 00:18:17.630
and they might
tell you something

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:21.020
you didn't know or have a
really, really good idea.

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:23.030
So practice silence.

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:27.050
And if someone asks you a
question in a big meeting,

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:28.920
use silence.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:34.530
It will cause everybody to
listen harder if you use it.

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:36.590
So those are my thoughts.

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:37.490
We-- I was told.

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:38.940
Did we do 10 minutes?

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:40.080
Come on up, Amy.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:43.150
Because at this point, I am
becoming dominant and not

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:43.650
present.

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:46.060
So I give it to you.

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:50.327
AMY YURY: Please, everybody,
give Joanna a warm welcome.

00:18:50.327 --> 00:18:52.410
JOANNA BARSH: Oh, actually,
I want to go one more.

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:53.790
Diogo, you'll help me.

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:55.390
One more.

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:57.990
So this is the big so what.

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:01.210
Amy went through training and
centered leadership with me.

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:04.950
I was really, really honored
to have people from Google

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:08.760
as part of our training when I
was at McKinsey and shaping it.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:11.490
This is the big so what.

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:13.690
You're an iceberg.

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:18.750
We all see what you say and
what you do, what you don't say,

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:20.370
what you don't do.

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:21.180
That's what we see.

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:24.330
That's all we see, and
that's what we judge.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.910
And you are so much
more than that.

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:30.420
Underneath that is everything
you're thinking and feeling

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.490
and you're never
going to disclose.

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:37.110
And underneath that
is you're really

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:40.020
thinking about what matters
to you, what you believe,

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.190
what your values are.

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:43.950
Sometimes you don't
even know, but that's

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:45.510
what's driving your behavior.

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:50.220
And underneath that
is your human needs.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.780
Often people talk
about it as fear,

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.430
but actually, it's
what is your deepest,

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:57.480
deepest need as a human being.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.540
And that is what drives
all of the behavior.

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:01.930
Everything that's down there.

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:04.140
So if you start to think
of yourself in that way,

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:07.080
without judgment, you're
going to learn a lot.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.060
And as you read through
other people's stories,

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:14.520
you can put yourself in them
and accelerate your own growth.

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:15.680
That's what I had to say.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.513
AMY YURY: Thank you.

00:20:16.513 --> 00:20:17.330
Yeah, no.

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:20.780
It's an honor to have
you back at Google.

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:25.040
And yes, I do remember
many of these exercises

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.430
as part of the Centered
Leadership Program.

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:33.620
And specifically some of
the young childhood memory

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.990
exercises, where you asked
us to look back and talk

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:38.950
about experiences
that shaped us.

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:41.960
So it's an honor to have
you back, and thank you

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.690
for coming off of
a trip from Dubai.

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:47.810
Joanna has been traveling
around the world,

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:52.400
talking about this book, and
obviously, centered leadership.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:56.330
And you mentioned
that your first book,

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:59.270
"How Remarkable Women
Lead," was focused

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:02.330
on what you would call the
"more experienced" work set.

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:06.050
So what drove you
to say, all right.

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:07.770
Maybe I should gain
new perspective.

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:11.230
What created that sense
of curiosity for you?

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:12.860
JOANNA BARSH: So
it actually started

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:15.800
with this young lady
who is in the room,

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.460
in the front row, who
doesn't work at Google.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:19.400
Oh my god!

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:26.330
She said, I think
your book is boring.

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:27.890
And she was my--
she's my daughter.

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:28.973
She's allowed to say that.

00:21:28.973 --> 00:21:31.130
And so it's actually--
it's really OK.

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:33.030
And I asked her what she meant.

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:37.580
And she said, they're so old,
these leaders, I can't be them.

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:39.710
I'm not even sure
I want to be them.

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:44.600
And so how do I get there
from here is a mystery to me.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.540
And I began to think about,
well, what about people

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:49.450
under the age of 40?

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:53.210
What is happening to them,
and is it different today

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:54.770
than it was 40 years ago?

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:57.980
I mean, some of the people
I interviewed were 80.

00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:02.660
And I was on the edge of my
seat to make sure they made it

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:05.390
through the interview.

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:07.940
They were amazing
people, but they

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:09.890
lived in a different
environment,

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:12.060
in a different situation.

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:15.450
And today, I'm impressed.

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:17.285
I'm in awe of Millennials.

00:22:17.285 --> 00:22:19.640
So I thought it
would be really cool,

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:23.060
as I was retiring from
McKinsey, to hang out

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:25.790
with a bunch of people who
actually had a lot of hope

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:26.690
for life.

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:27.650
AMY YURY: And was it?

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:28.320
JOANNA BARSH: It was.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.986
And was-- I'm still
interviewing people.

00:22:29.986 --> 00:22:32.322
So if anybody wants to be
interviewed, just let me know.

00:22:32.322 --> 00:22:34.280
In fact, somebody in this
room was interviewed,

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.779
but I'm not going to tell you
who it is, because everybody's

00:22:36.779 --> 00:22:39.650
confidential.

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:44.330
AMY YURY: So what was
the epiphany for you,

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:47.480
in terms of what would
resonate in the way

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.970
that it changed the way
you wrote this book?

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:52.345
I've obviously read
both, and the style

00:22:52.345 --> 00:22:55.880
of "How Remarkable Women
Lead" versus this story

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:56.970
is a little bit different.

00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:59.390
Can you talk about
what changed that?

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:04.520
JOANNA BARSH: So one interviewee
said, I'm through with school.

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.910
I just don't need to
be taught anymore.

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:09.020
Adults learn by doing.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:11.690
And the adults that
I'm trying to reach,

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:14.420
everybody in this
room, you don't

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:15.620
have that much experience.

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.440
You might have six years,
10 years of experience.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:20.690
And it's your experience,
so it's really important,

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:23.510
but wouldn't it be
really cool to have

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:26.660
instant experience of all
these other people who

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:28.910
faced the challenge
that you're now facing,

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:31.040
but they did it
differently than you.

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:33.360
So at least they'll give you
something to think about.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.000
So that's what I wanted to do.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.730
I wanted to collect a
tapestry of stories.

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:39.950
Now, the internet is full
of people with stories,

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:42.410
and I started to look at
them, and they're fake.

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:45.330
It's like Susan had an issue.

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:46.850
And then it gives
you one paragraph,

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:49.100
and then in the second
paragraph, she solves the issue

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:52.040
and gets promoted.

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:54.440
Or she doesn't solve the
issue, and then the author

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:55.390
says, tsk, tsk.

00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:58.220
Had Susan only
asked the question,

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:00.770
she would have whatever.

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:02.210
Gotten the brass ring.

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:04.520
So I wanted to write
stories that you go,

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.390
what's really going to happen?

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:07.940
And the answer is, I don't know.

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:10.080
because they haven't lived
their whole life yet.

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.390
Will that person become famous?

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:12.470
I don't know.

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:15.340
But to me, they became
very, very interesting.

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:19.130
The second thing I wanted
to do is make it real.

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:21.980
And you could argue with me that
it's not real enough for you,

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:23.930
and that may indeed
be the truth.

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:27.560
But I didn't want
to say, Amy, just

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.120
I want to leave
you with thinking

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.500
about why you're
so uncomfortable

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:31.370
about that question.

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:35.990
Instead say, Amy, why don't you
go meet that person over there

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:38.882
and have a discussion about
what gets them excited?

00:24:38.882 --> 00:24:40.340
That's something
you could actually

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:44.870
do, as opposed to go home
and go, what did she say?

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:46.910
So that was my goal.

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:50.210
AMY YURY: You did something
at the end of every chapter

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:53.720
as well to try to give a
tool kit for folks to think

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.270
about how to solve
the challenge.

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:59.630
How did you think about
creating the different solutions

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:01.910
that you did, and
is there any order

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:07.636
in which you could go through in
solving these work challenges?

00:25:07.636 --> 00:25:09.510
JOANNA BARSH: You know,
everybody's challenge

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:10.880
is different.

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.430
And I became quite humble.

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:15.930
I could only put-- the
original book had--

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:19.320
it was like 400 pages, and
it had 120 stories in it.

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.830
And now it's 75 stories.

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:22.590
And you may still
find it too long,

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:25.620
but nonetheless, I went
through all the stories,

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:29.190
bottoms up, kind of like a
Google data mining exercise,

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:30.730
although I was an English major.

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:31.760
I apologize.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:35.861
And I found what these
people did, and then

00:25:35.861 --> 00:25:37.860
through my own experience
of centered leadership

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:40.680
and me at McKinsey and being
a consultant and on and on,

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:43.830
I put them into a
structure, which is first--

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:47.350
one CEO once said to me, just
tell me what to do first,

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:48.660
second, third.

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:50.110
In that order.

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:54.090
So I tried to order the actions
at the end of each chapter

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:57.190
based on if you don't know
where you are, start at the top.

00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:59.190
And if you've already
done that, go to the place

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:01.560
where it's now news for you.

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.780
AMY YURY: Great.

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:06.660
I know that managing people,
people always say, OK.

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:07.710
Well, where do I start?

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:08.570
How do I do this?

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:11.550
So I appreciate you giving
that specific advice.

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:14.640
I loved the titles
of the challenges.

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:18.780
And you went through
all of them upfront.

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:21.810
Some of them definitely
probably hit closer to home

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:27.150
for Googlers, including the what
do you do after a poor review,

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:29.854
because we just had our perf
review cycle, so everybody

00:26:29.854 --> 00:26:31.770
just got their annual
feedback and might still

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:34.110
be digesting and thinking, OK.

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:35.340
Now what do I do next?

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:44.010
I also love some of
the titles, including

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:46.835
when you have to be a
superhero, because working

00:26:46.835 --> 00:26:48.210
for a company like
Google, I know

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:52.590
people feel like the
bar keeps moving higher,

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:55.337
and the task keeps getting
bigger, and to your point,

00:26:55.337 --> 00:26:57.795
I have to solve a problem that
nobody's ever solved before.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.910
I personally love
when risk-taking

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:04.459
feels like jumping off a cliff.

00:27:04.459 --> 00:27:06.750
And for some of us, we either
enjoy jumping off cliffs,

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:09.010
or are afraid of heights.

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:11.370
What is your favorite
challenge in the book?

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:14.040
JOANNA BARSH: When I woke up
this morning, for some reason,

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.040
I was thinking, because
of that jump off a cliff

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:18.010
thing, of cliff divers.

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:21.390
Which I woke up with
a semi heart attack.

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:23.650
I was like, I don't
want to do that.

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:26.370
So my favorite chapter is
actually when everything sucks.

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:30.060
Because it came from a
military story of a woman who

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:31.920
had been to Afghanistan.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:35.890
And she taught me some things
that I had really never thought

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:36.390
about.

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:38.400
I don't know if anybody
has military experience

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.940
in the room, but it's completely
different than anything

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:42.490
in life.

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:45.040
So I put her in the
book for that reason.

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:48.810
And there were other people
where everything sucks,

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:52.470
for example, a
woman who started up

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:56.850
a really cool business with her
friends from her prior work,

00:27:56.850 --> 00:28:02.610
and she was kicked out by those
"friends" and on her own one

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:05.700
June morning and had
to restart herself.

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:09.390
So there are all kinds of
situations where you find--

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:12.750
a man who worked in
an automotive company

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:15.630
who his marriage
started falling apart.

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:17.610
He was working on the
most exciting thing,

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:19.680
renewable energy in cars.

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.780
He was totally
committed to this.

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:23.970
And then they shut
his project down,

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:27.360
which I'm sure happens at
Google once in a while.

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.980
And he just imploded.

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:32.070
And somebody said
to him, one day,

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:34.710
you'll tell your grandchildren
about this project.

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:38.180
And he was thinking,
I don't have a job.

00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:40.140
I'm not going to have
any grandchildren.

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:41.960
So he had to pull
himself together.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.760
So that's why I
like that chapter.

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:49.684
But what it does is it helps
you prepare for something

00:28:49.684 --> 00:28:51.100
that hopefully
you'll never be in,

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:55.380
but I'm sure you will,
because work ends up,

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:57.400
after a great week,
the next week it sucks.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.010
And you didn't ask for it.

00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:01.620
And the first thing
you do to prepare

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:05.080
is to be mentally,
physically, emotionally,

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:06.852
and spiritually resilient.

00:29:06.852 --> 00:29:08.310
Which I hadn't
thought about, which

00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:10.740
is why the military
forces people

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:13.980
to go through physical
training that's awful.

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:17.850
Because you develop
stamina and resistance

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:23.310
and alertness in the
midst of the unexpected.

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:27.390
AMY YURY: So
resilience, curiosity,

00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:31.680
bravery, what are some of these
attributes that if you look

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.810
at the collection of
stories and the people

00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:37.092
that you've seen, obviously
their stories are not complete.

00:29:37.092 --> 00:29:38.550
But what are some
of the attributes

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:43.380
that you've seen are common
amongst those that have learned

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:45.480
how to overcome
challenges and even

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.730
reframe challenges
as opportunities?

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:49.100
JOANNA BARSH: Yeah.

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:52.680
So people-- do you remember that
first slide with stereotypes?

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:55.380
People think of Millennials
as waiting for someone

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:57.030
to hand them the answer.

00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:58.710
And I didn't find that at all.

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:04.530
I found the strongest element
to be curiosity and bravery.

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:06.660
So a challenge is
something you really

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:11.880
don't want to face because you
know it's not going to be fun,

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.830
and it might
actually be painful.

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:18.520
And yet the people who
faced these challenges

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:23.110
did so because they were
driven by a desire to grow.

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:25.450
And some of them
were driven by fear.

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:28.900
So a fear that if they didn't
grow, they would fall behind.

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:30.400
And in this
generation, if there's

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.170
one theme that I
didn't know I would

00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:38.380
find it is that you are
growing up with uncertainty.

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:44.530
And when I grew up in the '50s,
it was like fake certainty,

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:45.940
but it was certain.

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:48.460
You lived in a house, and
your dad came home at night.

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:50.830
And you never saw him, but
you knew he was working

00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:51.940
and everything was cool.

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.640
And you played, and
that was your job.

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.840
Just to play everyday.

00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:59.320
Whereas today, I think
people, from the internet,

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:01.390
from being global
citizens of the world,

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:04.870
from having parents
who've lost their jobs,

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:06.310
you grow up with uncertainty.

00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:08.980
And that means that
you've got to be

00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:11.020
growing wherever you work.

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:13.660
Because you're in charge of you.

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:15.160
You already know that.

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:18.820
Now it's up to older people
who manage you to realize

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.770
that that's what's driving you.

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:23.530
And once you're an
owner of your future,

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:26.380
then you basically measure
everything in terms of

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:27.760
am I growing.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:30.490
And challenges are
the best way to grow.

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:33.580
So the people in this book,
they didn't all succeed,

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:36.100
but they all took
the challenge on.

00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:46.210
AMY YURY: In looking at
the stories of people

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:48.700
and those that are
continuously growing, did you

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:51.640
find any differences,
in terms of the stories

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.010
from men or women?

00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:56.190
JOANNA BARSH: [LAUGHS] I
counter-programmed the book

00:31:56.190 --> 00:32:01.480
because there was no
theme that I found.

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.580
Maybe you could prove me wrong.

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:08.080
But men told me that women were
more aggressive, more driven,

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:11.440
more goal-driven, were
really kicking ass.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:15.610
And women told me that
men were more courageous,

00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:18.550
willing to take a
chance, and kicking ass.

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:21.700
So it was-- and there were all
kinds of people in the book.

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:26.380
So I put in men who were afraid,
men who made mistakes and had

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:32.420
to live through it, and I put
in women who were totally bold,

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:33.130
aggressive.

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:35.050
Because that's what I heard.

00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:37.340
And then I put the
opposite in as well.

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:40.210
So there are, for
example, quiet people

00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:44.320
in the book who are very
introverted and still heroes.

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:48.580
And then there are noisy
people in the book too,

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:51.730
who are very outgoing
and able to lead

00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:55.200
through their social skills.

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:57.330
AMY YURY: So I have a
couple more questions,

00:32:57.330 --> 00:33:00.060
but I want to give you
guys a chance to ask Joanna

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:03.720
some questions about
centered leadership,

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:07.290
about women's leadership, about
grow where you work, about life

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:12.540
challenges, about bringing
your daughter with you

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:13.970
along the journey.

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:15.900
And so on that I just
will ask one more

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:18.282
question then turn
it over to you guys.

00:33:18.282 --> 00:33:18.990
What do you hope?

00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:22.260
Obviously, you've
mentioned Gabby,

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:25.110
and she's part of
the intro of this,

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:28.770
in terms of the impetus
for writing this book.

00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:31.140
Beyond your own
family, what do you

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:34.430
hope people will take
away from this book?

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:37.000
JOANNA BARSH: I am
passing the baton.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.880
So I'm 64 years old.

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:40.890
I worked my-- not my whole life.

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:43.710
I worked in the movie
business and some other things

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:45.870
before McKinsey.

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:48.300
But you are the future.

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:49.840
Millennials are our future.

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:53.640
So my hope is that
this book accelerates

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.840
enough people to
take on challenges

00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:00.510
and become leaders
at very early ages.

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:04.340
And maybe you already are all
leaders who are in this room.

00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:06.060
And by leader, I
don't mean somebody

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:09.510
who runs a company with
a million employees.

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:13.080
Leader meaning somebody who
sees something and makes it

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:15.780
happen because you
believe it should happen.

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:20.070
It should be the way reality is.

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:21.330
A person with vision.

00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:24.000
A person with a drive.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.060
Some kind of purpose.

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:27.389
And if you don't have
any of that right now,

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:31.949
I hope this book will help you
on your journey to find it.

00:34:31.949 --> 00:34:36.750
Because it took me 50 years
to realize that meaning

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:40.080
is, for me, the most
important thing in life.

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:42.090
And it sort of beats all else.

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:45.530
Clearly loving, having friends
you love, having family you

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:48.250
love helps you
along that journey.

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:51.929
But I discovered, at least
for me, that it wasn't enough.

00:34:51.929 --> 00:34:55.139
That you needed to be
able to help people

00:34:55.139 --> 00:34:58.530
be part of something bigger than
you, and that's what this is.

00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:03.379
So I want you to take action
based on the challenges

00:35:03.379 --> 00:35:04.170
that you're facing.

00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:05.860
That's what I want.

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:07.860
AMY YURY: I'm going to
turn it over to you guys,

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:12.390
if you have a
couple of questions.

00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:14.091
JOANNA BARSH: They're stupefied.

00:35:14.091 --> 00:35:16.110
Like, oh my god.

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:17.850
AMY YURY: Kick us off.

00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:22.790
AUDIENCE: Yeah, in
the dangerous question

00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:24.240
to take us off
track a little bit.

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:29.974
But I'm dying to know, how would
you think about the challenges

00:35:29.974 --> 00:35:31.890
that you've framed in
the book for Millennials

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:36.870
compared to Gen X, and does it
matter if you're in the Gen X

00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:40.025
generation working at Google?

00:35:40.025 --> 00:35:42.150
What do you-- how do you
do see that dividing line?

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.960
JOANNA BARSH: It's over for you.

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.160
[LAUGHS] I'm just kidding.

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:44.740
Just kidding.

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:45.330
AUDIENCE: That's what
I'm worried about.

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:46.420
Where's that chapter?

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:48.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:49.230
JOANNA BARSH: Yeah.

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:51.540
And there are a couple
of you in the room

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:55.030
who may consider yourselves
more Gen X than millennial.

00:35:55.030 --> 00:36:01.090
Gen Xers told me that they
were raised to suck it up

00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:04.990
until they reached the
goal that they wanted.

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:09.280
That for some reason, they felt
the loyalty of the company,

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:13.090
that if they were to wait it out
and gain the skills, that they

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:15.220
would get where
they wanted to go.

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:17.380
And millennials basically
said, I'm out of time.

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:19.130
I can't wait that long.

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:21.130
In fact, maybe I
can wait a year.

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:23.440
So to me, that was the
fundamental difference

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:25.820
between the two.

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:28.840
And as Sheryl
Sandberg admonished me

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:32.350
just a few weeks ago, never
say all, because it's not

00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:33.460
true of all people.

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:36.670
It's always true of some
people, but not all people.

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:39.250
So Gen Xers, I think,
can learn a lot

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:42.460
from Millennials, which is
what are you waiting for?

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:44.240
Do it now.

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:45.760
Take the risk now.

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.260
Ask the question now.

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:49.510
And if somebody says
no, they say no.

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:51.550
You will have learned
from the experience.

00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:53.920
And I said something
a few minutes ago

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:55.420
that a lot of the
people in the book

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:58.570
took on challenges and quote
unquote, "did not succeed"

00:36:58.570 --> 00:36:59.890
in the normal scheme of things.

00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:00.390
Right?

00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:02.650
They didn't get the
promotion or the gold ring

00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:05.110
or whatever you were
hoping they would get.

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:06.820
But they learned something.

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:11.170
So in that sense, they succeeded
through every challenge

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:11.860
that they met.

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:14.009
There was a story of a
woman who got a bad review.

00:37:14.009 --> 00:37:15.550
Actually it was a
pretty good review.

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:16.799
She worked for a tech company.

00:37:16.799 --> 00:37:18.160
Not yours.

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:21.310
And she was an African woman.

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:23.930
Set very high
standards for herself.

00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:26.165
And so she didn't like
the review she got.

00:37:26.165 --> 00:37:27.790
And people didn't
like her, apparently.

00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:29.800
That was in the review as well.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:32.524
That she's pushy, and
she set the bar high,

00:37:32.524 --> 00:37:33.940
and she couldn't
stand mediocrity.

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:35.410
Does this sound familiar?

00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:38.330
And everybody around her
was mediocre in her mind,

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:39.910
so she quit.

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:41.630
And I had the
conversation with her,

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:44.170
I'm sure that company
was sad that she quit.

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:47.920
But she said, this is not the
culture I want to be a part of.

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:49.960
I don't want to fit
in and have harmony.

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:53.050
I like reaching for perfection.

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:56.620
And so the only thing that
saddened me with her--

00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:59.620
and I call her [? Efe ?] in the
book, if you read the book--

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:02.320
is that she was striving
for perfection because she

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:04.536
felt she had to make it.

00:38:04.536 --> 00:38:06.160
It's one thing to
strive for perfection

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:07.751
because it motivates you.

00:38:07.751 --> 00:38:09.250
It's another thing
to actually think

00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:11.830
you have to achieve
perfection, because that

00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:13.190
ain't going to happen.

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:15.900
So in that sense,
[? Efe ?] made me sad.

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:17.420
But I kept in touch with her.

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:20.680
She ended up in a start-up,
and she's really happy doing--

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:24.130
striving for perfection
and creating software

00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:25.750
that the world needs.

00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:28.720
AMY YURY: So you just said
the difference is act now

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:31.920
versus wait a little bit later.

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.250
And one of the--

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:36.670
the first chapter
hit me personally

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:42.410
because I just lost a
longtime colleague who said,

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:43.240
I just have--

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:45.800
I don't have passion in what
I'm doing here any longer.

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:49.180
And you mentioned in
the book though that you

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:52.000
say, as part of the
toolkit, maybe wait a year

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.780
before you actually make a move.

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:55.120
So how do you think about--

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:57.662
JOANNA BARSH: Yes, but there's
a lot you can do in that year.

00:38:57.662 --> 00:38:58.286
AMY YURY: Yeah.

00:38:58.286 --> 00:38:58.930
I mean, so do--

00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:01.388
I mean, because you're saying,
Millennials want to act now,

00:39:01.388 --> 00:39:04.540
and you are giving more
that advice that I would say

00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:07.330
is take a little bit
of time before you just

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:08.894
make that action.

00:39:08.894 --> 00:39:10.560
And that was the same
advice I gave her.

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:13.582
I said, just stick it out
for another couple months.

00:39:13.582 --> 00:39:15.290
Try to do this with
your job differently.

00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:15.820
Do this.

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:20.272
And she just-- she came back to
me after taking a little short

00:39:20.272 --> 00:39:21.480
leave and just said, I can't.

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.950
I just-- I'm no longer--

00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:25.800
my head and heart are
no longer in this.

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:25.960
So.

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:27.070
JOANNA BARSH: Well, first
of all, the good news

00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:29.506
is you may have lost her, but
the world didn't lose her.

00:39:29.506 --> 00:39:30.380
AMY YURY: No, I know.

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:32.630
And I'm helping her
find something else.

00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:33.620
So--

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:36.310
JOANNA BARSH: So
let me rephrase.

00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:39.400
She was probably pretty
busy while those few months

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:42.790
were going by in which she was
meditating on her decision.

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:45.040
So let's say you are at a
job you don't want to be in.

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:47.582
And I'm telling you, maybe
you should wait a year,

00:39:47.582 --> 00:39:48.790
because it's a brand new job.

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:50.950
You will not have seen
the whole business cycle

00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:52.460
if you leave in three months.

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:54.820
Because if it's a really
bad fit, you'll know it.

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:56.140
You should leave right away.

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:57.830
If, in fact, you're
just uncomfortable,

00:39:57.830 --> 00:40:01.510
you're not learning fast
enough, you feel stagnant, then

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:02.630
what do you do?

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:04.050
Well, you talk to
a lot of people.

00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:05.710
So you take that time to learn.

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:07.270
Go learn something else.

00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:10.790
Do something outside of work
that expands your horizons.

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:14.110
So don't wait as in, OK.

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:16.450
I guess slow cycle
starts in five hours,

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:19.270
so I guess I'll just hang
out here and go there

00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:21.680
tonight and see if I
can pick my spirits up.

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:24.580
Instead, you really
just network like crazy.

00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:28.210
If you're introverted,
absolutely network like crazy.

00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:30.610
And go ask people
what their jobs are.

00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:31.600
Learn how to do--

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:32.680
ask your boss.

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:33.610
I want to do more.

00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:35.550
I'm bored to tears,
for God's sakes, Amy.

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:37.880
Give me something else to do.

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:40.590
And Amy will dream it
up and give it to you.

00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:43.380
And you won't get paid more,
but you will have learned more.

00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:47.620
So during that year,
be busy growing.

00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:50.020
And there are very concrete
things you can do to do that.

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:52.349
I see this gentleman's
patient as can be.

00:40:52.349 --> 00:40:53.890
AUDIENCE: Well,
thank you for coming.

00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:55.880
JOANNA BARSH: Debunking
Millennials yet again!

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:58.020
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS] I
just had a quick question

00:40:58.020 --> 00:40:59.370
for either one of you.

00:40:59.370 --> 00:41:01.996
If you guys have a
story or anecdote

00:41:01.996 --> 00:41:03.870
from early on in your
careers, the first time

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:07.052
that you maybe did have this
impactful leader, and maybe

00:41:07.052 --> 00:41:08.760
what it looked like
to you, or how it did

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:12.280
influence your
career going forward.

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:15.435
JOANNA BARSH: Take it away, Amy.

00:41:15.435 --> 00:41:17.810
AMY YURY: The question is did
I have an impactful leader?

00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:18.595
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:18.595 --> 00:41:20.970
Early on in your career, was
there anybody that stood out

00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:22.750
and really, you
kind of recognized,

00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:27.210
oh, this is an obvious great
leader, and we're really bad,

00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:29.187
and they're helping
me in this way, pushed

00:41:29.187 --> 00:41:30.270
you to maybe do something.

00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:32.610
Maybe challenge you in some way.

00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:35.100
AMY YURY: So yes on
both sides, right?

00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:37.410
Those that were not as--

00:41:37.410 --> 00:41:41.280
those that you don't admire,
and you observe very carefully

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:44.280
for all the things that
you make a long mental list

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:47.940
of the things that you'll
never do when you're a manager.

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:50.280
And then I love--

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:53.160
actually, Eileen
Naugton is somebody

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:56.130
that endorsed Joanna's book.

00:41:56.130 --> 00:41:59.360
And Eileen started in
the New York office

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.350
a long time ago,
when I was here,

00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:04.440
and she sat one
cube away from me

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:07.530
and became somebody that I
helped her figure out how

00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:11.340
to navigate Google because
she come from Time Inc.

00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:14.310
And so I helped her
figure out Google,

00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:18.120
she helped me then learn
a lot about leadership,

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:22.800
women's leadership, and we
became longtime friends.

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:26.940
She's obviously gone on
to be many different roles

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:29.340
within Google, and
most recently is now

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:31.230
our head of People Operations.

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:34.780
And I had the opportunity
to see her last week.

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:37.680
And one of the
things, she had this--

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:39.840
did a talk on leadership
a long time ago.

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:44.040
And she said, be a snob
for talent, meaning

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:45.347
hire really amazing people.

00:42:45.347 --> 00:42:46.680
People that are better from you.

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:48.200
That was one of the things.

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:53.580
And she also gave me
a lot of permission

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:58.710
early on to not always be
thinking about vertically

00:42:58.710 --> 00:43:01.230
climbing, but the
importance of horizontal,

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:04.380
and as Sheryl refers to
it, climbing the jungle gym

00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:07.290
to have lots of
different experiences.

00:43:07.290 --> 00:43:09.120
And having somebody
like her, who

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:11.670
had done that in her
career, she's moved,

00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:13.742
and now you see, even
within Google, to lots

00:43:13.742 --> 00:43:15.450
of different roles
and functions, kind of

00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:17.790
gave me permission to
think about doing the same.

00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:20.580
JOANNA BARSH: Sometimes villains
can actually teach you as much

00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:21.790
as great leaders.

00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:24.330
So early in my career,
I worked in retail.

00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:27.480
And there was a woman who
was my height, which means

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:30.720
that she was height challenged.

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:32.160
Mrs. Wilner.

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:34.620
And she tore people down.

00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:36.210
She actually enjoyed it.

00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:39.570
So I think she was on the
spectrum of sociopaths,

00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:41.250
close to the edge.

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:43.380
And I developed a bloody nose.

00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:45.480
It would come unpredictably.

00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:49.260
I was running some
shops in a retailer.

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:52.290
And I did all kinds of
cool things in those shops

00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:55.350
to get people to actually stop
and buy things or even just

00:43:55.350 --> 00:43:56.040
look.

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:57.870
So I had everything
upended, and it

00:43:57.870 --> 00:44:00.540
looked all like it would
fall apart in a second.

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:04.440
And she took the whole
team to the shop,

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:06.390
and in front of
all the customers,

00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:09.390
screamed at me till
I was in tears.

00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:13.800
So that was my earliest
memory of what it's really

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:15.720
like to work for a villain.

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:18.330
And so I switched
retailers, and I

00:44:18.330 --> 00:44:23.310
ended up with a taller, blonder
version of the same woman,

00:44:23.310 --> 00:44:24.420
and worked for her.

00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:29.280
And she did similar
things that taught me,

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:33.072
essentially, if the person
doesn't want you to succeed,

00:44:33.072 --> 00:44:34.530
there are a billion
things that you

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:37.470
have to get right in your job,
and you will get something

00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:40.590
wrong, and they will find it.

00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:44.370
So I learned that I
couldn't be perfect.

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:45.870
That it was really
embarrassing when

00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:48.960
I had a bloody nose
in front of customers.

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:53.310
And it gave me the impetus
to go to business school

00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:54.800
and completely change my career.

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:57.630
So I went from retail to
consulting, where people--

00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:59.257
only clients yelled at me.

00:44:59.257 --> 00:45:01.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:03.540
It got a lot better.

00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:05.160
AMY YURY: Another
important message

00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:08.470
that I give and have
tried to follow,

00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:11.760
which is once you work
for a terrible boss,

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:12.820
you kind of say, OK.

00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:14.070
JOANNA BARSH: Cut your losses.

00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:17.340
AMY YURY: Yeah,
find great bosses.

00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:19.890
AUDIENCE: So I opened up
your book on an airplane,

00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:21.450
and I think it was
in the forward.

00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:22.950
But I was reading
that what I really

00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:25.890
love about it is it's designed
to-- you can read any chapter.

00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:28.267
You don't have to go
chapter 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:45:28.267 --> 00:45:30.100
And I think that's a
really unique approach.

00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:31.766
I went straight to
the table of contents

00:45:31.766 --> 00:45:33.300
and was looking at like, hm.

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:35.390
What do I want to
start with here first?

00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:37.710
I wanted to ask you why
you made that choice

00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:40.560
and if that was based on some
of your interviews with people

00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:43.470
that you met with,
based on what books

00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:46.620
are available in the marketplace
and how they're structured,

00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:50.250
or what led you to
make that decision.

00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:54.120
JOANNA BARSH: The simple answer
is I did structure it in a way

00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:58.660
that I thought people,
on average, would evolve.

00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:03.120
However, you're going to be
only interested in the challenge

00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:04.200
that you're facing.

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:07.050
So you should start with that
challenge, and get into it,

00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:09.510
and see if you can
get value from it.

00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:14.250
I enjoyed all the chapters, and
I spent a lot of time thinking

00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:16.300
about where they should go.

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:18.960
So it turns out that
there are a couple

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:21.510
of basic themes in the book.

00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:25.440
One is about fear, and
that shows up in pressure.

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:28.290
It shows up in superheroes.

00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:31.950
And it shows up in taking
risk or speaking up,

00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:33.250
daring to challenge.

00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:37.320
Another one is caring,
meaning, purpose,

00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:40.320
that shows up in the first
and the last chapter.

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:41.670
And feeling purposeful.

00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:44.550
And then there is a third
theme around people.

00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:47.590
And so I put all
those guys together,

00:46:47.590 --> 00:46:49.230
bringing people
on board even when

00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:52.350
you just wish you could just
tell them what to do and make

00:46:52.350 --> 00:46:54.870
them do it, and they
just won't do it.

00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:57.120
Or working with creeps.

00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:59.290
Or trying to get a sponsor.

00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:01.230
So those kind of fit together.

00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:04.260
But you're going to have the
best experience of the book

00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:07.734
if you start with
what matters to you.

00:47:07.734 --> 00:47:08.568
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:08.568 --> 00:47:09.400
AMY YURY: All right.

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:10.752
Time for two more questions.

00:47:10.752 --> 00:47:12.210
I know we're running
a little over,

00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:15.000
for folks that have to leave.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:15.780
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:17.790
So I guess, after
listening to you,

00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:19.920
I fall in the
Millennial category.

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:23.052
I thought I was a Gen X.
Something that I've noticed--

00:47:23.052 --> 00:47:24.510
JOANNA BARSH: I'm
a Millennial too,

00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:27.030
even though I'm an old one.

00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:29.700
AUDIENCE: Something I've noticed
in trying to network or start

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:33.150
new conversations
is that often, it's

00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:36.900
really hard to get on the
connecting side with people.

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:40.450
As often, I find that because of
whatever perceptions they have,

00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:43.300
they want to other you instead.

00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:45.960
And so I know that listening
to them is a good strategy

00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:48.060
and should try and
bring them back,

00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:52.500
but it's always like, how do
you get to that listening side?

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:55.440
How do you ask questions
that will help open them up?

00:47:55.440 --> 00:48:00.420
Or what are strategies that
you can do getting to that part

00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:06.367
or in that process to maybe open
them up, maybe bring them back.

00:48:06.367 --> 00:48:08.200
JOANNA BARSH: That's a
really good question.

00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:11.290
So there's a couple of things
for you to think about.

00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:13.160
One is who do you admire.

00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:15.870
And as you reach out
to people you admire,

00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:18.750
actually tell them why you
admire them, specifically,

00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:20.540
not generically.

00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:24.190
There is a woman in the book
whose name is now escaping me.

00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:24.940
Jet lag.

00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:27.330
Let's blame it on
that or my age.

00:48:27.330 --> 00:48:32.160
But anyway, she always
starts with specific praise

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:33.210
that is genuine.

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:37.380
And people love to
hear about themselves.

00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:39.810
So if you start with that,
you've now opened them up.

00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:42.430
And then ask a question of
what's important to you.

00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:46.470
For example, Amy is an
extraordinary marketer,

00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:48.600
and you tell her that,
and then you say,

00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:51.840
I would really like to
learn more about the skills

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:53.010
that you developed early on.

00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:55.740
Is there a way that I
could, without taking any

00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:58.530
of your time, learn from you?

00:48:58.530 --> 00:49:00.960
And she might say,
just walk with me here.

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:03.660
Or just come to this
meeting with me.

00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:07.990
So there is that way
of saying, don't--

00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:10.630
instead of saying,
will you be my mentor,

00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:12.360
which the only answer is no.

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:15.890
Because I'm really--
everybody is really busy.

00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:21.660
But to say, could I just walk
with you down in the elevator?

00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:23.580
I have one question for you.

00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:25.022
That's one way to do it.

00:49:25.022 --> 00:49:26.730
And you've got to have
the questions that

00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:30.280
matter to you, that you think
will matter to that person.

00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:33.270
The other thing that
Sheryl taught me,

00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:37.230
and we've interacted now since
2013 because of our shared

00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:42.610
passion for women, is the effort
to help has to be specific.

00:49:42.610 --> 00:49:44.520
So you might say as
a younger person,

00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:46.380
I really want to help you.

00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:49.330
And that's a burden.

00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:52.050
So you think about,
by helping you,

00:49:52.050 --> 00:49:57.510
what I'd like to do for you
is look at all the research

00:49:57.510 --> 00:50:01.230
that we have access to, and then
I'm going to collate it for you

00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:02.190
or do something.

00:50:02.190 --> 00:50:06.540
So the specific help
that you offer, then

00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:08.170
I could just say yes or no.

00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:11.940
I probably would say, oh
my god, you're such a doll.

00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:13.470
Would you please do that for me?

00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:17.160
AMY YURY: That was how I ended
up becoming better friends with

00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:20.030
Eileen in the early days, when
she was starting Women@ here

00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:20.530
in New York.

00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:21.480
And I said, well,
let me just come,

00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:24.210
and I'll take notes and follow
through on the action items.

00:50:24.210 --> 00:50:26.460
And she was like, great.

00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:29.460
But it was being very
specific with how

00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:32.530
I could help, with something
that was important to her,

00:50:32.530 --> 00:50:34.170
but very tactical and specific.

00:50:34.170 --> 00:50:34.710
So.

00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:36.290
Last question.

00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:37.310
Or we have two.

00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:39.270
You guys want to
both fire them away?

00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:41.140
AUDIENCE: Who's chivalrous?

00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:43.530
AUDIENCE: So I wanted
to ask about the slide

00:50:43.530 --> 00:50:47.580
where you had perceptions of new
leaders compared to old leaders

00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:52.320
and what you think will prevent
the new leaders from ending up

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:53.540
like the old leaders.

00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:57.460
Do you think that it's the
company's culture or something

00:50:57.460 --> 00:50:59.200
with Millennials
that will end up

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:01.737
changing things for
the future, or will we

00:51:01.737 --> 00:51:03.820
see how things are happening
from the old leader's

00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:06.470
perspective and say
we've got to get in line.

00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:08.650
JOANNA BARSH: So there's
this psychological research

00:51:08.650 --> 00:51:11.140
that was done on monkeys.

00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:12.950
And it was-- I'm
trying to remember.

00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:16.600
I think Adam Grant wrote it
up in the book "Option B,"

00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:18.815
but McKinsey uses
it a lot as well.

00:51:18.815 --> 00:51:21.190
So there's this notion that
there are a bunch of monkeys.

00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:22.780
They're in a pen.

00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:27.010
And there's a beautiful bunch
of bananas up these stairs,

00:51:27.010 --> 00:51:28.720
and the first monkey
goes up to get it,

00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:31.540
and he gets doused with water.

00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:33.580
Like, really a horrible hose.

00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:35.150
He falls down.

00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:37.110
So the second monkey
goes, I can do better.

00:51:37.110 --> 00:51:38.110
I can do this.

00:51:38.110 --> 00:51:39.540
Goes up.

00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:40.210
Water.

00:51:40.210 --> 00:51:41.590
Third monkey.

00:51:41.590 --> 00:51:44.050
After a while, the
monkeys stop going up

00:51:44.050 --> 00:51:46.450
the ladder to get the
bananas because they

00:51:46.450 --> 00:51:48.460
know what's coming.

00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:50.470
The monkeys die.

00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:51.739
Sad, but it happens.

00:51:51.739 --> 00:51:52.780
They take the monkey out.

00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:54.460
They put a new monkey in.

00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:56.980
The monkey doesn't
go up the ladder.

00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:58.480
The new monkey.

00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:00.320
And why is that happening?

00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:03.130
Because the older monkeys are
saying, you go up the ladder,

00:52:03.130 --> 00:52:05.815
you're going to get
shot with water.

00:52:05.815 --> 00:52:06.940
It's a horrible experience.

00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:07.540
Don't do it.

00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:09.640
Now obviously, they do
that in monkey talk.

00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:10.900
But they figure out.

00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:14.350
They literally hold that young
monkey from doing that thing.

00:52:14.350 --> 00:52:15.910
That's my fear.

00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:21.360
My fear is that cultures tend
to show us how to be successful,

00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:23.890
and the young people who
are the most successful

00:52:23.890 --> 00:52:29.800
in the culture's definition will
mold to look like the leaders.

00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:32.620
And this is one of the many,
many reasons why it's harder

00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:34.600
for women than men,
because men are

00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:38.860
more capable of mirroring the
man at the top that they see.

00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:41.410
It's much harder for
women to do that.

00:52:41.410 --> 00:52:45.680
The second thing that happens
to people is you get successful.

00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:47.290
So you're a young
person, and you're

00:52:47.290 --> 00:52:50.260
getting success in this
formula that you don't even

00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:50.920
know you have.

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:53.170
But it becomes a
formula pretty quickly,

00:52:53.170 --> 00:52:54.610
and then you just repeat it.

00:52:54.610 --> 00:52:59.180
And as you are successful,
your mind starts to shut down.

00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:00.580
Like, I'm successful doing this.

00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:01.330
This is efficient.

00:53:01.330 --> 00:53:02.260
I'm going to do it again.

00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:03.718
I'm going to do it
again and again.

00:53:03.718 --> 00:53:06.070
Make all this money and be
famous and all these things.

00:53:06.070 --> 00:53:08.314
And you close yourself down.

00:53:08.314 --> 00:53:09.730
And so one of the
things I noticed

00:53:09.730 --> 00:53:13.300
when I interview older
very successful leaders

00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:15.160
is they weren't that curious.

00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:16.210
They had it.

00:53:16.210 --> 00:53:17.530
They knew the story.

00:53:17.530 --> 00:53:18.820
They delivered the story.

00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:20.450
And they were done.

00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:23.560
So those are the
two giant rocks that

00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:26.350
are threatening to crush you
as you go through the ladder.

00:53:26.350 --> 00:53:29.470
And I think what you could
do to avoid it is one,

00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:33.400
as a community, shift the
culture, which can actually

00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:34.450
be done pretty quickly.

00:53:34.450 --> 00:53:36.600
The leaders have
to want to do it.

00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:37.870
They have to role model it.

00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:41.004
And the second is to ask
yourself all the time

00:53:41.004 --> 00:53:41.920
what can I learn here.

00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:43.810
If you just start with that.

00:53:43.810 --> 00:53:46.359
I'm successful, what
can I learn here?

00:53:46.359 --> 00:53:46.900
It will help.

00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:49.480
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:51.092
AMY YURY: I learned a lot.

00:53:51.092 --> 00:53:52.300
I always do from you, Joanna.

00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:53.560
AUDIENCE: I'll ask you later.

00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:54.268
JOANNA BARSH: OK.

00:53:54.268 --> 00:53:55.690
I'll be here.

00:53:55.690 --> 00:53:56.770
AMY YURY: Wonderful.

00:53:56.770 --> 00:53:58.212
Thank you for joining us.

00:53:58.212 --> 00:53:59.420
JOANNA BARSH: You're welcome.

00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:02.530
AMY YURY: Stay
curious, and we will

00:54:02.530 --> 00:54:04.472
do our best to grow
and continue to grow

00:54:04.472 --> 00:54:05.680
while we work here at Google.

00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:07.980
So everybody, thank you.
