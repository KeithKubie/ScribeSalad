00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.719
One thing we really recommend in this
program is to try to get into a routine.

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.580
When you do on campus classes, you
kind of have the routine provided for

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.340
you, you go to class a certain number
of times a week at a certain time.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.140
And that kind of gives you
your routine for that course.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.620
Online though, we don't have that.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.379
So we really recommend that you set
aside a certain time each week to watch

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.870
the lectures, a certain time each
week to work on the assignments.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.750
And definitely set aside some time
each week to interact on Piazza with

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.030
your TAs, instructors and classmates.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.820
That'll make sure you don't
get into a situation where

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.790
halfway into the semester you find out,
I'm way behind on this class and

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:29.600
I'm never going to catch up.
