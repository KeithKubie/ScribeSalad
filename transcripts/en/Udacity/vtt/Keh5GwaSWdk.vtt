00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.270
We've learned even more about the relationship between age

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.620
and friend count by making use of the variables' gender

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.970
and tenure. We've seen that users who have been

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.270
on the site longer, typically have higher friend counts across

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.650
ages. Now, this leaves me wondering if friend requests

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.820
are the same or different across groups. Do new users

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.520
go on friending sprees? Or do users with more

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.248
tenure initiate more friendships? Let's explore this with a plot.

00:00:25.248 --> 00:00:26.781
I want you to create a line

00:00:26.781 --> 00:00:30.406
graph of friendships initiated per day, versus tenure.

00:00:30.406 --> 00:00:32.506
You need to make use of the variables

00:00:32.506 --> 00:00:37.270
age, tenure, friendships initiated, and year_joined.bucket. The color

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.126
of each part of your one line should

00:00:39.126 --> 00:00:42.410
correspond to each bucket of year_joined. You'll also

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.220
need to subset the data to only consider users with at least one day of tenure.
