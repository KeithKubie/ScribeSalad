should ask we should answer right now my
problem with nuclear weapons is rather

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579
problem with nuclear weapons is rather
 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.310
problem with nuclear weapons is rather
different I believe that America knows

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320
different I believe that America knows
 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.990

how to deter countries that have nuclear

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000
how to deter countries that have nuclear
 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.789
how to deter countries that have nuclear
weapons countries that have nuclear

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799
weapons countries that have nuclear
 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.289

weapons are not gonna attack the United
 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.150
weapons are not gonna attack the United
States because if they do we're going to

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160
States because if they do we're going to
 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.520
States because if they do we're going to
annihilate them we'll be very sad for us

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530
annihilate them we'll be very sad for us
 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.400
annihilate them we'll be very sad for us
it will be even sadder for them right

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410
it will be even sadder for them right
 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.710
it will be even sadder for them right
they're mostly small nuclear powers we

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720
they're mostly small nuclear powers we
 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.270
they're mostly small nuclear powers we
were a great at large nuclear power

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280
were a great at large nuclear power
 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.059
were a great at large nuclear power
right the whole thing would be very very

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069
right the whole thing would be very very
 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:12.699
right the whole thing would be very very
very sad and tragic and it's easy for

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709
very sad and tragic and it's easy for
 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.170
very sad and tragic and it's easy for
the other side to know how tragic it's

the other side to know how tragic it's
 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.729
the other side to know how tragic it's
going to be because our nuclear forces

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739
going to be because our nuclear forces
 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.310
going to be because our nuclear forces
are not a secret right we have fifteen

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320
are not a secret right we have fifteen
 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.409
are not a secret right we have fifteen

and we are getting ready to spend a
 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.710
and we are getting ready to spend a
trillion dollars modernizing that for us

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720
trillion dollars modernizing that for us
 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.439
trillion dollars modernizing that for us
to keep it tip-top shape

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:35.449
to keep it tip-top shape
 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.050
to keep it tip-top shape
I think deterrence we can do so what do

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060
I think deterrence we can do so what do
 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.179
I think deterrence we can do so what do
I worry about I worry about not nuclear

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:40.189
I worry about I worry about not nuclear
 

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:42.010
I worry about I worry about not nuclear
weapons in the hands of States but

weapons that are lost nuclear weapons

00:04:47.679 --> 00:04:47.689
weapons that are lost nuclear weapons
 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:49.089
weapons that are lost nuclear weapons
that are stolen nuclear weapons that are

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:49.099
that are stolen nuclear weapons that are
 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:51.879
that are stolen nuclear weapons that are
poor aligned right nuclear weapons are

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889
poor aligned right nuclear weapons are
 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.450
poor aligned right nuclear weapons are
sold off the back of trucks right so

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460
sold off the back of trucks right so
 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.820
sold off the back of trucks right so
what do you do about that well people

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830
what do you do about that well people
 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.980
what do you do about that well people
who believe in the non-proliferation

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990
who believe in the non-proliferation
 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.350
who believe in the non-proliferation
story will say well this is just another

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360
story will say well this is just another

reason to prevent more stage from

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740
reason to prevent more stage from
 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.439
reason to prevent more stage from
getting nuclear weapons I say yes but

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449
getting nuclear weapons I say yes but
 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:06.520
getting nuclear weapons I say yes but
what about all the states that already

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530
what about all the states that already
 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.680
what about all the states that already
have nuclear weapons including some that

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690
have nuclear weapons including some that
 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.689
have nuclear weapons including some that
I'm guessing don't really have very

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:10.699
I'm guessing don't really have very
 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:14.050
I'm guessing don't really have very
great can really terrific controls so my

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060
great can really terrific controls so my
 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.740
great can really terrific controls so my
view is our nuclear proliferation policy

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750
view is our nuclear proliferation policy
 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.300
view is our nuclear proliferation policy
is directed at the wrong thing in the

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310
is directed at the wrong thing in the
 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.339
is directed at the wrong thing in the
wrong problem what we want to do is make

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349
wrong problem what we want to do is make
 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:22.719
wrong problem what we want to do is make
sure that nuclear weapons are in the

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729
sure that nuclear weapons are in the
 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:25.360
sure that nuclear weapons are in the
hands of states remain in the hands of

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370
hands of states remain in the hands of
 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.700
hands of states remain in the hands of
States any state that has nuclear

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710
States any state that has nuclear
 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.379
States any state that has nuclear
weapons we should be talking to them

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389
weapons we should be talking to them
 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:31.959
weapons we should be talking to them
about best practices to ensure that

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:31.969
about best practices to ensure that
 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:35.260
about best practices to ensure that
nobody sells nobody steals nobody loses

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270
nobody sells nobody steals nobody loses
 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.170
nobody sells nobody steals nobody loses
nobody breaks right this is this

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180
nobody breaks right this is this
 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.689
nobody breaks right this is this
requires a lot of application a lot of

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:40.699
requires a lot of application a lot of
 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:43.540
requires a lot of application a lot of
organization right to be a responsible

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550
organization right to be a responsible
 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.659
organization right to be a responsible
nuclear power is hard work it took us a

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669
nuclear power is hard work it took us a
 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:49.119
nuclear power is hard work it took us a
long time to learn how to do it right

00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:49.129
long time to learn how to do it right
 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:51.459
long time to learn how to do it right
we've actually in the past taught others

00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:51.469
we've actually in the past taught others
 

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:53.920
we've actually in the past taught others
how to do it this should be the the

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930
how to do it this should be the the
 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.079
how to do it this should be the the
thing that we focus on in the world from

00:05:56.079 --> 00:05:56.089
thing that we focus on in the world from
 

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:57.969
thing that we focus on in the world from
the nuclear weapons problem right

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:57.979
the nuclear weapons problem right
 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:05:59.740
the nuclear weapons problem right
because once nuclear weapons are not in

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750
because once nuclear weapons are not in
 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.839
because once nuclear weapons are not in
the hands of States in the hands of

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:01.849
the hands of States in the hands of
 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:04.269
the hands of States in the hands of
individuals or groups then deterrence

00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:04.279
individuals or groups then deterrence
 

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:08.320
individuals or groups then deterrence
becomes hard because Rev a radical group

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330
becomes hard because Rev a radical group
 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.379
becomes hard because Rev a radical group
a terrorist group a millennial group and

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:11.389
a terrorist group a millennial group and
 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:12.939
a terrorist group a millennial group and
I don't mean the generation I mean

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:12.949
I don't mean the generation I mean

people who imagine some you know magic

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:15.650
people who imagine some you know magic
 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.499
people who imagine some you know magic
moment where history is gonna be

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:17.509
moment where history is gonna be
 

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:20.290
moment where history is gonna be
transformed right they they you can't

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.300
transformed right they they you can't
 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.610
transformed right they they you can't
deter you've got they've got nothing

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620
deter you've got they've got nothing
 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.680
deter you've got they've got nothing
that they value that you can threaten to

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690
that they value that you can threaten to
 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.719
that they value that you can threaten to
retaliate against countries have many

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:25.729
retaliate against countries have many
 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:27.459
retaliate against countries have many
things they value that you could threat

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:27.469
things they value that you could threat
 

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:29.019

it's all our aid against these groups

00:06:29.019 --> 00:06:29.029
it's all our aid against these groups
 

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:31.450
it's all our aid against these groups
may have nothing did you can retaliate

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:31.460
may have nothing did you can retaliate
 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.279
may have nothing did you can retaliate
again so it's very important to keep

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:33.289
again so it's very important to keep
 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:35.460
again so it's very important to keep
nuclear weapons out of their hands

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:35.470
nuclear weapons out of their hands
 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:43.449
