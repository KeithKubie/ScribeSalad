00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
&gt;&gt; Yes, of course, India can become a superpower.
That's what, in fact, we've been talking about

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.380
for the last ten years
and we've seen the rapid progress has been.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.629
The last one year has been a blip mark not
because of India but because

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:19.410
of the world economy [INAUDIBLE].
What we do not really have in place totally

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.740
and need to work towards is
the total political will to make it happen.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.100
Having the [INAUDIBLE] government in the second
session in a much

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.273
better position, will definitely help.
But at the same time, the willingness of the

00:00:35.273 --> 00:00:40.120
executive to work with the
private sector as well as with the social

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.890
sector to make the progress
happen is extremely important.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:52.540
In the private sector [INAUDIBLE] the new
enterprise of the businesses,

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.653
the people are just ready to go and want to
go.

00:00:56.653 --> 00:01:02.220
That is also reflected in the [INAUDIBLE]
initiatives that in place

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:09.039
have taken.
We hope to also reintegrate that -- our total

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:13.430
population and youth is
totally motivated and brought together to

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.290
play a role in this progress.
It will be a five-year or a 20-year plan depending

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.329
on how well we
manage the process.

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:25.420
At the minimum the 20-year plan can work,
if we have a total commitment

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.249
to changing the education sector.
This is the most important reform that that

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:37.800
we need to put in place and
in the timeframe to 20 to 30 years it is so

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.189
possible, so possible, that
I'll be surprised if we don't achieve it.
