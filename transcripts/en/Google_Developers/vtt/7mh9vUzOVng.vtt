&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Joe Gregorio and I work for Google
in

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.980
developer relations and today we're gonna
talk about

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.840
installing a Google App Engine application
into a

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.490
Google Apps domain.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.089
You may wanna do this so your users have a
more uniform

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:16.250
experience with the application, as it'll
now show up in a

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.300
sub domain of your domain, and the user authentication
can

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.830
also use the single sign-on mechanism that
you use for the

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.490
rest of the Google Apps domain.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.460
For example, I have this very simple App engine
application.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.380
It's the simple "Hello world!" That ships
with Google App

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.250
engine.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.860
So, it currently runs on appspot.com.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.240
I also own the domain bitworking.info, which
is a Google

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.380
Apps domain.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.310
Now, I'd like to install that "Hello world!"
application into

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.820
my domain.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.010
So, the first thing we need to do is upload
my application.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.190
And as you can see, I've already done that
and it's working

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.530
on the Appspot domain.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.960
Now, I go to the application dashboard for
the Google App

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.180
engine.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.330
I go down to versions and here I've only got
the first

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.510
version, version number one, and down here
it says domain

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.650
setup.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.830
Want to host your application on another domain?

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.550
Yes, I do.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.790
So, we will click "Add."

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:23.860
That is bitworking.info where I want to Add
that.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.120
I click "Add."

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.400
Now, there are terms and conditions I need
to agree to.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.780
You will need to read this carefully.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.130
I accept those conditions and I will now Activate
the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.450
service.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.350
And that's it.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.240
I'm done.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:45.370
So, now if I go back to my domain, and refresh,
you'll now see

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.729
that jcgregorio-test, my simple "Hello world!"

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.010
Application is now available, and it's available
at this

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.400
domain.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:02.170
So, now I can go in and add a new URL for
it, and I can

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.090
say -- I can add in, hello.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.539
So, now that application will now be available
at

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.430
hello.bitworking.info.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.230
I press "Add."

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.430
My site is updated and now it should be available.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.299
So, let's try that.

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.670
hello.bitworking.info.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.430
And there's my "Hello world!" application.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.120
So, that shows you how to install that application
into the

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.049
domain.

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.499
We haven't available shown off any of the
authentication

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:41.829
options. So, in order to do that, let's go
back to our new

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:46.209
template project and add in one more thing
to it.

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.400
So, you can see here we're going to require
login to our

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.709
"Hello world!"

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.760
Once we do that, we're going to need to create
a new

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.299
application ID.

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.809
So, domain App testing, that's available.

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:03.749
And now when I create it I do wanna choose
a different style

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:05.790
of authentication.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:12.739
You want to restrict logins to bitworking.info
domain.

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.359
Now, our domain has been created.

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.510
We now go through the same exact steps, as
we did before to

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:27.249
add this application into the bitworking info
domain.

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:34.049
Now, we have to, again, accept the service
agreement and there

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:34.760
we go.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.559
It's been installed.

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:40.900
You add a new sub domain, and now the application
should be

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.469
available at that sub domain.

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:48.329
Now, when I go to access the Hello secure
application, I'm

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:54.469
redirected to the login for the bitworking.info
domain.

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:57.689
Once we log into the domain, now the application
is

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:00.199
available.

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.760
And that's it.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.489
That's all it takes to add in an application
into your

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:05.249
domain.

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:06.329
Thanks, and have fun.
