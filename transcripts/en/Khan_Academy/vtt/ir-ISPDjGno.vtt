00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:01.870
- [Instructor] One of the core ideas

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.658
of Capital in the Twenty-First Century

00:00:04.658 --> 00:00:09.120
is looking at the after-tax
return on capital.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.030
Return, on, let me write
that a little bit neater,

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.301
return on capital,

00:00:16.301 --> 00:00:21.030
and comparing that to economic growth

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.810
with the contention that
if the return on capital,

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.730
if R is greater than G,

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.650
if R is greater than G,

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.880
than this is associated with,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.296
this right over here would be associated

00:00:37.296 --> 00:00:39.310
with rising income equality

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.860
and that more and more
income is going to go

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.640
towards the owners of
capital versus labor.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.060
And since capital tends to be concentrated

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.410
and wealth, you could
view capital as wealth,

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.010
and since wealth tends to be concentrated,

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.410
that'll just make the concentration

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.080
happen even further, even
more inequalities in wealth.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.577
Now before we get into that,

00:00:58.577 --> 00:01:02.080
and whether you believe
that causality or not,

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.950
is let's just understand return on capital

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.230
and how that might
compare to economic growth

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.890
and how that might
create returns to income

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.913
to the owners of capital
or income to labor.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.700
To think this through, let's just think

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.940
of a very, very simple economy.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.210
Let's say the whole economy
is nothing but a gold mine.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.680
So let's say this is
year one right over here

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.280
and the whole value of the economy,

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.290
all the wealth in the economy,

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.960
so the capital in the economy,

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.280
let's say that we just value
it as 1,000 gold pieces.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.080
And obviously, we could go
into how is that valued, etc.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.230
And that actually does
come into the conversation,

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.500
is are we thinking about
the market value of things

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.580
or are we looking at some things
on a more intrinsic basis,

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.230
but let's just go with this
simple analogy right now

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.220
just to start to get our
hands around the idea,

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.080
our heads around the
ideas of return on capital

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.110
and economic growth and how
they might relate to each other.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.440
So the capital, let's say
it's 1,000 gold pieces.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.590
I'll just write gp for short.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.360
1,000 gold pieces.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.920
And let's say that in that
year, the national income,

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.640
so it's a gold mine, so
it's just producing gold.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.150
So, let me do this in green,

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.733
so national income.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.630
And the whole nation is
just a big gold mine.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.120
National income, let's say

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.580
we have a national income
of 100 gold pieces.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.000
100 gold pieces.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.830
And let's say that that's divided

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.310
between income to labor, you needed people

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.587
to work on the gold mine,
to actually mine things

00:02:47.587 --> 00:02:49.740
and whatever else,

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.320
and this 100 gold pieces
is going to be split

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.950
between the owners of the capital,

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.440
the people who own the land and the tools

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.830
and whatever else of the gold mine,

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.792
and the people doing the work, the labor.

00:03:01.792 --> 00:03:06.792
So let's say that 50
of this, 50 gold pieces

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.900
goes to labor, so that's
the part that goes to labor

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.580
and let's say that 50 gold pieces

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.000
goes to the owners of capital.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.383
So I'll just say it goes to capital.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.440
And let's say maybe
there's no taxes in this,

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.710
we're not going to go into taxes

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:26.900
and complicate things just yet.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.780
So this is the after tax.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.770
So we can now calculate
the return on capital.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.740
R in year one,

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.800
R is going to be equal to,

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.210
well, the owners of
capital got 50 gold pieces.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.093
They got 50 gold pieces.

00:03:43.081 --> 00:03:47.570
And the capital that they
employed was 1,000 gold pieces,

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.570
50 divided by 1,000,
this is going to be 5%

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.830
right over here.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.400
Now, let's think about this

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.260
in the context of economic growth.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.210
Let's say we go from year one to year two.

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.277
So now let's go to year two.

00:04:08.012 --> 00:04:09.160
And we'll just say for
the sake of argument

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.120
that all of this capital that the owners

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.430
of the capital got,
that they reinvested it

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.750
back into the gold mine.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.050
So now the value of the gold mine,

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.580
so the capital now in year two,

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.460
is going to be 1,050 gold pieces.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.900
The 1,000 that we started
with, we earned another 50,

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.040
we're reinvesting that
back into the capital,

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.180
maybe we buy some more
equipment, some more land,

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.080
whatever it might be, and so
now it's 1,050 gold pieces.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.800
And let's say the next year,
the national income grows.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.800
So, national income, once again,

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.770
we're saying this is a
super-simplified economy,

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.151
overly simplified,
arguably, that's nothing

00:04:51.151 --> 00:04:54.210
but one big gold mine.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.360
And now let's say the
national income grew by,

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.090
let's say it grew by 2%.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.090
So the national income
is 102, 102 gold pieces.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.280
Now, there's a bunch of ways
that we could split this,

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.520
but let's just say for
the sake of argument,

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.023
well, let's just make it
clear what we just said,

00:05:19.626 --> 00:05:23.270
we just said that our growth
right over here is 2%.

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.270
Now the question, and this is one

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.280
of the central questions of the book,

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.280
is just because R is greater
than G in this situation,

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.490
is that going to lead to
more of the national income

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.510
going to the owners of capital

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.350
or is going to go the other way around?

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.670
Or is the level of inequality
going to stay neutral?

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:46.370
I encourage you to pause
this video right now

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.890
and try to think about that on your own.

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.530
Given all of these numbers,

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.240
come up with different break downs

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.760
of, say, year two's national income,

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.960
breaking it down between
how much goes to labor

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.460
and how much goes to capital.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.450
And think about, in this situation

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:00.360
where r is greater than g,

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.963
is it always going to
lead to more inequality?

00:06:02.963 --> 00:06:06.480
Well, it actually depends how
you break it down this year.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.740
So you could definitely have a situation

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.750
where you have, potentially,
growing inequality.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.822
So, for example, you
could have a situation

00:06:13.822 --> 00:06:17.873
where still labor gets 50 gold pieces,

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.250
50 gold pieces,

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:25.250
while capital is getting
52, 52 gold pieces.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.430
Now the return on capital is going to be

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.500
52 divided by 1,050,

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.463
52 divided by 1,050.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.650
The amount of income to capital is 52,

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.480
the value of the capital
is 1,050 gold pieces.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:46.160
And so we have a return
on capital of four point,

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.810
almost five percent, but a
little bit under five percent.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.810
4.95%, so in this scenario,
the return on capital

00:06:57.387 --> 00:06:59.083
is approximately 4.95%.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.780
And we see that, once
again, R is greater than G,

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.893
and inequality seems to be
getting a little bit more,

00:07:08.316 --> 00:07:10.030
the owners of the capital are getting more

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:11.580
of the income, a larger percentage.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.580
They're getting more than
50%, than they saw before.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.480
But you could have things
go the other way around.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.980
You could have things
go the other way around.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.060
Maybe labor had a little
bit more leverage this year,

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.700
and they were able to
negotiate some wage increases,

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.610
and so you have 52 gold
pieces going to labor

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.100
and 50 going to capital.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.340
Now, what's the return on capital?

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:37.510
Well, in this situation,
the return on capital

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:40.490
is going to be 50,

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.410
so they're essentially
getting the same income,

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:44.010
but over a larger investment,

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:45.940
over a larger capital base.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.830
Over 1,050, which is equal to...

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:54.830
So 50 divided by 1,050 gets us to 4.76%.

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:02.730
So, approximately 4.76%.

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:06.600
Approximately 4.76%.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.590
So just in this very,
I guess you could say,

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:12.920
simplified analysis, you
could see just looking

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.900
superficially at R and comparing it

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:18.034
superficially to G from
one year to the next

00:08:18.034 --> 00:08:22.580
doesn't necessarily mean
that you're going to have

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.660
rising income equality.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.520
Now, it could be a proxy for it,

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.060
it could be kind of a very high level way

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:29.893
of looking at things,

00:08:29.893 --> 00:08:31.920
but just in and of itself,
if someone told you

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.410
in a year, hey, R, the return on capital

00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:37.460
is greater than G, you can't say for sure

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:41.580
in that year that has gone by

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:44.950
that there has been an
increase in inequality.

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:46.790
Now, what we will do
in the next few videos

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:48.556
is dig a little bit
deeper in that question

00:08:48.556 --> 00:08:51.558
and use some spreadsheets
to look at some scenarios.

00:08:51.558 --> 00:08:55.378
Look at scenarios where
maybe we hold R constant

00:08:55.378 --> 00:08:59.500
or R and G constant and see
what happens to inequality,

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.825
or maybe we hold inequality
constant and see what

00:09:02.825 --> 00:09:05.040
R has to trend to.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.863
And we'll do that in the next video.
