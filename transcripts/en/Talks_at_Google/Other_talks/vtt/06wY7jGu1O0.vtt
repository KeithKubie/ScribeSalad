BRAD TEMPLETON: Hi, welcome,
this is Green at Google.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.600
I'm Brad Templeton, and
today we have Olver

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.990
Kuttner from Edison2.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.690
This company was the company
that won the X Prize for the

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.340
most efficient car that
was sponsored

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.060
by Progressive Insurance.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.129
In this contest, people had to
make cars that could go better

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.800
than 100 miles per gallon.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.160
They surprised everyone by
actually winning with a liquid

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.100
fuel-powered car, when the rules
had been aimed very much

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.215
for an electric car to win.

00:00:24.215 --> 00:00:27.390
So Oliver has been committed
to making cars lighter and

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.840
more efficient and, is now
planning to use his prize

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.650
money to commercialize what they
built into a consumer car

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.280
that's the most efficient
out there.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.250
So, Oliver.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.340
OLIVER KUTTNER: Unfortunately,
before I used more than the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.650
prize money.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:41.860
We see a clear opportunity.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.210
So basically, as you said,
the whole thing

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.540
began with the X Prize.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.460
It wasn't looking for the most
efficient car, it was looking

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.110
for a car that is better than
100 miles per gallon and meets

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.840
a whole series of
other criteria.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.200
It had to seat four people.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.360
It had to be producible.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.880
It had to have structures that,
with some modifications,

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.160
could meet all the
safety standards.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.120
There were a lot of
other things.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.530
It had to meet, if you decided
to burn fuel, emissions

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.040
standards, which turned
out to be probably the

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.930
single hardest thing.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.710
Anyway, you preempted it.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.140
We did win it.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.310
What I did is I pulled together
a group of people

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.600
from motor sports, which is
something that I've been

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.950
interested in all my life, and
some aerodynamicists , and put

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:38.640
together a team.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.680
Altogether, we were almost 100
people, about 20 core people.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.230
The big "aha" moment was
the initial analysis.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.980
I really believe that it's
time well spent to really

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.960
study stuff upfront
rather than guess

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.790
out and start working.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.590
At the time, I didn't know much
about efficiency cars.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.350
But racing, of course, is
efficiency because you have to

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.560
do everything in a fixed time,
and you don't want to burn

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.170
fuel, and you want to go
as fast as you can.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.620
All those things are trade-offs
of efficiency.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.130
And at the time, I remember the
president had pretty much

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.460
announced that we didn't have
an energy problem because

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.990
hydrogen fuel cells were coming,
and we were going to

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.110
have a hydrogen economy.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.100
And so it was natural for us
to evaluate that first.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:31.530
And in very short order, we
found problems, like a typical

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.130
gas station has a certain
number of PTU's that it

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.740
dispenses every day.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.710
And that's roughly equivalent
to a single

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.710
tanker truck of gasoline.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.330
If you wanted to fill the gas
station with hydrogen, you'd

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.750
have to bring in 22
tanker trucks.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.860
The mechanics of it
became difficult.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.010
Forget about the fact that it's
corrosive and you don't

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.100
know where the hydrogen
comes from.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.330
The message in this was that
those in charge don't

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.800
necessarily know.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.270
And this is a message that we've
been carrying all along.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.500
Hybrids are the answer, I'm
going to get to that shortly,

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.840
and electric cars
is the current,

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.520
maybe crashing, story.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.730
To me, losing was
not an option.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.650
So we basically looked at
everything from the ground up.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.480
And one of the first things we
did is we said, Well, how do

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.410
you measure fuel efficiency?

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.300
We looked at most of the main
standardization bodies, Japan,

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.400
Germany, USA.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.030
And we found that the EPA is
probably the single best

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.800
institution.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.260
Their test cycles are very
representative of what

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.600
actually happens.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.140
And what you're looking at is
a graph of a city cycle.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.810
It's a very prescribed

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.200
acceleration-braking situation.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.750
And you can translate that
into energy spent as a

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.980
function of what it
is you're moving.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.250
If it's heavier, you
need more energy.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.610
So what is interesting to note
in here, is the blue lines are

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:59.860
energy spent.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.020
The red line is energy available
for recovery, if you

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.750
could grab it all.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.560
The green line is the cumulative
energy spent, and

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.900
the purple line is the
cumulative total energy

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.830
available for recovery.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.709
We know that a very great
company, Toyota, has really

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.660
perfected the hybrid.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.460
And on a good day, they
can capture 30% of

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.700
the recoverable energy.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.840
That means 30 percent of the
purple line, which means the

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.210
potentially recoverable
energy is not so big.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.250
So making a hybrid out of a
car doesn't get you to a

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.570
paradigm shift.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.410
It is worth it.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.630
And you can take that math
further, and you can look at

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.200
the weight of a car.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.900
And the difference between the
green line below and the red

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.850
line is essentially the profit
from going hybrid.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.490
And as you notice, as the cars
get heavier, going hybrid is

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.860
worth more and more, which
means a bus that's hybrid

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.310
makes a lot of sense.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.210
But on the converse, as you get
down to 1,000 pounds, what

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.360
you gain from going hybrid
is minuscule.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.730
As a matter of fact, it may be
so little that the hybrid gear

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.620
costs you more than
what you gain.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.550
Now the other thing is, in
racing, you learn, in order to

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.790
win, first you must finish.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.890
So if you add a hybrid here,
an electric drive, you have

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.260
two drive lines.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.260
You have a much higher
likelihood

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.880
of mechanical failure.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.930
And this was a one-time shot
at making money, so

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.120
we didn't want it.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.030
So in the end result,
we decided we're

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.990
going to go with gasoline.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.720
We decided to run E85, because
it gave us some advantages in

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.090
the way the emissions work.

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.570
And in miles per gallon
equivalent, we were able to

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.560
record 129 on the highway.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.150
And final X Prize, I think we
got 102.5, but in the lab we

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.960
actually got 109 as a combined
cycle efficiency.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.770
The car had an unprecedented
combination of low weight and

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:03.710
low aerodynamic drag.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.450
We beat both our targets
in those numbers.

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.790
We did not beat our target in
the brake-specific fuel

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.960
consumption of the engine, but
all in all, it was enough.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.860
And it was interesting because,
two years before we

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.050
ran X Prize, we predicted we
might get 110 miles per

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.630
gallon, and we actually
got 109.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:27.080
The most significant number is
that our car can go 60 miles

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.530
an hour using 5.3 horsepower.

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.940
Now, the X Prize, some laugh
at it and see it

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.470
as a science project.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.490
It clearly was a science
project, but you have to start

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.600
with a science project.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.760
Google, outside you have cars
that have big things on top

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.170
and they look like a
science project.

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.360
But they're amazing cars and
they're clearly the future.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.730
So we all start somewhere.

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:55.840
Since the X Prize, we've been
working on turning the science

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.650
project into a product that
consumers might want.

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.100
One of the things we did
recognize, even though we were

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.290
very skeptical about electric
cars initially, is that I

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:08.910
believe today that electric
cars are the mandatory,

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.750
inevitable future
of automobiles.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:17.330
They make a lot of sense, they
are quite wonderful, there are

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.030
economic reasons to go that
way, but they also are the

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:25.640
only path to truly something
promising in the future.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.590
In effect what we've done, by
creating a very light car,

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.830
we've solved the battery
problem.

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:35.070
Because when a car is very
light, it needs less energy,

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:37.440
which means you can carry a
smaller battery, which means

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.790
the battery costs less,
which means your

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:41.500
charge time is shorter.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.460
To really put it in perspective,
this car, which

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:50.190
Brad saw some months ago, it
was here, can be charged at

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.710
any 110-volt outlet
in this room.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:56.560
In six hours you get a full
charge for 100 miles.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.580
If you want to drive this car
cross-country, like I did

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.990
recently, you can buy a two
kilowatt-hour Honda generator

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:06.910
that weighs 44 pounds, and put
it in the trunk, and plug in

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:07.840
an extension cord.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.580
And you can pretty much drive
to the other side of the

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.040
country by putting gas in it.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.670
What is quite stunning is this
very efficient car, using the

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:20.330
Honda generator, only gets
44 miles per gallon.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:24.270
What this tells you is how you
lose, and lose, and lose.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:27.010
It's the compounding
effect of losing.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:29.050
This is what I was trying
to explain to you.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:33.570
So this generator converts
gasoline into electricity.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:36.840
The electricity goes into a
battery and comes back out.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.990
And every time, you lose a
few percentage points.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:41.780
By the time you're done, the
109-mile-per-gallon,

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:48.760
129-mile-per-gallon highway car
gets 44 miles per gallon.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.390
There are a lot of lessons
that we've learned.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:54.160
But I will say, electric
cars are the future.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.810
They need to be.

00:08:55.810 --> 00:09:01.240
Now, fuel price is not what's
going to change the world.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.560
In Europe there are plenty of
people going Porsche Cayennes,

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.890
and gasoline is $10.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:09.580
What will change the world is
that worldwide CO2 regulations

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.590
are now real, they are here.

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:16.120
In the US specific, this is a
graph that we prepared some

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.460
months ago.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:21.700
These are the current
regulations starting in 2016

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.820
through 2025.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.190
And the red dots are the
larger-volume cars sold in the

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:29.270
United States today.

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:32.410
The fleet averages must
be below the lines.

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:35.730
And the line allows a larger car
to have more CO2, that's

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:38.020
why it's a curved line.

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.950
But you can figure out very
quickly that the average is

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:45.020
way above the lines, and every
year the line drops.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:46.730
Essentially, the industry's
in trouble.

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:49.580
The industry was counting
on electric cars being

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.690
larger-scale adopted.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:54.880
They would be compliance
boosters.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.535
Those cars are not selling
in numbers.

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:00.760
This is here, this
is real, and this

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.140
will change the industry.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.900
At this point, in Detroit and
everywhere else in the world,

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.590
people are really starting
to wonder what to do.

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:14.410
Because, as opposed to every
other law before, the penalty

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:17.620
for not complying means you lose
your license to sell cars

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.400
in the United States.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:23.120
This means that a company like
Land Rover, Jaguar, or

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:28.860
Mercedes could be faced with
not selling a single car.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.490
And that is catastrophic.

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.710
So losing this is
not an option.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:35.300
Essentially, they have the
same test that I had five

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.960
years ago with X Prize,
just bigger numbers.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.100
And currently, everybody thinks
they're going to keep

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.520
doing business as usual, and
shave off a little here and

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.450
shave off a little there.

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:50.110
This is going to cost
billions of dollars.

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:53.600
If you do it correctly, you
might meet the standards, but

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.250
I do ask where do you
go from there.

00:10:56.250 --> 00:11:00.250
Because you're now pulling out
all your weapons, and even if

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:02.470
you meet the standards with
all your weapons, at some

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:05.490
point, you're going to run
out of ammunition.

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:09.880
And all of these technologies
make a lot of sense.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.610
But it goes to the old Einstein
saying, if you want

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:16.210
to come out with a different
outcome, you have to approach

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:17.020
the problem differently.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.170
And I will drive this point
home with this slide.

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:22.110
In my opinion this
is the actual

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:25.090
efficiency limit of a car.

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:28.430
Essentially, cars are
architecturally all the same.

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:32.210
Today's cars are based
on a 1959 Mini.

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:35.460
They are front engine,
transverse, front-wheel drive

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.510
cars, for the most part.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:39.310
They have MacPherson strut
suspensions, which in my

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:41.910
opinion define the
weight of a car.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:47.080
And to me, the most efficient,
non-hybrid, gasoline-burning

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:50.550
car to-date is the 1992 General
Motors Ultralight,

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:53.710
with a carbon fiber chassis,
designed and built by the

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:56.530
winner of the first X
Prize, [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:00.270
It was a car built, cost no
object, and it was a car built

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:03.470
at the direction of General
Motors management, that was

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:06.870
supposed to get 100
miles per gallon.

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:07.690
It did not.

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:11.390
It got 88 miles per gallon
on the highway cycle.

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:13.610
The reason is, this
architecture

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:16.100
defines a glass ceiling.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:19.010
You can improve direct injection
a little more, you

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:21.750
can do this a little more,
this a little more.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.790
You're not going to
break the numbers.

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:28.806
As opposed to this, you take our
very simple car, 129 miles

00:12:28.806 --> 00:12:31.950
per gallon in the same test,
with a steel frame, a new

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:34.640
system, and much lower
cost, because it's

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.390
architecturally different.

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:40.000
Industry hasn't lost the thought
that maybe they have

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.740
to change something.

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:47.100
These are some examples
of some tasters.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.360
I think the industry is trying
to find out what

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.360
else they can sell.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:54.080
I think the industry is
petrified, and they are

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.530
starting to try some things.

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:58.050
Volkswagen is, I
think, the most

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:01.770
forward-pushing, visible company.

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:04.620
I have a feeling that inside
Toyota, there is every bit as

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.330
much going on.

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:11.460
This Toyota that I photographed
in Geneva had a

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:17.280
very thin-walled steel chassis
tubing frame filled with foam.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.070
It had a center spine.

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:21.500
Those are all things that
we have thought about,

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.920
made a lot of sense.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:26.940
These guys have been around
the block on this, and

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.470
they're very good.

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:30.860
I don't know about the
rest of the industry.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.620
I think there are some
big macro trends

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:36.590
that we'll also push.

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:41.080
One is transportation
electrification is going to

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:44.280
probably be driven most by the
fact that electric cars are

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.340
essentially coal burners.

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:49.980
And the green population doesn't
want to hear it, but

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.185
that's the truth, and eventually
hopefully they are

00:13:52.185 --> 00:13:53.600
all solar powered.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.020
But in the interim, they're
burning coal.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:58.080
And coal is the cheapest BTU
on the planet, so they

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.180
actually have a cost advantage,
if you can reduce

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.750
the battery cost.

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:06.240
Congested cities are going
to drive some things.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.330
I think your driverless cars
are in part about it.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.470
And shared ownerships,
I think, are

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:15.570
going to only increase.

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:19.670
A big issue, in my opinion,
is job scarcity.

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:22.520
Requirements for local content
will increase.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:26.260
Balance of trade, local content
requirement, these are

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:27.090
huge issues.

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:28.840
This is what has
killed Greece.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:33.470
This is what is killing Spain,
Portugal, possibly France,

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:35.910
Belgium, and Italy.

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:38.240
The world cannot keep going
the shifting balance of

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:41.350
trades, and automobile
manufacturer is the single

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:44.470
biggest violator, besides oil.

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:47.240
If the United States just
fixed this automobile

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.810
importing problem and its fuel
importing problem, we would

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:53.060
have no balance of trade
issues whatsoever.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.020
And Greece essentially had
no car manufacturing.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:59.080
And that, in many ways, was the
root problem of why Greece

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.490
is where it is.

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:02.070
This is a problem that's
not going away.

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:04.790
And the way you solve it is you
start to make cars in your

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:08.010
more localized environments,
or parts for it.

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:10.360
And then, I think, there's a
huge opportunity, as I travel

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.045
around the world all the time.

00:15:12.045 --> 00:15:15.280
There are all these low-cost bad
cars that are made by the

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:19.010
millions, that pollute like
crazy, that cost very little,

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:20.920
that are 1950s technology.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:24.860
And our large companies have
no answers to compete with

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:26.260
these cars.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.070
But these cars really should
be displaced by a

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:30.740
more elegant product.

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:36.950
And in our company, one of the
principles that we pursued, we

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:40.510
pursued all the X Prize
requirements, but we added one

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:41.220
requirement.

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:44.160
We said, listen, if we're going
to fail, we want to have

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.980
something that's worth
something.

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.730
So we said, we want
to design the

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:49.950
Volkswagen of the 21st century.

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:51.200
The car must be low-cost.

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:59.350
So here is we're going, and
I'll explain to you why

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:02.200
Edison2 is a completely
different company than any

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.760
other company.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:09.450
It begins with a different
architectural approach.

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:13.580
The Very Light Car has
self-contained suspension

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.230
systems inside the
wheel itself.

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:18.960
This is important because the
real estate in the wheel is

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.390
not normally used in a car.

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:25.010
And by putting the suspension
inside the wheel, we drive it

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:29.450
down to a single connection
point, which then feeds four

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:32.140
main connection points
for the chassis.

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:36.030
Four connection points in
the chassis is much less

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:38.750
complicated than the 16
or 20 you would find

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.600
in a typical car.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:46.550
And when you have these fewer
points, the geometry of the

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:49.450
chassis becomes easier, the
material content of the

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:51.430
chassis becomes easier,
therefore the

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:53.160
chassis becomes lighter.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.210
And the whole thing is
a virtuous circle.

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:57.700
If the chassis is lighter, my
brakes are smaller, my engine

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.150
is smaller, my transmission
is smaller, and it goes

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:03.490
on and on and on.

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:08.790
This suspension is a product
that we believe has a lot of

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:11.940
value, and we're actually going
to launch a new company

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:14.359
that will only promote
the suspension.

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:18.950
Which, in our opinion, can take
about 200 pounds off any

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:21.910
existing car simply by
redirecting its chassis

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:25.660
requirements, and add a flat
floor, which gives you an

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:29.150
aerodynamic benefit and gives
you additional space under the

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:30.900
hood and in the trunk.

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:33.640
And additional space in a car is
at a premium today, because

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.180
cars are becoming
so complicated.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:38.080
So we have high hopes for this
company, which should launch

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:42.130
in Quarter 2 , 2013.

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:47.730
But the other, we're still
dreaming to go to a car.

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:54.270
The other issue is, a light
car, to be safe.

00:17:56.870 --> 00:18:01.750
A light car always loses the
battle of momentum in a crash.

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:04.760
And it's unacceptable that you
have a car in which you die in

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.510
an accident.

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:11.160
From motor sports, we know a lot
about high impact crashes,

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.950
and essentially, it's also a
change in architecture, it's a

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:16.040
change in approach.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:19.050
We embrace the idea
of deflection.

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:22.780
In a normal car, you absorb
a crash, and you

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:24.920
engage the other car.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.900
In our situation, we prefer
to jettison parts

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.200
and deflect the crash.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:33.260
And this is really, brutally,
driven home in an actual crash

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:39.180
test following the IIHS 40%
Offset Crash Protocol in which

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.630
we recorded 21 g's.

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:44.590
To put it in perspective, this
is a crash I'm willing to sit

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:49.580
in the car with the seat belt,
not even an air bag.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:54.850
21 g's is probably the lowest
ever recorded data for this.

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:58.920
Maybe a Plymouth Prowler,
because the Plymouth Prowler,

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.340
by accident, does
the same thing.

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:05.140
This comes out motor sports.

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:08.070
We all know about high-impact
crashes.

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:11.995
And the other part that we use
is, we substitute space for

00:19:11.995 --> 00:19:13.440
our lack of mass.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.870
If you look at this top view,
you see the flat places that

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:19.230
connect our wheels
with the body.

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:22.180
Those are purely structure,
there's no suspension in

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.320
there, because the suspension
is in the wheel.

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.800
So this structure is
designed to absorb.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:32.030
So in a side-impact, in any
number of impacts, you have a

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:34.920
lot more absorptions space,
which you need to take care of

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.980
the added accelerations which
you have to face.

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:45.550
The third thing is that
we are all about cost.

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:50.180
And cost to me is what drives
it home in the end.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:53.130
And here's just a simple
explanation.

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:57.140
I like station wagons, and
station wagons became

00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:00.400
minivans, they became SUV's,
and I would argue they're

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.890
going to go back to being
station wagons.

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:05.920
And if you follow our
prescription, and you just

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.400
want a gas-burning station
wagon, 60 miles per gallon is

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.180
no problem whatsoever.

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:12.680
And essentially, over the
life of a car, you end

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.230
up with a free car.

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:17.510
And when you get the numbers so
different that you end up

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:21.880
with a free car, the customer
base exists, even if some

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.290
people look at it and raise
their eyebrows initially,

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:26.850
because money does talk.

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:29.960
And it gets really extreme when
you build an electric car

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:33.270
with a range extending engine.

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:38.290
The lowest energy cost of
operating car out there is

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:42.810
likely a Toyota Prius, which
can do this drive cycle for

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:45.380
about $15,000 in the US.

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:49.060
And we can do the same
drive cycle for 5500.

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:52.170
Same service, four
people my size.

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:55.245
So it shows you how brutal
the numbers get.

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:05.320
The architectural implications
are, we're all about cost, and

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:11.930
cost is about extreme parts
count production and reduction

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:13.415
in material.

00:21:13.415 --> 00:21:16.020
I'll first talk about
material.

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:20.350
The average car in America
costs $6 a pound.

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:22.790
If you build a car out of
conventional materials, you

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:24.810
can keep those numbers.

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:28.140
An expensive car, let's say an
Audi with an aluminum chassis

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.820
might cost $20 a pound.

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.500
When you bring the car down
to 1,300 pounds with full

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:36.100
content, it stands to reason
that it's going

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.920
to cost less money.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.140
How do we do it?

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.070
Parts count reduction.

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:45.720
We basically put most of the
complicated parts into a few

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.970
castings that are strategically
located, and

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:51.750
everything else is connections,
either deflecting

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:55.590
and absorbing, or, we don't let
anybody in because we're

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:57.100
going to keep your life.

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:59.340
Those are the two structures.

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:02.990
And if you insist that you want
to have a car that's a

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:06.530
box, you can use our
architecture, get the benefit

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:09.250
of the lightweight, and make
it look like a box.

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:10.990
Personally I don't like boxes.

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:14.750
I can see tremendous potential
for our designs.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:17.950
You have additional wing areas,
I mean, they will

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:22.630
become high-performance cars
of unbelievable dimensions,

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:24.060
and it's just a lot of fun.

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:30.420
I also believe that the
extensive use of plastics is

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:33.980
essential, because you can fully
recycle the plastics,

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:37.160
and, once again, with molded
plastics, you can create

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.660
further parts count and
cost reduction.

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:42.370
Because a molded part
can take many, many

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:44.740
functions into one part.

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:47.480
And one thing that's interesting
here, this is one

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:50.580
of our development chassis, if
you look at it, that's a full

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.290
drive-line equipped chassis.

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:54.840
And look at the front bumper
and the rear bumper and you

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.950
see all this empty space.

00:22:56.950 --> 00:23:00.750
What happens is, by making the
car so light, the drive line

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:03.580
becomes so small, the
car becomes entirely

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.460
space for the user.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.250
These cars have big trunks,
even though

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:08.520
they don't look it.

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:13.490
They're actually big inside,
they can fit big people, but

00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:15.130
they give you the space
where you need.

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:16.940
They don't give you the space
where you don't need it.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:19.810
In a normal car, a third of your
car is just your engine

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:22.640
compartment, it gives you
no other service.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.620
So it's interesting to note.

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:27.860
And ultimately, I can see a
scenario where you end up with

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:32.620
a plastic car with less than
30 parts, with less than 30

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:36.420
castings, and a few
other components.

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:38.720
And now you're in a whole
other dimension.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.050
It's really a new product.

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.720
Our goal is to go to a new
distribution model.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:49.000
The complicated parts will
be made centralized.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.740
They will have some intensive
tooling, will cost some money.

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:55.890
And then, depending on where
the cars are made, they get

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:57.790
assembled more locally.

00:23:57.790 --> 00:24:02.220
Essentially like flat packs, a
little bit like Ikea, except

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.200
the assembler is
a professional.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.830
And that way, you can end up
with a car factory in Greece.

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:09.660
Because you're essentially
looking for a large warehouse,

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:10.920
and you ship in some parts.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:15.390
And maybe the engines come from
China, let's take Chery,

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:17.330
for example, or Tata.

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:22.030
Both of them make 600-700
cc 2-cylinder engines.

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:25.410
They can be sourced for $1,000,
that's fuel injection

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:26.680
to catalyst.

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:30.540
They're nice aluminum engines,
and they can give you the

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:34.610
service that you get from
Volkswagen, Jetta, TDI.

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:37.870
And so you end up with the
parts coming in, and you

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:40.050
essentially have a large
glorified warehouse in which

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:41.300
you assemble the cars.

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:47.830
Edison2 is essentially
an R&amp;D company.

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:50.340
We're not married to become a
Tesla, we're not married to

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:51.310
being anything.

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:53.430
We are married to being
successful.

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:55.370
We're married to our
product becoming a

00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:59.140
large-volume situation.

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:04.160
At this point, we're raising
a little bit more money.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.420
Edison2 is pretty much done.

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:08.230
We're going to have a suspension
company, which is a

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:09.810
sales company.

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:15.640
And in 2014, we intend to raise
the big money, and go to

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.510
our production of our car.

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:20.260
And by that time, we believe we
will have solved virtually

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:22.420
all the issues.

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:27.110
We have a car that's now maybe
seven weeks away from driving,

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:29.390
that is essentially the
efficiency that you've seen.

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:32.890
You've seen this car, except it
drives like a Toyota Camry.

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:37.090
It has the suspension travel,
it has all the functions of

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:38.500
what people want.

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:43.240
And it's a lot of work, but
we're getting there.

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:48.330
I believe, in looking at this
from an outsider, the big

00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:51.870
problem in the car business is
that it is so money intensive,

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:54.040
and that it has kind
of killed itself.

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:57.420
Essentially the car business has
taken all the margin out.

00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:02.420
And when you have no margin,
there's huge risk aversion and

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:04.010
unwillingness to change.

00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:09.100
And up until a year ago, I was
unwilling to try to become a

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:11.830
car company, and at this
point our group's

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:13.050
moving in that direction.

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:15.700
Whether it becomes that we
become a division of somebody

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:19.670
or own car company remains
to be seen.

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:23.230
But we really think we can
deliver a full leap, and the

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:25.960
main reason we think so is
because we think the large

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:29.070
companies are going to be very,
very challenged, and

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:31.880
moving quickly.

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:34.040
Because there are so many
people, so many layers of

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:39.000
management, and because what
we're doing can so destabilize

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.560
them, because they have
such big investment.

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:46.700
So in this, I actually
see an opportunity.

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:48.620
Essentially, we are a
whole new product.

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:52.660
We're not a car, we're not a
motorcycle, we're a very light

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:55.690
car, but it's architecturally
completely different.

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:59.170
It will cost much different
money to operate.

00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:01.930
And I think it opens a
whole new dimension.

00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:07.160
I mean, here I'm sitting in the
middle of Google's place

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:11.200
and we're surrounded by all
kinds of high-tech companies.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:15.400
I think that in the automobile
business, there will be a

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:22.170
re-scaled parts business,
because the idea of having

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:26.340
engines of 2,000 or 5,000 cc's
moving cars that move one

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:29.860
person is not sustainable, and
makes no sense at all.

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:31.990
The proportions are
just wrong.

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:35.870
And I think that there's
a great opportunity.

00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:38.230
The other thing is, I was a car
dealer, I was a BMW dealer

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:38.810
for awhile.

00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:45.130
And I find it stunning how the
car companies are trying to

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:46.560
have all the business.

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:49.200
And they've really taking the
joy out of owning a car.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.470
They don't let you modify it,
they don't let you in it, they

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:53.260
don't let you understand it.

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:59.250
So in this thought that some
cars are going to want to be

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:03.440
shared-ownership cars, our
intention is to build very

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:07.240
simple cars, very simple base
cars, that are open to

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.560
modification.

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:13.110
So some people may buy them as
a fleet for shared ownership,

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:16.090
while other people may buy them,
and third parties may

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:20.370
make things to upgrade them,
essentially like an Android

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:22.630
platform with apps.

00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:24.460
You customize your computer
all the time.

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:26.510
There's a huge business
around this.

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:28.440
There's not such a big business
around the car,

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:31.040
because the car from the people
who make the car is

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.720
essentially protected.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:36.380
We're going to be open
to changing that.

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:39.770
I mentioned it earlier, there
is just a wrong proportion.

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:43.410
Moving 200-pound people, even
four people at 800 pounds with

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:47.020
4,000 pound boxes just
doesn't make sense.

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:48.090
It's not sustainable.

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:52.750
It's too much material, too much
energy, and want to point

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:53.420
out one example.

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:57.100
A Very Light Car chassis today
weighs less than 100 pounds.

00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:00.822
It's aluminum, part of it's
cast, part of it's stamped.

00:29:00.822 --> 00:29:03.610
It's riveted and
glued together.

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:06.950
That 100 pounds of aluminum
is the same 100 pounds of

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:11.010
aluminum you save by cutting
your engine size in half.

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:16.380
Sitting here at Google, I wonder
about your driverless

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:21.480
cars, and I can see a future
where everybody has a

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:28.250
driverless car, where smaller
cars have small batteries, and

00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:30.110
have relatively short range.

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:35.230
Have some contactless charging
on a highway, and become very

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:37.790
affordable because they're
so simple.

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:43.290
And I can actually see a
driverless small car

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:45.650
obsoleting public transport.

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:49.670
Because you now have individual
mobility, with the

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:51.845
efficiency of public transport,
or better.

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:57.950
And because your Google systems,
you can really pack

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:01.810
them into road systems, and
really solve some of these

00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:05.940
issues that seem almost
unsolvable the big, congested

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:08.050
traffic situations, etc.

00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:11.650
So in a way, it's a very
exciting time, and it's a lot

00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:12.980
of dots that have
be connected.

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:22.260
Here's a bit of a brochure thing
that we're working on.

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:25.200
On the final page, you see a
little bit where we're going.

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:30.020
This will be the first car we
will actually offer, or what

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:31.540
we think we will offer.

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:34.630
And it's a hybrid car, it can
run on two different modes--

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:37.200
on a gasoline mode and
an electric mode.

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:42.520
And you read the data, it's
a pretty peppy car.

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:45.170
Somebody who has a 3 Series BMW
isn't going to be sorry

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:46.530
about switching to this car.

00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:50.850
But it's a stunning
performance/efficiency ratio.

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:55.460
And because of the low parts
count, and the low mass, we

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:59.150
think we can deliver it at
a whole new price value.

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:00.400
Thank you very much.
