you're acting so that what you want to
 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.080
you're acting so that what you want to
have happen will happen and when it

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090
have happen will happen and when it
 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.449
have happen will happen and when it
happens well then you're happy because

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459
happens well then you're happy because
 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.370
happens well then you're happy because
well first of all you get what you want

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380
well first of all you get what you want
 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.759
well first of all you get what you want
and that's good maybe depending on what

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769
and that's good maybe depending on what
 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.800
and that's good maybe depending on what
you want but it's also good because if

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810
you want but it's also good because if
 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.140
you want but it's also good because if
you get what you want when you act then

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150
you get what you want when you act then
 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.000
you get what you want when you act then
it turns out that your model of how to

it turns out that your model of how to
 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.210
it turns out that your model of how to
act is valid right that would come that

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220
act is valid right that would come that
 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.640
act is valid right that would come that
you get what you want indicates no error

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650
you get what you want indicates no error
 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.910
you get what you want indicates no error
on the part of your model but it's very

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920
on the part of your model but it's very
 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.090
on the part of your model but it's very
frequently the case that when you act to

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100
frequently the case that when you act to
 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.310
frequently the case that when you act to
get what you want you don't get what you

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320
get what you want you don't get what you
 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.550
get what you want you don't get what you
want and then that's unpleasant because

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560
want and then that's unpleasant because
 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.250
want and then that's unpleasant because
you don't get what you want but it's

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260
you don't get what you want but it's
 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.020
you don't get what you want but it's
even more unpleasant because it brings

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030
even more unpleasant because it brings
 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.300
even more unpleasant because it brings

the manner in which you're construing

the manner in which you're construing
 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.000
the manner in which you're construing
the world is incorrect at some

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010
the world is incorrect at some
 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.640
the world is incorrect at some
indeterminant level so for example if

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650
indeterminant level so for example if
 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.430
indeterminant level so for example if
you tell a party tell a joke at a party

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440
you tell a party tell a joke at a party
 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.170
you tell a party tell a joke at a party
you presume that people will attend and

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180
you presume that people will attend and
 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.600
you presume that people will attend and
then when they hear the joke they will

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610
then when they hear the joke they will
 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.030
then when they hear the joke they will
laugh and then if you tell the joke and

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040
laugh and then if you tell the joke and
 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.570
laugh and then if you tell the joke and
it goes flat or even worse disgusts and

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580
it goes flat or even worse disgusts and
 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.570
it goes flat or even worse disgusts and
offends people then you're going to be

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580
offends people then you're going to be
 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.580
offends people then you're going to be
taken aback and that's partly because

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590
taken aback and that's partly because
 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.710
taken aback and that's partly because
you didn't get what you want and that's

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720
you didn't get what you want and that's
 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.050
you didn't get what you want and that's
not so good but it's but it's more

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060
not so good but it's but it's more
 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.270
not so good but it's but it's more
because there's something wrong with the

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280
because there's something wrong with the
 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.260
because there's something wrong with the
way you concept
