00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:05.613
I don't make it much of a secret,

00:00:05.613 --> 00:00:08.011
but I get quite frustrated

00:00:08.011 --> 00:00:11.393
when young people we work with

00:00:11.393 --> 00:00:13.221
don't make the most of the opportunities

00:00:13.221 --> 00:00:14.756
that they're provided.

00:00:14.756 --> 00:00:16.485
So, just to give you some context,

00:00:16.485 --> 00:00:18.892
we provide, on our website,

00:00:18.892 --> 00:00:20.421
there's a plethora of opportunities

00:00:20.421 --> 00:00:22.274
from some of the biggest organizations

00:00:22.274 --> 00:00:23.642
in the country,

00:00:23.642 --> 00:00:25.227
and you'll just get sometimes

00:00:25.227 --> 00:00:28.323
a lethargic response from young people,

00:00:28.323 --> 00:00:29.695
and I'm just like,

00:00:29.695 --> 00:00:32.768
"God, like, do you know how amazing this is

00:00:32.768 --> 00:00:35.045
to just have it served to you on a plate,

00:00:35.045 --> 00:00:37.537
and you're kind of like, hmmmm?"

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:39.561
That frustrates me quite a lot,

00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:41.133
and I have to,

00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:45.070
I have to kind of keep that undercover.
