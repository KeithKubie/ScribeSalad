00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.890
hey guys I'm really excited because I
just want to refill my liquid nitrogen

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.490
do and this time i ordered 30 liters but
they filled it up to the top

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.909
that means i got five liters for free
let's go put it to good use

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:14.999
today is the day where we answer the
question what does liquid nitrogen do

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:17.339
inside of a 6-foot water balloon

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.880
let's go find find out

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.080
oh man that's a lot heavier
than it was last time

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.270
now you might be wondering how dangerous
is liquid nitrogen and honestly it is

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.480
really really dangerous but not if you
respect the boundaries and work very

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.200
very quickly

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.640
got my wife here to help me

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.309
what do you think about all these crazy
experiments they want to know

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:40.660
they're always too much

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.480
it's boiled down a little bit so we're
just going to top it up so we get as

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.900
much liquid nitrogen in there as
possible and then I think it's time to

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.900
load it up

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.190
all right now this is where it gets real

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.000
I've already put a zip tie around the
neck here on the ideas stretch this over

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.329
the thermos turn this upside down and
dump everything in there and then tie it

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:02.140
off

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.269
we'll see if we can make that work

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.320
ohh, that's already getting crispy and can
see starting to blow up that's cool

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.020
zip tie just came off, that's not good. and that
neck is completely frozen

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.350
oh well, I'll have to warm that up I can't get
it off now, that things completely frozen

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.950
taking the gloves off

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.570
check it out, the bottom of this balloon

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.490
it's like a turtle shell, oh there it
goes there it goes. look how hard this is

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.460
almost like a helmet

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.280
luckily I brought backup ok so we
figured the reason I didn't work last

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.060
time has all the nitrogen froze the
rubber before we had a chance to tie off

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.760
so this time we're going to try some
kind of an insulating barrier we've got

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.430
water bottles styrofoam liners finals

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.430
maybe even a paper cup they were just
stick down the neck I'm gonna have my

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.820
wife try pouring into the balloon
present rather the whole thing upside

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.650
down we'll see if that makes a
difference

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.180
check out how big the neck of this
balloon is i think it's massive

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.250
so we should be able to stick this paper
in there no problem

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.250
that's actually a perfect fit

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.060
ok got all in there but the neck is
pretty well frozen off I think we might be in business

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.500
self-inflating balloons

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.500
now at this point the balloon is getting big enough i don't

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.140
really want to play with the too much in
case I pop it accidentally

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.410
I'm just going to let the nitrogen keep
expanding on its own until it runs out a liquid

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.840
let's just see how big it gets

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.300
look we sprung a leak

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.450
it's still expanding and it's still
blowing up but nitrogen is leaking out

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.040
faster we can contain it

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.320
is that a hole, right there, or is it just gas?

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.320
Oh my goodness

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.580
ok so update we're on Balloon number three
and these things aren't cheap, these are thirty

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.540
dollars each

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.870
we got a little duct tape so that the
zip tie doesn't rip into the rubber I

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.870
think that may have been one of the
problems we had from last time

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.650
till now I don't know that's a good
thing well and this is the neck again

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.750
okay we'll get this thing walmed up and tie it on

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.750
alright guys I think we're in business
we were this far and that's the hardest

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.750
part I think you look at the grass down
here

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:39.570
Crispy

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.740
Did that go in your face?

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.180
no, it was just rubber just hitting me in the eye

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.379
check that out though that is awesome
ok guys remember safety is important

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:57.489
and for some reason I wasn't wearing my
glasses and my eye definitely felt it

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.819
that rubber smack me right in the eye
ball and that hurt a lot

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.730
all right so here's the difference this
time we got duct tape around here

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.019
instead of the zip tie

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.500
we do have a zip tie under there but
it's like protected by duct tape so

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.049
there shouldn't be any sharp edges to
make this thing go off

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:14.379
now we're gonna get this off the grass
and go put on the trampoline because

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:17.169
there's a lot less chance the trampoline
is going to accidentally puncture it

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.169
like the grass did

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.680
ok guys this time glasses on for safety

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:43.430
Wow

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.760
I literally felt a concussion hit my
chest broom just like that, it was awesome

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.349
there you have it guys, it only took a
hundred dollars worth of liquid nitrogen

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:12.129
and a hundred and twenty dollars worth
of these 6-foot water balloons but we

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:15.280
got there in the end, we can now answer
the question what does liquid nitrogen

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.110
do to a 6-foot water balloon

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.449
thanks for joining me for this
experiment i'll be looking for you guys

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:22.810
in the next video I'll see you there

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.720
hey guys I just had to give credit where
credit's due big thanks to my friends

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.990
who came out last minute help me film
this today I'm Mark Wilson on the drone

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.639
pilot with skycams media

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:33.550
we're tom and Robin film's and we make
high-quality videos of awesome people

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.099
taking all their stuff with their links
in the description will see you next

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:36.959
time
