00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.630
So our goal in this video is
to take the antiderivative

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.860
of this fairly crazy
looking expression.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.840
Or another way of saying it is
to find the indefinite integral

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.990
of this crazy
looking expression.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.040
And the key realization
right over here

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.650
is that this expression is
made up of a bunch of terms.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.850
And the indefinite integral
of the entire expression

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.980
is going to be equal to the
indefinite integral of each

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.190
of the term.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.920
So this is going to be equal
to, we could look at this term

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.610
right over here, and just
take the indefinite that,

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.410
7x to the third dx.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.920
And then from that,
we can subtract

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.816
the indefinite
integral of this thing.

00:00:42.816 --> 00:00:44.190
So we could say
this is, and then

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.780
minus the indefinite integral
of 5 times the square root

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.180
of x dx.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.570
And then we can look at
this one right over here.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.790
So then we could say plus
the indefinite integral

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.670
of 18 square root of x.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.379
Square roots of x,
over x to the third dx.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.700
And then finally, I'm
running out of colors here,

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.810
finally I need more
colors in my thing.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.960
We can take the
antiderivative of this.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.850
So plus the antiderivative of x
to the negative 40th power dx.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.997
So I've just rewritten this
and color-coded things.

00:01:20.997 --> 00:01:23.080
So let's take the
antiderivative of each of these.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.714
And you'll see that we'll
be able to do it using our

00:01:25.714 --> 00:01:26.880
whatever we want to call it.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.530
The inverse of the power
rule, or the anti-power rule,

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.480
whatever you might
want to call it.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.080
So let's look at the first one.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.100
So we have-- what
I'm going to do

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.220
is, I'm just going to
find the antiderivative

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.410
without the constant, and just
add the constant at the end.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.451
For the sake of this one.

00:01:41.451 --> 00:01:44.570
Just to make sure we get the
most general antiderivative.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.660
So here the exponent is a 3.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.280
So we can increase it by 1.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.450
So it's going to
be x to the 4th.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.145
Let me do that same purple
color, or pink color.

00:01:53.145 --> 00:01:54.770
It's going to be x
to the 4th, or we're

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.040
going to divide by x to the 4th.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.440
So it's x to the 4th over 4
is the antiderivative of x

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.240
to the 3rd.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.180
And you just had this scaling
quantity, the seven out front.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.140
So we can still just
have the seven out front.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.610
So we get 7x to the 4th over 4.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.810
Fair enough.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.520
From that, we're
going to subtract

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.040
the antiderivative of this.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.870
Now at first this
might not be obvious,

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.260
that you could use our
inverse power rule,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.945
or anti-power rule here.

00:02:18.945 --> 00:02:20.320
But then you just
need to realize

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.340
that 5 times the
principal root of x

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:30.980
is the same thing as 5
times x to the 1/2 power.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.000
And so once again, the
exponent here is 1/2.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.760
We can increment it by 1.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.100
So it's going to
be x to the 3/2.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.330
And then divide by the
incremented exponent.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.120
So divide by 3/2.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.130
And of course we had
this 5 out front,

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.130
so we still want to
have the 5 out front.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.410
Now this next expression
looks even wackier.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.810
But once again, we can
simplify a little bit.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.900
This is the same thing-- let
me do it right over here--

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.580
this is the same thing as
18 times x to the 1/2 times

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.160
x to the negative 3 power.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.480
x to the 3rd in the
denominator is the same thing

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.099
as x to the negative 3.

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.390
We have the same base, we
could just add the exponents.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.890
So this is going to be equal
to 18 times x to the 2 and 1/2

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.980
power.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.490
Or another way of
thinking about it,

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:29.660
this is the same thing as
18 times x to the 5/2 power.

00:03:33.197 --> 00:03:34.030
Did I do that right?

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.530
Yeah.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:35.760
Negative 3.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.494
Oh sorry, this is
negative 2 and 1/2.

00:03:37.494 --> 00:03:38.660
Let me make this very clear.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.150
And this is going to be
the negative 5/2 power.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.290
x to the negative 3 is the same
thing as x to the negative 6/2.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.800
Negative 6/2 plus
1/2 is negative 5/2.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.560
So once again, we just have
to increment this exponent.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.160
So negative 5/2 plus 1 is
going to be negative 3/2.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.600
So you're going to have
x to the negative 3/2.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.799
And then you divide
by what your exponent

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:08.840
is when you increment it.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.010
So divide it by negative 3/2.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.780
And then you had
the 18 out front.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.720
And we obviously are going
to have to simplify this.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.180
And then finally, our
exponent in this term.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.530
Let me not use that
purple anymore.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.970
The exponent in this term
right over here is negative 40.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.380
If we increment it, we get
x to the negative 39 power,

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.480
all of that over negative 39.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.680
And now we can add
our constant, c.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.410
And all we need to do is
simplify all of this craziness.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.730
So the first one is
fairly simplified.

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.440
We can write it as
7/4 x to the 4th.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.550
Now this term right over
here is essentially negative

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.830
5 divided by 3/2.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:01.620
So 5 over 3/2 is
equal to 5 times 2/3,

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.130
which is equal to 10 over 3.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:10.060
So this thing right over here
simplifies to negative 10/3 x

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.860
to the 3/2.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.770
And then we have all
of this craziness.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.960
Now 18 divided by
negative 3/2 is

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.610
equal to 18 times negative 2/3.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.340
Which is equal to, well we can
simplify this a little bit,

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:35.000
this is the same thing
as 6 times negative 2.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.820
Which is equal to negative 12.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.280
So this expression
right over here

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.430
is negative 12x to
the negative 3/2.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.760
And then finally, this
one right over here,

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.210
we can just rewrite it
as, if we want, we could,

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.250
well, we could just
write negative 1/39 x

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:57.350
to the negative 39 plus c.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.100
And we're done.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.420
We've found the indefinite
integral of all this craziness.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.735
And I encourage you to take
the derivative of this.

00:06:03.735 --> 00:06:05.860
And you can do it using
really just the power rule,

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.220
to take the derivative of this.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.370
And verify that it does
indeed equal this expression

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.410
that we took the
antiderivative of.
