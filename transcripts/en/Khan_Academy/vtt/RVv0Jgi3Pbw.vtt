00:00:00.202 --> 00:00:01.862
- [Voiceoer] This is from the graph basic

00:00:01.862 --> 00:00:04.102
exponential functions on Khan Academy.

00:00:04.102 --> 00:00:07.283
They asked us graph the
following exponential function.

00:00:07.283 --> 00:00:08.444
And they give us the function,

00:00:08.444 --> 00:00:12.043
h of x is equal to 27 times 1/3 to the x.

00:00:12.043 --> 00:00:15.227
So our initial value is 27
and 1/3 is our common ratio.

00:00:15.227 --> 00:00:18.299
It's written in a
standard exponential form.

00:00:18.299 --> 00:00:19.727
And it gives us some graphing tool

00:00:19.727 --> 00:00:22.664
where we can define these two points

00:00:22.664 --> 00:00:26.270
and we can also define

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.400
a horizontal asymptote

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.025
to construct our function.

00:00:30.025 --> 00:00:32.703
And these three things
are enough to define

00:00:32.703 --> 00:00:35.245
to graph an exponential if we know

00:00:35.245 --> 00:00:37.184
that it is an exponential function.

00:00:37.184 --> 00:00:38.739
So let's think about it a little bit.

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.166
So the easiest thing
that I could think of is,

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.930
well, let's think about its initial value.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.292
Its initial value is going
to be x equal to zero.

00:00:46.292 --> 00:00:49.775
X equal zeros, 1/3 to the
zero power is just one

00:00:49.775 --> 00:00:52.886
and so you're just left with
27 times one or just 27.

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:54.151
That's what we call this number here

00:00:54.151 --> 00:00:55.776
when you've written in this form.

00:00:55.776 --> 00:00:57.477
You call this the initial value.

00:00:57.477 --> 00:00:59.451
So when x is equal to zero,

00:00:59.451 --> 00:01:02.156
h of x is equal to 27.

00:01:02.156 --> 00:01:05.186
Now we're graphing y=h(x).

00:01:05.186 --> 00:01:06.915
So now let's graph another point.

00:01:06.915 --> 00:01:08.494
So let's think about it a little bit.

00:01:08.494 --> 00:01:12.430
When x is equal to one,

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.413
when x is equal to one, what is h of x?

00:01:15.413 --> 00:01:17.012
It's gonna be 1/3 to the first power

00:01:17.012 --> 00:01:18.347
which is just 1/3.

00:01:18.347 --> 00:01:20.692
And so 1/3 times 27 is gonna be nine.

00:01:20.692 --> 00:01:25.692
So when x is one, h of one is nine.

00:01:25.928 --> 00:01:28.040
And we can verify.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.763
And now let's just think about,

00:01:29.763 --> 00:01:31.713
let's think about the asymptote.

00:01:31.713 --> 00:01:34.360
So what's gonna happen here when x becomes

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.018
really, really, really, really,
really, really, really big?

00:01:37.018 --> 00:01:41.383
If I take 1/3 to like a
really large exponent to,

00:01:41.383 --> 00:01:44.637
say to the 10th power
or to the 100th power

00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:47.674
or to the 1000th power, this
thing right over here is

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:50.715
going to start approaching
zero as x becomes

00:01:50.715 --> 00:01:52.387
much, much, much, much larger.

00:01:52.387 --> 00:01:55.754
And so something that is
approaching zero times 27,

00:01:55.754 --> 00:01:57.785
well, that's going to
approach zero as well.

00:01:57.785 --> 00:02:00.664
So we're gonna have a
horizontal asymptote at zero.

00:02:00.664 --> 00:02:02.348
And you can verify that this works

00:02:02.348 --> 00:02:04.646
for more than just a two
points we talk about.

00:02:04.646 --> 00:02:07.572
When x is equal to, this is
telling us that the graph,

00:02:07.572 --> 00:02:11.263
y equals h of x goes to
the point two comma three.

00:02:11.263 --> 00:02:13.864
So h of two should be equal to three.

00:02:13.864 --> 00:02:16.429
And you can verify that
that is indeed the case.

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:19.331
If x is two, 1/3 squared is nine.

00:02:19.331 --> 00:02:21.526
Oh sorry, 1/3 squared is 1/9

00:02:21.526 --> 00:02:24.184
times 27 is three.

00:02:24.184 --> 00:02:25.406
And we see that right over here.

00:02:25.406 --> 00:02:28.843
When x is two, h of two is three.

00:02:28.843 --> 00:02:30.886
So I feel pretty good about that.

00:02:30.886 --> 00:02:32.627
Let's do another one of this.

00:02:32.627 --> 00:02:35.367
So graph the following
exponential function.

00:02:35.367 --> 00:02:36.888
So same logic.

00:02:36.888 --> 00:02:41.739
When x is zero, the g
of zero is just gonna

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.702
boiled out to that initial value.

00:02:43.702 --> 00:02:45.188
And so you scroll down.

00:02:45.188 --> 00:02:48.091
Initial value is negative 30.

00:02:48.091 --> 00:02:50.924
And so let's think about
when x is equal to one.

00:02:50.924 --> 00:02:53.981
When x is equal to one, two to
the first power is just two.

00:02:53.981 --> 00:02:56.888
And so two times negative
30 is negative 60.

00:02:56.888 --> 00:03:01.888
So when x is equal to one,

00:03:02.041 --> 00:03:05.656
the value of the graph is negative 60.

00:03:05.656 --> 00:03:09.011
Now let's think about this asymptote

00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:10.834
over that, it should sit.

00:03:10.834 --> 00:03:13.008
So let's think about what
happens when x becomes

00:03:13.008 --> 00:03:16.177
really, really, really, really,
really, really negative.

00:03:16.177 --> 00:03:18.720
So when x is really negative,

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.645
so two to the negative one power is 1/2.

00:03:21.645 --> 00:03:23.224
Two to the negative two is 1/4.

00:03:23.224 --> 00:03:24.814
Two to the negative three is 1/8.

00:03:24.814 --> 00:03:26.957
As it gets larger and larger negative

00:03:26.957 --> 00:03:29.012
or higher magnitude negative values

00:03:29.012 --> 00:03:30.308
or in other words, as x becomes

00:03:30.308 --> 00:03:32.572
more and more and more negative,

00:03:32.572 --> 00:03:35.439
two to that power is
going to approach zero.

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:38.156
And so negative 30 times
something approaching zero

00:03:38.156 --> 00:03:39.676
is going to approach zero.

00:03:39.676 --> 00:03:41.441
So this asymptote is in the right place,

00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:45.783
a horizontal asymptote as x
approaches negative infinity.

00:03:45.783 --> 00:03:47.594
As we move further and
further to the left,

00:03:47.594 --> 00:03:50.624
the value of a function
is going to approach zero.

00:03:50.624 --> 00:03:54.083
Now we can see it kind of
approaches zero from below.

00:03:54.083 --> 00:03:55.755
We can see they approaches below

00:03:55.755 --> 00:03:57.740
because we already looked
at the initial value

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.758
and we used that common ratio
to find one other point.

00:04:00.758 --> 00:04:03.860
Hopefully, you found that interesting.
