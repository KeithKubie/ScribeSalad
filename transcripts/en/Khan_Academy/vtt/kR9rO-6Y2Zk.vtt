00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.690
- [Instructor] So let
me just write a general

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:03.500
two-by-two matrix A.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.500
So let's just say its
elements are a, b, c, and d.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.900
Now, from previous videos, we have learned

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.080
how to find the inverse of our matrix A,

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.410
the formula that we went over.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.060
The inverse of our matrix
A is going to be equal to

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.370
one over the determinant of our matrix A

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.490
times what is often called
the adjoint of our matrix A.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.630
And that's you are
swapping the a and the d.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.050
So you have a d here and an a here.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.620
You're making the b and the c negative.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.000
And this works for a
two-by-two when you do a,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.510
when you go to a three-by-three case,

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.480
it gets a little bit more complicated.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.270
So we're gonna have a negative b here

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.190
and a negative c here.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.990
Or another way to think about it,

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.890
the determinant of a two-by-two matrix

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.779
is going to be one over ad minus bc,

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:58.160
ad minus bc,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.650
and then you multiply
that times the adjoint.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.610
So that is fancy word,

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.660
that's a fancy word for it.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.310
So we have d, negative
b, negative c, and a.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.890
So that is all review.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.490
If it's not, I encourage you to review it

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.810
in other places on Khan Academy.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.890
But what we're going to ask
ourselves in this video is,

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.320
is there a situation where
a matrix is not invertible?

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.620
So pause this video,

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.860
and see if you can figure out a scenario

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.830
or a general set of scenarios

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.473
where a matrix is not
going to be invertible.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.550
So one way to think about a
matrix that is not invertible

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.140
is that, for that matrix,

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.000
we would somehow not be able
to make this calculation.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.830
Now, no matter what a, b, c, and d are,

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.730
we can always find an adjoint matrix.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.010
But what's a situation where
one over the determinant

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.750
is we're not going to
be able to calculate it?

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.340
Well, a situation where the determinant,

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.230
the determinant of our
matrix A is equal to zero,

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.520
or I could write the
determinant of our matrix A

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.070
is going to be equal to zero.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.480
In that situation, we're not
going to be able to calculate

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.020
one over the determinant
because that is undefined.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.590
And so we say,

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.140
we say A

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.300
is not invertible,

00:02:16.497 --> 00:02:17.913
invertible,

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.310
if and only if, I'll do this
two-way arrow right over here,

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.140
our determinant for our
matrix A is equal to zero.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.090
Because if our determinant
is equal to zero,

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.620
we're going to have to divide by zero

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.460
when we find the inverse.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.410
Now, let's explore what that

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.120
would look like a little bit more.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.990
If our determinant is
going to be equal to zero,

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.030
that means that this
expression right over here

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.770
is going to be equal to zero.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.230
So that means that ad
minus bc is equal to zero.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.030
We can add bc to both sides.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.950
That means that a times
d is equal to b times c.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.870
And then we can algebraically manipulate

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.870
this a little bit more if we
divided both sides by b and d.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.560
So let me just do that.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.450
If I divide both sides by b and d,

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.880
then the d's cancel out here,
and the b's cancel out here.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.830
So this could be a over b

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.790
is equal to c over d.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.320
So we have a situation where the,

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.800
you could think of it as
the ratio between a and b

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.350
is equivalent to the
ratio between c and d.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.150
You could also think
about it the other way.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.240
You could divide,

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.233
let's start with that original
equation, ad is equal to bc.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.600
If you divided both sides by

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.380
c and d,

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.600
so you divide both sides by cd,

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.910
what you're going to be
left with is that a over c

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.050
is going to be equal to b over d.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.700
And so the ratio between a and c

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.760
is equal to the ratio between b and d.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.540
So all of those situations,

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.710
you're going to have
a noninvertible matrix

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.650
because the determinant is
going to be equal to zero.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.190
And so let's look at a few examples.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.100
I want you to tell me whether
the following matrices

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.693
are invertible or not.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.860
So let's say I have the matrix five, one,

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.730
three, two.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.430
Is this an invertible matrix?

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.593
Pause this video, and
try to figure it out.

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.270
So the determinant of this matrix is going

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.030
to be equal to five times two, 10,

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.370
minus three times one,

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.370
minus three, which is equal to seven.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.700
And since this is not equal to zero,

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.060
we know that this matrix is invertible.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.240
We can find an inverse.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.700
Now, what about this matrix?

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.670
So 10, 20,

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.900
and 250 and 500,

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.620
is this matrix invertible?

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.390
The determinant here,

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.121
of 10, 20,

00:04:56.121 --> 00:04:59.220
250, and 500,

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.220
this is going to be equal to
10 times 500, which is 5,000,

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.240
minus 20 times 250, which is
5,000, which is equal to zero.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.270
And once again, if you
wanted to find its inverse,

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.300
you would take your adjoint matrix

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.400
and multiply it times
one over the determinant.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.600
But one over zero is not defined,
so this is not invertible.
