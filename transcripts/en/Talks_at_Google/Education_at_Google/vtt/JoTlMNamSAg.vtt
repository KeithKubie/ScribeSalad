00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:09.390
DAVID BARRY: Today
at Google we're

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.390
delighted to welcome
Rebecca Kantar.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.510
Rebecca is the
founder of Imbellus,

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.210
which is a company that
is reinventing the way we

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.380
think about human potential.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.330
Rebecca attended
Harvard College,

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.890
but dropped out at 19
to pursue her career,

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.385
and has been especially
passionate about thinking

00:00:30.385 --> 00:00:32.870
about education in
the US and how it

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.870
pertains to the future of work.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.240
So without any
further ado, we're

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.600
very excited to have Rebecca.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.686
She's working on huge
projects at such a young age,

00:00:42.686 --> 00:00:44.060
and we are delighted
to have her.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.848
So please join me in welcoming
to Google Rebecca Kantar.

00:00:46.848 --> 00:00:47.931
REBECCA KANTAR: Thank you.

00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:49.924
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:51.340
DAVID BARRY: Thank
you for coming.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.110
REBECCA KANTAR: Thanks.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.360
DAVID BARRY: So I'd love it
if you could start by just

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.630
telling us about Imbellus.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.200
Start with a high level.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.820
REBECCA KANTAR: So
at a high level,

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.710
I have been on the
quest to figure out

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.160
how we can move beyond
measuring how humans think

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.484
based on multiple choice tests.

00:01:05.484 --> 00:01:07.940
So if you think about
the education system,

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.370
change has always flowed
from the top down.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.160
Our colleges set standards
that become college admissions

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.682
standards.

00:01:13.682 --> 00:01:15.140
Many of you are
familiar with tests

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.650
like the SAT, the ACT, the SAT
subject tests, the AP test.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.660
There's a huge litany
of these exams,

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.420
and they're only able
to look at our ability

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.670
to answer really
set questions that

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.620
have very clear
mandates and very

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.500
clear answers, and both the
right and wrong answers.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.750
So when you think about that
as kind of a constraining

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.660
medium for how you can get at
people's processing, how they

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.970
develop ideas, how
they make decisions,

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.420
it's a really limiting factor.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.590
Imbellus is working on building
a new age of assessments that

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.390
are able to look
at how you think,

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.680
instead of just what you know.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.890
So moving beyond multiple
choice and rote memorization,

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.530
content based
understanding of assessment

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.600
towards an era of can we observe
every piece of your cognition,

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.290
every step in your processing,
not just that end choice.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.970
DAVID BARRY: Gotcha.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.220
And so what was it
that made you decide

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.260
to focus on standardized tests.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.030
REBECCA KANTAR: So thinking
about the education system,

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.510
if you kind of dive into the
education reform movement,

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.850
there's a lot of
change in K through 7,

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.500
new elementary schools
or middle schools.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.390
There's a lot less
change in high school,

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.390
and it's really where the
rubber meets the road.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.360
If people are orienting their
high schools towards getting

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.700
kids into good colleges,
and those high schools

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.277
don't actually prepare kids
for college admissions tests,

00:02:28.277 --> 00:02:30.110
it makes it very hard
for those high schools

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.130
to be well-regarded long term.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.940
So when you think about how
you impact change, particularly

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.440
at the high school
level, you've got

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.340
to take on high
school curriculum.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.900
And in our country, the current
set up of K through 12 schools

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.210
makes it such that our
state standardized tests

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.070
and then our college
admissions tests

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.230
kind of compound these
problems of inequity

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.500
throughout the system.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.680
So if you're in a poor
district when you start out

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.050
in kindergarten
through fifth grade,

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.170
you continue on to a mediocre
or poor middle school,

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.060
and then a mediocre
or poor high school,

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.070
your chances of getting
into a great college

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.672
are slim to none at that point.

00:03:02.672 --> 00:03:04.130
And I think we have
in this country

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.440
an idea that college
is universally

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.590
something that lifts people
up, that provides mobility.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.300
And in fact, it's not,
and we can kind of

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.925
get into this throughout
our discussion

00:03:12.925 --> 00:03:15.530
as we look through the
data, but there's really

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.980
a difference between going to
a top 20 or a top 100 college

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.380
and going to a
bottom 5,000 college,

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.330
and standardized tests
make all the difference

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.430
in terms of which
levels of access

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.230
students from
different backgrounds

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.930
are able to attain as they
seek college admission.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.780
So thinking about these
tests as a key lever--

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.180
until you fix this kind
of one line of code

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.490
of how we measure
how people think,

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.460
instead of measuring how
much stuff they've learned--

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.970
really important to alleviating
the pressure on high schools

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.970
to teach in a broad
content mastery based way--

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.650
as in, how many
subjects can you take,

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.630
and how well can you do
in all those subjects?

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.850
To instead focus
on how many skills,

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.790
and abilities, and core
concepts can you internalize?

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.720
And how can you use those across
a broad variety of applications

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.690
that are relevant not just to
school, not just to college,

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.340
but to work and to life?

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.140
And I think increasingly
we have kind of

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.570
separated the two-- of
our education system

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.040
and our employment system.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.490
And our aspiration of focusing
on assessments with input

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.770
from both employers
and from colleges

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.279
is to reunite education in
assessment and employment

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.649
systems as kind of one
giant ecosystem that

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:25.260
determines how you start out
in your early adult years.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.250
DAVID BARRY: So how can
Imbellus play a role

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.650
in changing the education?

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.390
REBECCA KANTAR: Sure, so maybe
we can put the slides up here,

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.600
but we have a focus on
simulation based assessments

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.360
that evaluate how people think,
instead of what they know.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.545
And just to make that kind
of tangible for folks,

00:04:40.545 --> 00:04:41.420
say you have an idea.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.430
Since our product
is very visual,

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.810
we have this natural
world ecosystem.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.350
It's a 3D virtual
environment where

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.330
people deal with
scenarios that look

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.880
totally different-- perhaps a
group of animals who are sick

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.210
with a disease, as opposed to
something you do on the job,

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.310
like writing an email
to your product manager.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.190
But underlying that skin,
that's very different.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.990
The structure of
the scenarios we

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.330
ask people to deal
with in our environment

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.150
are really analogous to those
that you face in real work

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.140
or in life.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.580
So our idea is, by understanding
how people make decisions

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.310
in this environment,
how they develop ideas,

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.160
how they process
information, we can translate

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.950
every click, every almost
click, every time stamp

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.040
into inferences that have much
better and more significant

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.630
implications in
the future of work

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.152
and where things are going,
as opposed to just relying

00:05:29.152 --> 00:05:30.860
on what we've done
for the last 100 years

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.810
or so in assessment,
which is saying, hey,

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.400
you've known more
about this subject,

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.710
and therefore critical
thinking must kind of sort of

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.390
be going on behind the scenes.

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.850
We actually see that
critical thinking happening

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.570
in a very raw, unfiltered way
just with different subject

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.520
matter material,
but that difference

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.354
is what we call far
transfer, meaning

00:05:48.354 --> 00:05:50.270
if we see you do it in
this environment that's

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.070
really abstract, the
idea is you should

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.560
be able to apply those skills
across many other different

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.460
environments.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.260
And the benefit to kind of
getting at skills in that way

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.460
is you allow high
schools to maybe,

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.300
if they're based
in Tennessee, focus

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.980
on teaching subject
matter that's

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.590
very different than high schools
that are based in Pasadena

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:07.880
or based in Boston.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.950
So you're able to
move away from just,

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.040
can you plow through
180 days of a textbook?

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.960
And towards project
based learning,

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.270
or application based learning,
or flipped classrooms.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.250
There's a whole variety
of different solutions

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.480
that kind of try and
inculcate deeper skills,

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.320
as opposed to more content,
but to date, none of our tests

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.140
have reflected that
curricular progress as such.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.720
So Imbellus you could think
of as this one line of code

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.600
that, if we can change how
people are tested primarily

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.540
between high school and college,
and college and employment,

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.970
perhaps we can change the
way the high school operating

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.960
system runs.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.350
DAVID BARRY: So let's contrast
that then with the old model.

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.534
So how did standardized
testing become what it is?

00:06:47.534 --> 00:06:49.700
REBECCA KANTAR: So most
people aren't super familiar

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.741
with kind of the history
of standardized testing.

00:06:51.741 --> 00:06:54.920
So just to back up, the SAT,
which many of us know and love

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.320
or know and hate, depending
on your experience--

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.620
the SAT used to be called the
standardized aptitude test,

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.690
and it was actually a
derivative of the IQ

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.950
test, which came about in
the early 1900s, around 1906.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.770
And the IQ test then was
the basis for the Army Alpha

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.390
test used in World War I.

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.750
So we went from measuring mental
retardation with the IQ test

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.680
to measuring soldiers for
fitness in World War I,

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.600
to then the same general
group of psychometricians

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.440
and learning scientists working
on this first instantiation

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.280
of the SAT at the bequest of
some of our elite colleges.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.340
So the elite colleges in the US
at the turn of the 20th century

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.632
had created something
called the committee of 10,

00:07:33.632 --> 00:07:35.090
and the committee
of 10 was focused

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.220
on standardizing high
school curriculum so that,

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:38.636
no matter where
you grew up, you'd

00:07:38.636 --> 00:07:41.420
have a relatively similar path
of preparation for entering

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:45.560
the job market, usually as a
factory assembly line worker,

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.440
or, in some cases, as a
manager, or as a judge,

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.110
or as a doctor, any of the
careers that at that time

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.270
really were served by
the elite colleges that

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.610
were available for a tiny
fraction of the population.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:59.510
So the SAT kind of
originated from that ground

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.180
for the elite colleges
to be able to suss out

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:05.000
who was fit for that
aristocratic lifestyle

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.340
and who was fit to be
an assembly line worker.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:10.640
And from there, throughout
the 1930s and 1950s,

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.430
you had this huge swell, more
and more students wanting

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:16.670
to go to college, more families
expecting it as an attainable

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:18.920
end goal for their children.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.980
And the SAT had
to kind of adapt,

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.570
so the College Board
released the SAT, and then

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:26.399
the SAT subject tests, many of
which are still around today.

00:08:26.399 --> 00:08:28.190
People usually take
two or three if they're

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:29.600
applying to a top college.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.357
And then in the 1950s,
really the major change

00:08:32.357 --> 00:08:34.190
that kind of started
the trickle down effect

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:37.650
that we experienced today
was the ACT and the AP exams.

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:40.490
So the ACT came on
the scene in 1959

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:42.710
with a promise of
measuring information

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:44.810
taught in high
school, as opposed

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:46.944
to critical thinking
or aptitude.

00:08:46.944 --> 00:08:48.860
I want to be careful of
this word of aptitude.

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.320
People think of it as
inherent or intrinsic skills

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.390
and abilities, as
opposed to what it really

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:55.040
stood for at the
time, which I believe

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.440
to be much more analogous
with what was your ceiling

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.814
and trying to figure out how
much theoretically could you

00:08:59.814 --> 00:09:01.130
process, could you understand.

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:04.550
So the ACT shifted the focus
away from any questions

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:07.100
around aptitude or
critical thinking

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.470
to just measuring how
well did kids absorb

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:11.180
what their schools taught.

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:13.340
Really important change
in the trajectory

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.160
of standardized testing,
because the APs then

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.230
came along to kind of
reinforce that trend and say,

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.590
well, maybe we can get much
more predictive results

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:23.900
about who will do well
in college if we focus

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.790
not just on measuring
math or English,

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:27.770
but on measuring every
other subject, too.

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:32.420
So today we have over 39 AP
tests, 20 SAT subject tests,

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:34.850
and those tests kind
of became the tail

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.310
wagging the dog of our
entire education system.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.230
So instead of
curriculum being shaped

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:42.500
by employers or by the
government, increasingly

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.270
at high school we
have curriculum

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:46.640
being shaped by the
tests that are required

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:47.990
for college admissions.

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.720
So that's kind of how the
history has played out

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.430
until now.

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:53.960
DAVID BARRY: So
how do you know--

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.930
say Imbellus shifts to a
model that's more about how

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:58.520
you think than what you know.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.410
How do you know
that that's really

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:03.695
a better way of testing
than current methods?

00:10:03.695 --> 00:10:06.320
REBECCA KANTAR: So as we think
about what should an assessment

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.180
be like, there are
a few requirements

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.610
for this day and age
that are table stakes.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.370
One is we need to try and undo
the compounding inequality

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:17.090
that this litany of exams that
we've had for the last 100

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:19.220
years have installed
in our system.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:22.280
The reason these exams tend
to perpetuate inequality--

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.920
as we all know, if you take
an SAT or ACT prep course,

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.220
if you take a set
of AP prep courses,

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.170
if your school
has more resources

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:33.230
to throw at teaching to higher
level, more rigorous courses

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:36.110
like APs, it tends to
follow that students

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:38.510
in those schools or in
those test prep courses

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:39.950
do better on the exams.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:42.240
And to the College
Board and ACT's credit,

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.240
they've done a lot
to democratize access

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.580
to exam preparation,
but you can't

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.160
undo 12 years of
bad public education

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.140
with 12 months of exam prep.

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:54.540
So the first requirement for
a new assessment should be,

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.760
how do you make something
that's not gameable?

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.700
That can't be easily cheated?

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.620
That can't be prepared
for in 12 hours?

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:04.010
Because really the point of
introducing new assessments

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:06.600
should be to shape 12
years of public education.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.590
So when you think about that as
kind of the first requirement,

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:11.250
from there, the
question becomes, well,

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:13.820
how do you make something
that's more generalizable,

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.020
that gets at these skills?

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:16.610
Instead of getting
at specific stuff,

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:19.250
that might be more
sensitive to the inequities

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:21.650
of one school versus
another, one child's

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:23.340
background versus another.

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:26.420
So we focus on, how do we build
environments that are, again,

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.180
abstract such that
the nature of skills

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.220
can shine through,
even if kids learned

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:33.860
how to use those skills
through a broad variety of life

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.450
experiences or
school experiences?

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:39.530
The next question is, if you're
going to deploy something

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:42.320
in a computer based environment,
how do you prevent people

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.792
from cheating and hacking?

00:11:43.792 --> 00:11:46.250
Especially if you're going to
deploy things remotely, which

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:48.920
right now part of the
limiting factor of an SAT,

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.830
or ACT, or SAT II, or AP
type experience is you

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:54.174
have to physically come
into an exam location.

00:11:54.174 --> 00:11:56.090
Your parent has to be
able to drive you there.

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:57.620
You have to apply
for a fee waiver

00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.520
if you can't afford
the fees online.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.150
There's a lot of friction
to coming and doing an exam.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.680
Ideally, we get
to a place where,

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.480
even if it's monitored
remotely, we're

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.780
able to deploy at a
library, or at a study hall,

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:11.090
or maybe even some
day at your home.

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:14.450
And that necessitates your
exam being different enough

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:17.032
for my exam such that
you can't be messaging me

00:12:17.032 --> 00:12:18.740
after about what you
did, and what works,

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:19.950
and what didn't work.

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:22.430
So we think about, how do
you achieve remote deployment

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:24.650
by having unique versions
of your assessment

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:26.690
for every person every time?

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:29.690
And then finally, there's
an underlying question

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:32.270
for assessment of this
century, which is really

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:35.940
the core of why work with
employers at this point for us,

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.397
which is what
skills are relevant?

00:12:37.397 --> 00:12:38.480
What should we be testing?

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.240
If we were to redo the
SAT from first principles,

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.160
what content should be in there?

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.870
What skills do
people really need?

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:47.390
So we stepped back and said,
OK, if you kind of go along

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:50.090
the general thesis of what the
education system has believed

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:52.460
to date of problem
solving, critical thinking,

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:55.310
analytical reasoning
skills being important,

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:58.640
the question becomes, how
do you define those skills

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:02.720
for the modern work life
environment of this century?

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:06.209
And so we've said, maybe we want
to go out and observe skills

00:13:06.209 --> 00:13:08.750
that are happening at companies
where they're at the bleeding

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:10.536
edge of kind of current
work environment,

00:13:10.536 --> 00:13:12.410
bleeding into the future
of work environment,

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:14.210
somewhere like Google,
as it might pertain

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.850
to a skill like creativity,
and really get a chance

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:20.130
to observe how people at that
place leverage that skill.

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:22.130
And you're not just looking
at what do they make

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:23.210
or what do they do?

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:24.990
You're looking at
how do they think,

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:27.290
and then trying to translate
that to an assessment.

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:29.870
So when we think about
our efficacy long term,

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:33.200
our goal is not just to predict
your first year GPA in college,

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.990
because there's a disconnect
for many, many colleges

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:38.840
between what success in college
might look like compared

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.820
to what success in
life might look like,

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.130
but instead our goal is
to be able to show that,

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:45.560
if we say someone is
capable of critical thinking

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.680
and creativity, if they then
enter a career that involves

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.330
critical thinking
and creativity,

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.220
can they remain
gainfully employed?

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:54.350
Can they deal with
daily life situations

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:55.970
that involve those
skills and how

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:59.570
do the choices they make impact,
over the long term, their life

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:01.350
status and their
ability to succeed?

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:04.130
So those are kind of the
longer term metrics that we're

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.590
going after to decide if
our assessment is truly

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:08.187
better than what's there now.

00:14:08.187 --> 00:14:10.520
DAVID BARRY: So you've worked
specifically with McKinsey

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:11.420
so far, right?

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:11.870
REBECCA KANTAR: Correct.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:12.880
DAVID BARRY: So could
you talk a little bit

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.300
about that and the
types of things

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:15.350
you've been doing with them?

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:17.475
REBECCA KANTAR: So we
started with McKinsey largely

00:14:17.475 --> 00:14:18.900
to focus on problem solving.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.304
They're world known
for solving problems.

00:14:21.304 --> 00:14:22.220
That's why they exist.

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.261
It's how they make money.

00:14:23.261 --> 00:14:25.400
So we said, perhaps
if we could understand

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.430
how problem solving happens in
an abstract sense at a place

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:30.800
like McKinsey, maybe
we could work backwards

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.070
to define what problem solving
should look like if it's

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:36.560
done well, but also to
understand problem solving

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.890
across a variety of
industries, across a variety

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:43.610
of nuanced contacts, perhaps
some sort of problem solving

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:46.610
in emergent markets versus
really well developed markets,

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:48.320
problem solving
in scenarios where

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.320
there's a lot of ambiguity
versus very little ambiguity.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.090
So there's kind of
a really nice canvas

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:55.310
for observing how
problem solving manifests

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:56.780
at a place like McKinsey.

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.286
And our goal together is to
develop this problem solving

00:14:59.286 --> 00:15:01.910
assessment that can kind of live
at the top of their recruiting

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:04.250
funnel, and to then
bring all of the data

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:07.070
that we get from working
with employers like McKinsey

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:10.100
back to top colleges in
the US who have forever

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.010
controlled the standards that
we set for college admissions.

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:15.560
So if we can make the case
to a place like Harvard

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.200
that we've been
testing 60% or 70%

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.010
of their graduating
seniors, now you

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:21.820
have a powerful body of data.

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.460
And that's really
the only way I think

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.860
to ever challenge the
traditional status quo

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.552
players and assessment.

00:15:28.552 --> 00:15:30.010
DAVID BARRY: So
what other skills--

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:32.070
so it sounds like problem
solving is a big thing,

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:33.630
looking at the way people think.

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:38.160
What are other skills that
Imbellus seeks to measure?

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.660
REBECCA KANTAR: So
I like this quote

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.440
just because it kind
of brings it to life,

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.320
but Bill Deresiewicz--
he's a famous author--

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.690
has a book called "Excellent
Sheep-- the Miseducation

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:46.830
of American Elite."

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:48.780
And I like to think
about it-- it says,

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.280
what does it take
to produce more

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:52.530
than just mere mortal sheep?

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:55.830
And if we think about this
idea that everyone's training

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.050
for jobs that we
know are soon to be

00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:00.600
obsolete due to
automation, how do

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.450
we think about the
universe of human skills

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:06.120
that really differentiate
humans from machines?

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:08.730
And for us, those are
skills like problem solving,

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:11.280
like critical thinking,
like abstract connections,

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.230
everything that we've kind
of talked about so far,

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:16.350
but there are also
skills like integrity

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:20.190
and like collaboration,
which obviously comes up

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:21.870
in every workplace now.

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:23.820
So we're focused on
how do we broaden

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.650
beyond just the traditional
cognitive skills.

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:29.970
How do we go beyond something
like what the AP tests measure

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:32.580
and really get at the
layers of human intelligence

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:36.240
that continue to differentiate
us from machines?

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.310
And just to kind
of underscore why

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:40.290
that's so important,
even if you're

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.420
a fan of content mastery--

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:43.440
and don't get me wrong.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.350
I think we need both,
kind of understanding

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:48.720
that everyone can do basic
math, that everyone can read,

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.040
that everyone can write.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.750
But even if you're
a fan, in theory,

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:54.360
of teaching to so many
subjects, the problem

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.800
is our kids attain
horrible results.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.740
So if you actually
take a look at-- this

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:01.050
is a nice mapping from
the College Board's data

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:02.760
on AP performance.

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.430
Most students score
between a 2 and a 3

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:08.790
out of 5, which doesn't sound
so bad until you realize

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:10.530
that, in order to
get a 5, you're

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:13.980
only talking about getting 50%
to 70% of the possible points.

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:17.280
So a 2 or 3, if we're generous
with our scaling of the College

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:21.210
Board's rating system, might
be somewhere like 20% to 40%

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:22.530
of the possible points.

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:25.440
So we're spending so
much time over indexing

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.740
on skills like working memory,
and like processing speed,

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:31.500
and basic critical thinking
that are absolutely

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.780
necessary to the world
of employment now,

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.640
and we're absolutely
building assessments

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.490
to kind of get at the core
of those challenges, as well,

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:42.240
but they're in no way
defining a new ceiling.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.280
They're just setting a
floor that ultimately is

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.230
too low for too many students.

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:49.260
And long term kind of when
you think about the evolution

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.320
of tests over the last 100 years
or so-- this is just a snapshot

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.920
since the 1990s--

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.580
you can see that AP
is exactly testing

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.580
this kind of rote
processing memorization,

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.540
basic critical thinking.

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:03.150
These have exploded
at a faster rate

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:05.670
than any of our other
college admissions tests.

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:07.290
So our goal is to
think about, OK,

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:10.650
if we're coming in to replace
this ecosystem of SAT, ACT,

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:14.100
AP exams, how do we go beyond
just the cognitive skills

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.440
that everyone knows that
we've already been testing

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.030
in schools, and
have tried to test

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:21.904
for a long time to the skills
that purely differentiate

00:18:21.904 --> 00:18:22.695
human intelligence?

00:18:22.695 --> 00:18:25.680
I think creativity and
imagination are kind of

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.470
amongst the most important
and earliest of those skills

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:30.540
that we're going to take
on that are markedly

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:32.880
different than what
traditional assessments used

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.850
in the educational
context try and get at.

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:38.410
DAVID BARRY: And why do you
think the traditional testing

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:42.080
methodologies have
discounted these areas

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:46.594
or evolved in a way where they
didn't incorporate the picture?

00:18:46.594 --> 00:18:48.510
REBECCA KANTAR: I think
the main reason you've

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:52.580
seen the traditional players of
really the College Board, ETS,

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:54.930
and the ACT stay
around for a while

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:57.200
and have such a strong
hold on this market

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.860
is, one, because
it's really hard

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:01.410
to disrupt their distribution.

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:04.020
So as soon as schools,
and parents, and colleges

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:08.550
all coalesce around one market
of AP, SAT, ACT, very hard

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:11.250
to change those standards, but
that's true in any other market

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:13.020
where standards
are set, as well.

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.990
But beyond that, turns out
that cognitive assessment

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:19.260
and assessment of anything
that's a latent trait that I

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.460
can't directly observe you
doing and say, oh, here

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:24.043
is how good your coding results
were, for example-- that would

00:19:24.043 --> 00:19:26.609
be much less latent, much
less difficult to get at,

00:19:26.609 --> 00:19:28.650
but I can't open up your
brain and say, oh, there

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:29.490
was problem solving.

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:30.570
I saw it right there.

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:34.200
I have to infer based
on some evidence stream

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.990
that you're either capable at
a high level of problem solving

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:39.690
for some environment or context
in which you'd want to use it,

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:40.560
or not.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.510
And doing that is
just really hard.

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:45.500
We haven't had the technology
until quite recently

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:49.500
to be able to pull apart
in non-black box ML models

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:53.160
this idea of how your
every click, or time stamp,

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.440
or mouse movement in
our environment maps

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.020
to one of these high level
skills like critical thinking.

00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:00.720
We haven't been able to
diagnose all of those behaviors

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:04.060
and then trace them in a really
understandable, explainable,

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:05.760
and defensible way,
which is important

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.470
when you talk about assessment.

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:10.530
And we also haven't
been able to untangle

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:13.710
when a solution like a
simulation based or a game

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:16.350
based assessment isn't
working, when you don't

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:18.330
see great distributions,
when everyone

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:21.880
fails or everyone passes on
some of your questions or tasks.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.680
We haven't been able to figure
out where things go wrong.

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:28.270
So unpacking was it a UI
problem, was it an art problem,

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:29.740
was it a language
problem, was it

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:32.260
an underlying assessment
problem, also really hard.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:33.635
So I think that
keeps the barrier

00:20:33.635 --> 00:20:36.130
to entry in this space of
trying to move beyond pen

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:38.530
and paper, multiple choice--

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:40.900
keeps the barrier
to entry very high.

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:43.060
And when you think about
the added complexity

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:44.794
of regulatory
environments, and some

00:20:44.794 --> 00:20:46.210
of what the
government tries to do

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:48.620
around coupling
huge initiatives,

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:51.280
such as Race to the Top,
or No Child Left Behind,

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.890
or the Common Core standards,
with assessments that

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:57.640
try and do those major
policy initiatives justice,

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.950
you kind of witness
the inability

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:01.690
of the modern
players in the market

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:03.070
to really meet the demands.

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:04.610
Because how do you
test life skills

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:06.130
in multiple choice tests?

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:07.120
You can't.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.610
I could ask you a million kind
of self-reflective questions

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:11.350
about yourself, but
those aren't always

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:13.270
going to be really
indicative of what you're

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:14.945
truly like in a
high stakes context,

00:21:14.945 --> 00:21:16.570
because something is
on the line, which

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:18.070
means you have
incentive to kind of say

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:20.570
something perhaps a little bit
different than what's true.

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:24.310
So when you think about this
ecosystem of so many schools,

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:26.680
so much distribution,
coupled with it's

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.480
really hard to
move to technology

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.460
because you never know
when things go wrong,

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:32.590
or how they're going
wrong, and it's really hard

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:35.800
to deal with all the data that
comes out, finally that it's

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.110
really expensive, you
have a lot of inertia

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:39.910
in the system keeping
it the way it is

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:42.190
and very little reason
to try and pursue

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:45.760
building new assessments
from first principles.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:50.720
DAVID BARRY: And that's the key
reason why there's sort of--

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.640
so when we're talking
about the shortcomings

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.970
of the current model, I think
it's something that I've known.

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:58.090
You're kind of articulating
it in a better way,

00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:02.450
but what's really
preventing people

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:08.240
from trying to fix it in the
way sort of like you're doing?

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.840
Is it mostly just the entrenched
system is so in place,

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:14.630
and it's hard to crack
and change things?

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:16.740
REBECCA KANTAR: Yeah,
I'd say all the points

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:19.040
I've just made around
government regulation

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:22.000
coupled with expense, coupled
with market dynamics--

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.420
I mean, all of these things
coalesce to make it hard,

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:27.620
but past that there's this
broken link in infrastructure

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:29.780
in our system where
folks haven't really

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:32.120
done a bottom up
analysis of what

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:35.030
jobs now and jobs in
the future are going

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:36.652
to require in terms of skills.

00:22:36.652 --> 00:22:38.360
So one of the hardest
questions to answer

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:40.190
is, what should
you be measuring?

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:42.290
And how do you know
what good looks like?

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:45.140
And we haven't done this kind
of generalized analysis--

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:47.780
not under the lens of chemistry
and what problem solving looks

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:50.450
like in chemistry, or under
the lens of what good math

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:51.230
looks like.

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:52.970
We haven't done this
kind of analysis of,

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:54.530
what does critical
thinking mean?

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:55.880
What kinds of critical
thinking do people

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:56.796
need to be capable of?

00:22:56.796 --> 00:22:58.125
What does creativity mean?

00:22:58.125 --> 00:23:00.500
What kinds of creativity do
people need to be capable of?

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:02.690
No one has done this
linking of employment

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:05.370
back to education for 100 years.

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:06.950
So when you go and
try and research,

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:10.090
OK, let's build a creativity
assessment, well, good luck.

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:11.090
How are you defining it?

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:13.500
Is it just simply the number
of ideas people come up with

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:15.650
and the nature of how
divergent those ideas are?

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:17.190
That's usually the
barometer folks

00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:19.390
use in the cognitive
space for creativity,

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:21.140
but that's not that practical.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:23.240
That doesn't tell me about
the nuanced differences

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.910
between what it takes
to be creative at IDEO,

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:27.650
what it takes to be
creative at Google,

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:29.720
and what it takes to
be creative at Pixar.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.840
All three places require
creativity, but how do we know?

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:35.180
How do we describe the
differences in those places?

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:37.890
And what do their distributions
look like in terms of the data?

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:41.210
So I think the final barrier
to really preventing folks

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:44.510
from going after cognitive
assessment in this high stakes

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:47.450
environment is you have to be
predictive of whatever you're

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:48.580
trying to assess.

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:50.330
So if you have no
correlation between what

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:52.730
you say people are like and
then how they do on a job

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:54.380
or in school, your
tests aren't going

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:56.030
to be around for
a long time, which

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:59.270
means you have to do this hard
work of figuring out what's

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:02.660
relevant to that job or to that
person's performance in school

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:04.020
or whatever context.

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:06.230
And that's a huge
undertaking, as well.

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:09.590
It's a lot of chugging along,
doing observation, doing

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:13.610
research, experimenting, and
spending years just patiently

00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:16.042
getting to the answer of what
better assessment requires.

00:24:16.042 --> 00:24:17.750
DAVID BARRY: And that's
what you guys are

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:18.600
working on doing [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.350
REBECCA KANTAR: Yeah,
as long as it takes.

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:28.020
DAVID BARRY: Whenever I think of
an online platform for testing,

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:31.265
I'm worried about maybe hacking
or cheating in some way.

00:24:31.265 --> 00:24:33.180
How do you protect against that?

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:35.120
REBECCA KANTAR: So
thinking about if you're

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.650
building an assessment,
whether it's

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:38.930
around collaborative problem
solving or creativity,

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:41.030
and you have something
that's game-like,

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:43.610
people always have an incentive
to try and beat the game.

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:46.490
I mean, this is a known problem
for all sorts of massive multi

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:48.680
online player worlds and games.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.870
The key difference
between an MMO game

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:54.380
and somewhere like Imbellus
is it's fine for humans

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:57.890
to create all the variance
between one version of "World

00:24:57.890 --> 00:24:59.810
of Warcraft" when you
sit down to it one day

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:01.520
and the next
version the next day

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.950
because you're not trying
to hold some threshold

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:06.414
understanding of what
everyone started as when they

00:25:06.414 --> 00:25:07.580
entered "World of Warcraft."

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:09.200
You're just trying
to understand how

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.110
they do in that point of time
and keep them in a flow state.

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:14.360
But for us, it's
critically important

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:17.000
that I understand the starting
state of your assessment

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.050
and the starting state
of my assessment.

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:20.990
That means yours can't
be wildly harder,

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:23.844
and mine can't be wildly
easier, or it wouldn't be fair.

00:25:23.844 --> 00:25:26.510
It also means that, since I have
no understanding of what you're

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:28.784
like cognitively until you
come into the assessment

00:25:28.784 --> 00:25:30.200
and start performing--
and I don't

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.742
have an understanding of what
anyone else is like cognitively

00:25:32.742 --> 00:25:34.241
before they come
into the assessment

00:25:34.241 --> 00:25:36.890
and start performing-- we've got
to start you at the same place

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:38.930
so that we can watch your
progress in an apples

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:39.720
to apples way.

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.390
So not only from a
fairness perspective,

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:43.220
but from a measurement
perspective,

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:45.860
it's key that the
assessments be similar enough

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:49.130
that I can call them comparable,
but then different enough--

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:52.250
not caused by humans, because
if it's all caused by humans,

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:54.410
your state could end up
being way harder than mine,

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:56.520
and we could lose
control of the system--

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.800
but controlled by
our system itself.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.770
So when you think about
cheating, and hacking,

00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:03.320
and gaming, the challenge
clearly becomes,

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.030
how do you keep content fresh?

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:07.760
How do you keep everything new
every time for every person,

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:09.830
but also predictable
on our side?

00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:11.810
Because if it's not
predictable on our side,

00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:14.690
we don't know if it was you
who actually stumbled and had

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:16.490
a hard time with a
problem, or if it

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:19.010
was someone else who created
that variance for you.

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:21.260
So we can't rely
on lots of people

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:24.590
playing at once to cause any
differences in our platform.

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:27.800
Instead we use AI to
basically generate

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.010
new versions of our scenarios
that are similar enough

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:34.100
that they are considered
equivalent as assessments,

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:37.580
but different enough such that,
if you went online and wrote

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:40.480
down on some post everything
you thought you did

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.230
and why you thought
it was right or wrong,

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:44.720
someone else took those notes
and then tried to use them

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.580
in their scenario,
everything has

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:48.680
to look different and
feel different enough

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.110
that it's of no utility.

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:53.230
So to make this practical,
let's think about a scenario

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:55.640
where a group of animals
is sick with a disease,

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.100
and the disease is spreading.

00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:59.470
It's your job, as the
user in our assessment,

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:02.920
to figure out how the disease is
spreading, which disease it is,

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.900
which animals are
being impacted,

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:07.090
how the group dynamics
or the herd dynamics

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:10.750
are feeding into that equation,
and to then develop a solution,

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:12.340
try it out, see
how well it works,

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:15.010
adapt as the simulation
gives you feedback.

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:17.680
Now, yours could be happening
in the desert with camels.

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:20.890
Mine could be happening in the
mountains with mountain goats.

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:23.470
All of the properties
driving which disease,

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:26.260
how it's spreading--
everything has to be emergent.

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:29.470
So your environment is totally
different than my environment,

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:31.054
and how things
unfold are therefore

00:27:31.054 --> 00:27:33.220
going to be different,
meaning our optimal solutions

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:34.303
are going to be different.

00:27:34.303 --> 00:27:36.100
Now, beyond just
the solution state,

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.680
we're also looking at every
click, every time stamp,

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:41.230
how you do the processing
in that environment.

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:42.820
So you could think
of it like chess.

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:45.370
Maybe someone memorizes
some openings on chess,

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:47.620
and they execute those, but
that's a little different

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:49.990
than the person who
sees 12 moves ahead

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:52.896
and is executing a careful
strategy of distracting you

00:27:52.896 --> 00:27:54.520
in one region of the
board so that they

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:57.770
can take advantage of
your dislocated attention

00:27:57.770 --> 00:27:59.510
in another region of the board.

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:01.780
So when you think about
that as an analogy,

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.370
our goal is to
build an assessment

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:06.250
that, even if you've seen
some YouTube videos online,

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:09.730
doesn't meaningfully impact
your odds at actually doing well

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:11.320
in the environment.

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.224
And just to back
up with one thing

00:28:13.224 --> 00:28:14.890
that I don't think
we've hit, the reason

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:17.080
we choose the natural
world is largely

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.210
because we have
such a rich context

00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:22.390
for creating this kind of
anti-cheating variance.

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:25.090
If I were to use an office
setting, because there are so

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:28.000
many strict ties of reality
and so many expectations

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.800
that, if you grew up
in one country or one

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:33.760
city versus another, you might
hold, it's very hard for us

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:36.040
to create the same
level of variance

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.980
in a procedural or
an AI based solution

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:41.020
if we're using
people writing memos

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:42.610
to their product managers.

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:45.700
Suddenly this possibility space
becomes really constrained,

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:48.040
and it's very difficult
to kind of generate

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:51.190
this rich set of property
or data driven environments

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:53.434
that can constantly
unfold in new ways.

00:28:53.434 --> 00:28:55.600
So that's why you'll notice
a lot of our assessments

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:59.500
have plants, animals, the
weather as the primary actors,

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:00.970
and it's your job
to cope with all

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:03.834
of the emergent consequences
from those drivers.

00:29:03.834 --> 00:29:06.250
DAVID BARRY: Do you anticipate
that people who in the past

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:10.227
have done on the ACT, SAT will
do well on Imbellus's tests?

00:29:10.227 --> 00:29:12.310
REBECCA KANTAR: So I think
one of the ugly truths,

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:14.410
unfortunately, of the
American education system

00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:16.900
is it's not an
accident if you do well

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:19.120
or don't do well in college
admissions assessments.

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:21.670
It's more so a verdict of
the schooling you've had

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:23.620
and the lifestyle you've
had until that point

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:25.570
than your particular
skills or abilities.

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:29.260
Certainly, skills and abilities
of the individual, general G

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:31.210
intelligence people
like to talk about--

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:32.865
sure all of those
things are factors,

00:29:32.865 --> 00:29:34.990
just like in every other
part of your life in terms

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:37.720
of why you succeed or why
you don't at task you try.

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:40.510
But in the education
system, disproportionately,

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:42.430
if you start out
disadvantaged, you're

00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:44.920
likely to end up disadvantaged,
and if you start out

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:47.770
very privileged, you're likely
to end up very privileged.

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:49.930
And that's because,
at a state level,

00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:52.060
when we introduce
something like Common Core,

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:55.180
the tests for Common Core rely
on how much teachers have been

00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:58.000
successful in teaching
to students over a year,

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.520
and that's reflected in an
English test or a math test

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:02.530
starting in, say,
kindergarten through third

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:03.610
through fifth grade.

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:06.520
And that cycle of testing
how much knowledge kids have

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:08.870
acquired continues on
through high school.

00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:11.590
So if your high school is
good at teaching AP courses,

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:13.962
and you take AP
biology and AP history,

00:30:13.962 --> 00:30:16.420
and your teacher has it down--
they've been doing it for 10

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:16.990
years--

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:19.060
your odds of doing
better on those tests

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:22.060
are so much greater than someone
whose school is introducing

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:23.710
APs for the first time.

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:26.800
And the challenge that our
neediest and poorest schools

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.795
face beyond just that they
perhaps have lower teacher

00:30:29.795 --> 00:30:31.420
retention-- they have
younger teachers.

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:32.600
All these things are true--

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.760
but beyond that,
the main challenge

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:37.870
is just they have needier
students and fewer resources

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:39.180
to deal with those needs.

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:42.580
So if you have more kids who
are English language learners,

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:45.570
maybe you have more families who
need holistic kind of community

00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:46.450
supports.

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:50.350
It makes it really hard to focus
on teaching to AP biology or AP

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:53.080
history when you're still
working on literacy.

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:55.580
What are you going to do with
those kids in that environment

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:57.920
when you have so much
information to plow through?

00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:01.760
So I would not expect kids
who have been disadvantaged

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.710
their entire lives
to suddenly correct

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:05.930
for that in a new assessment
between high school

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:06.800
and college.

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.950
I would expect our tests to
make it a little bit less awful,

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:14.030
and that's a terrible starting
goal, but a practical reality

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:15.080
of where we are.

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:16.850
On the flip side, if
students do really

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:19.497
well in the SAT, SAT
IIs, APs, I don't

00:31:19.497 --> 00:31:21.330
think they're going to
tank our assessments.

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:23.288
There's no reason that
that should be the case,

00:31:23.288 --> 00:31:25.460
but they're not going
to be as easy to fake

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.830
by just studying, and
preparing over and over,

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:30.170
and kind of memorizing
the format of questions,

00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:33.041
and the format of answers, and
what's probabilistically there.

00:31:33.041 --> 00:31:34.790
And that's important,
because if we're all

00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:37.580
serious about wanting
a meritocratic system,

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:42.260
we should want to alleviate the
challenges of being born poor

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:44.630
versus the privilege
of being born rich,

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:46.150
and we should want
to get at, what

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:48.450
is this individual's potential?

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:51.260
So I think about the role of
our assessments on a macro level

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:52.659
as hopefully raising the floor.

00:31:52.659 --> 00:31:54.950
We tend to focus a lot, when
we think about assessment,

00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:56.759
on the individual,
which is logical,

00:31:56.759 --> 00:31:58.550
because it's an assessment
for each person,

00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:01.011
and then we talk about their
fate after that assessment.

00:32:01.011 --> 00:32:02.760
But I take a different
view on assessment,

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:05.240
which is assessment
drives the system.

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:09.020
That's our theory-- is what you
test determines what you teach,

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:11.150
and how you test
determines how you teach.

00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:12.870
So if you see it
that way, Imbellus

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:15.710
is focused really on
raising the floor for what

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:17.690
is the bare minimum
set of skills

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:20.570
that all people need when they
graduate from high school.

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:22.910
Forget college, because
for a lot of people,

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:24.740
the reality is it's
not in the cards,

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:27.230
or they're part of
the 50% of Americans

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:29.660
who start out in college,
don't graduate in six years,

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:32.240
and have $40,000
or more in debt.

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.520
When you think about
those odds, you really

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:37.520
need to optimize for high school
being the last public point

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.360
of intervention
in someone's life

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:41.720
to give them the skills
they need as an adult.

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:44.990
And for us, that's kind
of the thrust of what

00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:46.820
a good assessment
should be and how

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:49.790
you should judge performance--
is how do we raise the floor?

00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:53.030
Not necessarily does the kid
from Harvard-Westlake in LA

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:54.587
do better on our
tests than the SAT,

00:32:54.587 --> 00:32:57.170
and are they therefore able to
get into Princeton and Harvard,

00:32:57.170 --> 00:32:58.790
not just Columbia and Duke?

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:00.980
I mean, they're going
to be fine regardless.

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:03.680
So thinking instead
about how do we make sure

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.200
that the kids in the Bronx
who right now have teachers

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:09.080
scrambling to teach
to the AP bio test

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:10.730
are instead learning
content that's

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:13.304
appropriate for their
context, but most importantly,

00:33:13.304 --> 00:33:14.720
just developing
the skills they're

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:17.420
going to need behind whatever
content is best for them

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:18.225
to engage with.

00:33:18.225 --> 00:33:20.600
DAVID BARRY: So I remember
when I was applying to college

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:24.320
the SAT was kind of you had
to get above a certain score

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.660
in order to be eligible
for the college,

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:29.840
but after that, whether
you got a perfect score it

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:32.460
didn't matter that much.

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:36.470
Do you foresee Imbellus
maybe having more weight

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:40.131
in the admissions process so
that the person from the Bronx

00:33:40.131 --> 00:33:42.380
might be able to beat the
person from Harvard-Westlake

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:44.421
who has all these
extracurriculars and everything

00:33:44.421 --> 00:33:47.414
because their problem solving
skills are that much greater?

00:33:47.414 --> 00:33:49.580
So like rather than, whereas
the SAT, like you said,

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:52.130
is just a floor,
this has a better way

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:54.680
of sort of measuring
potential of how they

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.360
might perform once they arrive.

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:57.440
REBECCA KANTAR: Yeah,
it's absolutely our hope,

00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:00.110
because look, I think it's a
hard case for someone to make

00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:03.080
that, if an individual
tests like employees

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:06.590
at Google, or Facebook,
or Amazon, or Goldman,

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:08.750
or wherever hopefully
someday we're

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:10.639
privileged enough to
partner with in the way

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:12.320
we have with McKinsey to date--

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.850
it's hard to say
that that kid is

00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:16.460
unfit to have a
successful beginning

00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:17.656
of their career, at least.

00:34:17.656 --> 00:34:19.489
Who knows how they're
going to be long term?

00:34:19.489 --> 00:34:21.989
And perhaps they're going to
have other life challenges that

00:34:21.989 --> 00:34:24.600
come as a circumstance of
poverty, but at the very least,

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.220
they're showing
potential in terms

00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:28.219
of how they're thinking
that's emblematic of how

00:34:28.219 --> 00:34:31.409
lots of people at lots of other
high performing places think.

00:34:31.409 --> 00:34:33.050
So yes, I think
you're going to be

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:35.570
able to find kind of diamonds
in the rough, if you will,

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:39.230
who right now perhaps might not
be recognized because school

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:41.420
is tainting their
ability to demonstrate

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:42.835
their raw potential.

00:34:42.835 --> 00:34:44.960
And I don't mean raw, again,
in the inherent sense,

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.626
but perhaps they
learned a set of skills

00:34:46.626 --> 00:34:49.880
after school watching a
sibling or working a job.

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:53.116
Wherever they came from, our
job should be to recognize them.

00:34:53.116 --> 00:34:54.949
I think you bring up
an important point when

00:34:54.949 --> 00:34:56.698
you talk about
extracurriculars, because I

00:34:56.698 --> 00:34:58.760
would posit that over
the next 20 years

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:04.250
or so you're going to notice the
current lag effect of education

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:08.540
under serving the elites and
upper middle class in a way

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:11.150
that really they're
not noticing right now.

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:14.109
So we don't think about
that the upper middle class

00:35:14.109 --> 00:35:16.400
families', the elite families'
kids are going to soccer

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.740
practice, and band,
and summer camp,

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:21.860
and all of the interactions
they're having after school

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:25.280
and between school years is
defining a lot of the key

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.740
skills that they need
in work and in life,

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:30.080
while poor kids aren't
necessarily having the same

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:31.130
after school experience.

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:33.020
They're going an hour
to and from school.

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:34.750
They're baby sitting
a younger sibling.

00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:36.500
Maybe their parents
are working three jobs

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:38.400
and can't do
flashcards over dinner.

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:41.720
Whatever the circumstance,
hopefully our assessments are

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:45.500
able to recognize the underlying
abilities and kind of put

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:48.470
a little bit less emphasis on
the learned skills that might

00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:51.350
only come from activities that
rich kids might have access

00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:52.491
to, while poor kids don't.

00:35:52.491 --> 00:35:53.990
But I think there's
going to be kind

00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:56.990
of a groundswell of parents
in the next 20 years--

00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:59.240
probably of the millennial
generation-- saying,

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:02.360
look, even the after school
activities aren't cutting it.

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.670
Our kids are still
woefully under prepared.

00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:06.920
An MGI, McKinsey
Global Institute,

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.500
report that I found
valuable talks

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.600
about a survey they did
with employers where

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:15.770
60% of employers in
major economy countries

00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:18.350
said that graduates were
under prepared for work when

00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:19.450
they started on the job.

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:21.890
And it's like, how is
that possible after 16

00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:24.920
years of education in either
the US, or the UK, or somewhere

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:25.830
similar?

00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:28.940
How are our kids who have been
through the tried and true path

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:31.580
of all of public
education, plus college--

00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:34.634
how are they unable to work
in the modern workplace now?

00:36:34.634 --> 00:36:36.800
And how is that not going
to get exponentially worse

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:37.774
over the next 30 years?

00:36:37.774 --> 00:36:39.190
That's where I
think there's going

00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:42.410
to be a rise in public support
for a solution like Imbellus

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:45.260
that hopefully can cut through
whatever stuff kids are

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:46.790
learning that's less relevant.

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:49.460
But what actually
matters is, are they able

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:51.900
to think in a variety of ways?

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:54.890
And are they dexterous enough
to cope with constantly changing

00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:57.920
content, but really have their
underlying abilities shine

00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.160
through?

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:01.246
DAVID BARRY: So you
pointed to the William--

00:37:01.246 --> 00:37:02.495
how do you pronounce his last?

00:37:02.495 --> 00:37:03.080
REBECCA KANTAR: Deresiewicz.

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:04.830
DAVID BARRY: Deresiewicz,
the professor.

00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:07.689
REBECCA KANTAR: Try spelling it.

00:37:07.689 --> 00:37:09.230
DAVID BARRY: So in
his book, he talks

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:11.450
about how there's sort
of a double edged sword

00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:15.112
with the Harvard-Westlake kids
who pad their resume with all

00:37:15.112 --> 00:37:16.070
these extracurriculars.

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:17.954
They sort of get in
this mindset of I

00:37:17.954 --> 00:37:19.370
need to be doing
all these things.

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:20.570
I need to be checking
all these boxes.

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:22.520
I need to be jumping
through all these hoops,

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:23.936
and that actually
hurts them later

00:37:23.936 --> 00:37:26.397
on when it comes time to
sort of navigate their life,

00:37:26.397 --> 00:37:28.480
because they just want the
most prestigious thing.

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.396
It's not necessarily
what they should be doing

00:37:30.396 --> 00:37:32.810
or what they naturally
gravitate to.

00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:44.920
So what I'm envisioning is
for Imbellus to have a greater

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:49.540
weight in the process so that
that's not reinforced so much

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:51.611
and that people will end
up at these institutions

00:37:51.611 --> 00:37:53.860
where they have opportunity,
who can then do something

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:57.550
like you've done, where you
graduate and you sort of carve

00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:59.860
your own path, as
opposed to just having

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:02.530
these super saturated
markets of people trying

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:04.450
to go into investment
banking, or consulting,

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:06.970
or private equity, or what
have you that have the most

00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:09.260
prestige and money in them.

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:12.470
So I want to frame
this as a question.

00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:14.650
So I think it's a
difficult thing to change.

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:18.150
It's very entrenched, and
it has a lot of social--

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:20.990
it has to do with a lot of
social things and values.

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:25.030
So I think it's very
interesting that you're

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:27.490
tackling it from the
testing point of view,

00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:29.920
but I'm curious--

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:32.350
it seems like it's
the social value

00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:34.600
system that sort
of has contributed

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:36.260
to make things this way.

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:38.785
So how do you think about
that and approaching that?

00:38:38.785 --> 00:38:39.910
REBECCA KANTAR: Absolutely.

00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:43.210
I think education in our
country exists primarily now

00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:44.740
to serve social status.

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:48.190
So undoubtedly, it
would not be acceptable

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:51.040
for you to go to Harvard,
graduate, become a plumber,

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:52.870
and make $200,000 a year.

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:54.940
It's a ridiculous
idea because it's not

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:57.220
seen as a prestigious
career track when

00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:00.380
you could go to Goldman or
Bain and do the same thing.

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:02.800
So thinking about the
seismic shift that

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.300
would have to happen
in this country

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.670
to embrace that,
in fact, college

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:09.560
isn't the only endpoint
for education--

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:11.920
and there's been a growing
movement towards community

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.570
college or vocational
schools, but unfortunately,

00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:17.810
this is kind of Race to
the Top data from Obama's

00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:19.420
balanced scorecard initiative.

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:22.840
When you think about
the litany of schools

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:25.780
that exist to serve, perhaps,
things different than the four

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:29.140
year liberal arts education,
a lot of them are total scams.

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:33.040
The average salary coming out
of those schools is $27,000.

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:36.310
So when you think about, again,
12 years of public education,

00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:38.140
two or four years
of education on top

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:40.570
of that at a post-secondary
level, it's like,

00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:41.290
what's the point?

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:43.750
That's not a living wage--
in most parts of the country,

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:44.890
anyway.

00:39:44.890 --> 00:39:48.145
So when I think about
unraveling that social system,

00:39:48.145 --> 00:39:50.770
I don't think it's practical, at
least in a short term horizon.

00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:53.530
I think the US has embraced
the idea that it's not just

00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:54.790
a meritocracy.

00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:57.490
It's also hereditary
wealth that drives

00:39:57.490 --> 00:40:00.820
how we have odds at
advancing through society

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:04.360
throughout our children to
adolescent to adult lives.

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.670
But what I do think
is more practical

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:09.200
is to actually use that
inertia to our advantage.

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:12.610
So I think it's becoming
less one size fits all

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:14.920
if you're not in
the top 10% in terms

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:18.340
of what you might do after
graduating from high school.

00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:20.950
Is going to Trinity
College a great value

00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:23.440
if you have $80,000
worth of debt?

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:24.051
It depends.

00:40:24.051 --> 00:40:26.050
It really depends on what
you're going to study,

00:40:26.050 --> 00:40:27.675
and where you're
from, and where you're

00:40:27.675 --> 00:40:29.530
going to go to seek
employment after school,

00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:32.170
but I think people are starting
to ask those questions.

00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:34.090
I think the broader
implication is, how do you

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:37.960
stop this kind of predatory
for-profit tiny colleges,

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:40.360
community colleges
serving 10 or 20 students

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:42.640
doing digital
photography as their two

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:44.590
years of post-secondary
training,

00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:48.400
and then making $5,000, or
$0, or whatever it is year,

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.910
and having ballooning debt?

00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:52.000
So for us, the
focus should be on,

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.860
for those kids, in
the case that they

00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:55.480
don't choose to go to college--

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:58.360
as regulatory environments
hopefully kind of crack down

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:01.360
on these types of schools that
really cannot demonstrate any

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:02.920
efficacy--

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:05.070
can we make sure that what
they did in high school

00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:07.420
prepared them for
that lifestyle?

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:10.300
And I think your
point of social status

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:12.850
also rings true when you think
about Harvard, and Princeton,

00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:16.450
and Yale as hedge funds that
have schools attached to them.

00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:18.400
There's so much money,
and there's so much

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:22.450
power across these endowments
of major research universities

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:24.760
that it's unrealistic
to think that you're

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.560
going to get them to
change their mantra,

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:27.850
change how they sort.

00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:30.340
People have been advocating
for a portfolio based approach

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:32.230
to admissions, for
example, for a long time

00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:34.300
to try and relieve
some of the inequities.

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:37.810
But unless these schools see
that they have a better shot

00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:40.990
at finding talented people
who are likely to reinforce

00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:43.510
their social capital,
their fiscal capital,

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:46.030
and their intellectual capital--
meaning win Nobel prizes,

00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:48.220
go on to graduate schools,
become professors,

00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:51.190
continue not just to be
elite in terms of earning,

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:54.100
but to be elite in terms of
prestige in their intellectual

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:55.930
pursuits throughout
their careers--

00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:57.430
it's unlikely that
schools are going

00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:59.500
to embrace a new
standard, because what

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:02.830
they have now does the job
of sorting that they need.

00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:04.390
The problem for
all of us is that

00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:06.520
the downward negative
externalities

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:08.560
that it exerts on the
rest of the system

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:10.660
means that it's not just
sorting that's happening.

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:12.880
It's shaping of all
of our curriculum,

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:14.939
and that's where I
think as a society we

00:42:14.939 --> 00:42:16.480
need to say there's
more than one end

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:18.580
goal than the elite
liberal arts college

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:21.220
or the non-elite liberal
arts college, the 300

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:22.990
or so derivatives of Harvard.

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:25.232
And we need to
embrace, instead, kids

00:42:25.232 --> 00:42:27.190
learning what they need
to learn in high school

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:28.840
to prepare them
to become adults,

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:31.210
and then pursuing
post-secondary opportunities

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:32.982
that further more of
the same in a place

00:42:32.982 --> 00:42:35.440
where there's actually market
demand for the sets of skills

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:37.194
they're acquiring.

00:42:37.194 --> 00:42:38.860
DAVID BARRY: Do you
think the government

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:42.960
should play a role in
educational testing

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.629
or admissions testing?

00:42:44.629 --> 00:42:46.170
REBECCA KANTAR: So
government already

00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:49.530
does play a huge role in terms
of state standardized tests.

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:52.320
Lots of parents have been up
in arms about the Common Core

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:52.830
for years.

00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:55.110
I think the Common
Core was a nice idea

00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:56.850
and was really
challenging to implement.

00:42:56.850 --> 00:42:58.530
There are very few
assessment providers

00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:00.946
who are going to, as we talked
about a little bit earlier,

00:43:00.946 --> 00:43:03.810
be able to measure skills
through multiple choice.

00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:04.910
I haven't seen it yet.

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:06.660
I would definitely be
impressed if someone

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:09.930
manages to do that in a high
stakes and predictive capacity.

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:12.540
But thinking about
the assessment players

00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:14.760
who are out there, the
challenge for the government

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:17.880
is, every time there's a new
set of Common Core standards,

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:19.830
or Race to the Top, or
No Child Left Behind,

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:21.960
or ESSA, or any of the
policy initiatives,

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:24.000
finding a way to
measure how well are

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.020
states doing or districts doing
on forwarding those policy

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:28.890
goals--

00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:31.200
comes to student assessment,
because what else are you

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:31.900
going to use?

00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:34.650
You don't want to wait
20 years necessarily

00:43:34.650 --> 00:43:37.380
to see how socioeconomic
data plays out for a district

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:40.320
once people graduate from
elementary, middle, high

00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:42.060
school, and then
start employment.

00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:43.680
So people are
usually implementing

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:45.900
shorter term feedback
cycles through state

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:47.160
standardized tests.

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:51.150
And in that case, government
has provided a foundation, where

00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:53.760
no one else has, around
cognitive assessment

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:57.540
and the bar for little kids,
but in the high school market,

00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:59.100
it's much more detached.

00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:00.960
It's much more so
the College Board

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:04.410
and ACT who have set the
standards both for what

00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:06.540
we test, but also
for what we teach--

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:09.480
in the College Board's
case, with APs in the most

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:10.900
literal way possible.

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:12.780
There's an AP packet
and course that's

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:15.990
given for every single
subject, and it's teachers' job

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:17.460
to stick to the script.

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:20.790
So I think for us the hopeful
long term role of government

00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:23.550
is to help unite lots of
players who are already

00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:25.770
working on curricular
reform in what I see

00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:27.750
as the right direction,
basically moving away

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:30.030
from that rote
content based teaching

00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:32.730
to embrace a new
era of assessments

00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:35.040
at at least the high
school level, maybe

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:38.940
some day for younger students,
as well, that go beyond just

00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:41.370
measuring how well teachers
did at teaching content

00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:45.570
to students, and instead look at
how well are students being fit

00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:47.580
and prepared for
the nature of work

00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:50.280
that they're going to encounter
in school and in life.

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:51.280
DAVID BARRY: It's funny.

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:55.080
At most high schools the course
itself is titled AP English.

00:44:58.110 --> 00:45:02.340
So what about taking a look
at-- so I'm from Massachusetts,

00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:05.460
and we had I think it was
called the MCAS or something,

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:06.180
the state test.

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:06.900
REBECCA KANTAR: I'm
from Massachusetts, too.

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:08.150
DAVID BARRY: You are, as well?

00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:10.110
REBECCA KANTAR: So it
is indeed the MCAS.

00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:11.130
DAVID BARRY: And if
you did well enough,

00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:12.960
I think you could go to
UMass Amherst or something

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.168
for free or something, right?

00:45:14.168 --> 00:45:15.660
REBECCA KANTAR: Yep.

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:17.460
DAVID BARRY: So I
remember that from

00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:19.140
elementary and middle school.

00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:21.060
You are focusing right now--

00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:23.660
well, I guess right now you're
focusing on the post-college,

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:26.140
but really ultimately your goal
is to focus on high school.

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:28.260
What about those
important formative years,

00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:29.760
the elementary,
middle school years?

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:30.750
Do you have a plan?

00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:32.370
REBECCA KANTAR: Yeah,
so I don't think

00:45:32.370 --> 00:45:34.740
we'll address those
anytime really soon,

00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:39.120
and the reason why is I think
in the K through 7 level you do

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:41.250
need to teach some
basis of information

00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:42.870
that everyone needs to function.

00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:43.710
They've got to be able to read.

00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:44.670
Kids have to be able to write.

00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:45.900
They have to be able
to do basic math.

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:48.108
They should have some idea
of the country we live in,

00:45:48.108 --> 00:45:50.290
the world we live in, the
history of those things.

00:45:50.290 --> 00:45:52.920
So our ambition is
not to wipe out all

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:55.260
of the traditional system,
either in kind of the K

00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:59.460
through 12 realm in
terms of basic subject

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:02.100
mastery, but also in
the college realm.

00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:04.680
We're not advocating for
getting rid of liberal arts.

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:08.070
The goal, I think, long term
should be in those cases of K

00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:11.280
through 7, how do you move away
from so much summative testing?

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:13.500
Because most parents
and students, I think,

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:16.620
feel that it's absolutely
suffocating as it exists now.

00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:19.840
Maybe we'll start to play in
that space in 10 or 15 years,

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:22.590
but for right now, we want
to remain squarely focused

00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:23.979
on college to employment.

00:46:23.979 --> 00:46:25.270
What do people look like there?

00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:28.080
So that we can reverse engineer
an understanding of high school

00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:30.030
to college and what
should good look like

00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:31.530
across the dimensions
of thinking

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:33.640
that really matter
in that layer.

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:35.460
DAVID BARRY: Great.

00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:38.020
Well, I think that does
it for my questions.

00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:40.440
So I think we could take
some audience questions.

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:43.560
There's a mic in the
back there, and we

00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:44.937
can form a line back there.

00:46:44.937 --> 00:46:46.770
Is there anything else,
I guess, while we're

00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:49.710
waiting that you'd
like to mention,

00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:53.160
or that we may have missed
in talking about Imbellus

00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:55.340
that you'd like to plug?

00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:59.780
REBECCA KANTAR: No, I think
that we're in good shape.

00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:02.246
DAVID BARRY: We'll give
it another few minutes.

00:47:02.246 --> 00:47:03.955
REBECCA KANTAR: Sure.

00:47:03.955 --> 00:47:06.330
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
collaborative problem solving.

00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:07.705
Does that mean
students are going

00:47:07.705 --> 00:47:10.810
to take the assessment at the
same time with other people?

00:47:10.810 --> 00:47:12.310
REBECCA KANTAR:
Yeah, good question.

00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:13.640
AUDIENCE: Or how does that work?

00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:15.310
REBECCA KANTAR: So this
is one of the newer skills

00:47:15.310 --> 00:47:17.050
that we're working
on, so I'd be lying

00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:18.640
if I said we had
it all figured out,

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:21.310
but I can tell you it's kind of
a graveyard of assessment space

00:47:21.310 --> 00:47:22.190
right now.

00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:25.810
So our vision is, look, it's not
practical to think about only

00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:27.970
using a chatbot to measure
a collaboration, which

00:47:27.970 --> 00:47:30.220
is what most folks to
date have tried to do,

00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:32.740
because it's not emblematic
of the kind of collaboration

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:34.570
that you actually do at work.

00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:38.066
So we're thinking, how do
you integrate, for example,

00:47:38.066 --> 00:47:40.630
a several course meal,
where, in one course,

00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:42.290
we're looking at
your personality,

00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:44.590
in another course
maybe we're having you

00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:47.500
do a questionnaire that you
self-report on what you think

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:49.870
of how you did in various
situations, what you learned

00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:51.970
in different environments,
what matters to you?

00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:53.920
Then maybe you're
doing a video call

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:56.560
and actually going through
one of our assessments

00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:58.880
with other people talking
about what's right,

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:01.660
what's wrong, how you're making
your way through processing

00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:02.770
the information.

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:05.290
And then we might put you
in your own environment

00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:08.080
where you're kind of playing
one on one with our game based

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:10.510
environment in our
virtual world and track

00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:12.070
how you incorporated
everything you

00:48:12.070 --> 00:48:14.110
learned before
everything you discussed.

00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:17.440
So that's just emblematic
of a totally different form

00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:18.070
of assessment.

00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:20.020
Can we use lots of
different vantage points

00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:22.030
to build a mosaic
of what you're like?

00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:24.430
But it's still very,
very early days

00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:26.170
for us to try and
figure out, how

00:48:26.170 --> 00:48:29.860
do you have multiple people
in an environment interacting?

00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:31.924
And how do you score that
without having humans?

00:48:31.924 --> 00:48:33.340
Because we all
know that, once you

00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:36.070
have humans scoring millions and
millions of kids' assessments,

00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:37.210
you have bias creeping in.

00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:40.214
You have people getting
tired at Friday at 5:00 PM

00:48:40.214 --> 00:48:42.130
when it's the last
assessment they're scoring,

00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:44.110
and that could have
an impact on scores.

00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:45.994
So how do we stick to
our core principles

00:48:45.994 --> 00:48:48.160
of, hey, this thing needs
to be remotely deployable,

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:49.710
it needs to measure
what matters,

00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:52.090
and it needs to be somewhat
engaging and interesting

00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:54.360
if you're going to have a
full conversation that's

00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:56.230
at all emblematic
of what you'd have

00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:58.930
on the job around the
assessment itself?

00:48:58.930 --> 00:49:01.090
So very early days,
but in general,

00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:03.503
that's kind of where we're
heading with collaboration.

00:49:03.503 --> 00:49:04.520
AUDIENCE: Thank.

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:06.520
DAVID BARRY: I have one
final question, I think.

00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:06.880
REBECCA KANTAR: Sure.

00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:08.588
DAVID BARRY: Or do
you have one, as well?

00:49:08.588 --> 00:49:09.510
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:10.910
DAVID BARRY: Well, in the
meantime, I'll ask this one.

00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:12.210
REBECCA KANTAR: Sure.

00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:13.710
DAVID BARRY: So I
think about people

00:49:13.710 --> 00:49:15.550
who prepare for, say,
the McKinsey interview,

00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:17.152
where it's a problem
solving question.

00:49:17.152 --> 00:49:19.360
If you do enough of those
brainteaser type questions,

00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:21.090
you start to get
an knack for it.

00:49:21.090 --> 00:49:23.700
So are you looking
at how people can

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:28.554
be conditioned to the Imbellus
test in trying to control for--

00:49:28.554 --> 00:49:30.720
basically make it so that
they cannot be conditioned

00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:31.800
and improve?

00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:37.380
Or is it more of a situation
where the time, and energy,

00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:40.240
and effort it takes to
get from the nothing state

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:42.330
to the prepared
state is less, so

00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:45.660
that people who don't have
the leisure time to prepare,

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:47.910
like they do now
for the SAT, aren't

00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:49.530
at some disproportionate
advantage?

00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:50.580
REBECCA KANTAR: So
I would actually

00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:52.590
flip it to say the goal
should be that it takes

00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:54.520
many, many years to prepare.

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.070
As in, you can't
do it last minute.

00:49:56.070 --> 00:49:57.780
That is definitely the ambition.

00:49:57.780 --> 00:49:59.361
And in the many
years of preparation,

00:49:59.361 --> 00:50:01.110
it's not that you need
to sit in our world

00:50:01.110 --> 00:50:02.460
and play through the same task.

00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:04.590
Just as you could get
better at something

00:50:04.590 --> 00:50:06.360
like chess not just
by playing chess,

00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:09.240
but by learning to do
abstract theoretical reasoning

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:12.030
and to memorize different
patterns, same idea here.

00:50:12.030 --> 00:50:14.370
So what we're trying
to do is force schools

00:50:14.370 --> 00:50:18.142
to embrace teaching to the
underlying sets of problems

00:50:18.142 --> 00:50:20.100
that involve a lot of
ambiguity, where you have

00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:22.890
to define the problem statement
and pursue different solutions,

00:50:22.890 --> 00:50:25.530
and you maybe don't know if
a solution is perfect or not.

00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:27.660
You have to respond to
feedback that you get.

00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:30.587
We want you to practice
those kinds of environments

00:50:30.587 --> 00:50:32.670
and getting comfortable
with, say, problem solving

00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:35.040
in those environments,
but not practice directly

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:35.800
in our assessment.

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:38.100
So we will publish a
few of our tasks online,

00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:40.020
and people can get
used to the UI,

00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:41.580
get used to the
game mechanics, get

00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:45.030
used to how the world works, but
not such that you can sit there

00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:46.920
and play for 50 hours.

00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:47.742
Not the goal.

00:50:47.742 --> 00:50:49.200
Because I don't
think anyone really

00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:50.790
defends that the
system should work

00:50:50.790 --> 00:50:53.410
that way, that you shouldn't
be able to prepare overnight.

00:50:53.410 --> 00:50:55.170
That's not the
intention of tests

00:50:55.170 --> 00:50:57.240
that are supposed to
reflect how well you've

00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:00.500
done in high school or your
aptitude for college and life,

00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:02.250
depending on which way
you see these tests

00:51:02.250 --> 00:51:03.390
kind of playing out.

00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:07.350
So for us, that's the underlying
driver of, can we make things

00:51:07.350 --> 00:51:09.880
challenging enough such that
maybe you learn broad brush

00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:12.660
strokes, the kinds of context
you're going to encounter,

00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:14.322
but you can't
memorize specifics.

00:51:14.322 --> 00:51:15.780
And spending more
time trying to do

00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:19.020
that versus focusing on just
developing a set of experiences

00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:21.390
and skills across your life
and your high school years

00:51:21.390 --> 00:51:22.620
would be futile.

00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:24.960
Think about us as
not necessarily being

00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:27.450
industry specific or
firm specific in terms

00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:29.310
of assessments, but
being skill specific.

00:51:29.310 --> 00:51:32.310
So if we were deploying an
assessment at Disney Pixar,

00:51:32.310 --> 00:51:34.920
for example, and we wanted
to measure creativity,

00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:36.990
because that doesn't
have any overlap--

00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:38.744
or maybe it has some,
but limited overlap

00:51:38.744 --> 00:51:41.160
with some of the skills that
we've been focused on to date

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:42.510
around problem solving--

00:51:42.510 --> 00:51:44.370
we would go out
and study what does

00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:46.770
it take to be successful in
those types of environments,

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:48.600
and what kinds of
skills are critical?

00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:51.075
And then build assessments
that are best fit for getting

00:51:51.075 --> 00:51:52.200
at those skills.

00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:55.320
But right now, we are still
in a phase of building

00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:58.050
the overall library of all
the assessments we would ever

00:51:58.050 --> 00:52:01.200
want to have, as opposed to just
deploying the same ones over

00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:03.600
and over, but there's
definitely a degree-- just

00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:06.330
like any other
assessments company,

00:52:06.330 --> 00:52:08.250
there is a degree
of generalizability

00:52:08.250 --> 00:52:11.250
and reusability of both the
assessments and the underlying

00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:11.820
skills.

00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:14.670
So problem solving might
be similar at McKinsey,

00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:17.550
as it would be in an
environment like medical school.

00:52:17.550 --> 00:52:19.080
We have to just
go ahead and look

00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:20.970
at what are the roles,
and what are the jobs,

00:52:20.970 --> 00:52:23.220
and what are the tasks
that people are doing.

00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:24.930
That should inform
the reusability

00:52:24.930 --> 00:52:26.820
of how we deploy
various assessments

00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:28.947
in different contexts.

00:52:28.947 --> 00:52:30.530
DAVID BARRY: And
then ultimately, say,

00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:33.040
looking at colleges,
would you say,

00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:37.300
if a college has X number of
English majors versus physics

00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:40.030
majors, is it going to be the
same sort of tailored approach

00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:42.880
where, in a physics
major, we're looking

00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:46.329
for these criteria or
this sort of [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:46.329 --> 00:52:47.870
REBECCA KANTAR: It's
a good question.

00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:50.290
I think it will somewhat
depend on how colleges want

00:52:50.290 --> 00:52:51.910
to work with us in the future.

00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:53.860
My guess is there's
always going to be demand

00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:58.480
for a very one size fits all
generic standardized test that

00:52:58.480 --> 00:52:59.980
goes between high
school and college

00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:02.170
simply because of the
imbalance between the number

00:53:02.170 --> 00:53:04.360
of applicants--
hundreds of thousands--

00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:07.760
versus the number of spots
at any of the elite colleges,

00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:09.692
and certainly en masse,
all of them together.

00:53:09.692 --> 00:53:11.650
So I don't think you're
ever going to move away

00:53:11.650 --> 00:53:13.990
from wanting to test
critical thinking,

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:17.080
standardized in some sense
that everyone agrees,

00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:19.870
yeah, these questions or
tests are emblematic of that.

00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:24.160
But perhaps there add ons
that one university has

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:25.600
more of an engineering
focus, say,

00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:27.250
somewhere like
Olin College, where

00:53:27.250 --> 00:53:29.560
people are doing very
application based learning.

00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:31.540
Maybe what they're
looking for is slightly

00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:34.210
different from a place
like Wash U, which

00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:36.730
is slightly different from
University of Florida.

00:53:36.730 --> 00:53:39.670
So starting to learn about what
their students are like, what

00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:41.780
it takes to be successful
there, and tailoring

00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:43.240
I think might happen
in the future,

00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:45.850
but probably after there's
a more standardized unit

00:53:45.850 --> 00:53:48.139
of problem solving, critical
thinking, creativity,

00:53:48.139 --> 00:53:49.930
collaboration, whatever
we can jam in there

00:53:49.930 --> 00:53:52.263
and kind of convince people
are necessary for the future

00:53:52.263 --> 00:53:53.439
of work.

00:53:53.439 --> 00:53:54.230
DAVID BARRY: Great.

00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:55.907
Well, thank you, Rebecca.

00:53:55.907 --> 00:53:57.240
Thank you, everyone, for coming.

00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:57.820
REBECCA KANTAR: Thank you.

00:53:57.820 --> 00:53:58.310
DAVID BARRY: Take care.

00:53:58.310 --> 00:53:59.434
One more round of applause.

00:53:59.434 --> 00:54:02.970
[APPLAUSE]
