00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.210
All right,
let's talk about similar triangles.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.530
Both of these triangles have
the exact same angles inside.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.200
They're both right triangles,

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.530
which means that one of their
angles is equal to 90 degrees.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.850
And then this top angle in triangle

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.080
B is equivalent to this
top angle in triangle A.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.860
And this bottom angle on the right
in Triangle B Is equivalent to

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.910
this bottom right angle on triangle A.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.490
The difference is that
the sides of this triangle

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.470
are twice as big as
the sides of this triangle.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.445
These two triangles
are called similar triangles.

00:00:38.445 --> 00:00:42.135
That means that the angles inside each
triangle have the same measure and

00:00:42.135 --> 00:00:45.115
their sides are in
proportion to each other.

00:00:45.115 --> 00:00:50.225
I can set up a proportion where I put
the side of triangle A in the numerator

00:00:50.225 --> 00:00:54.275
and the corresponding side of
triangle B in the denominator.

00:00:54.275 --> 00:00:58.770
So I'm comparing 2 to 4 and
I can set that equivalent to

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.860
A proportion of the other
legs of the triangles.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.150
But this says is that the ratios
of the corresponding legs

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.160
of the similar triangles
should be equivalent.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.418
So the ratio of 2 to 4 is the same
thing as the ratio of 3 to 6.

00:01:13.418 --> 00:01:16.050
2/4 = 1/2.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.110
And 3 over 6 also equals 1/2 and so we
see they are equivalent to each other.
