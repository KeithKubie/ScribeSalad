00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.130
Let's go through more
exponent examples.

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.850
So to warm up, let's think
about taking a fraction

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:06.640
to some power.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.220
So let's say I have
2/3, and I want

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.680
to raise it to the
third power here.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.180
Now, we've already
learned there are

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.040
two ways of thinking about this.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.792
One way is to say
let's take three 2/3's.

00:00:19.792 --> 00:00:26.751
So that's one 2/3, two
2/3's, and three 2/3's.

00:00:26.751 --> 00:00:29.236
So that's one, two, three, 2/3.

00:00:29.236 --> 00:00:31.224
And then we multiply them.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.670
And we will get-- let's
see, the numerator

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.600
will be 2 times 2
times 2, which is 8.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.660
And the denominator's
going to be 3 times 3 times

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.830
3 times 3, which is equal to 27.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.590
Now, the other way of viewing
this is you start with a 1,

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.740
and you multiply it
by 2/3 three times.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.950
So you multiply by 2/3
once, twice, three times.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.820
You will get the exact
same result here.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.800
So let's do one more
example like that.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.529
So lets say I had 4/9,
and I want to square it.

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:07.320
When I raise something
to the second power,

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.680
people often say,
you're squaring it.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.471
Also, raising something
to the third power,

00:01:10.471 --> 00:01:12.580
people sometimes say,
you're cubing it.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.950
But let's raise 4/9
to the second power.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:15.917
Let's square it.

00:01:15.917 --> 00:01:17.500
And I encourage you
to pause the video

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.910
and work this out yourself.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.180
Well, once again,
you could view this

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.810
as taking two 4/9's
and multiplying them.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.380
Or you could view this
as starting with a 1,

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.620
and multiplying it
by 4/9 two times.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.840
Either way, your
numerator is going

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.432
to be 4 times 4, which is 16.

00:01:37.432 --> 00:01:38.890
And your denominator
is going to be

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.110
9 times 9, which is equal to 81.
