00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
Whats up guys! We are back and today we're gonna try and experiment

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.900
making a pull tab, pyrotechnic.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.000
Now I found an US army handbook on Amazon

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.000
and as I started flipping through it I found a cool tutorial

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.900
on how to make a fuse igniter from a book of matches.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The idea being that you can start a fuse by the simple flick of a wrist

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.520
That seemed like a pretty dang cool experiment

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.000
so i played around with it and made a few modifications to make it even simpler and even more convenient.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.340
Now the materials for this experiment are very simple,

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.200
all we're going to need is a book of paper matches. I know back in the day

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.500
you could find these at gas stations and hotels

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.820
but I just went down to the grocery store where they sell them in large packs

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.760
of 50 for just a couple of bucks,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.940
you can't beat that.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.740
Now to kick things off we're gonna make just the igniter itself

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.900
from 1 single book of matches it's very easy and this is how it works.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.020
Go ahead and open your book of matches that'll reveal the 4 layers of matches inside.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.340
And if u grab on to the base and just give the cardboard a tug,

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.220
it'll separate of that staple and leave your book of matches in 2 different pieces.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.160
If you look at the base of of the matches you'll notice a little staple and that needs to come off,

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.960
you can use your fingernails, your teeth a pair of

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.820
pliers might be a better way to go or

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.960
you can just grab the two cardboard

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.519
bases at the bottom that matches and

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.650
give it a gentle tug. What we're going to do

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.000
next to take the actual cardboard

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.350
housing for the match folks we're going

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.580
to lay it down on the table so the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.560
striker strip is facing up then we're

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.119
going to take both edges and fold them

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.250
in toward the center until they meet in

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.170
the middle. The two edges of the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.000
cardboard should but up nicely against

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.140
each other now to hold them in place

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.430
let's just take a piece of electrical

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.630
tape and wrap it around where the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.869
striker strip would be on the inside.

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.250
Now you can see this forms a little funnel

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.689
shape where it's nice and open at the

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.880
top closes offer on the striker strip

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.200
and then pinches off and gets nice and

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.439
tight at the bottom. That's all we need to do with this piece for now so let's

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.090
set that to the side and move on to the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.250
matches next. Now working with our

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.049
matches is going to be even simpler, all

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.250
we have to do is take one of the sets

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.869
and lay it flat on the table and then

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.880
take both edges and fold them a little

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.680
past center so the cardboard folds up

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.869
into thirds, the matches will want to

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.430
unravel so to hold them in place takes

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.720
piece of tape and wrap it around the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.310
bundle about a quarter inch down from

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.320
the match head and that right there is

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.850
really about it all we have to do now is

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.619
take our bundle of matches insert it

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.509
down into the striker tube and fold it

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.369
all up. Now as you push the bundle of

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.020
matches down into the striker tube you

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.399
don't want to go too far you want the

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.229
heads of the matches to stop above the

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.030
stricker strip and you'll know you're there when

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.380
your bundle sticks out about a quarter

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.600
to half an inch. Now from here what we're

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.310
going to do is form a pull tab and to

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.330
do that we're just going to take the

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.430
top of the striker tube place our finger

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.260
right in the center and loop the tip

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.060
over until it wraps around and touches

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.130
the first piece of tape. Use another

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.660
piece of tape to hold the tip in place

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.980
and you'll end up with something looking

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.670
like this, a little pyrotechnics whistle.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.260
So check it out guys using nothing but a

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.000
book of paper matches and a little bit

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.620
of tape we create ourselves a really

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.540
cool-looking ring pool initiator,

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.090
the question is does it work? I based this off

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.950
the idea of a ring pull grenade and all

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.120
you have to do to activate it is stick

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.830
your finger through the loop grab the

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:47.820
base of the bundle firmly with your

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.060
other hand and pull it really is just as

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.739
simple as that and to get this thing to

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.420
ignite a fuse really is pretty simple as

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.310
well you can see when you pull the two

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.780
apart the friction from the striker

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.489
strip on the inside ignites all the

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.650
match heads at once, that delivers a lot

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.060
of heat and a lot of energy in one

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.519
single burst. I love the way these things

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:06.780
light off and with a little bit of

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.160
practice you can get them work every

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.050
time. Now I should mention that if you

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.819
wrap the casings on too tight it's going

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.260
to take a lot of force to pull them

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.120
apart but even just a little a bit of

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.590
friction will set them off but

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.329
conversely if you don't wrap them tight

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:19.620
enough there's a good chance that when

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.970
you pull them apart they don't let off

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.570
at all. Ha, fail. So I personally think it's

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:25.739
better to error on the side of caution

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.299
and wrap them a little bit tighter.

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.900
Alright, moving on for the fuses the kind

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.489
of fuse I like to use is called Visco

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.470
fuse, this is a safety firework fuse that

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.239
I got from a firework supply company. It

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:37.620
takes about a second in an open flame

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.630
for the stuff the light off to get this

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.310
stuff to light off with our pull-start

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.750
pyro, we only have to make one simple

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.820
modification and that's to tie a small

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.120
not in the top. Now to get the fuses to

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.320
work with our system all we have to do

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.940
is take the knotted end and stick it at

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.280
the top of our match heads on the bundle

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.570
and start rolling it up from the side

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.609
Once we've got it all rolled up you're

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:57.600
going to notice that makes a nice little

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.060
pyrotechnics bouquet of match heads with

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.950
the knotted piece on top and once we

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.030
put a little bit of tape around here

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.440
we'll be able to tug on that to fuse and

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.810
the knot will not slide through. Now go

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.010
ahead and make the striker casing like

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.239
you did before but this time take the

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.829
end of your fuse and push it through

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.470
first. Now you can go ahead and wrap the

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.940
loop back into position the same way we

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.070
did before and our pull string fuse

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.560
igniter is complete. So I'm going to put

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.100
it to the test for you so we can see how

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.520
it works. See, look at that I can't

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.870
even get my barbecues igniter to light

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.190
anyway but that's okay because we've got pull-start-ignition. Glasses on for

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.890
safety. So theoretically we stick our

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.660
finger on the loop grab onto the other side and pull.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.940
Whooo! Yeah!

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.420
You see my hand just pulling off that sheath thing and

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.250
there goes one match lights it looks

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.020
like it like the other one and then

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.300
within about a seconds or less the fuse

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.050
lights off. So it looks like if the error on

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.340
the side of making them a little bit

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.930
tighter there's a higher chance that

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.550
your handle will break off but a lot

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.840
higher chance that your fuse will

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.700
actually ignite as well. I love this stuff.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.860
The fuse worked guys! That was

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.600
amazing that's really good news, that's

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.190
very encouraging, let's try that again!

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.230
What I'm actually really curious to know

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.720
is how slowly can we pull this thing and

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.520
still have a go off. I'm gonna pull it

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.140
extremely slowly lets see what happens

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.580
Feeling quite a bit of tension right now.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.540
Whoa!

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.540
That worked!

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.860
And the match just fell off but they're still going

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.450
but that definitely worked, that definitely worked.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.150
And you see the match heads light off,

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:42.180
and within a fraction of a second the fuse lights off as well. That gets hot really fast guys.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.280
Sweet!

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.560
Dang look how bright that fire is!

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.160
That really does send off a shower of sparks, doesn't it?

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.600
That's what I'm talking about there. And that is

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.680
success, I love to see things work!

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.160
So, there you have it guys apparently with a

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:01.819
simple book of paper matches and a

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:03.379
little bit of tape, we now have the power

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:05.539
to ignite pyrotechnics with a flick of a

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:09.259
finger. Whoa! Hey, thanks for joining me

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:10.789
