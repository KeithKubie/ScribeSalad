00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:06.500
This is the fictional planet Nibiru which
has been predicted to slam into Earth, resulting

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.040
in the end of the world.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.360
The scenario is known to doomsayers as the
Nibiru cataclysm.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.150
It was allegedly supposed to have occurred
several times over the last decade but most

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.160
recently in April of 2018.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.100
Needless to say... it didn't happen.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.000
Even though planetary collisions aren't widely
observed today, it's believed they were once

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.929
pretty common and they left lasting impacts
on the planets in our solar system and beyond.

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:42.440
Uranus is thought to have been a victim of
a major collision.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.400
Billions of years ago an object, at least
twice the mass of Earth, crept up a little

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.539
too close to young Uranus, and the two bodies
slammed into each other with great force.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.520
Researchers say the cataclysmic collision
was so strong it caused

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.400
Uranus to shift onto its side.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.360
This theory would explain why the planet has
an axial tilt of nearly 98 degrees which is

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.060
far more dramatic than the rest of the solar system.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.760
Fortunately, Uranus managed to maintain the
majority of its atmosphere

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.880
so it's still around today.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.160
However, not all planetary masses survive
impacts on this scale.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.860
Earth is thought to have been at the center
of a catastrophic

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.820
collision that destroyed another planet.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.310
The Giant Impact Hypothesis - aka The Big
Splash or the Theia Impact - suggests that

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:40.430
an object about the size of Mars moved towards
Earth more than four billion years ago.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.060
It then slammed into our protoplanet and vaporized
on impact.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.200
The theory claims that debris from the decimated
planet was pulled into Earth's orbit and

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.350
over time, the pieces are thought to have
clumped together, eventually forming the Moon.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.820
While this is estimated to have happened a
really long time ago, there are some planetary

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.090
collisions that are thought to have occurred
a lot more recently.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.370
Within the last few thousand years, it's believed
two planets orbiting a young star were involved

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.750
in a violent, catastrophic collision.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.120
The impact annihilated the smaller planet,
sending its remains far into space in the

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.360
form of vaporized rock and metal.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.830
Since this was a relatively recent collision,
some of the remains are still present and

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.950
in 2009 NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope found
evidence of the impact.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.260
It detected traces of silicon monoxide gas
- a product of a vaporized planetary crust.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.959
Scientists believe the findings help back
up the Giant Impact Hypothesis.

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.700
So could history repeat itself?

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.710
Could a planet ever collide with Earth?

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.220
Scientists say it's highly unlikely.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.950
While large-scale collisions were prevalent
when our solar system was young, it would

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.280
be extremely rare for one to occur in a stable
and established system like our own.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.210
On top of that, if a planet were to come remotely
close enough to threaten Earth, astronomers

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.600
would be able to spot it years, if not decades,
before impact.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.500
So, it's safe to say, we don't have to worry
about a rogue planet obliterating our existence

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.740
- well at least not in our lifetime.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.760
