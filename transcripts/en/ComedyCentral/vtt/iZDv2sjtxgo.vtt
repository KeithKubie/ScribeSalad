HAD A WEIGHT PROBLEM.

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:14.414
MY DOCTORS SAY THAT
IT'S BECAUSE I EAT TOO MUCH,

00:00:16.283 --> 00:00:18.785

- IT'S A MUZZLE...
- MM-HMM.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.406
- THAT WORKS ON A TIME LOCK

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:42.409
SO THAT YOU CAN'T EAT
BETWEEN MEALS.

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:45.479
- OH, OKAY.
SO IT'S FOR PEOPLE?

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:47.014

00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:52.986

OF THE TIME OF THE DAY,

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.688
YOUR MOUTH IS COVERED OVER
BY THIS--

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:57.024
BY A MUZZLE?

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:59.793
- YOU HATE IT?

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:01.628
- WHO CARES WHAT I THINK?

00:01:01.662 --> 00:01:03.864
THE IMPORTANT THING
IS THAT YOU KNOW

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:06.099
THAT YOU ARE WORTH $1 MILLION.

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.501

- ALL RIGHT.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.108
- SEE YOU OUT THERE
ON THOSE COALS, OKAY?

00:01:15.142 --> 00:01:16.109
- OKAY.

00:01:16.143 --> 00:01:17.845
- NOW, I WANT ALL OF YOU

00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:19.479
TO CLOSE YOUR EYES.

00:01:19.513 --> 00:01:22.816
THERE'S ONE THING
EACH OF YOU BROUGHT HERE TODAY--

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.485
YOUR MILLION-DOLLAR IDEA.

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:28.155
THIS IS WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA SHOUT OUT

00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:33.126
AS YOU WALK
ACROSS THOSE HOT COALS.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.895
- EXCUSE ME.

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:37.497
WERE WE SUPPOSED TO COME HERE
WITH A MILLION-DOLLAR IDEA

00:01:37.531 --> 00:01:40.200
ALREADY IN MIND?
- YEAH.

00:01:40.234 --> 00:01:42.836
IT'S--IT'S THE HEART
OF "WEALTHNASTICS."

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.172
- THIS IDEA--

00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:47.508
- OH, GOD.
OKAY.

00:01:47.541 --> 00:01:50.677
LUCILLE HAD GIVEN ME A PACKET OF
INFORMATION ABOUT THIS SEMINAR

00:01:50.711 --> 00:01:52.713
BUT DID NOT INSIST
THAT I READ IT.

00:01:52.746 --> 00:01:55.315
HER NEGLIGENCE PUT ME
IN A TERRIBLE POSITION.

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:56.750
JUST THINK OF IT, JUST THINK
OF IT, JUST THINK OF IT.

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:58.852
JUST SAY IT.
JUST SAY--JUST SAY ONE THING.

00:01:58.886 --> 00:02:02.055
I--A TOILET
THAT CAN FLUSH ITSELF

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:04.091
OR A TOILET--A TOILET
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SIT ON.

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:07.194
OR A BATHROOM--WHY--
