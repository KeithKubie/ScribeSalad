Speaker 1:          00:00          No

Speaker 2:          00:02          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:05          now. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:07          [inaudible] no, I listen to radio [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:19          I'll continue with here. Report the first large scale study comparing the prevalence of absolute pitch them to normal populations by means professors. Professor Diana Deutsch. Diana Deutsch, right? Yeah. I'm going to turn down my head from Neverland Fan. I'm a professor of psychology at the University of California San Diego. Can you still hear me, Diane? Okay. Hello Diana.

Speaker 3:          00:38          Studies sound how humans perceive sound. She's a scientist. She has a lab, but every so often she will also release cds, right? These a cds of audio demonstrations that she uses in her research and that's why we called because it was in the production of her second CD that she stumbled onto the weirdest phenomenon. Well,

Speaker 1:          00:58          when you do post production is as you know of of of speech, you look things, look things, look things so that you can zero in on piece. Cool. That sound too loud. Nita? Unpopular ss. That sounds too sharp and so on. So you put things on loops in order to fine tune the way the speech sounds. So I had this particular phrase on a loop and forgot about it. What phrase was this? It's a phrase that occurs at the beginning of the CD in which I say the sounds as they appear to you. I'm not any different from those that are really present, but they sometimes behave so strangely as to seem quite impossible, quite impossible. Now, I had some hospital so strangely looped the sounds as they appear to you are not only different from those that are really present, but they sometimes behave so strangely sometimes behave so strangely. Just those few words sometimes behave so strangely and forgot about sometimes behave so strangely, sometimes behave so strange.

Speaker 3:          02:05          So here's what happened. Diana leaves her studio, she closes the door, it goes into the kitchen to make some tea. All the wild. This loop is wearing away in the background and she's sipping her tea. She thinks

Speaker 1:          02:15          sometimes if someone's singing strangely who's singing? I heard what sounded like song and my background shoe. That's, wait a second, that's not singing. That's me talking that very phrase strangely, but at this point sometimes behave so straight here to be sung rather than spoken strangely sometimes behave so strangely. This is sometimes being so strange, right? You still hear the words but they're some words rather than spoken words. It's weird like it just switches at a certain point, three or four repetitions in, right? It's going, it's going and then pow becomes music and then now, now none of us can get it out of our head. Like the whole office is like sometimes VA's so strange

Speaker 3:          03:00          sometimes ca so strangely.

Speaker 1:          03:02          And you know what if you do this demo and then you go back to the original sentence that sounds like you know speech to begin with and when you come to that very phrase as seemed to be bursting into song the sounds as they appear to you and not only different from those that are really present, but they sometimes behave so strangely as to seem quite impossible. I have to say, this can continue for months and months. I sort of sort of like your brain gets altered for that particular phrase and it, and it continues to sound like singing for a very, very long time. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          03:43          all right, so here we have just one small indication that music is crazy. Well, it behaves very strangely, right? I mean, think about this. We started with some basic speech, repeated it a few times. Somewhere along the way it leaped into song strangely. How did it change like that and if that's all it takes to turn something into music. And what exactly is music? Sometimes we, there's some strange thing. This is Radiolab. Today's program is about answering that question or trying to, in any case, I'm Jad Abumrad here with me. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom and Z. Robert Krulwich, my partner in crime. It was a little hard to get out of your head. I know. It is really cool. I know. Yeah. Okay, so this hour, what are we doing? We are going to try and we will probably fail. Yes, we will fail, but we will make an earnest effort to try to find the ingredients of music. Both its basis in languages basis in physics as basis in your brain will look everywhere we can software trying to find out what music is made of and why it touches us so intimately straight and touches us. Sometimes not in a good way. If you've ever had this experience of going to a concert, hearing some music and it just made you upset for some reason, like irrationally upset, right?

Speaker 1:          05:03          Almost like you want to hurt someone.

Speaker 3:          05:05          If that rings a bell, there's a segment later in the show you will not want to miss.

Speaker 4:          05:13          Ah,

Speaker 3:          05:14          this is Radiolab. Stick around. Hey, be hey. Oh

Speaker 4:          05:26          Eh, the

Speaker 3:          05:33          I completely messed up. All right. Shall we start? Sure. Well first, thanks to the LaGuardia High School Chorus and Robert Apostle, they were the voices you just heard. We hear more of them later. So let's explore a little bit more closely this connection between language and music. Yes. You think of them as separate.

Speaker 1:          05:50          Great.

Speaker 3:          05:51          The thing is they're really closely related. So as neuroscientists, mark, Jude tremble when we speak, we sing,

Speaker 5:          05:58          you know how to use the pitch of your voice to convey emotion and meaning. Like, um, I went to the store just because I raised the pitch, the note, if you will, you interpret that as an interrogative, a monotonic speech, you know, talking at the same rate and rhythm in the same pitch and loudness. I mean that is not how humans talk,

Speaker 1:          06:25          but humans talking to all kinds of different ways in different languages. Each language has its own musical personality. German is different than French is different than Swahili. And if you look at those differences closely, there are all kinds of things we can learn about music. Tick Diana Deutsch. Okay. She's recently been looking at tone languages, just published her results and the results are startling. Diana, before we start, what exactly is it? Tone language. Okay. In tone languages, words take on different meanings depending upon the tones in which they are annunciated. For example, Mandarin has four tones and the word mar in Mandarin means mother in the first tone. Hampton, the second CHONe horse in the third tone. And a reproach in the fourth tone. Could you say them name? Would you like me to? Yeah cause you didn't, I thought you were well up. You know I have them on CD but I'd rather hear you say them well. Um, okay. So excuse my bad pronunciation that our trial means Martha Ma means hemp Ma means horse and Ma is a reproach. Huh? So conceivably if you screwed up the tones you could call your Mama Horse. Yes indeed. In fact, there are quite a lot of jokes where westerners who don't speak the tone is right, say terrible things. And utilizing Hong Kong you have to be very careful where you will shout at shit half long. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          08:05          see this is the basic difference in English. We don't really worry about pitch. We can see our words up here or down here or glisten it up or bended down in and it's all the same. Not so with tone languages. In any case, this is where it gets interesting. One day Diana is working with some mandarin speakers and she notices something. There were these words, these words that they would say where they would all hit precisely the same note with their voices, not just close to one another either. Exactly. Precisely and consistently the same,

Speaker 1:          08:41          even on different days. In fact, would you like me to play for you one person reciting a list of 12 mandarin tones on two different days? Yeah, definitely. First you have the first words spoken on Day one, followed by the same word spoken in day two. Then you have the second word spoken on Day one, jaw followed by the same word spoken day two, so on and that way he, you can see the consistency is going to appear as though the words are being repeated immediately. In fact, the repetitions occur in entirely different days. So each of those word pairs came out of the mouth. One person separated by like 24 hours. Oh, much more than that. Um, something like a week really. And it was a remarkable consistency. Jean Jean will, there'll be like a sing the word mom always at this note right here. Mom. Mom, mom. Well, I concluded that basically this was a form of perfect page.

Speaker 6:          09:46          Yeah. [inaudible] pouch on the [inaudible] junk, which I've never quite understood what perfect pitch is to be honest. You, you don't know what that is. No. Should I, and I know I should, but it's whispered to me as a musician growing up, uh, perfect pitches like that. It's like the thing, it's like the,

Speaker 3:          10:08          anything you wish you had that none of us have. Basically. It's like having a tuning fork in your brain here. I'll, I'll give you an analogy. Yeah. Okay. You see this a Coffee Cup I'm holding? Yeah. What color is it? Brown. And you knew that how few of my eyes, right? You didn't need me to put this Brown Coffee Cup next to my blue jeans. No, I didn't know to see the Brown. I mean it's absolute brown. Absolute Brown. Perfect pitch. People have that with pitch. They hear a pitch. They knew exactly what note it is. The rest of us have to run this

Speaker 1:          10:39          piano. So if the hero thing from an elevator, can they name the note? Yeah, that's exactly it. Anything with a pitch like a horn honk, they could tell you that horn is enough. Or those church bells, they're alternating between B flat and B, and if the faucet were dripping, they could say that faucet is dripping in a d sharp. They don't even have to think about it. They just know it used to be that the note names would jump out at me. Diana Deutsch is actually one of these lucky people to the extent that it would even be a nuisance. And why? Why is that good?

Speaker 3:          11:14          Well, it's really rare. It only happens like once every 10,000 people here in America. Europe. Yeah, man. Turning your tongue into a, you call them and have the people who have it. Yeah. Well, let's see how many, how should I say this? If you look in your music history textbook, so you will see that every famous composer like the really big ones, right?

Speaker 1:          11:35          [inaudible] Mozart,

Speaker 2:          11:43          [inaudible], Beethoven, [inaudible],

Speaker 1:          11:49          they all had it where really Mendelson, the list goes on on. So if

Speaker 3:          11:54          you have perfect pitch on some level, you are closer to them.

Speaker 2:          12:02          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          12:03          he's got the gift. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          12:07          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          12:08          Danielle, let's get back to Diana Deutsch. Okay. Okay. Let's talk about your latest experiment. That's the one I'm really interested in. Okay. You see, you compare Chinese kids to American kids to see who has perfect pitch more. So the, explain how this works. You had a group of Chinese music students, air group who have American music students at the Eastman School of music here in New York. You played them a bunch of notes, I imagine in a room and ask them to guess what those notes were right now. How did that work exactly?

Speaker 1:          12:35          Well, the test consisted of piano tones, which began on the c below middle c it says note and extended up three octaves or the way to the that note. That's a big range. Yeah. 36 notes. Can you demonstrate you're sure? Yes. Here is six tones,

Speaker 7:          12:57          Eh,

Speaker 3:          13:00          such as where given in the test. So you would have played those notes to both sets of kids and asked them to name the notes without going to the piano. What were the notes? Really what these notes were?

Speaker 1:          13:12          D E g shock, c sharp, d sharp. And g. Um, what were the results? Well, it turns out the Chinese group far outperformed the eastern group of those students who started musical training at ages four and five 74% of the Chinese group show perfect pitch, but 14% of the u s [inaudible] 74%, the Beijing group was nine times roughly more likely to show perfect pitch than the American Jesus. That's a split as American group. Daggering difference. It's a staggering difference.

Speaker 8:          13:48          Mm.

Speaker 6:          13:50          And it's your hunch that the difference is because they speak a tone language.

Speaker 1:          13:55          That's my hat. I mean the, it's, it's known that the first year of life say from eight, six months up to, you know, a little pastor the year infants learn features of their native language. This is a very, very important stage. Let's suppose that tone and the absolute pitch of tones is a feature which is potentially available to anyone. Babies who are exposed only to an international language such as English and not given the opportunity to acquire tones, then they're going to be at a real disadvantage when they come later on to learn to take wizard lessons.

Speaker 3:          14:46          So you think that as they're a data data, let me ask this. As they're learning their language, which includes inherently music to some degree, they are essentially learning two languages as they learn one.

Speaker 1:          14:59          Is that right? It's a matter of fact. If you take the first tone [inaudible] it's a flat tone. It's really sung. Yeah. Compared with English speech, it's really more like song.

Speaker 3:          15:10          That's what that's always been sort of the stereotype of the Chinese languages. It's very sort of sing songs.

Speaker 1:          15:16          Yes. One Boomi soy mean Guido home bow share, Lambo, Shirley bow shoe for example, the third child in Mandarin Ma. It's sort of like a j type pattern. The second term, which is a gentle output glace ma the fourth toe, which is a rapid downward place. Ma. I mean these are all kinds of musical relationships. Yeah. Given the evidence on absolute pitch, one could speculate further and say, well, may be other features of music are also enhanced for individuals who start off learning tone language.

Speaker 3:          15:50          So, so the, here's my big question, could this explain the experience that I had? And I think a lot of people have this experience when they're taking music lessons and playing a little piddly

Speaker 1:          16:01          pieces like flares, Yamaka,

Speaker 1:          16:05          and here are these Chinese girls, right? Her playing rough Monona you know, the brilliant, yeah. Is this why? Well, I, I think it's a viable hypothesis. I mean evidently it could be something else. It could be something else going on. No, go ahead. I mean, one could argue that instead it might be genetic and so on, but they're seen as such a, it's such a boring theory, like always a boring theory. And furthermore, we don't have to assume that knowing what we do about exposure to tone language in very early childhood as a, as a, it's just not fair. And I think we can look at it another way around here. We have a faculty that had been thought to be confined to a few rare individuals who are just extraordinarily gifted, right? That might in fact be available to any individual provided they're given the right exposure, attic critical period. And that raises the question of what are the sorts of abilities could be brought out if we only knew just what to do. There may be much more human potential than we had realized.

Speaker 9:          17:34          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          17:35          Diana Deutsch is a professor of music psychology at the University of San Diego, music psychology, music psychology, and as I mentioned earlier, she's also the releaser of two cds. Yeah. Yes. Two CDs, one's called musical illusions and paradoxes, and the other one is called Phantom words and other curiosities. What would you put on a CD? Exactly. She puts these little audio pieces that she uses in her research. The stuff I guess that she will play to subjects as she tests them and she puts these on cds because they're kind of fun to listen to you. This is like an ear test or sort of, we've actually put a couple on our website. Well, what do they sound like? We just it that little sample. All right. I'll get some samples though. There is the chromatic illusion. Ken has a carnival feel to it. There's also the a Cambiado illusion.

Speaker 10:         18:25          Oh, the can be.

Speaker 3:          18:28          And of course the phantom word experiments. [inaudible] none of those pieces are gonna make any kind of sense unless you visit our website, radiolab.org where all will be explained

Speaker 4:          18:51          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          18:52          coming up, fashionable French ladies and elegant dresses threw things at innocent musicians. I'm Jad, I'm from Rodan, me, maybe not so innocent. [inaudible] which, and I will continue in a moment. You're listening to radio live from New York public radio. B u. N. N. P. R. Sorry.

Speaker 2:          19:21          Right

Speaker 11:         19:23          baby [inaudible] so speeding. [inaudible] some.

Speaker 2:          19:31          Ah,

Speaker 11:         19:43          hey, so Steve's the south.

Speaker 2:          19:50          So

Speaker 11:         19:52          was the hey solos. [inaudible] sorry.

Speaker 2:          20:01          [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         20:02          baby. Hey [inaudible] sound [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          20:17          this is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich. Ah, program today is about music. What it is, how it works and what we want to do next. Did we want to, we want to stay on the subject, but we're going to explore this a little more deeply. Take a closer look at the connection between language and music. We're gonna add touch, touch, and that will take us to the ear, the ear, and then into the brain, the brain. And then to the big question, the really big question, why does music or how does music become a feeling? The

Speaker 12:         20:48          feeling, why do we get such deep pleasure or deep pain? We will. They have pain coming up to all simply because it air pressing against your ear. All right. We're first. All right, well there is a psychology professor I want you to meet at Stanford who directs the Center for Infants Studies. There in front old's is her name and she got it into her head that there is a kind of deep universal music inside language.

Speaker 13:         21:15          She discovered it actually at a hospital. The Max Planck Institute in Munich has an obstetrics unit which is very popular among expectant mothers. Mothers came from the war. It's if this German hospital then so they were Turkish. They were Greek, they were Sicilian. They were the so called guest workers and the German society. Of course, I didn't understand a word of what they spoke. As soon as they put the baby down and no longer had the physical contact, bodily contact with the child, they started to sing almost in one language after another. Given the babies. I heard these, I heard them use these melodies Russian now to reach, to reach the child to remain in touch with the baby Yiddish for a period. So next day I brought my tape

Speaker 12:         22:08          quarter ham for an old, took her tape recorder from that hospital and traveled all over the world recording parents as they talk to their very little babies. And it didn't matter whether the parents spoke a romance language or a tone language everywhere she went below the word, she heard consistently the same melodies. For example, I'll start with approval. When a parent wanted to praise a child, we would ask the parents to show the baby they were happy. Good boy. Now you got it. Just using their voice. Show him you're happy with that.

Speaker 14:         22:43          I taught that. He got, he get that I Gardy [inaudible] Portuguese

Speaker 12:         22:53          bungalow. And what these things had in common was that the melody was a kind of a of a rise fall. Um, good girl. Hi Girl. Got It. Yeah. Good girl sweetie. It doesn't matter what words the parents are saying. It's always really about this melody and why that particular melody. All she knows is that it worked. There's something about this melody that that piece,

Speaker 13:         23:23          just the child doing something. There are, she says other categories that she discovered. Now with a prohibition. In contrast, your goal is to stop the child from doing something. The category that says stop quite a different melody. It's short, it's sharp in musical terms, it's the Kotto,

Speaker 12:         23:42          but I bet there is the category. Look, pay

Speaker 13:         23:46          attention to that. No, this frequently use rising pitch. Look Sweetie, they frequently use higher pitch at Unicorn. So far, Anne Fernald has found four universal melodies that praise, that stop and call attention and of course the melody that comforts [inaudible] and while this may seem obvious to you, if you think about it, this is music that is understood by infants who are just new in the world, but we all know what it means. We all know these songs. We we're used to thinking of sounds as being about something. Speeches always about something, but it feels to me more like touch.

Speaker 4:          24:31          [inaudible]

Speaker 13:         24:32          touch isn't about something. If you whack me on the arm in a sudden sharp way, I'm going to be startled or a gentle touch has a different effect. And I think, you know, actually sound is kind of touch at a, at a distance.

Speaker 12:         24:53          I was in for an old director of the center for infant studies at Stanford and when Anne says sound is more like touch, that turns out to be literally the case. This is something I learned from a friend of mine, Jonah Lehrer. Um, my name's Jonah Lehrer with this very moment is working on a book, an upcoming book on art and science on the connection between art and science. Do we own it? Do we have a name for that book? It's called Proust was a neuroscientist. Okay. Ansys Jonah, thinking about sound as touch more like touch, I asked him, how does sound get into or, or touch your brain, take us on that journey. It's just waves of vibrating air. Um, it's just your voice

Speaker 13:         25:40          hatch at a, at a

Speaker 15:         25:42          beginning. Your voicebox compresses air, not air travel through space and time

Speaker 12:         25:49          into my hair. The little ton of waves of diffuse vibrating here focused and channeled into my eardrum, which vibrates a few very small bones and the little bones transmit the vibration into this salty seat

Speaker 16:         26:08          where the hairs are and the hair cells are fascinating. The hair cells become active when they are literally bent by weight.

Speaker 4:          26:18          [inaudible]

Speaker 16:         26:18          Ben like trees and a breeze. And when these hair cells are banned,

Speaker 12:         26:24          charged molecules,

Speaker 13:         26:27          blood inwards and activate the cell.

Speaker 12:         26:32          So the sound triggers the bones, the bones disturbs the fluid, the fluid rocks the hairs. Yes. And then the heres set off essentially electricity. Yes. That's the language of neurons. All those changes from waves to bones to electricity. All those things were a trip on their way to being heard. It's only when the electricity finally forms a pattern in your brain. Only when it's deep inside. That's when you hear something.

Speaker 3:          27:04          That's okay. If it feels to me more like touch sound is kind of touch at a, at a distance.

Speaker 2:          27:16          Uh, [inaudible].

Speaker 12:         27:35          All right. Now that we have gotten a sound and any sound into our heads, let me ask you the next really big question. Okay. Why do some sound and let's make it music. Okay. Why does music make so many of us so often feel

Speaker 3:          27:49          so strongly? Yeah. Like in terms of what we were just listening to, like how does all that electricity from the ear going up to the brain in the next millisecond become a feeling? Yeah. Well, let me introduce you to someone martyred. Trey Mo actually we heard from him earlier. He's a neuroscientist. I'm in the Department of Neurology at Harvard Medical School and mark can at least begin to answer this question, this feeling question. He's done something really interesting. He's able to listen to the electricity as it pools in the ear and shoots up this big fat nerve to the brain. It's um, it's kind of a, a popping sound. He can actually listen to that nerve to the electricity so faster than I'm able to do here with my fingers.

Speaker 17:         28:36          [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         28:37          is that a, is that the sounds when it sounds like, how did they get, how do they get this sounds? I actually have no idea. I guess I sort of tap into the nerve. This is the sound of sound entering the brain. Yes. This is the sound of sound entering the brain as electricity and little pulses. And as you can hear, the electricity has a meter, but mark is discovered is that when the electricity entering your brain is even and regular, regular. This is the baggage should wait

Speaker 17:         29:09          [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         29:09          yeah, that's regular. Right. When the meter of the electricity is regular and rhythmic,

Speaker 3:          29:14          it will arrive in our mind and be heard by us as a sound that we generally like,

Speaker 12:         29:19          like this nice sound that

Speaker 3:          29:25          in music is known as a perfect fit. The inputs coming from a perfect fifth

Speaker 17:         29:30          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          29:31          [inaudible] is very, very regular like a metronome. However, and here's where it gets interesting. When the meter going from the year two, the brain is irregular, jagged a with make unpredictable. Let

Speaker 12:         29:42          me hear it. This is jagging in here. Oh, Jagan which,

Speaker 17:         29:51          oh

Speaker 12:         29:51          yeah, that's true. Yeah. And what mark has discovered is that when electrical impulses like that travel from the ear to the brain, they will become heard by us, by our mind as a sound that we generally don't like, like that. Don't care for that one. That's a minor second. The inputs coming from a minor second

Speaker 17:         30:08          again

Speaker 12:         30:10          is very, very chaotic. Okay, so let me just sum up here what I think you're, you're saying if a sound entering my brain is disorderly and unexpected, electrically speaking, electrically speaking, then that would make me feel uncomfortable. Yeah. And if it comes in in a familiar and orderly way, that will make me feel comfortable. There does seem to be a relationship between the kind of electricity as sound producers and how we feel about that sound. Do they have like fancy names for this? Well, that's a minor second. That thing you just said, but did the scientists have names for pleasant and unpleasant? A continent is pleasant. Dissonant is unpleasant. That's not a science name. That's a music name. Oh, okay. And these are fixed positions in your ear. Wow. Meet with me. Be Fixed for scientists. But you know, maybe let me just propose this to you and what people find pleasing. What people find painful is malleable. I'll tell you why. I'm going to tell you a story now. The true story. It involves a musician, ego, Stravinsky, who is now considered to be one of the great composers of the 20th century, if not the most important composer of the 20th century. That's Jonah layer again. And Jonah tells the story of two concerts one year apart in the same city, the exact same piece of music, the audience who heard it first and then the audience, or heard it later on her totally different things.

Speaker 16:         31:44          So let's begin first at Jonah. How does this, um, just set the scene? This is May, 1913 to spring night. It's a, it's a balmy summer night. Black Tie costumes. The women have their fedoras. This was evening clothes. Yeah. Well this was the Russian ballet. This was high art. And the programs had, this is a concert about springtime, but as they settled into their seats, right?

Speaker 12:         32:10          Turns out that what Stravinsky had in mind was not spring like honeybees. No. The spring Stravinsky had in mind was about change, about radical change, ritual murder. Literally, that's what the story of the play is. It's, it's a pagan ritual where the end, the virgin gets massacred. Oh dear.

Speaker 2:          32:34          [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         32:35          but the music itself is fascinating. The beginning is this very charming

Speaker 16:         32:40          bassoon. It's a classic Lithuanian folk tune and it does sound like the earth is warming and that lasts for about a minute and then we get some Tutti of flutes and it's lovely. It's getting a little more disturbing and then about three minutes into it

Speaker 8:          33:07          [inaudible]

Speaker 18:         33:07          everything changes. [inaudible]

Speaker 16:         33:17          there's this, there's just an earthquake. Stravinsky plays this cord

Speaker 18:         33:24          [inaudible]

Speaker 16:         33:24          there's a great story that went the Aga lab, who's the head of the ballet roost first heard this court entrance because playing on the piano for him, he asked Stravinsky, how long will it go on like that? And Stravinsky looked at him and said to the end, my dear, and it literally does that chord structures, the music, it's one of the most difficult sounds you've ever heard. It is. It is just the stereotype of desinence. It is. It hurts you, Huh? Well what happened? Well, after about three minutes they ride. They ride it meaning what? Like they screamed or through, they screamed. There was blood. Old Ladies were hitting each other with Keynes. One lady on lady should've gotten hit Stravinsky with a cane. But once they started screaming, Stravinsky ran backstage and by some counselors crying, Nijinsky was off on the side of the stage screaming to his dancers to keep the beat. Dude. Wow. Quite the fiasco. And the question is why?

Speaker 12:         34:33          Well, this is the feeling question. Why so much feeling about a piece of music that, why did they arrive? You would think that they ride it because they were hot because they didn't like those towns because they did. They thought those dancers were making strange and odd gestures. Lo Jonah offers a different theory. Let me put it this way. This ride has been talked about and written about for forever. But to the best of our knowledge, no one has ever tried to explain what happened that night through the lens of, um, brain chemistry, brain chemistry. Yeah. What music can do to a brain. You know, if you try to imagine yourself or all you've heard is [inaudible]

Speaker 16:         35:16          even or, and, and the great romanticism of 19th century user,

Speaker 12:         35:25          um, and then all of a sudden you get debt.

Speaker 18:         35:30          [inaudible].

Speaker 16:         35:31          These are noises you've never heard before.

Speaker 12:         35:34          It's all very new, but scientists are beginning. Figure out what

Speaker 3:          35:38          happens in our brain when we hear noises we've never heard before, especially dissonant noises, refine that chords. Musical chords that are typically judged to be dissonant, elicit these wild fluctuations in brain activities is Yon Fishman. He is a neuroscientist and he studies those wild fluctuations in the brain on an area of the brain called the auditory cortex. Let's zoom in to the auditory cortex for a moment because this is basically hearing central and when you're listening to music, there are all kinds of neurons during all kinds of things. One gang in particular that yarn is interested in. That's right. The gang that he suspects gets very agitated when it hears sounds like these

Speaker 4:          36:30          [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          36:31          These neurons might be the new noise department because he thinks their job is to take every new strange unordered unpredictable noise that comes into the brain. Figure it out, find the pattern. There are groups of neurons whose sole job it is. This is how Jonah puts it to turn that dissonant note, dissect it, take it apart and try to understand it. We are pattern searching animals and this is how Yon Fishman puts it. And so at the level of the auditory Cortex, the brain has this daunting task of having to be able to disentangle this complex mixture of sound. Most of the time those neurons in the auditory cortex succeed in finding the pattern. But every so often, and maybe this was the case that night

Speaker 4:          37:37          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          37:37          okay, so Robert, imagine inside the brains, inside the heads of the people in the audience listening to the right of spring that night where all of these neurons, yeah, I can hear them trying to make sense of the new sounds in failing, not just feeling once or twice, but over and over and over and over. The rite of spring keeps being dissonant all the way through so they can never get any rest. And when those neurons fail repeatedly, there are consequences. Chemical consequences. What happens is our neurons squirt out a bit of dopamine and what does the dopamine do? Well dope mean, makes us feel a little dopamine. Makes you feel happy. That's why sex and drugs make you feel euphoric, but a little too much. And that euphoria turns into literally a schizophrenia. Really? Yes. I don't want to oversimplify a schizophrenia in any way, shape, or form, but some of our most effective treatments for work by

Speaker 12:         38:36          suppressing dopamine release in the brain. So there's some kind of relationship. Too much dopamine has been shown clinically to make people feel crazy. Yes. Maybe that's what happened that night. On May 29th, 1913 music erupted. Neurons revolted, right? Dopamine flooded through. This is to their brains and people went mad. Literally Mad. Let's go to the second night in our story. The piece does come back to Paris, right? Yes. How much later after the riot? Uh, it's from May to March. Actually it was April. So it's almost a year later. Yes. And this time it doesn't come with the ballet. This time it's just being performed as a work of music. So do, does anyone buy tickets? Oh yeah. It's, it's, it's, it's gonna sell out. They do cause a few nights of violent riots. Can you shut up the situation? Now the audience is at a different audience. Uh, I actually don't know if the audience is different, but we can at least say that the audience is coming to it with a different set of information. Exactly. They've, they've been warned

Speaker 4:          39:33          [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         39:33          so for the first time they can actually sit back and really try to pay attention to the notes by being willing to listen. They could hear the orders and patterns that students get hidden in this work. They were able to hear the music and find the orders hidden underneath this noise. Was there a riot this time? The second round? Oh No. Quite the opposite. Stravinsky was a hero. They carried them out on their shoulders.

Speaker 12:         40:08          Really? Literally he was, he was literally, he was carried on the shoulders and, and, and the press was glowing in one year, in one year. And just one year Stravinsky had gone from villainous monster to hipster icon to the extent that police had to escort him from the concert hall to keep them safe from adoring fans. And that was just the beginning. The the third story, if you wanted to tell a third story would be it became children's music. It became Disney music in 1940 27 years after Stravinsky caused a violent and bloody riot. He was negotiating with Mickey Mouse over the rights to use his music and Fantasia, which fantasia just starting a hippopotamus and a little too to know. Is that the one? Is it the mushroom stone? Yeah, I think it's the mushrooms isn't mushrooms. Actually we looked it up later. It was a the part with the dinosaurs.

Speaker 12:         41:00          So how does this happen? How do you go so quickly from being the most outrageous thing that literally maddens people to a triumph to kid's music? Yes. I mean the rite of spring is perfect evidence of the brain's astonishing plasticity. See, this is the really cool part of it for me. If you remember just one bit of science from this whole thing, remember this a, those neurons we met earlier, the one that, the little voices, I liked him. It turns out those neurons learn and they learn fast because they're actually part of a larger network of brain cells with a very technical name called the Cortico fugal network. And what this network does is it's always sort of monitoring, listening to the sounds that are coming into the brain and tuning those neurons to better hear those sounds. Trying to get the station on the radio just to getting it just right.

Speaker 19:         41:58          [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         41:58          so our neurons literally adjust. Literally we're talking then biochemical engineering sense. So if on that first night you just hear the right as pure noise all the way through from beginning to end. If you're listening, if you're letting your cortical fugal network do its job, it can actually resculpt your brain and let you hear the patterns better as a symphony evolves. Is it fair to say that this is a sort of tug of war that an artist comes, create something that is new and unpredictable and strange and maybe noise ish at first hearing and the artist is thrilled to be new in that way and then the brain ruins it all slowly but surely by making it familiar. And whether the brain a pours the new, the brain constantly wants to assimilate every experience we've ever had into every other experience. And I think Stravinsky realized it was the purpose of the artist to challenge a brain, to break the brain out of its conservative cycle.

Speaker 12:         43:05          The astonishing thing to me is here you have an artist like Igor Stravinsky who comes to town intentionally trying to get people to sit in their seats and really listen to music. And the strategy he chooses is instead of pleasing them, he wants to put them in a little bit of discomfort or real pain even. Right? And indeed they not only listen, they riot, but within a year, and this is the sad part to me, within a year it's easier to hear. Suddenly it's pleasant. Suddenly they like it and suddenly you s driven ski is robbed of his newness. Why is that sad for you? Well, because it's kind of, I don't know. I never thought of the brain as the enemy of the artists before with Mia. But I can give you a different interpretation on this. I mean, here comes a guy who offers up the most dissonant, stabbing, percussive, painful music to anyone had heard to that point. And we learned to love him. But because of that make you sort of feel like pride. No, I know. I mean like our brains can decode anything. We learned to love it only because it's well-made. Yeah. But just random car honks. I don't think you could really appreciate that. I disagree. Or you think it would be like just having, have you heard the music that was written after Stravinsky?

Speaker 19:         44:19          Okay.

Speaker 12:         44:20          It's even worse than what you just did. Yeah. But my brain has never accommodated that. But some people love that stuff. And my only point is that if there, if there are these like fixed poles, our ear

Speaker 3:          44:32          between continents and dissonance, which is how we started this whole thing, and now we end up learning that our brains can override that to such an astonishing degree. Well then culture wins. Culture beats biology. But to me it's sad. Sad for the artist. It's not sad for us.

Speaker 19:         44:53          Hmm.

Speaker 12:         44:55          It's sorta like the artists and the brains are that kind of eternal struggle.

Speaker 19:         45:01          [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         45:07          special thanks for that story too. Jonah Lira, who is a regular radio lab contributor and he's the author of the upcoming book, Proust was a neuroscientist, a posted down Yossi and [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          45:19          I'm Jad Abumrad Robert Grove, which, and I will continue in a moment. You're listening to radio from New York public radio. NPR.

Speaker 19:         45:40          Okay.

Speaker 3:          46:40          This is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. Today I program's about music. We ended our last segment with a look back at a very famous riot in 1913 and a composer, Igor Stravinsky, whose primary objective was to create something new and dissonant and disturbing. Right now we'll present the opposite, the off the unscrew the head tie, Stravinsky, in a way. What we mean is he, we're going to introduce you to a guy who has invented a new, radically innovative and ingenious way of creating something old. His name is David Cope. He works and teaches composition at UC Santa Cruz in California and recently our producer Ellen was in the area and it is a beautiful area. It's, it's 22.5 miles. Well, and she paid him to visit extraordinary. And they're like birds. We've got a, we've got, you know, I have nest in each window, each here. Sure. And this one's over here. You can take a look again, like come back in. It's okay. It's just me. Come on kid back in your nest. Um, she's usually, she'll just hop right back in when she hears me talk. You're, aren't you going to listen to me? Oh, this was beside the point because we'd actually come to talk to David Cope, not about nature, but actually about something unnatural that he'd done, which started about 20 years ago,

Speaker 20:         48:07          the 1980, I had a, a commission for an opera which involved actual money, which we had been given up front. And which by the way, since I had four small children, I had already spent and uh, for the first time in my life, uh, I suffered a composer's block. It was like somebody just shot me or your, I should be at the height of my creative power and I can't find a reason to compose. A first note is c sharp started no more interesting. You'd see natural or d and notes just didn't make any sense to me. I was really lost. I can't think of anything worse cause it's not my profession,

Speaker 3:          48:49          it's what I am. A short time later, David Cope Party

Speaker 20:         48:56          and he finds himself talking to a guy who programs computer and he was asking me how things were going and I just simply said, ah, you know, it's a nightmare. And we talked through it, you know, and I, I think I must've initiated it by saying, are there any intelligent programs out there that could, I could possibly use to help me through this? And he said, well there aren't any intelligent programs period. But he said, you don't really need one, don't you really just need some kind of a foil. He called it that.

Speaker 3:          49:23          And I, I really had an epiphany. What I would do is build not so much composing engine, but an analytical engine, a computer. It took them years to build. And that's it. This is, this is, this is Amy right here. This is this Emmy is the computer's name, spelled e. M. I. M. E is an acronym for experiments in musical intelligence and what he built me to do is analyze things. This is specifically notes, treat notes like data. In other words, he'll feed me a bunch of sheet music. For example, buck, Krells, any will then convert every single note on the page into numbers. Right. Can you describe what you see on the screen? Well, there's thousands and thousands of numbers. There are five numbers for each note numbers which represent all kinds of things. The on time, the pitch, the duration corral becomes a huge, massive information. Which Emmy then sorts through looking for patterns. Note four 50 always seems to be falling by note four 56 loud and then soft. She will find the patterns. Every composer has them, the little things they do, the DNA of

Speaker 20:         50:27          the individual

Speaker 3:          50:30          now finding all the patterns, mapping the creative DNA of a composer is in and of itself. Not all that interesting. It's what happens next, which is the spooky part. Cope hits a few buttons and all the DNA starts to recombine. Ghosts stir in the machine,

Speaker 20:         50:51          any molar,

Speaker 18:         50:57          any Beethoven,

Speaker 21:         51:02          [inaudible],

Speaker 20:         51:03          Ethan Scott, chaplain

Speaker 8:          51:07          [inaudible],

Speaker 20:         51:07          and of course his favorite Bach of course. Then I became very excited about this prospect and immediately put in some coke and sure enough my opera, which had taken ion. No, by the time I was putting in the Copa, it was maybe five years and past. Uh, the opera was written in about 10 days.

Speaker 20:         51:28          So as a demonstration, I'm going to play for you the f the opening of the corral that was composed in 1987, uh, in the style of Bach. And one of the first ones that came out of the program. Now, this corral was so bad, it sounded to me when I first heard it that I, I, I threw it away at Britain, the trashcan. And then I said, well, there's something about that that I kind of like and I pulled it out again. I thank God I did because this is my, one of my favorite pieces the program ever produced. So here's what it sounds like as a machine, but plant

Speaker 8:          52:01          [inaudible] just a huge rigidity of machine, like n****r of the meter being processed and all the notes being processed in precisely the right time with these timbers this mornings, which are egregious. I mean, they're just terrible. [inaudible]

Speaker 20:         52:20          now I'm going to play for you the same corral as performed by a group of singers a while later.

Speaker 18:         52:41          [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 20:         52:46          same piece of music. Incredibly human, personally musical going someplace intriguing. I want to hear more. The second one. I'm glad I turned off the first one. One idea.

Speaker 18:         53:00          Oh, [inaudible].

Speaker 20:         53:10          Yes sir. Yes. Oh, the number of negative reactions is far, far outnumber the positive reactions. Remember recall one in particular? One that Oh yeah, it was at a conference in Germany in which, uh, colleague, uh, he hit me in the nose, his finger. I'm a, I'm pretty much a coward physically. Yeah. You know, he was bigger than I, so it was, it was a quite a moment, but there have been many, many occasions, you know, shouting matches. If you've spent a good portion of your life being in love with, you know, these dead composers. I mean, that sounds horrible, but you know what I mean? And along comes some Twerp who claims to have this little piece of software would use, isn't in much at all that can, can, can move you in the same way. Suddenly you're saying to yourself, yeah,

Speaker 4:          53:58          Whoa,

Speaker 20:         54:01          what's happened here? Certainly my, my, my relationship to the original pieces of music is cheapened in some way. I mean, what is Chopin really just nothing more than a bunch of cliches thrown together.

Speaker 22:         54:15          [inaudible]

Speaker 20:         54:15          I hurt with them in a way and when they hurt, um, I feel successful and I also feel very bad. I mean, I'm missing with some pretty powerful relationships here and doing so in a mechanical way. If I had done it myself as a human being, these individuals could probably live with it because after all, they could say, well, you know, he's just really good at that sort of thing. But somehow using hell, you know, or some version of how is the ultimate insult. There is nothing intelligent about my program in this lightest. Nothing intelligent about it. I could do everything it did if you gave me 10 years. I just don't have that amount of time. I'd rather spend five minutes. Thank you very much.

Speaker 4:          55:09          [inaudible]

Speaker 20:         55:09          we did a concert here at Bach, at Emmy Bach and the Middle Moon is just a dorm. I mean it's just lovely. And, and a friend of mine was sitting in the back of the hall next to an ancient lady. She must've been in her eighties late eighties and she couldn't read very well. So she hadn't read the program. [inaudible] she really just was at this concert because friends told her she didn't know what was all about or anything like that. But she knew all about music and she loves it. Bach and, and she listened to that
