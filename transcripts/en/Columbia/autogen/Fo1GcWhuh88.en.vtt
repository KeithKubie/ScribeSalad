advance so this summer we worked with

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460
advance so this summer we worked with
 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.910
advance so this summer we worked with
work on project and dynamics of that

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920
work on project and dynamics of that
 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.180
work on project and dynamics of that
spaces so I'm just going to give a

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190
spaces so I'm just going to give a
 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.250
spaces so I'm just going to give a
little spoiler and how to cut sharp in

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260
little spoiler and how to cut sharp in
 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.110
little spoiler and how to cut sharp in
that space because it's going to be

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120
that space because it's going to be
 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.690
that space because it's going to be
useful later and I'll leave the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700
useful later and I'll leave the
 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.599
useful later and I'll leave the
construction

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:48.609
 
 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:54.259
 
so let's faces our quotients of

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269
so let's faces our quotients of
 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:59.549
so let's faces our quotients of
asclepius new key actions so so more

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559
asclepius new key actions so so more
 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:14.370
asclepius new key actions so so more
precisely that and find the action by

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380
precisely that and find the action by
 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:26.160
precisely that and find the action by
this matrix

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170
 
 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.719
 
so we're defining the action of this on

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729
so we're defining the action of this on
 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.580
so we're defining the action of this on
honest week and this makes sense because

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590
honest week and this makes sense because
 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.640
honest week and this makes sense because
that's the reason

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650
that's the reason
 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.620
that's the reason
and so the quotient of this action on s3

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630
and so the quotient of this action on s3
 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.810
and so the quotient of this action on s3
is going to be called in that space

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820
is going to be called in that space
 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.350
is going to be called in that space
our PQ and I'm just gonna leave this

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360
our PQ and I'm just gonna leave this
 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.270
our PQ and I'm just gonna leave this
here because it'll be useful for a

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280
here because it'll be useful for a
 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.859
here because it'll be useful for a
carrot to use later so now that we have

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869
carrot to use later so now that we have
 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.200

so it's much better if I have a picture

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660
so it's much better if I have a picture
 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.070
so it's much better if I have a picture
so what are hyper planes of tender

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080
so what are hyper planes of tender
 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.900
so what are hyper planes of tender
spaces there are 3 their plates each

spaces there are 3 their plates each
point we have a plane here and what I

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220
point we have a plane here and what I
 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.189
point we have a plane here and what I
mean that these can't make the depending

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199
mean that these can't make the depending
 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.409
mean that these can't make the depending
on their so I'm smaller pitiful we try

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419
on their so I'm smaller pitiful we try
 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.390
on their so I'm smaller pitiful we try
to glue these things together we

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400
to glue these things together we
 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.540
to glue these things together we
obviously need to rip it down the middle

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550
obviously need to rip it down the middle
 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.430
obviously need to rip it down the middle
so now that we have some idea of what a

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440
so now that we have some idea of what a
 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.850
so now that we have some idea of what a
contact structure is let's try thinking

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860
contact structure is let's try thinking
 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.300
contact structure is let's try thinking
about how we can find them so if alpha

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310
about how we can find them so if alpha
 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.760
about how we can find them so if alpha
is a one form on your manifold such that

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770
is a one form on your manifold such that
 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.010
is a one form on your manifold such that
alpha which the alpha to the N minus 1

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020
alpha which the alpha to the N minus 1
 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.920
alpha which the alpha to the N minus 1
is a volume form then the kernel of this

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930
is a volume form then the kernel of this
 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.040
is a volume form then the kernel of this
is going to be a contact structure and

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050
is going to be a contact structure and
 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.650
is going to be a contact structure and
we call one forms that satisfy this

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660
we call one forms that satisfy this
 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.450
we call one forms that satisfy this
condition a contact form and in our case

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460
condition a contact form and in our case
 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.000
condition a contact form and in our case
of r3 here we have alpha is DZ plus X dy

so the parallel this is the concept

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550

r2 n which can be identified with CN
through these coordinates so if we

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300
through these coordinates so if we
 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.600

form alpha one and the second one is the
 

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:07.089
form alpha one and the second one is the

00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:07.099
kernel of some form alpha 2 then we say
 

00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:09.789

it makes sense because the kernel of g

00:07:17.249 --> 00:07:17.259
it makes sense because the kernel of g
 

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:19.899
it makes sense because the kernel of g
times alpha one is same it is the same

00:07:19.899 --> 00:07:19.909
times alpha one is same it is the same
 

00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:22.029
times alpha one is same it is the same
thing as the kernel about the one thing

00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:22.039

G is strictly positive and when when we
have and this leads us to the conclusion

so let's look at an example r3 with the
 

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.460
so let's look at an example r3 with the

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:43.470
kernel of the one form we showed earlier
 

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:47.659

contact amorphic and in fact these are

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:50.580
contact amorphic and in fact these are
 

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:51.860
contact amorphic and in fact these are
something we like to call strictly

something we like to call strictly
 

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:54.080
something we like to call strictly
contact of norfolk which means that not

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:54.090
contact of norfolk which means that not
 

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:55.520
contact of norfolk which means that not
only are the contact structure is the

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:55.530
only are the contact structure is the
 

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:57.890
only are the contact structure is the
same but these two contact forms are

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:57.900
same but these two contact forms are
 

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:03.740
same but these two contact forms are
also the same so when we have morphisms

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:03.750
also the same so when we have morphisms
 

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.529
also the same so when we have morphisms
like contact the morphisms obviously one

00:08:06.529 --> 00:08:06.539
like contact the morphisms obviously one
 

00:08:06.539 --> 00:08:08.510
like contact the morphisms obviously one

there's something that's not a ban which

00:08:12.439 --> 00:08:12.449
there's something that's not a ban which

there's something that's not a ban which
is very important to our project this

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:16.590
is very important to our project this
 

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:22.730
is very important to our project this
and these are so given a contact form

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:22.740
and these are so given a contact form
 

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.999
and these are so given a contact form
alpha and the contact structure the

00:08:25.999 --> 00:08:26.009
alpha and the contact structure the
 

00:08:26.009 --> 00:08:28.129
alpha and the contact structure the
kernel of this alpha then the red vector

00:08:28.129 --> 00:08:28.139
kernel of this alpha then the red vector
 

00:08:28.139 --> 00:08:29.899

field is the unique vector field

00:08:29.899 --> 00:08:29.909
field is the unique vector field
 

00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:31.959
field is the unique vector field
determined by these two equations and

00:08:31.959 --> 00:08:31.969
determined by these two equations and
 

00:08:31.969 --> 00:08:34.339
determined by these two equations and
the first equation is a normalization

00:08:34.339 --> 00:08:34.349
the first equation is a normalization
 

00:08:34.349 --> 00:08:36.769
the first equation is a normalization
requirement and the second one is that

00:08:36.769 --> 00:08:36.779
requirement and the second one is that
 

00:08:36.779 --> 00:08:39.519

transversality remark which says that

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:39.529
transversality remark which says that
 

00:08:39.529 --> 00:08:42.800
transversality remark which says that
the red vector field is transverse to

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:42.810
the red vector field is transverse to
 

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:46.670
the red vector field is transverse to
the contact structure so when we have

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:46.680
the contact structure so when we have
 

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.860
the contact structure so when we have
vector fields the natural thing to do is

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:48.870
vector fields the natural thing to do is
 

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:50.810
vector fields the natural thing to do is
flow along these vector fields so we

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:50.820
flow along these vector fields so we
 

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.430
flow along these vector fields so we
call the red flow

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:52.440
call the red flow
 

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.949
call the red flow

it's you might have realized that it's
very important which form we have we

00:09:06.769 --> 00:09:06.779
very important which form we have we

want to mean by that is the red flow is

00:09:09.079 --> 00:09:09.089
want to mean by that is the red flow is
 

00:09:09.089 --> 00:09:14.390
want to mean by that is the red flow is

even though G alpha and alpha have the
 

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.770
even though G alpha and alpha have the

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:03.430
 
you came up with this as well as an

okay so basically the idea is that you
 

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:29.750

these you have some coefficients but
 

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:44.630
these you have some coefficients but
like like with this sphere of piece you

can just you can just pick a period and
 

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:53.600
can just you can just pick a period and
like you'll always have a period so what

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:53.610
like you'll always have a period so what
 

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:56.419
like you'll always have a period so what
you do is you kind of insert these small

00:18:56.419 --> 00:18:56.429
you do is you kind of insert these small
 

00:18:56.429 --> 00:18:58.370
you do is you kind of insert these small
little like rationally independent

00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:58.380

epsilon so you don't get a period in

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:02.580

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:06.670
 
 

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:08.970
 
we add one to one of them and then we

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:08.980
we add one to one of them and then we
 

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:10.710
we add one to one of them and then we
subtract the epsilon from the other so

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:10.720
subtract the epsilon from the other so
 

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:18.360
subtract the epsilon from the other so
these are obviously not rational

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:18.370
 
 

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:21.150
