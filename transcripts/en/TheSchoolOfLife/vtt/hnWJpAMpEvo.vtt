00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:07.140
We can sometimes be so modest about our power
to know what might be good for others or ourselves,

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.030
we forget it might be possible to hazard a
few generalisations about what constitutes

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:19.410
an emotionally healthy childhood. It can’t
be pure idiosyncracy or good luck; there are

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.660
distinct themes and goals to identify. With
a map of optimal development in mind, we could

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.710
more clearly appreciate where dislocation
begins, what we have to be grateful for and

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.140
what there is to regret. At a collective level,
we would have more of a sense of what we need

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:44.540
to achieve to generate a more emotionally-privileged
– and therefore slightly saner – world.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.710
In the course of an emotionally healthy childhood,
we could expect some of the following to occur:

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.070
– Someone will put themselves profoundly
at our service. If as adults we have even

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.290
a measure of mental health, it is almost certainly
because, when we were helpless tiny infants,

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:08.119
there was a person (to whom we essentially
owe our lives) who pushed their needs to one

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:14.770
side for a time in order to focus wholly on
our own. They interpreted what we could not

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.860
quite say, they guessed what might be ailing
us, they settled and consoled us. They kept

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.409
the chaos and noise at bay and cut the world
up into manageable pieces for us. They did

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.451
not, all the while, ask that we thank them,
understand them or show them sympathy. They

00:01:32.451 --> 00:01:37.090
didn’t demand that we enquire how their
days went or how they were sleeping at night

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.659
(they weren’t much). They treated us like
royalty, so that we would later on be able

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.290
to submit to the rigours and humiliations
of an ordinary life. This temporarily one-sided

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:56.630
relationship guaranteed our eventual ability
to form a two-sided kind. We may think of

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.060
egoists as people who have grown sick from
too much love. But the opposite is rather

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.990
the case; an egoist is someone who has not
yet had their fill. Self-centeredness has

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:14.540
to have a clean run in the early years, if
it isn’t to haunt and ruin the later ones.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:21.079
The so-called narcissist is simply a benighted
soul who has not had a chance to be inordinately

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:26.959
and unreasonably admired at the start. – In
an emotionally-healthy childhood, someone

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:32.049
is on hand to put the best possible spin on
our behaviour. We’re given the benefit of

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:37.909
the doubt. We are assessed by what we might
one day be, not by exactly what we are right

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:45.120
now. Someone is kind. A harsh judge might,
for example, say that we were ‘attention-seeking’.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.230
Our caregiver imagines that what we most stand
in need of is a hug and some encouraging words.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.450
We might have acted rather meanly. Our caregiver
adds that we must, in the background, have

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.839
been feeling threatened. It looked as if we
were negligent; the caregiver remembers that

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:07.159
tiredness could have had a lot to do with
it. Our carer constantly searches beneath

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:12.639
the surface for a more sympathetic set of
explanations. They help us to be on our own

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:18.249
side, to like ourselves – and therefore
eventually not to be too defensive about our

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:24.620
own flaws, whose existence we grow strong
enough to accept. – In a good childhood,

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.090
the relationship with our caregiver is steady,
consistent and long-term. We trust that they

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.219
will be there tomorrow and the day after.
They aren’t volatile or fragile. They are

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:40.969
almost boringly predictable and happy to be
taken for granted. As a result, we develop

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:46.129
a trust in relationships that spreads throughout
our life. We are able to believe that what

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:51.879
has gone well once can go well again and let
such an expectation govern our choice of adult

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:57.469
partners. We aren’t mesmerised by people
who are off-hand and unreliable; we don’t

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:03.159
relish being punished. We can pick out candidates
who are kind and nurturing – and don’t

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:08.809
judge them as weak or deficient for being
so. And if trouble strikes with our kindly

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:15.419
partners, we don’t panic anxiously or avoidantly
turn away. We can confidently set about trying

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:22.079
to repair a love we know we deserve. – In
an emotionally healthy upbringing, we aren’t

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:27.870
always required to be wholly good boys or
girls. We are allowed to get furious and sometimes

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.409
a bit revolting, at points to say ‘absolutely
not’ and ‘because I feel like it’. The

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:38.780
adults know their own flaws and do not expect
a child to be fundamentally better than they

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:45.199
are. We do not have to comply at every turn
to be tolerated. We can let others see our

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:51.789
shadow sides. This period of freedom prepares
us one day to submit to the demands of society

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:57.409
without having to rebel in self-defeating
ways (rebels being, at heart, people who had

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:03.599
to obey too much too early). We can knuckle
down and tow the line when it’s in our long-term

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:09.500
interest to do so. At the same time, we’re
not overly cowed or indiscriminately obedient

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:16.349
either. We find a sound middle point between
slavish compliance on the one hand and self-destructive

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:22.060
defiance on the other. – In the emotionally
healthy home, our carer isn’t jealous of

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.490
or competitive with us. They can allow themselves
to be overtaken and superseded. They have

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.939
had their moment in the limelight – or else
are having it elsewhere beyond the family.

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:37.590
They can be proud rather than rivalrous of
the achievements of the (usually same-sex)

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:43.949
child. It doesn’t all need to be about them.
The good carer isn’t overly ambitious on

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:48.760
the child’s behalf. They want them to do
well, but for their own sake, in their own

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:54.370
way. There is no particular script the offspring
has to follow to be loved; the child isn’t

00:05:54.370 --> 00:06:00.530
required to support the carer’s frayed self-belief
or burnish their image in the eyes of the

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:07.120
world. – In the emotionally healthy upbringing,
the child learns that things which break can

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:13.449
be fixed. Plans can go awry, but new ones
can be made. You can fall over and dust yourself

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:19.689
off. The carer models for the child how to
calm down, plough on and remain hopeful. A

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:24.919
voice of resilience, originally external,
becomes the way the child learns to speak

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:31.039
to themselves. There are alternatives to panic;
the ship will endure the storm and make it

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:36.980
back to harbour. It is safe enough to go outside
and explore. There aren’t dangers at every

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:42.060
turn. We can make little forays at first,
then come back for reassurance – only to

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:48.449
return for another, longer journey of exploration.
We can take risks. – Importantly, plenty

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:54.310
goes wrong in the emotionally healthy childhood.
No one has staked their reputation on rendering

00:06:54.310 --> 00:07:00.740
the whole thing perfect. The carer does not
see it as their role to remove every frustration.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:05.879
They intuit that a lot of good comes from
having the right, manageable kind of friction

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:11.199
– through which the child develops their
own resources and individuality. In contact

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:17.300
with bearable disappointment, the child is
prompted to create their own internal world,

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:24.219
in which they can dream, hatch fresh plans,
self-soothe and build up their own resources.

00:07:24.219 --> 00:07:29.919
– The good carer isn’t, the child can
see, either entirely good or wholly bad and

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:36.100
so isn’t worthy of either idealisation or
denigration. The child accepts the faults

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:42.499
and virtues of the carer with melancholy maturity
and gratitude – and thereby, by extension,

00:07:42.499 --> 00:07:49.090
becomes ready to accept that everyone they
like will be a mixture of positive and negative.

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:53.409
They won’t as adults fall deeply in love
and then grow furious at the first moment

00:07:53.409 --> 00:08:00.289
of let-down. They have a realistic sense of
what can be expected of life alongside another

00:08:00.289 --> 00:08:07.069
good enough human. Soberingly, despite all
our advances in technology and material resources,

00:08:07.069 --> 00:08:12.499
we are not much more advanced in the art of
delivering emotionally healthy childhoods

00:08:12.499 --> 00:08:19.860
than previous generations. The number of breakdowns,
inauthentic lives and broken souls shows no

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:25.919
marked signs of decline. We are failing to
offer one another tolerable childhoods not

00:08:25.919 --> 00:08:31.439
because we are evil or indifferent but because
we still have so far to go before we know

00:08:31.439 --> 00:08:39.040
how to do that most apparently simple yet
infinitely complicated of things: love.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:50.880
The dark truths in our book "Things you should never tell children" may not be suitable for children, but can offer solace, humour and relief to the older ones among us.
