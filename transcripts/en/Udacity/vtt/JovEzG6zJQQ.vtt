00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.920
So going back to our mani-core challenges, we have

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.500
seen that there are solutions to the increasing the

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.050
on-chip coherence traffic as the number of cores grows.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.650
We have seen solutions to the increasing off-chip traffic

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.726
as the number of cores grows. And we have

00:00:15.726 --> 00:00:18.094
also seen a way to have a directory that

00:00:18.094 --> 00:00:21.720
will support our on-chip network and that solution was,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.568
as we have recently seen, a distributed partial directory,

00:00:25.568 --> 00:00:28.824
which doesn't keep information for every possible

00:00:28.824 --> 00:00:31.892
block in memory. It only keeps information

00:00:31.892 --> 00:00:34.322
for a limited number of blocks, and

00:00:34.322 --> 00:00:38.453
has a replacement policy, and invalidates on-chip caches

00:00:38.453 --> 00:00:41.093
as a result of such replacements. The

00:00:41.093 --> 00:00:44.748
next mani-core challenge we will consider is that

00:00:44.748 --> 00:00:47.723
the power budget available for the chip,

00:00:47.723 --> 00:00:51.123
for example 100 watts that we can reasonably

00:00:51.123 --> 00:00:56.223
call from a chip of the area that we can manufacture is split among all the

00:00:56.223 --> 00:01:02.050
cores. So as the number of cores goes up, the power we can spend in each

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.712
core goes down. And that means that the

00:01:05.712 --> 00:01:09.044
frequency and the voltage that we can use

00:01:09.044 --> 00:01:12.193
in each core goes down. And that means

00:01:12.193 --> 00:01:16.183
that if we have a single-threaded program it gets

00:01:16.183 --> 00:01:21.825
slower and slower, the more cores we have. because that single-threaded program,

00:01:21.825 --> 00:01:24.729
if we only had one core, would get the power budget of

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.490
the entire chip. With, let's say, 64 cores, it gets

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.950
only a 64th part of the power budget. So what do we do about this?
