00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.429
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Hello.

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:09.160
Thank you so much for coming to what is the
latest in our political Fireside Chats.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.999
Some of you may recall, but in 2010 we hosted
a number of candidates and campaigns on campus.

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:19.920
And we think this is a real value to Googlers
to hear what's going on in our home state.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.050
So this is the latest in the political Fireside
Chats for 2012.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.180
We will be offering the other side of this
issue to come to campus and have the same

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.140
opportunity to speak to Googlers.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.930
And to hear questions from you all.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.830
And with that, I'm gonna hand this over to
Alan.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:37.960
&gt;&gt;Alan: So thanks for coming.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.250
I appreciate it.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.230
You know, this is an issue that I think sometimes
there's an abstract issue.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.600
You know, you think about the death penalty
and it's kind of somebody else's problem.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.050
It's on the pages of the news.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.309
And you know, you see it that way.

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.489
But it's not personal.

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.980
And I feel like one of the things that's missing
from political debate in general, but in this

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.470
topic in particular, is the personal side
on some of these issues.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.890
And so I've been talking to Natasha, and full
disclosure, I support this cause.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.470
I support the SAFE ballot initiative.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.180
I'm one of the funders of that initiative.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.470
But in the course of that conversation, I've
learned a lot about the issues.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.100
And one of the things that she and I talked
about was, you know, would it be possible

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.369
to host an event here.

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.071
Would it be possible for us to learn a little
bit more about the issues and the impact of

00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:33.071
those issues?

00:01:33.071 --> 00:01:34.710
And she did something which was fantastic.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.880
Which she actually just put together a panel
here.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.909
Of people on, you know, two people that were
on Death Row, that actually through a long

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.619
and I'm sure arduous process, that they'll
tell you about, were exonerated.

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.270
And also a former warden at San Quentin that
can show you that perspective.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.950
And of course Natasha's working very hard
on a ballot initiative that she'll tell you

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.310
about as well.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.250
But the main thing that I want to get out
of this morning is to just personalize it.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.180
It's not an abstract issue.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.289
It's a very specific one.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.500
The consequences of our decisions are enormous.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:19.380
Probably the single most enormous consequence
that any society or decision can make.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.760
And I feel like, because of that it's really
important for us as individuals and as citizens

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.010
to know what we're getting into.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.010
And what we have got into.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.709
So with that, I wanted to turn it over.

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.680
Do you want to start with introductions here?

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.300
&gt;&gt;Natasha: Sure.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.630
My name is Natasha Minsker.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.970
I am the campaign manager for the SAFE California
Act.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.040
&gt;&gt;Jeannie: My name is Jeannie Woodford.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.560
I'm the Warden on the panel.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.720
But currently I'm the executive director of
Death Penalty Focus.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.610
And I'm the proponent of the initiative to
replace the Death Penalty in California.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.700
&gt;&gt;Nathan: My name is Nathan Fields.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.980
And I'm the chairmen of Witness to Innocence
compensation committee.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.610
I spent a total of 18 years in prison.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.420
11 and a half on death row for a crime I didn't
commit.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.019
&gt;&gt;Randy: I'm Randy Steidl.

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.709
And I'm president of the broad of directors
of Witness to Innocence.

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:18.330
And I spent almost 18 years in prison and
12 on death row for a crime I didn't commit.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.790
&gt;&gt;Alan: So let's start with you.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.620
I think you know, let's just start at the
beginning of your story.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.000
&gt;&gt;Randy: Well first off, I would like to thank
Death Penalty Focus and SAFE California.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.220
And the Google policy makers group.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.410
For inviting me.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:39.140
Giving me this opportunity to explain exactly
what happened to me with this barbaric system

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.950
that Illinois had in place.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.400
In 1986, in the small town of Paris, Illinois,
there was a gruesome murder of a young newlywed

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.200
couple.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.510
And Paris was such a small town you could
imagine how it shocked the whole community.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.510
Four weeks before these murders had happened,
I had reported the local state's attorney

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:07.410
to the FBI for drug distribution and protecting
drug distribution in that small town.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:14.130
And it was three days after these murders
that there was a knock on my door and wanted

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.609
me to come downtown for questioning.

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.180
I cooperated fully with the police.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.609
I had a brother that was a Illinois State
Police officer.

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.119
I had a grandfather that was a Deputy Sheriff.

00:04:24.119 --> 00:04:27.680
So I believed that you should cooperate with
authority.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.650
I went down and gave them my step by step
whereabouts.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:30.669
Who I was with.

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.229
What times I was there.

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.050
And I was released.

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.930
Seven months later there was another knock
on the door.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.520
Five police officers come into my home with
guns drawn.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.520
Throwed me down on the floor.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.599
And arrested me and booked me for a double
murder I didn't commit.

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:51.619
And you can only imagine the pain and the
suffering that I felt when my little brother

00:04:51.619 --> 00:04:52.619
came to the jail.

00:04:52.619 --> 00:04:56.801
Slammed a [indistinct] down in front of the
holding cell, and said "Well, I've talked

00:04:56.801 --> 00:05:01.789
to the prosecutor and the lead detective,
and they said, if you cooperate they won't

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:04.759
seek the death penalty."

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:08.979
And I can't repeat the exact words I told
him that night in jail.

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:10.210
Wouldn't be appropriate.

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.680
He got mad and screamed at me.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.689
And kicked the stool across the office floor
and screamed "They don't arrest people that

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:16.689
aren't guilty."

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:20.830
Now you can imagine anybody saying that.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:26.979
But my own brother said they don't arrest
people that aren't guilty.

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:34.860
My case was rife with corruption, political
influence.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.969
The State had two alleged eye witnesses that
said they were present at the crime scene.

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:41.969
But yet neither one of them saw each other.

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:47.240
This young newlywed couple was just viciously
stabbed over 50 times.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.169
And their home was set on fire.

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:56.029
I went from the comforts in my home to Death
Row in 97 days.

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:58.139
That's unheard of today.

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:01.849
But through the years there was no physical
evidence.

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:03.300
No forensic evidence.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.639
No DNA.

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:09.669
Nothing linking me to this crime but a town
drunk, who said he was an eyewitness.

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:12.889
And a mentally ill, violently mentally ill
woman.

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:14.379
Who claimed to be present.

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:20.520
And actually held the woman down while me
and my co-defendant stabbed her to death.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.339
Yet she was free to go home after giving that
statement.

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:26.759
Can you imagine?

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:32.240
My appeals process in the state of Illinois
was nothing more than an exercise in futility.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.149
Because there is nothing to doubt.

00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:36.599
There was two alleged eyewitnesses, right?

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:38.539
Even though their stories were not credible.

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:41.169
And didn't corroborate each other.

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:46.720
I spent over 12 years on Death Row before
I finally got some relief through the state

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:53.459
of Illinois because my attorney who was incompetent,
didn't put on any mitigation at sentencing.

00:06:53.459 --> 00:06:55.050
And I ended up with the Death Penalty.

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:58.919
Finally I ended up with life without parole.

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:00.150
I had one appeal left.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.009
It was a Federal court.

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:07.759
And after 14 years there was finally enough
publicity to embarrass the Illinois State

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:13.020
Police, who assigned an investigator to review
the case.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.180
Hoping he would just rubber stamp it.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.050
And this cop didn't do that.

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.800
He was one of those Serpico type police officers.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.319
That was a search for the truth, to him.

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:27.449
He tried five times to reopen a case.

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:30.080
Said "You got two innocent men sitting here."

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.529
He said "I'm trying to bring closure to the
murder victim's family members and address

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:40.680
this corruption and wrongdoing within the
police department and the state's attorney's

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:41.709
office."

00:07:41.709 --> 00:07:43.849
He was denied five times to reopen the case.

00:07:43.849 --> 00:07:46.189
They said the case was too politically sensitive.

00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:52.300
But if it had not been for this police officer,
at the very least I'd be spending the rest

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.759
of my life in prison.

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:59.749
Because his reports and his investigation
combined with my federal habeas corpus petition

00:07:59.749 --> 00:08:05.649
in federal court is what convinced the federal
judge to either release or have the state

00:08:05.649 --> 00:08:08.729
retry me in 120 days.

00:08:08.729 --> 00:08:17.379
So after 17 years, three months, and three
weeks, May 28, 2004, I was released.

00:08:17.379 --> 00:08:20.719
And it was like being reborn.

00:08:20.719 --> 00:08:23.399
Into the arms of my family and my children.

00:08:23.399 --> 00:08:24.399
Alan?

00:08:24.399 --> 00:08:27.919
&gt;&gt;Alan: That's quite a story.

00:08:27.919 --> 00:08:31.779
So, also from Illinois, also in the same system.

00:08:31.779 --> 00:08:32.779
&gt;&gt;Nathan: Right.

00:08:32.779 --> 00:08:35.020
&gt;&gt;Alan: Please tell your story.

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:36.020
&gt;&gt;Nathan: Mm.

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.269
My story begins in 1985.

00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:42.690
I was the manager of a Southside Chicago building.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:45.240
I had did what I always do every morning.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:50.550
Which is go down the street, to McDonald's
and get a cup of coffee.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:54.370
As I was going to get the cup of coffee, the
police pulled me over.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:55.720
I was not speeding.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.430
I was not doing anything wrong.

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:00.060
They told me to show some ID.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.250
Which I did.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:06.240
Upon showing the ID, the policeman went back
to his car.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.519
When he came back, he had his gun out.

00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:11.410
And two other squad cars, unmarked, had pulled
up.

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:14.070
And they all pulled their guns out.

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:16.459
They told me "Keep your hands on the car."

00:09:16.459 --> 00:09:17.870
I told 'em "I'm not gonna move.

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:19.209
I'm not gonna move."

00:09:19.209 --> 00:09:22.449
'Cause they had the guns aiming directly at
me.

00:09:22.449 --> 00:09:24.070
They put me in the squad car.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:25.480
One of them got in my car.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.580
And we all drove to the police station.

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:32.519
When we got to the police station, one of
the cops told me, "Hey, Nate, we'll see you

00:09:32.519 --> 00:09:33.850
in 40 years."

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:36.750
I really didn't understand what he was talking
about.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:41.490
'Cause I was trying to figure why did they
even bring me to the police station.

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:46.370
While I was there, the police did not ask
me any questions about any crime.

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:50.870
They didn't interrogate me or try to get a
confession or nothing.

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:55.120
They just, were just saying, "You goin' down."

00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:00.600
So when I went for arraignment a couple of
days later, I was shocked when I appeared

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:06.970
before the judge, and he read off that I was
charged with a double murder.

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:08.290
Make a long story short.

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:12.370
My trial began before Judge Thomas Malone.

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:15.350
I went to trial, the case was very weak.

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:18.290
Because I was arrested 13 months after it
happened.

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:19.500
There was no physical evidence.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.560
No DNA evidence.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:28.490
The sole suspect that they was looking for
was a person that was 18 years old to 20.

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:31.389
Light skinned black male.

00:10:31.389 --> 00:10:33.560
At that time, I was 31 years old.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.959
When I was arrested.

00:10:34.959 --> 00:10:38.949
And as you see, I'm not a light skinned black
male.

00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:39.949
Mm.

00:10:39.949 --> 00:10:45.449
That to the side, I went before this judge
and he found me guilty.

00:10:45.449 --> 00:10:50.970
Upon finding me guilty, I really thought that
the judge was just prejudiced against me.

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:53.820
And I had a co-defendant as well.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:57.070
And I really thought the judge was just prejudiced
against me.

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:58.220
But I didn't know what happened.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:01.470
But I know that evidence did not prove me
guilty.

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:05.949
It was about five high school students that
testified at my trial.

00:11:05.949 --> 00:11:08.290
That I couldn't have been the person.

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:14.690
And it was only one eyewitness who claimed
that he saw the crime from over 150 feet away,

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:15.959
playing baseball.

00:11:15.959 --> 00:11:18.360
He found me guilty.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.860
And upon finding me guilty, we went to the
sentencing hearing.

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:26.750
At the sentencing hearing, the very witness,
the one witness that pointed me out, said

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:27.879
that he had lied.

00:11:27.879 --> 00:11:32.329
And that the police had coached him to say
that I was the one.

00:11:32.329 --> 00:11:35.620
And that they had manipulated the lineup.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.970
That to the side, the judge still would not
give me a new trial.

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:42.079
Or stave off my death sentence.

00:11:42.079 --> 00:11:43.560
So I was sent to Death Row.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:47.600
I was found, well I was given the death penalty,
I went to Death Row.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.290
Death Row, let me tell you something about
it.

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:51.589
It's like hell on earth.

00:11:51.589 --> 00:11:56.270
When I got there, lot of guys that tried to
help me before I left.

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:58.670
They was either executed.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:01.209
Or they had lost they mind.

00:12:01.209 --> 00:12:02.459
The place is so restrictive.

00:12:02.459 --> 00:12:05.620
You're in a cell five by eight.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:07.930
You're led around with a dog chain.

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:08.930
Handcuffs.

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:09.930
Shackles.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:10.959
Everywhere you go.

00:12:10.959 --> 00:12:14.480
You're allowed out the cell one hour per day.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.450
The stress that I saw on Death Row was so
overwhelming.

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:23.910
To see so many men I just couldn't believe
that everyone was under a death sentence.

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.709
Individuals started losin' they mind.

00:12:25.709 --> 00:12:30.509
It was nothin' to hear prisoners lay there
at night, talkin' to imaginary figures.

00:12:30.509 --> 00:12:31.800
Talkin' to their children.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.639
Talkin' to their wives.

00:12:33.639 --> 00:12:35.620
Talkin' to anyone.

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.029
Just talkin'.

00:12:37.029 --> 00:12:39.910
Hearing prisoners yellin' out in the middle
of the night.

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:44.180
Seein' prisoners who, a few days ago they
was callin' you by your name.

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.370
Now you come by their cell, they don't even
know you.

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:48.190
They have lost they mind.

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:52.480
I saw prisoners who, they hadn't combed they
hair in 13 years.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.310
They hadn't brushed they teeth 13 years.

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:57.930
They hadn't tooken a shower in years.

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:00.490
The cell smelled like a lion's den.

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:05.290
The guards would always, when the brass come
on the unit, they would go in and clean these

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:06.980
prisoner's cell out.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:08.800
And try to deodorize it.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:12.260
So that the brass wouldn't see what was goin'
on.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.120
Or the visitors that was comin' to the prison.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:20.660
While I was on Death Row, I was there for
11 executions of men who I knew.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:30.509
I had the unopportunity to meet one of Illinois'
most noted serial killer, John Wayne Gacy.

00:13:30.509 --> 00:13:33.699
Who I met right as I came into the door.

00:13:33.699 --> 00:13:36.459
And we had a little situation that developed.

00:13:36.459 --> 00:13:42.079
And the guards wouldn't let us come near each
other anymore after we had a little incident.

00:13:42.079 --> 00:13:47.589
But that to the side, what happened for me
was, one day I was reading the newspaper.

00:13:47.589 --> 00:13:52.519
And I saw in the newspaper, they was talkin'
about my judge who had sentenced me to death.

00:13:52.519 --> 00:13:58.950
And then the article said that he had been
indicted for takin' bribes in murder cases.

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:02.350
And he had taken a bribe on my very case.

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:08.230
Um, when I read this I just fell to my knees
and I started prayin'.

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:13.320
What had happened, the judge had taken a bribe
from my co-defendant's attorney to throw the

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.320
case.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:18.779
My co-defendant's attorney had been corrupt
and had bribed the judge on other cases.

00:14:18.779 --> 00:14:20.850
I knew nothin' about the bribe.

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:26.070
When the FBI came into the courtroom and was
sittin' on the rows watchin' the trial, and

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:29.769
the bailiffs told the judge that the FBI was
in the courtroom.

00:14:29.769 --> 00:14:31.870
He knew that they was up on the bribe.

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:32.910
And they were.

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:34.910
They had tapped his phone.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:40.180
In a desperate attempt to cover it up, he
gave the money back to my co-defendant's attorney

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.399
and he had convicted me to cover it up.

00:14:43.399 --> 00:14:48.120
At this present time, this judge has served
13 years in prison for doin' this.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:54.290
He is the first and the most corrupt judge
in American history to be found guilty of

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:58.629
sendin' individuals to Death Row to cover
up a bribe.

00:14:58.629 --> 00:15:01.689
At that point, I got a new trial.

00:15:01.689 --> 00:15:04.399
I was found not guilty at my new trial.

00:15:04.399 --> 00:15:10.459
I represented myself on my certificate of
innocence before the chief judge of Cooke

00:15:10.459 --> 00:15:11.610
County.

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:15.320
Against the very prosecutors who was tryin'
to send me back to Death Row.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.320
And I won.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:22.220
A certificate of innocence is a legal document
that declares that legally you were innocent.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:29.509
After that, I filed the largest lawsuit in
Illinois history for a wrongful conviction.

00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:30.910
Thank you.

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:33.009
&gt;&gt;Alan: So, Jeannie.

00:15:33.009 --> 00:15:36.019
You've seen it from the inside as well.

00:15:36.019 --> 00:15:38.199
On the other side of the cell block.

00:15:38.199 --> 00:15:39.279
Can you tell me your story?

00:15:39.279 --> 00:15:40.279
&gt;&gt;Jeannie: Yes.

00:15:40.279 --> 00:15:42.101
Thank you so much for having me here.

00:15:42.101 --> 00:15:44.749
And your stories are just so touching.

00:15:44.749 --> 00:15:48.490
It's just so difficult to believe that in
America we have to worry about issues like

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:49.490
this.

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:50.490
But we do.

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:55.129
So I started at San Quentin State Prison in
1978, two weeks after graduating from Sonoma

00:15:55.129 --> 00:15:57.499
State University with a degree in Criminal
Justice.

00:15:57.499 --> 00:15:59.449
I started as a correctional officer.

00:15:59.449 --> 00:16:03.309
At that time Death Row had about eight inmates
on it.

00:16:03.309 --> 00:16:06.819
I stayed at San Quentin for over 26 years.

00:16:06.819 --> 00:16:11.040
Promoting up through the ranks until I became
the Warden in 1999.

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:15.980
And during that time, I saw Death Row grow
from the eight inmates that were there when

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:18.749
I started to where it is today.

00:16:18.749 --> 00:16:22.540
We have over 725 people on Death Row in the
state of California.

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:25.399
It's the largest Death Row in the United States.

00:16:25.399 --> 00:16:27.889
When I became the warden in 1999.

00:16:27.889 --> 00:16:31.740
Let's just say, I feel like I've grown up
with the death penalty, 'cause I've seen it

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.779
from every point of view and from every position.

00:16:34.779 --> 00:16:36.580
Working within a prison.

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:38.529
Having worked on Death Row as a correctional
officer.

00:16:38.529 --> 00:16:40.269
As a counselor.

00:16:40.269 --> 00:16:41.860
As a captain.

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:44.569
And then I became the chief deputy and then
finally the warden.

00:16:44.569 --> 00:16:50.499
But when I became the warden in 1999, it became
my responsibility to carry out executions.

00:16:50.499 --> 00:16:53.220
And so I've been involved in four executions.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:56.250
I've always been morally opposed to the death
penalty.

00:16:56.250 --> 00:17:00.270
But when you're the warden, you tell yourself
it is your job to carry out the laws on behalf

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:02.949
of the citizens of the state of California.

00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:04.870
But then I want you to think about that.

00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:07.490
What is it that we ask of public servants?

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:09.159
So I describe it this way.

00:17:09.159 --> 00:17:14.399
As the warden, you get up 30 to 60 days prior
to a scheduled execution.

00:17:14.399 --> 00:17:16.790
You put on your clothes and you get ready
to go to work.

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:18.860
You hug your husband goodbye.

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:21.839
You tell your children to have a great day
at school.

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:22.880
You get in your car.

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:26.669
And for me I drove the 28 miles to San Quentin,
knowing that I was going there to carry out

00:17:26.669 --> 00:17:28.520
an execution.

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:32.830
And as the warden it's not only your job to
carry out an execution, it's your job to lead

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:36.059
your staff through that process.

00:17:36.059 --> 00:17:39.550
And staff are involved in this process for
many reasons.

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:44.909
But most people believe that they're there
carrying out the laws as the citizens expect

00:17:44.909 --> 00:17:46.770
them to do.

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:52.370
So you end up the night of the execution,
and you see it from every point of view.

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:55.539
You see the victim's family members come to
the execution.

00:17:55.539 --> 00:17:58.390
The inmate's family and their legal team.

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:03.710
You watch the faces of your staff as you're
carrying out that execution.

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:10.100
And then after each execution, someone on
my staff would say something like "Did we

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.640
improve public safety in California today?"

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:16.649
And we never answered that question because
we knew the answer was "No."

00:18:16.649 --> 00:18:21.049
And so you start to think about this from
a public policy point of view.

00:18:21.049 --> 00:18:23.750
And you look at the cost of executions.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:29.250
The state of California spent four billion
dollars on the death penalty since 1978.

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:31.280
Four billion dollars.

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:34.429
We've carried out 13 executions.

00:18:34.429 --> 00:18:38.500
That means that each execution was over 300
million dollars.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:42.559
And then because I've spent over 30 years
in criminal justice I've really studied the

00:18:42.559 --> 00:18:44.590
science of criminal justice.

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:46.420
And I believe I know what works.

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:51.809
And what really works to keep us safe is to
spend our resources solving crime.

00:18:51.809 --> 00:18:56.910
And in the state of California, 46 percent
of homicides and 56 percent of reported rapes

00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:59.690
go unsolved each year in this state.

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:03.380
And we know what makes us safer is having
more police on the streets.

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:09.679
And yet, in California today, many communities
are removing police from, because of our economic

00:19:09.679 --> 00:19:11.000
crisis.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.180
And so, I am the proponent of this initiative
because I believe in public safety.

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:20.399
And I believe we can use our resources in
a much more productive way that improves public

00:19:20.399 --> 00:19:22.620
safety in the state of California.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:26.260
And keeps our children and our communities
safer.

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:29.419
Thank you.

00:19:29.419 --> 00:19:30.991
&gt;&gt;Alan: Thank you.

00:19:30.991 --> 00:19:31.991
Natasha.

00:19:31.991 --> 00:19:32.991
&gt;&gt;Natasha: Thank you Alan.

00:19:32.991 --> 00:19:34.399
Thank you very much to everyone at Google
for having us here today.

00:19:34.399 --> 00:19:38.760
And I just have to say, it's really an honor
to sit on the stage with these individuals.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.600
And to work with folks like this.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.120
Who have been through so much.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.600
And bring so much personal experience to this.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.990
As Alan said, this is a personal issue for
people.

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:52.950
And it's easy to think that the Death Penalty
doesn't touch our lives.

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:54.370
It touches many people's lives.

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:56.330
And you've heard some of their stories.

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:58.700
And I'm sure you will have questions for them.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:01.570
I am the campaign manager for the SAFE California
Act.

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:06.110
The SAFE California Act is an initiative that
will be on the November ballot this year in

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:07.380
California.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.250
The initiative does three things.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:13.929
It will replace the Death Penalty with life
without possibility of parole as the maximum

00:20:13.929 --> 00:20:16.020
punishment for murder.

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:21.110
It requires every person convicted of murder
to work in prison and pay restitution to the

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:23.480
victim's compensation fund.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:27.289
And it will take a portion of the money that
we are going to save by replacing the Death

00:20:27.289 --> 00:20:32.510
Penalty and direct it to local law enforcement
for the purpose of increasing the rate at

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:36.630
which we solve rape and murder cases here
in California.

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:41.130
The SAFE California Act will make sure that
we never execute an innocent person here in

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:42.660
California.

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:46.030
You have just heard Randy and Nate's stories
from Illinois.

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:48.799
These problems happen here in California as
well.

00:20:48.799 --> 00:20:54.620
Hundreds of people have been wrongfully convicted
in California of serious crimes.

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:57.690
Many of them have been wrongfully convicted
of murder.

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:01.460
People like Franky Carrillo, who works with
us on this campaign.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:06.570
Franky was just 16 years old when he was wrongfully
convicted of a murder.

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:10.080
It took 20 years for him to prove his innocence.

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:15.010
These two men served, themselves, almost two
decades in prison for crimes they did not

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:16.010
commit.

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:20.710
These mistakes are serious and as Jeannie
said, they continue to happen.

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:25.840
The only way we can prevent the execution
of an innocent person in California is if

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:30.440
we replace the Death Penalty with the SAFE
California Act this November.

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:36.580
The initiative will also save California over
100 million dollars each year.

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:40.780
It's surprising to many people, but the Death
Penalty is enormously expensive.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:45.799
Much more expensive than the alternative of
life without possibility of parole.

00:21:45.799 --> 00:21:49.140
And that's because the entire process is more
complicated.

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:51.510
In fact it's a double trial process.

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:56.000
A Death Penalty trial involves stage one where
you decide if the person actually committed

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000
the crime.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.350
Just like every other criminal trial.

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:02.659
But then there's a whole second trial where
we decide whether the person gets death or

00:22:02.659 --> 00:22:04.659
life without parole.

00:22:04.659 --> 00:22:07.590
Two trials requires two lawyers on the defense
team.

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:08.670
Two investigators.

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:11.090
The prosecution team is even larger.

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:14.779
It takes months just to select a jury in a
Death Penalty case.

00:22:14.779 --> 00:22:18.679
And the judge has to be specially qualified
as well.

00:22:18.679 --> 00:22:21.269
This is all just to get to the death sentence.

00:22:21.269 --> 00:22:27.399
After that, there's literally 25 years of
appeals in California Death Penalty cases.

00:22:27.399 --> 00:22:31.010
25 years of court processes and more attorneys
that we pay for.

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:35.710
And one of the most surprising things is that
the housing in Death Row cases here in California

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:39.610
is more expensive than life without possibility
of parole.

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:44.690
If those 724 people who are now on Death Row
were sentenced to life without parole instead,

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:51.980
we would actually save 30 million dollars
a year just in the extra housing costs alone.

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:56.131
You all know that California is in the midst
of a terrible economic crisis and that we

00:22:56.131 --> 00:22:57.940
are facing terrible budget cuts.

00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:03.800
Just today in fact, the governor signed a
new budget with deeper cuts to social services.

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.460
Cuts to Healthy Families.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:09.679
I actually can't believe we live in a state
where we are cutting a program called Healthy

00:23:09.679 --> 00:23:12.529
Families that gives health insurance to poor
children.

00:23:12.529 --> 00:23:14.470
But we just cut that program.

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:18.250
Because we just don't have the money we need
for the things we need.

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:24.169
And meanwhile we waste over 100 million dollars
a year, every year, on a terribly broken death

00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:25.740
penalty in this state.

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:27.510
That's why we need the SAFE California Act.

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:32.510
And the initiative for a three year period
will direct 30 million dollars a year to local

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:34.440
law enforcement.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:38.600
Specifically to increase the rate at which
we solve rape and murder cases.

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:44.100
I was shocked when I learned that 46 percent
of murders go unsolved and 56 percent of reported

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:47.779
rapes go unsolved every year in California.

00:23:47.779 --> 00:23:50.230
And behind those numbers are real people.

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:51.880
And real families.

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:56.110
People like Lorrain Taylor, Lorrain Taylor's
twin sons were murdered in Oakland.

00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:58.389
Two kids in college.

00:23:58.389 --> 00:23:59.389
Their car broke down.

00:23:59.389 --> 00:24:01.650
They were on the side of the road trying to
fix it.

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:03.500
In the wrong neighborhood.

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.790
And they were shot and killed in a drive by
shooting.

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:08.789
The person who killed them has never been
caught.

00:24:08.789 --> 00:24:11.610
Lorraine Taylor has a group that she works
with.

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:14.910
Other mothers and fathers who have lost children
to gun violence.

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:19.650
And every week she goes down to the homicide
department in Oakland and she asks about their

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:20.650
cases.

00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:25.639
And every day, every week, when she meets
with the head of Homicide, he sits and says

00:24:25.639 --> 00:24:28.389
to her, "I'm sorry Ms. Taylor.

00:24:28.389 --> 00:24:30.139
I don't have anything for you on this case.

00:24:30.139 --> 00:24:33.510
" And she says "What about this case?" and
he says "I'm sorry Ms. Taylor.

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:36.110
We have no leads in that case either."

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:40.519
It was Lorraine who told me that the Oakland
police department couldn't afford to have

00:24:40.519 --> 00:24:42.809
a fingerprint analyst.

00:24:42.809 --> 00:24:45.100
And so for a while they stopped collecting
fingerprints.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:50.750
Those are the kinds of basic public safety
needs that are not getting met right now in

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:51.750
California.

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:56.740
As we lay off police officers and cut core
services to our law enforcement.

00:24:56.740 --> 00:25:01.000
So by ending the waste on the death penalty,
we are going to be able to redirect money

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.970
to our most important needs like our kid's
schools.

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:09.590
And for three years, we are gonna direct funds
directly to local law enforcement to meet

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:12.110
the most important public safety need in California.

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:16.830
Which is catching the killers and the rapists
who are still walking free in our streets.

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:19.409
That is why we call this the SAFE California
Act.

00:25:19.409 --> 00:25:22.899
Because this is about making California a
safe place.

00:25:22.899 --> 00:25:25.690
Protecting the innocent from wrongful execution.

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:30.570
And protecting every one of our families from
the people who are out there who could commit

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:31.809
harm.

00:25:31.809 --> 00:25:36.120
And so we are gonna ask you to support the
SAFE California Act this November as a really

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:40.510
important step for making California the kind
of place we all wanna live in.

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:41.510
&gt;&gt;Alan: Great.

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:42.510
Thank you.

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:46.140
So you guys please, ask questions.

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.980
You know, it'd be great to get your impressions.

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:51.080
But I'll start here.

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:56.020
Lemme just tell you, I'm, people ask me why
I donated to this particular cause.

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:59.350
And it really came down to one thing for me.

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:03.820
Is that our standard for guilt and innocence
is beyond a reasonable doubt.

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:05.350
And that's a perfectly fine standard.

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:09.419
I think that's a standard where you know,
for somebody that's shoplifting.

00:26:09.419 --> 00:26:11.950
That seems like a perfectly reasonable standard.

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:14.080
But to put this man to death?

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:15.270
I don't know.

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:21.090
It just, for me, doesn't feel like that's
the standard that we need.

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:26.159
And that we as Californians would feel comfortable
with that standard being applied in these

00:26:26.159 --> 00:26:28.030
kinds of cases.

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:32.549
And I think it would be a harder problem to
change the whole standards associated with

00:26:32.549 --> 00:26:33.549
it.

00:26:33.549 --> 00:26:42.200
And obviously it's also a problem in my mind,
of how wildly diverging that standard has

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:46.210
been applied, based on ethnicity.

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:47.500
Based on what state you're in.

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.660
based on prosecutors.

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:50.780
Based on other things.

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:56.919
And I can't sit back and have the feeling
that we as Californians, and we as Americans

00:26:56.919 --> 00:26:58.520
are being fair.

00:26:58.520 --> 00:26:59.840
And that we're doing the right thing.

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.539
And the money is obviously important too.

00:27:01.539 --> 00:27:06.570
But I feel like, you know, the basic fairness
of the system is what I worry about most.

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:07.570
Go ahead, please.

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:08.570
Ask your question.

00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:09.789
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Well thank you for coming today.

00:27:09.789 --> 00:27:14.600
I'm actually somebody who's gone back and
forth on the issue.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:18.080
I fully supported the death penalty, and then
completely against it.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:25.480
And I can't seem to really fully 100 percent
decide on which way to go.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:35.529
I think my issue is more a fear of people
like Charles Manson and John Wayne Gacy, and

00:27:35.529 --> 00:27:40.480
people who get life in prison, and become,
you know.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:44.840
Even without the possibility of parole, a
judgment down the line from the Supreme Court

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:50.419
can say "Oh, this new judgment says that these
people can be let off."

00:27:50.419 --> 00:27:54.909
And then a new wave of appeals happen, and
people like that may be set free.

00:27:54.909 --> 00:27:56.630
I mean, that's an extreme example.

00:27:56.630 --> 00:28:01.799
But I think that's where a fear of mine lies.

00:28:01.799 --> 00:28:04.470
Why I've gone back and forth on that.

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:12.440
So, I, don't, I understand the rationale behind
it.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:20.059
But the emotional side of me, I can't seem
to let that fear go.

00:28:20.059 --> 00:28:29.230
And I think as the more cases you see of serial
killers coming up, and I am completely ashamed

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:31.270
of the legal system what happened to you two
and stuff.

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:34.269
And I know it actually happens often.

00:28:34.269 --> 00:28:38.309
At the same time, I have to kind of look at
my safety as well.

00:28:38.309 --> 00:28:40.240
And my family members.

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:46.120
So, how do you kind of tackle that issue when
you're going out and you're trying to convince

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.019
people that this is the right thing to do?

00:28:48.019 --> 00:28:49.799
&gt;&gt;Randy: Can I address that?

00:28:49.799 --> 00:28:54.409
&gt;&gt;Alan: Sure, and I think there's, I actually
had this conversation with Natasha a while

00:28:54.409 --> 00:28:55.409
back.

00:28:55.409 --> 00:28:58.610
And I think this is a core issue and I'm glad
you brought it up right at the beginning.

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:03.090
&gt;&gt;Randy: You know, I, like you, come from
a conservative family.

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:05.429
My granddad was a Deputy Sheriff.

00:29:05.429 --> 00:29:07.950
My brother was State Police.

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:12.850
And I used to see those people being put in
handcuffs, drug across the TV screen.

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:16.760
And "Yeah, they look guilty to me, and they're
being charged with child rape and murder.

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:19.299
Yeah, they need to hang 'em."

00:29:19.299 --> 00:29:23.210
That's before I realized, I was naive to the
system.

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:24.950
And most of us are.

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:27.300
Because we all grew up watching Dragnet.

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:30.019
And Mayberry RFD.

00:29:30.019 --> 00:29:33.600
And all those shows that show a moral to the
story at the end.

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.600
OK?

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:36.110
That's Hollywood.

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:42.610
But that has given us blind allegiance to
these people that are in the criminal justice

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:43.610
system.

00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:44.610
The judges.

00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:49.059
Officer Friendly with the shiny badge that
gets up there and takes the oath of office.

00:29:49.059 --> 00:29:52.920
The prosecutor who says "The people, your
honor.

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.700
Ladies and gentlemen, the people."

00:29:55.700 --> 00:30:02.740
You see, it's this blind allegiance that the
criminal justice system makes no mistakes.

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:05.830
That has affected all the people.

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:09.600
They don't want you to think there's any chink
in their armor.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.649
Because we know the banking industry's flawed.

00:30:11.649 --> 00:30:13.960
We know the medical industry is flawed.

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:16.270
Our government is corrupt.

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:20.720
But they don't want you to think the criminal
justice system is.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:29.090
It's that blind allegiance that put 139 men
and one woman, on Death Row in this country.

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:34.240
Now the 140 of us, we're the very fortunate
ones, the lucky ones.

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:40.940
The ones that college kids are resources outside
the judicial system, helped expose the truth

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:42.899
and free 'em.

00:30:42.899 --> 00:30:45.550
How many others weren't as fortunate as me
and Nate.

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:46.670
Settin' here.

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:51.519
That's because you have a system in place,
a life and death system.

00:30:51.519 --> 00:30:53.990
It's an irreversible punishment.

00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:58.930
And as Nate so eloquently always says, it's
the human factor.

00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:00.019
Those judges.

00:31:00.019 --> 00:31:01.820
Those prosecutors.

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:04.070
These defense lawyers.

00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:05.160
They're not some god.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.669
They are flesh and blood humans.

00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:14.460
Who whether intentionally, or just an honest
mistake, make mistakes because they're human.

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:19.809
And jurors oftentimes convict people just
to be safe.

00:31:19.809 --> 00:31:24.030
&gt;&gt;Alan: So let me go back to Natasha and I.

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:29.259
And Jeannie, I think, also have it but to
get to the point of what are the chances of

00:31:29.259 --> 00:31:35.440
somebody actually coming out, given life,
a guilty person coming out after life without

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:36.440
parole?

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:38.379
&gt;&gt;Natasha: Let's ask the warden.

00:31:38.379 --> 00:31:43.470
&gt;&gt;Jeannie: So a person serving life without
possibility of parole has no opportunity to

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:47.590
be released unless they're able to prove themself
innocent.

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:49.049
That's the only way.

00:31:49.049 --> 00:31:52.159
And the only way that law could be changed
in the state of California is to go back to

00:31:52.159 --> 00:31:53.159
the voters.

00:31:53.159 --> 00:31:54.799
If the voters wanted to change it.

00:31:54.799 --> 00:31:56.890
And I think that's virtually impossible.

00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:58.350
And then you mentioned Charlie Manson.

00:31:58.350 --> 00:32:01.230
So I do wanna tell you about Charlie Manson.

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:04.779
Charlie Manson isn't on Death Row because
the US Supreme Court overturned the death

00:32:04.779 --> 00:32:05.919
penalty.

00:32:05.919 --> 00:32:09.669
And at that point in time when they did that,
life without possibility of parole was not

00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:12.120
a punishment available in California.

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:14.940
It is now a punishment available in California.

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:18.659
And no one gets out who is serving life without
possibility of parole unless they prove themself

00:32:18.659 --> 00:32:19.659
innocent.

00:32:19.659 --> 00:32:23.049
And we do have one individual, Obie Anthony,
who also works for Death Penalty Focus as

00:32:23.049 --> 00:32:28.490
a justice advocate, who was serving life without
possibility of parole and he was exonerated.

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:30.500
Now he could have easily been on Death Row.

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:34.510
But the fact that he was serving life without
possibility of parole allowed him the opportunity

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:36.379
to prove his innocence and he did.

00:32:36.379 --> 00:32:39.549
&gt;&gt;Natasha: And I'm really glad you brought
that up and asked that question.

00:32:39.549 --> 00:32:42.700
'cause I do think for a lot of people, that's
the core issue here.

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:45.190
Is everyone wants to have safe families.

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:50.600
And how do you guarantee that we're gonna
have safety in our communities in California.

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:55.490
Just yesterday we had an event in Los Angeles
with victims and murder victim family members

00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:57.279
who support the SAFE California Act.

00:32:57.279 --> 00:33:02.490
There are now over 400 murder victim family
members who have endorsed the initiative.

00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:05.779
One of the speakers yesterday is a woman named
Rose.

00:33:05.779 --> 00:33:10.910
Rose was raped when she was 22 years old by
a serial killer.

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:14.460
The serial killer actually killed five women.

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:18.250
She is one of two women who survived his brutal
assault.

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:24.030
And as a 22 year old woman, she knew she had
to do everything possible to make sure he

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:26.600
never hurt another woman again.

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:30.850
And she actually testified against him in
three trials.

00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:33.480
Until he was sentenced to death twice.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:37.809
That's how committed she was to making sure
that he would never hurt anyone.

00:33:37.809 --> 00:33:40.580
That was 28 years ago.

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:42.299
He still sits on Death Row.

00:33:42.299 --> 00:33:45.429
And the appeals process continues.

00:33:45.429 --> 00:33:48.269
And Rose now supports the SAFE California
Act.

00:33:48.269 --> 00:33:54.210
Because she has realized that actually the
best way to ensure that he never hurts someone

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:59.269
else again, and that California communities
are safe, is with life without possibility

00:33:59.269 --> 00:34:00.320
of parole.

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:04.299
She knows that if he is sentenced to life
without parole, he will never get out.

00:34:04.299 --> 00:34:07.030
He will actually be forced to work in prison.

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:08.630
Which he doesn't now.

00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:12.010
He will pay into the victim's compensation
fund.

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:15.370
And it will put an end to the appeals.

00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:18.330
Which have literally tortured her for 28 years.

00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:24.140
She has seen that in fact, the death penalty
is actually really just helping him.

00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:25.140
Because he has lawyers.

00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:28.610
And he has special privileges by being on
Death Row.

00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:30.990
And what she wants is to forget about him.

00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:36.980
What she wants is for the money that's being
spent on his case to go into things like violence

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:38.800
prevention and treatment.

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.910
So that people like him aren't made.

00:34:40.910 --> 00:34:42.290
Aren't created.

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:44.470
Don't come to be in California anymore.

00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:45.920
She was just one of the speakers.

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:48.810
Another woman who was with us yesterday is
Nova Reeves.

00:34:48.810 --> 00:34:52.280
Her mother was killed by a serial killer in
Washington State.

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:54.280
She was 16 years old.

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.540
For over ten years she didn't know.

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:57.840
They didn't know where her mother was.

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:58.840
They didn't know.

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:00.350
It took ten years to even solve the crime.

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:05.650
And the killer, that serial killer is serving
life without possibility of parole.

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:11.300
And she described how that for her, was a
moment that let her move on with her life.

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:12.800
This was sort of closure.

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.130
There will never be closure.

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:17.480
You cannot close the hole in your heart.

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:18.940
She'll never get her mother back.

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:21.760
Rose will never get her youth back.

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:25.480
But they can be freed from the criminal justice
system.

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:29.420
In a sense of life without parole guarantees
safety for the community.

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:32.560
It means dangerous people will never get out.

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:37.080
But it also lets us shift our resources to
what we really need to do.

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:41.510
Which is actually catching more killers and
rapists who literally walk free right now.

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:48.000
So this initiative is supported by victims
who have been through the worst possible experiences.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.070
Law enforcement who have seen the system firsthand.

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:55.300
As well as innocent people who know that we
can always make a mistake.

00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:57.510
&gt;&gt;Alan: Please, go ahead.

00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:02.550
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Do you see any positive trends
in other states of overturning the death penalty.

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:06.880
And why do you think this is, I mean I know
state's rights issues, but why isn't' it a

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:07.880
federal issue as well?

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:10.450
&gt;&gt;Natasha: So I'll answer the second one first.

00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:13.980
And then I'm actually going to ask Randy and
Nate to describe their work in other states.

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:18.000
So the death penalty is enacted state by state.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.580
Each state makes a decision about whether
they wanna have the death penalty on their

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:22.580
books.

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:27.310
And as of now, we have 17 states that actually
have chosen to use life without parole instead

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:28.810
of the death penalty.

00:36:28.810 --> 00:36:33.880
And it's not a federal issue in the sense
that you couldn't pass a federal law that

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:37.680
would say to a state "You can't have the death
penalty."

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:40.890
That the states have the right to determine
their own criminal laws.

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:45.030
The only way the issue can be addressed on
a federal level of the entire country would

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:47.540
be through a US Supreme Court decision.

00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:51.170
As Jeannie mentioned, there was actually a
period where the US Supreme Court threw out

00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:53.330
the death penalty for the entire country.

00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:59.280
But then they allowed new death penalty laws
in 1976 that they thought were gonna fix the

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.280
problems.

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:04.510
We know 34 years later that we have all the
same problems that we did before.

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:09.520
It's clear that the Supreme Court will not
rule, not get rid of the death penalty across

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:14.760
the entire country until enough states on
their own have changed their laws.

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:19.290
At a certain point the Supreme Court may say
"Enough states have done away with the death

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:21.560
penalty that the rest of the country has to."

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:23.200
But we're not at that point yet.

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.810
So I know that Randy and Nate have been really
active in other states.

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:28.620
So maybe you could talk about the importance
of what's going on there.

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:33.530
&gt;&gt;Randy: Well Witness to Innocence has worked
in the last five states that have abolished

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:35.370
the death penalty.

00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:41.330
And I worked in New Mexico, Connecticut, Illinois,
and we've worked in Maryland.

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:45.160
We've worked in Wisconsin to keep it from
coming back.

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:49.590
And I believe that each state is different.

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:54.030
On their approach to why they should do away
with the death penalty.

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:57.850
Illinois, for example, was the mistakes that
they've made.

00:37:57.850 --> 00:37:59.690
They had to acknowledge it.

00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:04.500
There was 160 men on Death Row and 20 of us
were actually innocent.

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:10.710
Now, you wouldn't get on an airplane if there
was 20 chances in 160 it was gonna crash.

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:16.150
But yet, the death penalty had crashed years
before they put a moratorium in place.

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:18.430
And years before they abolished it.

00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:22.230
And I think it's those mistakes and that cost.

00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:24.670
Each state works on a different approach.

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:29.590
And if you could educate the people about
the death penalty, the millions of dollars

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:30.860
that they will save.

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:32.310
Like California, for instance.

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:34.380
It couldn't be any better example.

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:36.170
28 years of appeals.

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:43.460
Now, do you think capital qualified defense
lawyers and a prosecutors wanna see the death

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:44.460
penalty abolished?

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:45.840
No. you know why?

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.710
It's a cash cow for 'em.

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:53.180
It's nothing more than a stimulus package
that the tax payers are payin' the bill.

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:59.270
When you can give somebody life without parole,
and this is just my own personal opinion.

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:01.920
Because of being on Death Row.

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:04.330
And then as opposed to life without parole.

00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:08.670
When you gotta deal with 1000 more violent.

00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:10.530
More hate, more rage.

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:14.280
That there was times, had they rolled that
gurney by my cell, I'd have buckled myself

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:16.690
on it.

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:22.610
Most people have no idea the horrors of maximum
security penitentiary life.

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:27.920
And to me, being executed would have been
early release.

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:29.620
It's a miserable existence.

00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:35.910
At least when you have life without parole,
you don't risk the possibility of executing

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:37.080
an innocent person.

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:39.930
Because you can release an innocent person
from prison.

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:41.650
You can't release him from the grave.

00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:44.150
And Nate and I are perfect examples of that.

00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:45.280
&gt;&gt;Alan: Good.

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:51.760
&gt;&gt;Nathan: I wanna say something' on the first
young lady that spoke about the innocence

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:52.760
factor.

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:58.450
My position when it comes to the death penalty
is primarily the human factor.

00:39:58.450 --> 00:40:01.180
And that is, we all make mistakes.

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:03.360
We do it all the time.

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:08.510
We can be feeding the baby with a bottle and
we take the nipple and it hits the baby's

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:09.640
chin.

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:10.790
Mistake.

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:12.780
We can make a wrong turn.

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:14.130
Mistake.

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:16.310
One person can get it wrong.

00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:19.130
12 people can get it wrong.

00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:22.230
100 people can make an honest mistake.

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:23.730
We see it in baseball games.

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:26.250
The player slide into the second base.

00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:29.230
The umpire says "He's out."

00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:33.440
On first review, he really was safe.

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:37.100
That man can come out the dugout, and go back
to second base.

00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:41.000
But you can't bring a man back from the graveyard.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.800
And that's it right there.

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:45.180
You don't want that innocence factor there.

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:48.620
That you know that we all susceptible to.

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:50.900
No matter how much we might wanna deny it.

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:52.840
It is so true.

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:54.630
We make mistakes.

00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:57.090
And who wanna be a mistake?

00:40:57.090 --> 00:40:58.740
Thank you.

00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:00.380
&gt;&gt;Alan: Thanks.

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:04.530
So one thing I wanted to, uh, are you comin'
up?

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:05.530
Go ahead.

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:11.170
&gt;&gt;Female #3: So, it's clear to me that ballot
initiatives in California are very hotly contested.

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:15.690
And I'm interested to know a little bit about
what you anticipate the opposition is against

00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:16.690
this bill?

00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:17.690
How strong it will be.

00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:19.590
How much funding there is.

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:20.590
To oppose it.

00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:22.400
Just tell us a little bit more about that.

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:28.590
&gt;&gt;Natasha: Sure, so the main opposition is
the California District Attorney's Association.

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:31.820
And they are currently only a little bit active.

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:34.560
We haven't seen a lot of activity from the
opposition.

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:36.920
But that's actually pretty typical for ballot
initiatives.

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:40.530
The real heat of the campaign will happen
in the fall.

00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:45.040
It's a little bit hard to predict how much
money the other side will have.

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:50.060
We are facing a big filing deadline of June
30th when all of the political campaigns have

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:53.960
to do their disclosures about how much money
they have in the bank.

00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:56.620
So we'll have a little bit more information
about that.

00:41:56.620 --> 00:42:01.370
But honestly, we really won't know until the
fall, how much money the opposition will have.

00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:03.590
And how much money our campaign will have.

00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:08.080
I can tell you kind of just to give you a
sense of scale, this is not going to be the

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:13.000
biggest spending initiative fight this year
in November.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000
In California.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:19.390
There are, we're looking at initiatives on
the ballot related to taxes, and union dues,

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:24.530
those issues we are expecting each side to
spend 40 million dollars or more in those

00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:25.590
campaigns.

00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:28.690
Our goal for our campaign is much smaller.

00:42:28.690 --> 00:42:32.570
But we believe that we know from the polling,
I can tell you, that the California voters

00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:33.900
support this initiative.

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:37.590
A majority of California voters are on our
side.

00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:42.520
And so we are hopeful that with not as many
millions as you'll see in those other fights,

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:47.460
that we'll be able to get our message to the
key voters in California.

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:52.310
And really do view this as our moment when
we will win this initiative in California.

00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:56.520
&gt;&gt;Alan: So, I want to, go ahead.

00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:57.520
Come on.

00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:59.240
My goal is not to ask any questions.

00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:00.240
You know?

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:02.450
So if you guys don't do it then you're gonna
be forced with my questions.

00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:03.450
&gt;&gt;Male #1: I'll try to help you.

00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:04.450
Yeah.

00:43:04.450 --> 00:43:05.450
I just have a quick question.

00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:07.950
I'm wondering if the two gentlemen that were
on Death Row can go into a little bit more

00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:15.120
detail about what it's like for the experience
of being on Death Row, versus life in parole?

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:18.520
Because I think, financially it makes a lot
of sense to me.

00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:23.670
And I'm wondering what it's actually like
if you're accused, experientially, in prison.

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:25.190
&gt;&gt;Nathan: Well.

00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:32.960
[sighs] Death Row is, I mean, when you're
somewhere that you know you's not supposed

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:38.400
to be, for somethin' that you didn't do, you're
not comfortable at all.

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:43.740
If you're in prison, doin' a life sentence,
and you there, you there because you supposed

00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:49.420
to be there for somethin' that you did, it's
a entirely different mentality.

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:57.210
So Death Row, it creates this stress, it creates
tension, every single day that can really

00:43:57.210 --> 00:43:59.940
just cause your mind to just break in half.

00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:01.230
So to speak.

00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:04.320
You get news from your daughter that she's
hurt.

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.820
Or that her birthday is comin' up.

00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:07.750
And you can't attend.

00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:12.570
You get news like I did, that my mother had
died of a heart attack.

00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:16.960
Right in the middle of tryin' to hold my everything
together.

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.630
It just totally different.

00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:19.630
And you're there.

00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:20.630
On the yard.

00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:22.180
With a friend.

00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:24.780
Who you met while you was on Death Row.

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:26.830
Who's scheduled to be executed the next day.

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:29.380
It is so different.

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:36.310
When you there, and you talkin' to a individual
who tomorrow, he's gonna be gone.

00:44:36.310 --> 00:44:39.530
I feel that's the difference right there.

00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:42.950
The pressure that comes with the death penalty.

00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:47.440
&gt;&gt;Natasha: Maybe I can ask Jeannie to jump
in on this too, since she's the most familiar

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:50.050
with California's security systems.

00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:55.330
&gt;&gt;Jeannie: So Death Row in California is different
than Death Row was in Illinois.

00:44:55.330 --> 00:44:58.180
Because they were only allowed out of their
cell one hour a day.

00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:04.430
But in California, inmates who are on Death
Row are single celled, they're either in their

00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:09.360
cells watching TV or they're out on an exercise
yard.

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:12.910
Which they're allowed to go to seven days
a week for six hours a day.

00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:15.240
In California they have a legal team.

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:17.050
For life.

00:45:17.050 --> 00:45:19.330
So they're, they receive a lot of visits.

00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:21.940
That legal team tends to take care of them.

00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:22.970
Sends them packages.

00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:24.960
Christmas presents.

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:27.120
Make sure they have newspapers.

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:30.720
So they're really, they really depend on that
legal team.

00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:36.190
And they have visiting, what else did I forget?

00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:40.490
So, I will tell you, as the warden of San
Quentin I met every arriving, newly arrived

00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:43.900
death row inmate in what we call classification.

00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:48.910
And I met at least 3 inmates who had asked
for the death penalty.

00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:53.710
Because they understood that Death Row was
an easier way of doing time in California

00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:56.480
than serving the sentence of life without
possibility of parole.

00:45:56.480 --> 00:46:00.410
Because in this state, when you're serving
life without possibility of parole, you're

00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:02.090
in a maximum security prison.

00:46:02.090 --> 00:46:03.090
You're double-celled.

00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:05.270
You're expected to work.

00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:08.190
You're allowed to have visiting only two days
a week.

00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:11.570
If there's enough room in the visiting room
for you to have visitors.

00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:13.840
Because there's a capacity on each of the
visiting rooms.

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:17.010
And often people will travel to prisons in
California and be turned away because the

00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:18.640
visiting room is full.

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:23.830
So you can earn greater privileges if you
have life without possibility of parole, but

00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:24.830
that is the difference.

00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:26.720
You have to earn those privileges.

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:30.160
On Death Row, those things are given to you
in the state of California.

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:34.170
That's why it's so much more expensive to
be on Death Row in terms of the housing of

00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:35.750
Death Row inmates.

00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:38.230
Because you're isolated from the general population.

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:41.870
And either we're bringing the services to
you, or we're bringing you to the services.

00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:45.750
So lot's of staff involved in all the processes
I just described.

00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:54.490
&gt;&gt;Alan: So, one thing that I think has, uh,
focused the issue more than any other thing

00:46:54.490 --> 00:46:59.100
in the last 10 or 15 years, is DNA.

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:00.320
And DNA analysis.

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:04.490
And the technology that has changed.

00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:11.740
Which offers potentially irrefutable proof
of innocence.

00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:14.560
And has cut through some of the layers of
bureaucracy.

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:17.790
So, you wanna talk a little bit about the
technology changes?

00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:21.960
Since we're, there's a room, with a lot of
technologists involved.

00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:22.960
&gt;&gt;Natasha: Absolutely.

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:26.920
So DNA is probably what's captured people's
attention and brought the issue of innocence

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:29.990
to the public in a way that few things have.

00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:31.650
I'll let Jeannie actually address this.

00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:35.310
'cause she talks about how much law enforcement
has learned from DNA.

00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:39.880
But what's interesting is these two men, didn't
say the words DNA when they explained to you

00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:41.750
how they were proven innocent.

00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:45.240
In fact, their cases didn't involve DNA evidence.

00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:47.150
&gt;&gt;Alan: Or any physical evidence at all.

00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:48.150
&gt;&gt;Natasha: or any physical evidence.

00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:51.390
So that's the thing, when there's no physical
evidence, it also means there's no physical

00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:53.120
evidence to prove that you're innocent.

00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:59.450
So in fact, DNA evidence is available in only
about 15 percent of homicide cases.

00:47:59.450 --> 00:48:04.360
And in those cases, you can have that tool
available to tell you if this is the right

00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:05.360
person or not.

00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:07.790
But in fact, the majority of cases there are
no witnesses.

00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:09.690
There is no DNA.

00:48:09.690 --> 00:48:13.010
And the kinds of mistakes we heard about continue
to happen.

00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:17.670
So while DNA is an incredible tool that has
been very helpful in showing us that we make

00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:21.610
mistakes, it isn't the silver bullet that's
gonna make sure that we never make mistakes.

00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:24.060
But I think Jeannie's perspective is also
helpful in this.

00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:27.810
&gt;&gt;Jeannie: Well, what I say about DNA is that
DNA has taught us in law enforcement not to

00:48:27.810 --> 00:48:29.280
believe everything we think.

00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:35.330
Through DNA we found out that eyewitness testimony
is wrong more often than it's right.

00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:40.460
We found out that people falsely confess to
crimes.

00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:45.120
And we found out, which I think we all, we
knew all along, we just didn't wanna admit

00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:49.920
we knew it, is that jailhouse snitches lie
most of the time.

00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:55.520
And it's because of DNA that we have the growing
number of exonerees in the state of California

00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:57.360
and around the country.

00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:01.600
Because it's not, because courts and others
are not only questioning those cases where

00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:05.690
DNA is available, but because of what we've
learned from DNA is opening the doors to other

00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:07.440
issues where DNA is not available.

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:10.500
And people are taking a much more careful
look.

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:14.830
But, DNA is not the answer to this issue.

00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:17.260
Replacing the death penalty is the answer.

00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:20.520
&gt;&gt;Randy: I would like to say that DNA is fabulous.

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:22.380
It's a great safety net.

00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:23.910
But it's such a small one.

00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:30.450
When you have other evidence that the prosecutors
use like eyewitness testimony.

00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:37.840
Why is it so hard for people to believe that
a jailhouse snitch, or a supposed eyewitness

00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:45.890
to a murder, won't get up there on that stand,
for the prosecution, and lie?

00:49:45.890 --> 00:49:51.790
They do it every day in our courts across
this country.

00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:56.250
Many many crimes are committed right in the
courtroom every day in this country.

00:49:56.250 --> 00:50:01.230
Because of prosecutors with their absolute
immunity and their qualified immunity clauses

00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:02.480
that they have.

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:05.630
They can suborn perjury.

00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:08.140
They can fabricate evidence.

00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:10.120
They can hide evidence.

00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:13.840
And all of this is what leads to wrongful
convictions.

00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:19.440
You cannot have an irreversible punishment
in place when prosecutors have that kind of

00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:24.040
power and are absolutely immune.

00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:28.320
&gt;&gt;Alan: So we only have a few minutes here
left.

00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:32.560
I want to focus on one particular piece of
your story.

00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:34.810
If I can.

00:50:34.810 --> 00:50:39.820
Which is, the moment that you found out that
you were gonna get released.

00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:46.610
Or that you know, when you got the word that
after all these years and all the suffering

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:50.620
and all this pain, you know, how did it happen?

00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:52.280
And what did you feel?

00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:54.270
And what happened from that?

00:50:54.270 --> 00:50:58.010
From that moment on to the moment you're reunited
from your family.

00:50:58.010 --> 00:50:59.010
What happened?

00:50:59.010 --> 00:51:03.340
&gt;&gt;Randy: Well, it was after, it was almost
16 years.

00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:06.360
As I said, I'd lost every state appeal.

00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:12.500
When I found out that my federal habeas corpus
opinion had come down that morning, but they

00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:13.970
didn't know the results.

00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:15.430
&gt;&gt;Alan: How did you get that news.

00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:16.430
Who talked--?

00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:19.970
&gt;&gt;Randy: My attorneys called me from out of
my cell.

00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:24.160
And I knew it was either gonna be bad news
or it was gonna be good news.

00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:27.300
And I set down in the captains office.

00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:28.300
And he handed me the phone.

00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:33.880
And she says, my attorney says "Randy, are
you settin' down?" and I said "Yes."

00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:39.460
And says "Judge McCaskey had just granted
all 17 issues in your federal habeas corpus

00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:40.460
position.

00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:45.430
And ordered the state of Illinois to either
retry you or release you in 120 days."

00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:46.960
I'm sitting there.

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:50.640
And I asked her, I said "Can you repeat that
for me please?"

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:51.640
[laughter]

00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:56.740
Because that was the first bit of good news
that I had had in almost 17 years.

00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:58.210
But it was shock.

00:51:58.210 --> 00:52:04.280
It was just as shocking as the moment the
jury opened their mouth and convicted me of

00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:05.760
this crime.

00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:12.520
&gt;&gt;Nathan: Uh, as for me, I was released on
bond first.

00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:19.291
After I got the new trial, the prosecutors
told the Illinois Supreme Court that they

00:52:19.291 --> 00:52:22.400
could not retry me because there is no case.

00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:26.610
If they upheld my new trial, there's no case.

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:29.020
So when I came back for the new trial.

00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:32.020
I was thinkin' they was just gonna let me
go.

00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:34.520
Soon as I went before the judge.

00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:39.410
But the prosecutor said, "We're not bound
by what the prosecutor said to the Supreme

00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:40.410
Court."

00:52:40.410 --> 00:52:42.490
And they said they was gonna retry me.

00:52:42.490 --> 00:52:45.570
And they set my bond at a million dollars.

00:52:45.570 --> 00:52:51.990
So, Governor Ryan, the governor of Illinois
at the time, he emptied out Death Row by giving

00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:55.010
all the prisoners on Death Row a pardon.

00:52:55.010 --> 00:53:00.080
When he done that, one of my best friends,
Aaron Patterson came home.

00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:02.200
He was completely exonerated.

00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:08.960
He got his state compensation pay and he put
up 100,000 dollars and came and bond me out.

00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:14.020
We had made a pact while we was on Death Row,
that whichever one of us get out first would

00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:16.570
reach back and get the other.

00:53:16.570 --> 00:53:22.560
When the guards came to my cell, and told
me "Pack up, you goin' home."

00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:24.950
I really thought he was jokin'.

00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:27.430
And but I started packin' up.

00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:31.990
But I don't know why I was thinkin' he was
jokin'.

00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:33.060
But it was real.

00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:34.670
I packed my things up.

00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:35.840
And I went to downstairs.

00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:38.510
And they processed me out.

00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:42.900
And when I got to the last gate, I had a folder
with me.

00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:44.980
And I told the guard, "What next."

00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:47.570
He said "Just walk out that door."

00:53:47.570 --> 00:53:50.000
I said "Just walk out?"

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.460
He said "Yeah."

00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:54.250
And so I walked out the door.

00:53:54.250 --> 00:53:57.630
And as I was walking, I smelled somethin'.

00:53:57.630 --> 00:53:59.980
That I hadn't smelled.

00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:02.770
And when I looked up, it was a tree.

00:54:02.770 --> 00:54:06.440
It was a tree high in the air over my head.

00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:09.990
And I almost fell right on my face right then
on the ground.

00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:12.430
I had to catch my balance.

00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:14.310
I thought about what made me do that.

00:54:14.310 --> 00:54:20.640
And there was the fact that I hadn't been
under a tree in 18 years.

00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:24.530
And it threw me off.

00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:26.020
But then, I walked on out.

00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:27.260
And all my family.

00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:28.660
The press.

00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:29.660
It was beautiful.

00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:32.040
&gt;&gt;Alan: Well great.

00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:37.860
So I can't imagine another way, a better way
to end today than that story.

00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:39.600
I wanna thank everyone for being here.

00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:47.170
I think it's really been a, I feel like the
education that we get from hearing the stories

00:54:47.170 --> 00:54:49.700
of people that are inside the system.

00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:53.670
And understand that it's just so different
than we sometimes see.

00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:54.670
You know.

00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:55.670
In the media and on the television.

00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:56.670
And other things.

00:54:56.670 --> 00:54:59.550
And I just wanna thank you very much for bringing
your stories.

00:54:59.550 --> 00:55:00.880
You know, to Google.

00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:05.470
And to the people that will watch the video.

00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:07.110
Because I think it's a very important issue.

00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:12.710
And I think your perspectives are incredibly
important to get the word out.

00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:17.220
And changes that we as citizens of California
can potentially make.

00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:21.820
And I think the other thing that's important
is that California's kind of a bell ringer

00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:23.510
for the rest of the world.

00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:26.070
And for the United States in general.

00:55:26.070 --> 00:55:32.030
That if California goes, if California changes
its law.

00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:37.610
If we go with life without parole, there's
a very good chance that the rest of the nation

00:55:37.610 --> 00:55:39.130
will follow us.

00:55:39.130 --> 00:55:42.310
And I think the stakes are very high.

00:55:42.310 --> 00:55:49.540
And I appreciate the time that each of you
has spent with this issue and Natasha for

00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:51.130
leading this effort.

00:55:51.130 --> 00:55:52.800
And I wish you the very best of luck.

00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:53.800
So thank you everybody.

00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:53.801
[applause]
