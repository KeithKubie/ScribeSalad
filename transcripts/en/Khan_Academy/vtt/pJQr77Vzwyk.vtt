00:00:00.961 --> 00:00:02.753
- [Instructor] Ancient Greece was not even

00:00:02.753 --> 00:00:04.180
a cohesive empire.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.582
It was made up of many city states,

00:00:06.582 --> 00:00:08.665
led by Athens and Sparta.

00:00:09.651 --> 00:00:13.031
But, despite its fragmentation,
it's made innumerable

00:00:13.031 --> 00:00:15.976
contributions to, not
just Western civilization,

00:00:15.976 --> 00:00:18.703
but civilization as a whole.

00:00:18.703 --> 00:00:20.922
And those are contributions in terms of

00:00:20.922 --> 00:00:23.654
forms of governance, like democracy,

00:00:23.654 --> 00:00:26.750
contributions in medicine,
contributions in the arts,

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.421
in mathematics, in the sciences.

00:00:29.421 --> 00:00:32.403
But perhaps their most famous contribution

00:00:32.403 --> 00:00:34.916
is in terms of philosophy.

00:00:34.916 --> 00:00:36.632
And if we're going to
talk about philosophy

00:00:36.632 --> 00:00:40.203
in ancient Greece, the most
famous three philosophers

00:00:40.203 --> 00:00:43.120
are Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.

00:00:44.124 --> 00:00:47.165
Now, before we get into the first of them,

00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:49.020
and really the teacher of Plato,

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.072
who was then the teacher of Aristotle,

00:00:51.072 --> 00:00:54.245
let's get a little bit of
context on this time period.

00:00:54.245 --> 00:00:57.468
So, as we enter into
the fifth century BCE,

00:00:57.468 --> 00:00:59.862
a couple of things are emerging.

00:00:59.862 --> 00:01:03.279
First, you have a new Athenian democracy.

00:01:04.715 --> 00:01:09.458
Then, as you get into that
century, the Persians invade,

00:01:09.458 --> 00:01:14.094
try to conquer Greece several
times, but unsuccessfully.

00:01:14.094 --> 00:01:17.226
But then, the Greeks start
fighting amongst themselves,

00:01:17.226 --> 00:01:20.467
led on one side by Athens,
on the other side by Sparta,

00:01:20.467 --> 00:01:23.535
and that's the Peloponnesian
War, which ends with

00:01:23.535 --> 00:01:26.728
Sparta being victorious, but
all of the Greek city states

00:01:26.728 --> 00:01:28.771
being weakened dramatically.

00:01:28.771 --> 00:01:32.628
Now, between the end,
especially the first part

00:01:32.628 --> 00:01:35.294
of the Greco-Persian
Wars, and the end of the

00:01:35.294 --> 00:01:38.281
Peloponnesian War, it
was actually a time of

00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:40.214
Athenian prosperity.

00:01:40.214 --> 00:01:42.874
They were leading this semi-empire,

00:01:42.874 --> 00:01:44.929
they were investing in the arts,

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:48.234
and it's often called
the Golden Age of Athens,

00:01:48.234 --> 00:01:52.151
and that's the world in
which Socrates emerged.

00:01:54.694 --> 00:01:57.860
Like many philosophers,
Socrates led a very

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.680
interesting life, and it's worth noting

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.904
what we know about him
does not come directly

00:02:01.904 --> 00:02:02.881
from his writing.

00:02:02.881 --> 00:02:05.018
We don't have surviving
accounts of his writing.

00:02:05.018 --> 00:02:07.806
It comes mainly through the
writing of his students,

00:02:07.806 --> 00:02:10.396
Xenophon, and, most notably, Plato.

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:14.260
We also get some parody of
Socrates from Aristophanes,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.642
that Socrates himself
did not appreciate much.

00:02:17.642 --> 00:02:20.162
But what we know is
that he started in life,

00:02:20.162 --> 00:02:21.630
he was a stone mason,

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.687
he even acted as a soldier, a hoplite,

00:02:23.687 --> 00:02:25.675
during the Peloponnesian War.

00:02:25.675 --> 00:02:28.805
But he is, of course, most
famous for being a philosopher

00:02:28.805 --> 00:02:30.440
and for being a teacher.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.809
And his teaching style,
the Socratic method,

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:36.086
is still viewed as something
of a best practice today.

00:02:36.086 --> 00:02:38.893
Rather than lecturing
students, to, instead,

00:02:38.893 --> 00:02:42.767
ask incisive questions that
force a student to deepen

00:02:42.767 --> 00:02:46.282
their thinking and get closer
to the root of an issue,

00:02:46.282 --> 00:02:50.208
and to learn how to think
rather than just having

00:02:50.208 --> 00:02:52.970
knowledge transmitted to them.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.531
Now, what's also notable about Socrates

00:02:55.531 --> 00:02:59.279
and his many students,
including Plato and Aristotle,

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:02.487
is that they took a departure
of how to think about

00:03:02.487 --> 00:03:05.204
the world from most of the ancient world.

00:03:05.204 --> 00:03:07.905
Most of the ancient world
was focused on the gods

00:03:07.905 --> 00:03:10.377
and the metaphysical
explaining everything.

00:03:10.377 --> 00:03:13.423
And, while the ancient Greeks
did have a large pantheon

00:03:13.423 --> 00:03:17.692
of gods, Socrates and
his fellow philosophers

00:03:17.692 --> 00:03:19.927
tried to figure out how the world works,

00:03:19.927 --> 00:03:22.826
why we are here, somewhat
independent of the gods.

00:03:22.826 --> 00:03:23.984
They tried to reason it through,

00:03:23.984 --> 00:03:26.327
they tried to talk it
through, think about it

00:03:26.327 --> 00:03:28.469
from a rational point of view.

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:32.219
And to get a flavor of
that, here is a quote.

00:03:33.063 --> 00:03:36.372
"True wisdom comes to
each of us when we realize

00:03:36.372 --> 00:03:39.787
"how little we understand
about life, ourselves,

00:03:39.787 --> 00:03:41.293
"and the world around us."

00:03:41.293 --> 00:03:44.470
So, unlike many ancient
societies that just tried to

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.707
explain everything
through the metaphysical

00:03:46.707 --> 00:03:49.757
or through the gods, here
you have Socrates saying, no,

00:03:49.757 --> 00:03:51.720
an ideal true wisdom

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.477
is when you appreciate how little we know,

00:03:55.477 --> 00:03:58.394
this form of intellectual humility.

00:03:59.708 --> 00:04:03.875
Now, Socrates lived during
this Golden Age of Athens,

00:04:05.228 --> 00:04:09.829
a time when democracy was
flourishing, the Age of Pericles.

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:11.987
But he himself was a little bit skeptical

00:04:11.987 --> 00:04:14.237
of unfettered or pure democracy.

00:04:14.237 --> 00:04:17.536
He was worried, well,
what if the people voting

00:04:17.536 --> 00:04:20.166
aren't educated to make
the types of decisions?

00:04:20.166 --> 00:04:22.538
Maybe they can be
manipulated by a demagogue,

00:04:22.538 --> 00:04:26.264
someone who just tells 'em
exactly what they want to hear.

00:04:26.264 --> 00:04:29.049
And so he was a bit of
a controversial figure,

00:04:29.049 --> 00:04:32.968
especially as you get to the
end of the Peloponnesian War.

00:04:32.968 --> 00:04:35.879
Remember, Athens loses
the Peloponnesian War.

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:40.560
It went from being this powerful
head of this Delian League,

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.830
something of an empire, this wealthy city,

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.028
and now it's a subjugated
state, it's tired from war.

00:04:47.028 --> 00:04:48.763
And so you can imagine there's a lot of

00:04:48.763 --> 00:04:51.647
political infighting, and
Socrates ends up being

00:04:51.647 --> 00:04:53.146
one of the casualties.

00:04:53.146 --> 00:04:57.313
He is actually put on trial
by his fellow Athenians.

00:04:59.917 --> 00:05:03.162
This is a depiction of
the trial of Socrates,

00:05:03.162 --> 00:05:06.241
and it shows Socrates defending himself

00:05:06.241 --> 00:05:09.772
from the accusations brought against him.

00:05:09.772 --> 00:05:13.939
Refusing to recognize the gods
acknowledged by the state,

00:05:15.264 --> 00:05:18.550
importing strange divinities of his own,

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.300
corrupting the young.

00:05:21.173 --> 00:05:25.771
And his defense, which both
Xenophon and Plato write about,

00:05:25.771 --> 00:05:29.331
called The Apology, he's
bewildered, he says,

00:05:29.331 --> 00:05:31.872
where is all of this coming from?

00:05:31.872 --> 00:05:34.285
Now, it is true, he
did not invoke the gods

00:05:34.285 --> 00:05:36.127
when he's trying to explain the universe.

00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:39.106
And, yes, he was trying to
teach the young to think.

00:05:39.106 --> 00:05:41.904
But by no means, if you
look at what he was doing,

00:05:41.904 --> 00:05:43.922
or at least our modern
accounts coming through Plato

00:05:43.922 --> 00:05:47.216
and Xenophon, does it
seem like he was trying to

00:05:47.216 --> 00:05:50.452
undermine the state in some way.

00:05:50.452 --> 00:05:52.905
But, needless to say, it comes to a vote,

00:05:52.905 --> 00:05:55.587
and maybe he's a victim of his own fears

00:05:55.587 --> 00:05:58.357
of a pure democratic process,

00:05:58.357 --> 00:06:00.819
but, amongst the 500 Athenians voting,

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:02.949
280 say that he is guilty,

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:05.782
and 220 say that he is not guilty.

00:06:06.618 --> 00:06:09.224
He is given a chance to think about

00:06:09.224 --> 00:06:11.236
what his penalty should be.

00:06:11.236 --> 00:06:13.990
And the charges, at least
in the Athenian's minds,

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.395
were quite serious.

00:06:15.395 --> 00:06:17.645
But Socrates famously says,

00:06:19.826 --> 00:06:23.869
"An unexamined life is not worth living."

00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:25.908
And so, even though many
historians think that

00:06:25.908 --> 00:06:29.761
he might have been able to
get exile if he asked for it,

00:06:29.761 --> 00:06:31.928
he was sentenced to death.

00:06:33.376 --> 00:06:36.154
And this is a painting
done much, much later

00:06:36.154 --> 00:06:39.793
of what that death of Socrates
might have looked like.

00:06:39.793 --> 00:06:44.721
But you see here Socrates about
to, or maybe he just drank

00:06:44.721 --> 00:06:48.675
the hemlock, which is the
poison which will kill him.

00:06:48.675 --> 00:06:53.388
So, even though he had to
die for these pretty spurious

00:06:53.388 --> 00:06:56.458
allegations, his legacy lives on,

00:06:56.458 --> 00:07:00.625
and it lives on most famously
in his student Plato.

00:07:02.996 --> 00:07:06.595
Now, Plato is famous for many things.

00:07:06.595 --> 00:07:11.387
There's this notion of a
Platonic ideal form that,

00:07:11.387 --> 00:07:13.255
whether you're talking about a circle,

00:07:13.255 --> 00:07:15.922
or a ball, or a dog, or a chair,

00:07:17.343 --> 00:07:20.601
that there's an ideal
form that is independent

00:07:20.601 --> 00:07:23.261
of what your senses are telling you,

00:07:23.261 --> 00:07:26.224
or what the chair in
front of you might be,

00:07:26.224 --> 00:07:30.160
that that's an imperfect
version of that ideal form.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.588
The word Platonic, in
general, you'll hear applied

00:07:32.588 --> 00:07:35.431
to many different concepts,
some of the meanings

00:07:35.431 --> 00:07:37.681
having changed over time.

00:07:37.681 --> 00:07:40.928
The other thing that Plato is famous for

00:07:40.928 --> 00:07:43.453
is the notion of an academy.

00:07:43.453 --> 00:07:45.569
The place where he taught his students

00:07:45.569 --> 00:07:49.486
was a little field outside
the walls of Athens,

00:07:50.361 --> 00:07:53.976
named for the Athenian hero Akademos,

00:07:53.976 --> 00:07:58.709
and so that area became
known as Plato's Academy.

00:07:58.709 --> 00:08:02.256
And ever since then, places
of learning have often been

00:08:02.256 --> 00:08:06.280
referred to as academies,
just like Khan Academy.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:10.223
But Plato was also concerned,
like his teacher Socrates,

00:08:10.223 --> 00:08:13.723
with the nature of how we should be ruled.

00:08:15.732 --> 00:08:18.529
"There will be no end to
the troubles of states,

00:08:18.529 --> 00:08:21.701
"or indeed of humanity
itself, till philosophers

00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:24.490
"become rulers in this
world, or till those

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:28.030
"we now call kings and
rulers really and truly

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:31.786
"become philosophers, and
political power and philosophy

00:08:31.786 --> 00:08:35.207
"thus come into the same hands."

00:08:35.207 --> 00:08:37.793
So, like Socrates, he's weary of how

00:08:37.793 --> 00:08:38.872
they have been governed.

00:08:38.872 --> 00:08:40.956
And, remember, we're now after the period

00:08:40.956 --> 00:08:41.943
of the Peloponnesian War.

00:08:41.943 --> 00:08:44.588
The city states of
Greece, especially Athens,

00:08:44.588 --> 00:08:47.074
have been dramatically
weakened, so a lot of people

00:08:47.074 --> 00:08:48.666
might be thinking, including Plato,

00:08:48.666 --> 00:08:52.253
is there a better way to govern ourselves?

00:08:52.253 --> 00:08:56.086
Now, Plato's most famous
student is Aristotle.

00:08:58.186 --> 00:09:02.150
And, like his teacher, Aristotle
is famous for many things

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:05.611
and explored many
dimensions of the universe.

00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:09.331
But he is probably most
famous for being the tutor

00:09:09.331 --> 00:09:12.699
of Alexander the Great when
Alexander the Great was young.

00:09:12.699 --> 00:09:16.711
Phillip of Macedon,
Alexander the Great's father,

00:09:16.711 --> 00:09:19.780
as he conquers the weakened city states

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.685
after the Peloponnesian War,

00:09:21.685 --> 00:09:25.763
he also conquers Aristotle's
home town of Stagira,

00:09:25.763 --> 00:09:27.890
and he enslaves the population.

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:30.600
And so, when he goes to
Aristotle to tutor his young son,

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.748
who ends up being called
Alexander the Great eventually,

00:09:33.748 --> 00:09:36.551
Aristotle says, okay, my fee will be

00:09:36.551 --> 00:09:38.875
free the people of my town.

00:09:38.875 --> 00:09:42.792
His town is freed, he
tutors a young Alexander,

00:09:43.859 --> 00:09:46.122
when Alexander is in his early teens,

00:09:46.122 --> 00:09:50.154
and he also gets support
for a center of learning.

00:09:50.154 --> 00:09:53.835
He creates a Lyceum,
which is his version of

00:09:53.835 --> 00:09:55.700
Plato's Academy.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.599
And, just like you saw with
Socrates and you see with Plato,

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:03.784
Aristotle continued this
tradition of a focus on learning

00:10:03.784 --> 00:10:07.524
and a humble acceptance
of all that there might be

00:10:07.524 --> 00:10:10.643
in the world, this
rationality that we now see

00:10:10.643 --> 00:10:12.508
in modern science, that you didn't see

00:10:12.508 --> 00:10:13.557
from a lot of the ancients,

00:10:13.557 --> 00:10:17.944
who were focused on the
metaphysics and the gods.

00:10:17.944 --> 00:10:20.705
"It is the mark of an educated mind

00:10:20.705 --> 00:10:25.094
"to be able to entertain a
thought without accepting it."

00:10:25.094 --> 00:10:29.144
And I'll leave you there,
but the big takeaway is,

00:10:29.144 --> 00:10:32.130
going from Socrates,
to Plato, to Aristotle,

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.431
and there were many
other Greek philosophers,

00:10:34.431 --> 00:10:38.626
you have the seed of what you
could call modern rationality.

00:10:38.626 --> 00:10:41.969
Roughly 2,000 years later, you
have the European Renaissance

00:10:41.969 --> 00:10:45.260
that starts reemerging
many of these same ideas,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.629
all the way providing a
bridge into the Enlightenment,

00:10:48.629 --> 00:10:53.153
and now our modern, hopefully
fairly rational view

00:10:53.153 --> 00:10:54.236
of the world.
