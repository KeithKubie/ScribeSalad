00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.300
We've learned a lot about
derivatives, and now we will

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.840
use them to solve something
that is hopefully may

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.970
be kind of useful.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.980
So let's just start with a
review of the chain rule,

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.760
and I'm going to write
in a different way.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.920
So let's say I had the
function f of g of x.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.530
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going actually write this in a

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.430
way that might be a bit foreign
to you, but I think with a

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.370
little bit of explanation
you'll realize that this is the

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:32.500
same thing as the chain rule
that we all know and love.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.830
I changed colors
really for no reason.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.220
Just to change colors.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.230
Sometimes I do that.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.570
I'll change colors again.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:45.500
The derivative of f of g of x
is equal to the rate at which

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.790
f changes with respect to g.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:01:01.870
So that's df to dg times the
rate at which g changes

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.290
with respect to x.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.900
And you're saying Sal, this
looks completely foreign to me.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.550
And one, you could think
about what I just said and

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.490
I think it'll make sense.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.760
Or I could just rewrite
this in the traditional

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.540
chain rule format.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.130
And this isn't really
the traditional.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.440
What I wrote is the
traditional, but the

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.100
way I've taught you.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.300
So the way I taught you,
what's the change of

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.450
f with respect to g?

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:34.130
Well that's just f prime of g
of x times-- and what's the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.025
rate at which g changes
with respect to x?

00:01:37.025 --> 00:01:40.870
Well that's just g prime of x.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.270
So hopefully this make sense
to you that these are just

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.410
two different ways of
writing the chain rule.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.670
I think what was this, this is
either Lagrange or Leibniz's

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.430
notation, and this
the other guy.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.640
But I forget.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.040
And this actually makes sense
just from a fractions point of

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.500
view that this term and that
term cancels out and you get,

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.730
you know that this equals that
rate at which f changes

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.190
with respect x.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.960
So with that out of the way,
let's use this to solve

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.020
something kind of hopefully
a little bit neat.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.635
Let's say I have a cone.

00:02:11.635 --> 00:02:13.830
Let's say it's one of
those cups you have

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.280
at the water cooler.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.350
That's the top of the cup.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.500
And let's say at any point in
the clone the ratio of the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.090
radius of the cone to the
height-- if this is the

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.110
height, then the radius
is 1/2 of height.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.340
At any point.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.750
As you know, it's a fixed cone,
these are lines on both sides.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.215
So that ratio stays fixed.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.850
So just to start off with
some-- you maybe never

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:50.605
even learned this.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.900
This will help us with
the problem later on.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.020
What's the volume of-- let's
say I'm filling water

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.500
up to height h.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.650
Let's say this is where
the water line is.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.130
But that's where the
water is in this cone.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.870
What's the volume assuming
that the height is h.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.680
Assuming that I've let's say
8 centimeters of water.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.210
What is the volume of water
that I put in the cone?

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.450
Well, if you don't know it, and
I sometimes-- well actually

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.180
later when we do rotations of
solid into integration modules

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.030
I can actually prove this to
you-- but the volume of a cone

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.300
is equal to 1/3 base times
height, where the base is

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.120
actually, you can kind of
view it as the surface

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.550
area of the water.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.370
And what's the base?

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.595
Well that's just equal to
volume is equal to 1/3.

00:03:47.595 --> 00:03:52.230
The base is equal to pi r
squared, where r is the radius.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.770
This is just kind of
solid geometry review.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.000
And what's the radius
in this case?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.220
It's 1/3 pi r squared times h.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.370
And in this example I
said that the radius

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.960
is 1/2 of the height.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:13.690
So this equals 1/3 pi 1/2 the
height-- I just replaced it

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.450
for r squared-- times h.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.760
We haven't done
any calculus yet.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.100
This is just complicated-- not
complicated really-- just a

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.770
little bit hairy
solid geometry.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.220
And if we simplify that we get
volume is equal to-- let's see.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:37.850
So we get 1/2 squared is 1/4
times 1/3 is 1/12 pi, and

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.990
then h squared times
h, h to the third.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.200
Very interesting, Now let's
start doing some calculus.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.640
I think this might
blow your mind.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:05:03.030
Let's say I am pouring water
into this cup at a rate of 1

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.410
cubic centimeter per second.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.800
And for you metric jocks,
you'll know sometimes doctors

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.740
or nurses will say 1 cc, and
that's also equal

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.090
to 1 millimeter.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.013
Just for other frames of
reference, but I like to stay

00:05:17.013 --> 00:05:19.070
in centimeters cubed per
second because we're going

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.380
to work with centimeters
in multiple dimensions.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.960
But let's say we're pouring
1 centimeter cubed per

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.270
second into this cup.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:34.460
I want to know-- this is an
interesting question-- how fast

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.380
is the water level rising.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.750
How fast is h changing, the
height of the water, at the

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.640
moment when h is equal
to 2 centimeters.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.600
So how do we do that?

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.080
This just give us a static
picture of if we know the

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.510
height we can figure
out the volume.

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.980
But if we figure it out, if we
took the rate of change with

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.700
respect to time off of both
sides of this equation,

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.390
something interesting
might happen.

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.310
So let's take the derivative
with respect time

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.940
on both sides.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.970
So the derivative with respect
to time of the volume.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.860
Well that's just dv/dt.

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.880
And what's the derivative
with respect to time of

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.730
this side of the equation?

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:21.530
Well it's the rate which v
changes with respect to h.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.970
This is v as a
function of h, right?

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:36.040
So it's going to be dv as a
function-- how fast does v

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.730
change with respect to h--
times how fast does h

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:41.300
change with respect to t.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.175
This is just the
chain rule up here.

00:06:43.175 --> 00:06:44.740
I want you to think about
this a little bit.

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.370
It might not seem obvious
but all we're doing

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:47.280
is the chain rule.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.820
It's a little confusing because
I had no t's in this equation

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.345
before, and all of a sudden I'm
picking a derivative

00:06:51.345 --> 00:06:52.690
with respect to t.

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:56.670
But let's just say that h
actually is a function of t,

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:59.020
which as you know it is.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.640
So let's then just solve that.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:06.020
So dv-- the derivative of v
with respect to t-- is equal

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.840
to the derivative of
v with respect to h.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.740
Well that's easy.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.850
The derivative of v with
respect to h is just simple.

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:17.230
So 3 times 1/12, that's 3/12.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:25.730
That's 1/4 pi, so we can just
write pi over 4 h squared.

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:26.720
So that's this part.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:34.800
And in this part is just
still-- see, I can rewrite

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.570
in this new color
dh/dt, times dh/dt.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.250
So you're saying Sal,
what have you now done.

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:48.236
I said the rate of which the
volume is changing with respect

00:07:48.236 --> 00:07:52.810
to time is equal to pi over 4
times the height squared times

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:56.560
the rate at which the height is
changing with respect to time.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.630
So can this solve
the problem for us?

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:06.870
Well what do we know?

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:08.860
We know the rate at which
the volume is changing

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:09.980
with respect to time.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.330
1 centimeter cubed
per second squared.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:17.030
So we could say dv/dt
is equal to 1.

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:18.210
I'm going to get
rid of the units.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.620
Most physics instructors
would cringe.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:28.080
But 1 centimeter cubed per
second is equal to pi over 4.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:32.390
This one is v the rate at
which the volume is changing

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:34.450
with respect to time.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:35.520
pi over 4 h squared.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.210
We know what h is right
now. h is 2, so it's

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:41.410
2 squared times 4.

00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:44.785
We said the height is 2
right then, so 2 squared

00:08:44.785 --> 00:08:46.330
is 4 times dh/dt.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:54.820
So this cancels out, and we get
1 is equal to pi times dh/dt.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:58.150
And we solve for dt/dt we
get-- let me make sure

00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:59.100
not to confuse you.

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.423
The rate at which the height of
water is changing with respect

00:09:02.423 --> 00:09:04.860
to time is just 1 over pi.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.710
Fascinating.

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:10.180
Or 1 over pi centimeters
per second.

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:11.900
So we can figure out what this
number is, it's going to

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:15.150
be like 0.3 something.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:18.660
So 0.3 something centimeters
per second is the rate at which

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.900
the height of the water level
is going to change as I put 1

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:28.300
centimeter cubed of volume
into this cup per second.

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.620
I have probably confused you.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.090
You may want to
watch this again.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:33.110
And I'll do a couple more
videos with these rates of

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:36.800
change problems because these
tend to confuse people, but

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.400
once you get the hang of it, I
think you'll see that

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.890
they're not so bad.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:41.650
I'll see you the
next presentation.
