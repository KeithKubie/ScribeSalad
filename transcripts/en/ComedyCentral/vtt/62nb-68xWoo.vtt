In a close presidential race,
or a penis-measuring contest,

00:00:03.437 --> 00:00:05.939
every inch counts, which is why

00:00:05.973 --> 00:00:08.742
Team Trump has been using
some creative measuring.

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:11.245
In September, Donald's doctors
listed him as six-three

00:00:11.278 --> 00:00:13.280
when he'd been
previously six-two.

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:16.283
We'd say it was a simple
mistake, but, uh, come on.

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:18.352
Trump's doctor's
a medical professional.

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:19.887
(laughter)

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.088
There he is.

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:23.323
Was it Mickey Rourke
in <i>Cast Away?</i>

00:00:23.357 --> 00:00:24.992
-Looks like. Nice.
-(laughter)

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:26.693
-(applause and cheering)
-I've actually...

00:00:26.727 --> 00:00:28.762
I'm gonna give you
100 points for that.

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:31.732
Uh, I've been calling him
Spammy Hagar. Uh...

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:33.600
-Uh...
-(laughter)

00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:37.070
And now Trump's VP,
the Ghost of Mayonnaise Past,

00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:39.039
-seems to be following suit.
-Mm.

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:40.641
At last night's
vice presidential debate,

00:00:40.674 --> 00:00:42.743
it was clear
that Tim Kaine, Hillary's VP,

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:45.112
and also the dad on every Disney
Channel show...

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:46.947
-(laughter)
-...was substantially

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.348
taller than Mike Pence.

00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:50.117
And yet,
when we looked it up online,

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.452
Pence is listed as taller
than Kaine! What the (bleep)!

00:00:52.486 --> 00:00:53.921
Either Trump
and Pence are lying,

00:00:53.954 --> 00:00:55.589
or maybe they just measure
their heights

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:58.225
while standing on the backs
of the poor, but...

00:00:58.258 --> 00:01:00.360
-(laughter, groaning)
-It's actually...

00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:01.895
(cheers and applause)

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:04.731
...a good political strategy.

00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:08.402
Look, comedians,
now that this is a thing,

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:10.537
what other physical attribute
might the candidates lie about

00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:12.372
to seem more presidential?

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:15.275
-Bob Saget. -Um, Mike Pence.
A lot of people don't know this.

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:17.477
Mike Pence can make a cucumber
disappear actually

00:01:17.511 --> 00:01:19.713
-just by sitting on it.
-HARDWICK: Okay. Points.

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:21.048
-(laughter, applause)
-Points.

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:23.984
Yeah. Rich Eisen.

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:26.854
Pence's hair is actually
that white and not the result

00:01:26.887 --> 00:01:29.556
of seeing the ghost
that haunts Trump's toupee.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.924
-HARDWICK: All right. Points.
-(laughter, applause)

00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.694
Mr. Proops.

00:01:33.727 --> 00:01:35.195
They're two old
entitled white guys.

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:35.295
They don't have
to lie about anything.
