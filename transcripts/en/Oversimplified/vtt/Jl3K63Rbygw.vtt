00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.349
England in the Middle Ages.

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:16.769
The sun is shining . The birds are singing.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.759
The children are playing in the village square.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.600
"What a wonderful time to be alive!"

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.040
"Hey, you're dying of dysentary." (welp)

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.580
"Aaaaaaand,

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.335
also, we're being raided by Vikings."

00:00:26.335 --> 00:00:28.049
"What an awful time to be alive!"

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:29.649
It's the Year 900.

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:31.409
Europe is a Vikings wet dream.

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:32.189
Raids galore.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.049
"Hey, you wanna go raid Paris?"

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.120
Okay, that particular raid didn't go too well, but the King of the Francs said,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.820
"You guys are pretty tough and scary."

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.440
"How about we give you land in northern France?"

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.657
"And in return, you protect us from other Vikings."

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.700
And it was agreed.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.660
The Vikings set up the Duchy of Normandy

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.835
And then they went full-on French.

00:00:46.835 --> 00:00:50.189
Converting to Christianity, learning the language, and making babies with the locals. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.940
England also had its fair share of Viking problems.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.400
In the 800s, Danish Vikings had conquered most of the country, but the Anglo-Saxons eventually managed to kick them out.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.475
Although they left behind a bunch of Viking settlers.

00:00:59.475 --> 00:01:00.160
Now this guy's king.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.925
"He sucks. Replace him with his brother!" (k)

00:01:01.925 --> 00:01:02.879
and he was like, "Hey, baby."

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.518
"How you doin?" and had a son, and then turned around and was like, "Hey, baby."

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.600
"How you doin?" and had another son. (damn)

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.220
And then he died and no one was sure which son to make King.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.120
"This one, cause he's older!"

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.240
"Not if I have anything to do with it."

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.860
"That works for us, too!"

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.160
Then he grew up and married the Duke of Normandy's daughter and had a bunch of kids.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.980
Remember this one, he's important.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.700
Then his advisors came to him and said,

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.140
"Hey, man, all those Viking settlers that are living here?"

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.320
"They might band together and kill you."

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.720
"Well, then why don't we kill them first?"

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.020
And so it was.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.264
This pissed off the Danish king, who launched an invasion.

00:01:30.264 --> 00:01:31.940
And the Vikings conquered England once again.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.680
Then the Anglo-Saxons unconquered it.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.291
Then the Vikings reconquered it.

00:01:35.291 --> 00:01:38.060
The King's family had to go into exile, including Edward

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.739
Remember him? He went to Normandy where he lived for thirty years.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.490
He and his brother Alfred tried to return to England to retake the throne from the Vikings.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.960
But they were betrayed by the Earl of Wessex, who said,

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.680
"Hey friend, I'll take you to London where all the nobles are waiting to make you King"

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.360
"Oh, no, look out, red-hot poker in the eyes." (trolled)

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.700
"I can't see!"

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.400
And thus you can't be King. (jerk)

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.640
Edward then escaped back to Normandy.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.020
After a few more Viking Kings came and went, one finally died without an heir and Edward was called back to England,

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.087
where he became king.

00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:02.820
And that's where our story begins

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.380
[Intro]

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.880
Here's the thing about becoming a king in the Middle Ages.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.080
Often your entire country won't support you at first.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.040
You can be vulnerable to rebellions and it's up to you to take control.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.080
Fortunately for Edward, there was already a super powerful guy who had a lot of control over England

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.900
and if Edward could get his support then England would be his.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.111
"Who is this guy?"

00:02:23.111 --> 00:02:23.730
"Aw piss,"

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.360
"It's the guy who gave my brother the red-hot poker in the eyes."

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.039
After an awkward moment where Edward exiled Godwin from the country,

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.800
He eventually had to give in and let him keep his earldom.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.980
Possibly after Godwin gave him a bunch of gold and said he was very very sorry.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.739
King Edward also married Godwin's daughter then Godwin died and his massive fortune was passed down to his sons who all became Earl's in

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.750
Particular this one became the new Earl of Wessex Harold Godwinson was now King Edward's brother-in-law

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.029
he was a close advisor to the King a brave warrior who had proven himself in battle against the Welsh and in many ways he

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.599
Was almost like a Co-King, uh-oh Edward got old and he's on his deathbed (rip)

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.590
Possibly for religious reasons or maybe because he wasn't happy about having to marry her

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.269
He didn't boink his wife and as a result has no kids. Meaning, there's no obvious heir to the throne

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.239
"Meaning I'm gonna be king." "He does have a grand nephew. It could be him"

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.260
"Hmm no let's go with me"

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.780
Just one problem.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.360
I mentioned that Edwards mother was in Norman Edward grew up in Normandy and he had a lot of Norman friends

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.660
The current Duke of Normandy was William the bastard

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.379
Why was he called the bastard one day his father was sneaking out of his castle

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.320
When his advisors said, "Where are you going?"

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.820
"Uh, to the tanner's shop?"

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.600
"Why?"

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.600
"To get a..."

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.180
"Tan?"

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.809
But that was a lie firstly because tanner's give you leather not tans and

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:39.229
Secondly because he was really going to see the Tanners daughter one thing leads to another and out comes baby William born out of wedlock

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.370
Thus an absolute bastard

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.870
His father died when William was seven or eight and he became the new Juke he spent most of his childhood narrowly avoiding assassination

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.060
Which probably turned him into the big balls tough guy?

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.460
He's remembered as today in

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:57.340
1051 the town of Aleçon tried to rebel against him and the townspeople beat on dead animal skins as an insult to his commoner mother

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.850
William was furious and he responded by well, let's just say it wasn't pretty that's the kind of guy

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:07.720
We're dealing with here William and Edward were good friends and Edward allegedly promised that William could have the English throne after him

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.660
A decade later Harold Godwinson even visited William and pledged an oath to him over

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.780
Holy relics promising that William could be the next king of England

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.410
Although it's possible Harold only did it because William was holding his family hostage

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.760
So when William heard that the king was on his deathbed he said hooray. I'm gonna be king

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.080
So now you have two extremely powerful men who both think they're about to become the next king.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.640
But wait

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.640
This guy is the king of Norway

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.820
He spent most of his life as a warrior for hire. Fighting for whoever would give him the most gold

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:40.879
You name a place. He probably fought a war then Poland. Yep. Estonia. Yep. Against pirates in the Mediterranean

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.669
Yep, the holy lands Sicily and Bulgaria. Yep

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.699
He got crazy rich off the back of it and was swimming in gold

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.710
Then he returned home and became King

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:54.859
One of the previous Norwegian kings had made an agreement with one of England's Viking kings saying that when that Viking King died the king

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.400
Of Norway would get the English throne. Hardrada felt that because of this agreement

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.080
He was now entitled to the English throne

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.189
He was also eager to go on one last big conquest that would turn him into a legend

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.959
So when he got word that Edward was on his deathbed he thought I'm gonna invade England and then I'm gonna be king

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:15.589
So now we have three extremely powerful men who all think they're about to become the next king of England and that means somebody's probably

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:21.709
About to get hurt back in England Harold Godwinson is watching over the dying King Edward. Suddenly. He comes out with a shocking announcement

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:28.729
Hey, everyone gather in. That's it. Come closer. Don't be shy. Okay, so I've got bad news. The king is dead

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:33.559
I know very sad, but good news. He said that I should be the next king. So

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:36.370
hooray for me and

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.500
Oh, yeah

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.000
He said that if he once told anyone else

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.580
They could be king that he doesn't like them anymore and they should just stay in Normandy

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.300
And also he said that no one should ask any further questions

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.850
Okay. Good talk. Go um.

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.490
Go do whatever it is you do

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.280
Usually it took months of preparation to crown a new king

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.600
But Harold rushed it and he had himself crowned the same day King Edward was buried in Normandy

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:03.570
William's advisors came to him and said: "Hey Big Willie, bad news, Harold Godwinson has taken the English throne." And William was furious

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:08.489
So he sent an envoy to Harold who said: "William says you stole the throne and demands you immediately return it to him." Hmm

00:06:08.489 --> 00:06:10.480
Let me think about that

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.280
thinking

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:12.820
No. (good answer)

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.860
"He said no." "That bastard." "Wait, I thought you were the bastard". (lol)

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.420
"Dude.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.120
Uncool."

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.760
William immediately began gathering his armies together and preparing for an invasion of England

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:31.370
Now killing a king was generally frowned upon in old-time Europe because they were considered to have been chosen by God himself

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.840
So back in Normandy, William had to get God on his side. He needed the Pope's blessing for his conquest

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.109
So he went to the Pope and said "Godwinson made an oath to me over Holy relics

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.330
And then he usurped the throne. Can I kill him?"

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:49.189
"Yeah, sure. Why not." So the Pope gave William his blessing meaning William now had God on his side. Everything was ready to go

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:54.830
Just one problem. The wind. It was blowing the wrong way and William had to wait with his army in Normandy

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:59.840
While Godwinson waited with his army in the South of England, they waited and waited and waited

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.040
and waited.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.440
And then William said screw it and sailed for England and got shipwrecked because the wind was blowing the wrong way

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.220
So then he decided to keep on waiting

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:12.979
They waited for two months and the wind never changed eventually Godwinson got bored and also ran out of food for his soldiers

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.810
So he sent them all home, and he returned to London

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:20.989
The south coast was undefended and all William could do was keep waiting while the northerly wind kept William in Normandy

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.960
It was carrying Hardrata and his Viking army to England

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:30.139
Hardrata landed near the old Viking city of York and defeated a regional army led by the northern Earl's and York's surrendered

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.990
When Godwinson heard about this, he must have been pretty upset

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:37.550
He had just disbanded his army. And now he had to gather them all together again and march all the way north

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.920
He made the exhausting journey in just FOUR days (hm, impressive)

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:46.860
Which is crazy quick and he caught the Vikings off guard and unprepared for battle. The two armies stood on either side of the river Derwent

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:51.320
Legends says that a beserker Viking single handedly held the only way crossing the river

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.070
dodging arrows and fending off attackers

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:57.140
Until some English soldiers got under the bridge in a barrel and gave him the old spear in the jewels

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:01.069
This gave the Vikings enough time to form a shield wall. But because they'd been caught off guard

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:05.809
Many weren't wearing their chainwear and armour and the English eventually defeated them, killing Hardrada,

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.980
and with him bringing the Viking era in England to an end

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.140
just keep waiting...just keep waiting..

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.000
well...this is BOOORING!

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:14.520
*squeak*

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.520
ayyy there we go!

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:17.800
Finally!

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.800
Williams fleet of over 700 ships and

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:24.629
14,000 men set sail and landed on the English coast at Pevensey and set up camp near Hastings and

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.900
Harold was still all the way in York his

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:32.580
exhausted army had to march all the way south just days after their battle with the Vikings. Harold made it to London and considered just

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:36.980
Staying there waiting for William to come to him but William forced Harold's hand by burning down a bunch of villages

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:40.080
Harold's army set out and met Williams on the 14th of October

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:41.160
1066

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:46.139
and both sides prepared themselves for the Battle of Hastings the English were on a hill so they decided to stay there because it was

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:50.549
A good defensive position the Normans approached and the two sides probably spent a while yelling at each other

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:56.700
William and the Normans had a few tactical advantages over the English the first were the archers the Normans sent volley after volley of arrows

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.859
Of the English who formed a shield wall in defence

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.860
Then Williams sent his infantry up the hill

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:04.620
The English threw anything they had at them and the Normans couldn't break through the shield wall

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.080
Then the Normans next tactical advantage came into play

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:12.809
William sent his cavalry up the hill but even they struggled to break through the shield wall defences. Wave after wave of

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:14.880
Infantry and cavalry came and Harold knew

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.530
All he had to do was let the Normans exhaust themselves and he would win but then something a bit strange happened

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:22.170
It's possible the Normans incorrectly believed William had been killed

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:26.249
Maybe they lost their will to fight against the shield wall, or maybe it was an intentional deception tactic

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:32.549
But suddenly the norman forces turned and ran away from the english believing they had won the english broke their shield wall and chased down

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:39.090
The retreating Normans who then turned around encircled the English troops and cut them down in the chaotic fighting that followed Harold Godwinson was killed

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:43.830
The most popular theory being that he took an arrow in the eye the English were defeated and William had won

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:45.810
He was no more just a bastard now

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:51.299
He was a conqueror at first English Nobles were reluctant to make him King but William burned down a few more villages and the nobles

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:56.970
Eventually gave in and offered him the crown as he was coronated the local villages and Westminster let out a cheer of support but William

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:57.660
Thought it was a riot

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:01.600
So he burned down the village (they just love burning down the villages..) William then had to go on a long and costly campaign of quelling

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.780
rebellions and burning down villages all over England *insert burning down village compilation*

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:10.530
To force the people into submission and England went through a massive transformation under its new Norman rule English Nobles were replaced with Normans

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.150
They built castles and grand cathedrals

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:15.209
But one of the most interesting changes occurred within the English language

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:20.309
The Normans brought their dialect of French to England and emerged with Old English and ways we still live with today

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:20.880
First of all,

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.440
The Normans were obviously the ones in power

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:27.220
So words related to power like government judge castle and crown come from norman's words that are considered

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:31.299
Posher are more refined are usually the norman ones at first the anglo-saxons

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.870
probably weren't that friendly to the Normans while the Normans likely weren't that amiable towards the

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:35.650
Anglo-Saxons.

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:41.470
An Anglo-Saxon might come into a room, but a Norman would enter into a chamber, an Anglo Saxon might buy themselves a shirt

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:45.369
While the Norman would purchase a blouse, and while that filthy peasants new shirt may be fair

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:47.370
The Norman blouse is absolutely beautiful!

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:53.410
The Normans actually considered some anglo-saxon words so crude that I can't even say them on YouTube. But there's more! Ask an anglo-saxon

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:58.629
What job he does and he might respond with some low-level trade such as a baker, a Miller, or a shoemaker

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:03.160
But a Norman has a skilled trade like a painter, a tailor, or a merchant the

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:06.460
anglo-saxon farmers working in the fields owned many cows, pigs and sheep

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:08.470
But once they were served up in a Norman banquet,

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:14.319
they became beef, pork, and mutton and written English changed to since many Anglo Saxons couldn't write the written language was

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:19.510
romanticized your annoying friend that says Cool Hwip might just be speaking an old English dialect as the

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:26.769
anglo-saxons originally wrote it hwen hwere and hwat but the Normans swapped the w and h around and the long English 'a' vowel sounded more like an

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:30.189
'O' to the Normans so you can thank them that you live in a home not a ham (thx Normans! :D)

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:36.340
Hey, fun fact about William. The man couldn't read or write not in French not in English not in anything (he have dyslexia)

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:36.760
well
