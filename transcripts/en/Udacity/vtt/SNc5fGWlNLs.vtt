00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.069
So I searched Google for, how to center align a button vertically and

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:05.860
horizontally in an iPhone app.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.780
And after a bit of browsing, I landed on this blog which addressed the issue.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.135
By the way, a link to this blog is also available in the instructor notes.

00:00:15.135 --> 00:00:18.000
There I learned that on my storyboard,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.930
there is this super tiny button here at the bottom called Document Outline.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.440
Let me just quickly go ahead and center my storyboard one more time.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.740
Now, I know that there is a lot of new information here on the Document Outline,

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.330
but for now I only want to you to focus on the things that we've added already.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.860
Things like the Record Button and the view that it is enclosed within.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.970
Now, to center this button horizontally, what I will do is select the button and

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.260
then I will hold the Control Key down on my keyboard and

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.800
start dragging from the button in this direction, and let go.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.610
And here I will select the option that says, Center Horizontally in Container.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.350
Done.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.330
To center vertically, I will hold the Control Key down on

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.370
my keyboard one more time and start dragging from my button in this direction,

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.370
and then select, Center Vertically in Container.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.830
There.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.380
Now, what we are doing here is adding something called constraints.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.850
This is XCodes way of putting things at a precise location on your phone.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.220
You can see here in the document outline that we have added two constraints.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.710
A center x alignment, and a y alignment.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.302
Okay.

00:01:31.302 --> 00:01:33.680
So I'm going to go ahead and run my app and see if it worked.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.410
It says, Stop Pitch Perfect?

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.310
Oh, the simulator is already running, so

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.970
I'll say Stop, and then it will restart it.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.200
Aha, there is the Record Button.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.450
This time in the center of the phone.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.530
Now if for some reason I want to delete these constraints,

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.120
all I have to do is select them, and hit Delete on my keyboard.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.480
There, gone.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.350
Let me stop the app and run it one more time.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.360
And we can see that the Record Button is not aligned anymore.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.980
So I'm going to go back and add the constraints, but

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.700
this time, I will use this tiny button here at the bottom which says Align.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.597
I will select the button, and then click on Align, and

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:15.866
say Horizontal Centering Container and Vertical Centering Container.

00:02:15.866 --> 00:02:18.170
And then I will add the two constraints.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.360
There. Let me stop the simulator and

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.190
run the app again, and boom, our button is in the center.
