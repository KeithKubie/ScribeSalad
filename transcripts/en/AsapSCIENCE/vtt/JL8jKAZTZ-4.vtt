This episode is supported by Skillshare.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.895
Campfires need wood to release heat, cars need petroleum to move,

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.885
and you need food to fuel every aspect of your life.

00:00:08.885 --> 00:00:11.240
So what would happen to your body, right now,

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.640
if you suddenly stopped eating food?

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.540
To understand what happens without food,

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.580
we first need to understand what happens when you eat.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.660
It starts with the sun, who's energy is harvested by photosynthesis and plants

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.820
We then consume that stored chemical energy,

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.480
either directly from eating plants like a tomato

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.280
or by eating an animal like chicken that has eaten a plant like grains

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.120
If we take a hamburger as an example

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.180
you absorb fats from the lipid-filled sauces,

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.040
proteins from the beef patty, and

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.900
carbohydrates from the starchy bun.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.620
And it's your digestive system using processes like chewing, gastric acid, and enzymes

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.780
to break the food into small enough molecules that you can then absorb into your bloodstream.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.160
Any excess glucose is stored in the liver and muscles as glycogen

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.280
while some are converted into fats.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.800
you can visually see some of the fat stores in the pudgier parts of your body.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.520
There are around 37 trillion cells in your body and you start to really

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.080
harvest the energy from your food in the mitochondria of your cells.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.760
This is where glucose and fats have been broken down into Acetyl CoA

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.920
and now go through the citric acid cycle

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.100
where they're modified continuously to release tons of energy carrying molecules.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.200
The energy from these molecules are then used to pump protons

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.240
into a layer of the mitochondria that becomes so dense with protons

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.900
they need to diffuse back into the less busy space

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.460
and do so by going through a protein called ATP synthase.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.900
As a result ATP is created, the most important energy source in your body.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.520
You use around 10²⁵ molecules of ATP everyday.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.000
When this ATP is hydrolyzed into ADP in your body,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.780
the bond breaks releasing energy for things like electrons forming bonds

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.180
and essentially creating all aspects of your ability to live.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.100
If you stopped consuming food, within 6 hours your body will be breaking down glycogen into glucose

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.720
and fat into acetyl CoA to keep your bioloical processes at work.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.000
And this is quite normal, but after 72 hours,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.920
your body will need to start breaking down protein in order to synthesize glucose from amino acids

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.300
otherwise your brain will starve.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.780
This is because fats used for energy can't cross the blood-brain barrier

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.300
With no vitamins and minerals being consumed, people might start to get sick within a week.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.760
After several weeks of starvation, fat stores become depleted,

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.180
and all that is left for energy is proteins

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.420
at this point essential proteins for survival, like antibodies used to fight infection

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.820
or muscle proteins used for strength, are now being used to make glucose.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.040
And this loss of protein leads to severe illnesses.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.140
Death can come as short as 3 weeks to 70 days,

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.860
commonly from a heart attack due to the tissue degradation of the heart, diaphragm, and body.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.640
A factor in how long you live is how hydrated you stay

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.300
and also how many fat stores you had to begin with.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.780
Although it's pretty amazing to think that if you did stop eating today

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.620
you could potentially live for another 70 days,

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.720
but please, don't try this at home.
