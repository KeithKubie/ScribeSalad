00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.740
It seems odd at first to imagine that we might
get angry, even maddened, by a partner because

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.789
they were, in the course of a discussion,
proving to be too reasonable and too logical.

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.090
We are used to thinking highly of reason and
logic. We are not normally enemies of evidence

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:29.450
and rationality. How then could these ingredients
become problematic in the course of love?

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.850
But from close up, considered with sufficient
imagination, our suspicion can make a lot

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.309
of sense. When we are in difficulties what
we may primarily be seeking from our partners

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.530
is a sense that they understand what we are
going through. We are not looking for answers

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.570
(the problems may be too large for there to
be any obvious ones) so much as comfort, reassurance

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.629
and fellow-feeling. In the circumstances,
the deployment of an overly logical stance

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.870
may come across not as an act of kindness,
but as a species of disguised impatience.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.260
Let’s imagine someone who comes to their
partner complaining of vertigo. The fear of

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:15.600
heights is usually manifestly unreasonable:
the balcony obviously isn’t about to collapse,

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.210
there’s a strong iron balustrade between
us and the abyss, the building has been repeatedly

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:27.220
tested by experts. We may know all this intellectually,
but it does nothing to reduce our sickening

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.289
anxiety in practice. If a partner were to
patiently begin to explain the laws of physics

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:42.549
to us, we wouldn’t be grateful: we would
simply feel they were misunderstanding us. Much that troubles us has a structure akin

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:48.039
to vertigo; our worry isn’t exactly reasonable
but we’re unsettled all the same. We can,

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.679
for example, continue to feel guilty about
letting down our parents, no matter how nice

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:58.380
to them we’ve actually been. Or we can feel
very worried about money even if we’re objectively

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.920
economically quite safe. We can feel horrified
by our own appearance even though no one else

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.220
judges our face or body harshly. Or we can
be certain that we’re failures who’ve

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.510
messed up everything we’ve ever done – even
if, in objective terms, we seem to be doing

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.819
pretty well. We can obsess that we’ve forgotten
to pack something even though we’ve taken

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.620
a lot of care and can, in any case, buy almost
everything at the other end. Or we may feel

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.730
that our life will fall apart if we have to
make a short speech even though thousands

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.510
of people make quite bad speeches every day
and their lives continue as normal. When we

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.239
recount our worries to our partner, we may
receive a set of precisely delivered, unimpassioned

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.129
logical answers – we have been good to our
parents, we have packed enough toothpaste

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:47.710
etc. – answers that are both entirely true
and yet unhelpful as well, and so in their

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:54.360
own way enraging. It feels as if the excessive
logic of the other has led them to look down

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.940
on our concerns. Because, reasonably speaking,
we shouldn’t have our fears or worries,

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.239
the implication is that no sane person would
have them; our partners make us feel a bit

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:11.310
mad. The one putting forward the ‘logical’
point of view shouldn’t be surprised by

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.550
the angry response they receive. They are
forgetting how weird and beyond the ordinary

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:22.769
rules of reason all human minds can be, their
own included. The logic they are applying

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.630
is really a species of brute common-sense
that refuses the insights of psychology. Of

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.689
course our minds are prey to fantasms, illusions,
projections and neurotic terrors. Of course

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:39.190
we’re afraid of many things that don’t
exist in the so-called real world. But such

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.260
phenomena are not so much ‘illogical’
as deserving of the application of a deeper

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.060
logic based on a sympathy for the complexities
of emotional life. Our sense of whether we’re

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.920
attractive or not isn’t about what we actually
look like, it follows a so-called logic that

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.761
goes back to childhood and how loved we were
made to feel by those we depended on. The

00:03:59.761 --> 00:04:05.760
fear of public speaking is bound up with long-buried
and tortuous emotions of shame and a fear

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.370
around competing and dealing with another’s
envy.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.300
An excessively logical approach to fears discounts

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.910
their origins and concentrates instead on
why we shouldn’t have them: which is maddening

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.810
when we are in pain. It’s not that we actually
want our partner to stop being reasonable;

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.199
we want them to apply their intelligence to
the task of reassurance. We want them to enter

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:35.040
into the weirder bits of our own experience
by remembering their own. We want to be understood

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:41.250
for being the mad animals we all are, and
then comforted and consoled that it will (probably)

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:47.570
all be OK anyway. Then again, it could be
that the application of excessive logic isn’t

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:54.759
an accident or form of stupidity. It may just
be an act of revenge. Perhaps the partner

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:59.870
is giving brief logical answers to our worries
because their efforts to be more sympathetic

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:05.100
towards us in the past have gone nowhere.
Perhaps we have neglected their needs. If

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.500
two people were being properly ‘logical’
in the deepest sense of the word – that

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.440
is, truly alive to all the complexities of
emotional functioning – rather than squabbling

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.150
around the question of ‘Why are you being
so rational when I’m in pain?’, the person

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.509
on the receiving end of superficial logic
should gently change the subject and ask:

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:32.160
‘Is it possible I’ve hurt or been neglecting
you?’ That would be real logic.
