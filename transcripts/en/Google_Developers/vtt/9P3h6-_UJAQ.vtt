LAURENCE MORONEY: Today
on Coffee with a Googler

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:04.200
we're having coffee, cloud,
containers and a whole lot

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.960
more with stand up comic
and developer advocate

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.820
extraordinaire Carter Morgan.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.285
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.920
So, Carter, you've had so many
roles like soldier, bartender,

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.840
I hear you worked in
a software company

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.712
over in Redmond, blogger.

00:00:24.712 --> 00:00:27.170
What brings you to Google, and
what are you doing here now?

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.460
CARTER MORGAN: Well, I
came because I wanted

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.660
to be a developer advocate.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.710
I wanted to stop being
a software engineer,

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.350
where I was at the other
company in Redmond and what not.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.000
LAURENCE MORONEY:
I know the one.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.670
CARTER MORGAN: You know one?

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.520
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah,
I think that's it.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.240
CARTER MORGAN: Yeah.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.860
And so I wrote this nine page
cover letter to try and get in,

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.890
because I'm like, you have
no experience in this field.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.400
Somehow they let me in.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.540
And now I get to run
workshops and teach people

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.820
how to use our
technology with videos,

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.202
or workshops, blog posts.

00:00:55.202 --> 00:00:55.910
It's really cool.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.320
LAURENCE MORONEY:
A nine page letter?

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.195
CARTER MORGAN: I did.

00:00:58.195 --> 00:00:59.610
It was literally nine pages.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.280
It was all Google
colored and themed.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.394
It was horrible looking.

00:01:02.394 --> 00:01:04.019
LAURENCE MORONEY: Do
you still have it?

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:04.852
CARTER MORGAN: I do.

00:01:04.852 --> 00:01:06.410
I still look at it time to time.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.469
LAURENCE MORONEY: It's
framed in your office?

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:11.010
CARTER MORGAN: So
I wanted attention.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.760
I didn't have any
experience in this role,

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.460
so I did things like I wrote
a haiku in the middle falsely

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.510
attributed to Rob Pike.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.101
It said something
like, you don't

00:01:20.101 --> 00:01:22.100
have to write long cover
letters if your name is

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.190
Rob Pike, signed Rob Pike,
or something like that.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.980
And someone that I interviewed
with sent it to him,

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.240
and I get this response back,
and it said something like,

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.480
ad hominem arguments for
[? and or ?] [? khand ?] are

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.550
not convincing.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:37.550
LAURENCE MORONEY:
And that's a haiku.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.730
CARTER MORGAN: Yeah,
and I didn't realize it.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.516
I just thought Rob
Pike was really mean

00:01:40.516 --> 00:01:42.350
and just dashed my dreams.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.683
LAURENCE MORONEY: He's not mean.

00:01:43.683 --> 00:01:45.150
He's way above average.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.207
Sorry, that's my bad
joke for the day.

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:49.040
So I'm the one making
the joke, but you also

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.390
do stand up comedy right?

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.680
CARTER MORGAN: I dabble.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.000
I try and do some stand up,
mostly in Seattle and whatnot.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.850
It's been a real big help
for the job and speaking

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:59.704
in front of people.

00:01:59.704 --> 00:02:01.370
Well, I don't have
to be afraid anymore,

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.655
because I've been in
front of drunk audiences.

00:02:03.655 --> 00:02:05.030
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Now, just given

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.571
that you've done
the stand up comedy,

00:02:06.571 --> 00:02:08.405
and you weren't a
developer advocate before,

00:02:08.405 --> 00:02:10.529
and you wrote this big
letter, and that brought you

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:13.130
into Google, how was it to fit
into the role of a developer

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.092
advocate?

00:02:14.092 --> 00:02:15.800
CARTER MORGAN: Well,
when I first joined,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.240
I joined the DP team.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.219
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK, so DP are
the people who build our sample

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:21.010
applications right?

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.301
CARTER MORGAN: Yes, so
developer of programs engineers.

00:02:23.301 --> 00:02:25.960
And they are more
internal facing.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.189
And developer advocates are
more customer-developer facing.

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:30.230
And it wasn't a good fit.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.857
It was a year that was
really a tough fit, because I

00:02:32.857 --> 00:02:34.940
wrote this nine page cover
letter like, here's all

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.898
the external stuff that
I do, and they're like,

00:02:36.898 --> 00:02:37.765
don't do that.

00:02:37.765 --> 00:02:40.390
But Google was really flexible,
and they kind of worked with me

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.980
to transition to this team.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.810
So it's still
finding your place,

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.850
how can I be most effective.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.360
You get a lot of freedom
in this role, which is--

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.390
it can be terrifying when
you join a new company

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.580
with all these smart people.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.570
Rob Pike works here.

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.400
You work here.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.160
LAURENCE MORONEY:
I'd lower the average

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.480
to balance it out with Rob.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.870
So that's the only
reason they hired me.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.729
So you're doing all this
stuff like outreach,

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:06.520
that kind of thing.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.660
Now, it's cloud that you
work on and Kubernetes

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:09.669
in particular right?

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:10.460
CARTER MORGAN: Yes.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.806
So the tool I've been focused
on for the first year I

00:03:12.806 --> 00:03:15.140
was at Google was Kubernetes,
and that's, basically,

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.870
an orchestrator for containers
or running applications,

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.360
so how do you do that at scale.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.860
Now that we've done
that for a year,

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.860
I'm moving over into continuous
integration and delivery,

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.560
which is how do you
actually deliver a software,

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.030
how do you send updates
out in a controlled manner,

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.560
a deterministic way.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.797
And so the tool we're focusing
on right now is Spinnaker.

00:03:35.797 --> 00:03:37.880
So that's been exciting,
too, because, again, it's

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.350
like every year
it's almost like you

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.940
have to start from
scratch and relearn

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.330
a whole tool, or
platform, or community.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.330
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.538
And that's also what it's
like for developers, right?

00:03:46.538 --> 00:03:48.290
With the pace of
technology going so fast,

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.450
there's continuing pressure on
them to keep their skills up

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.949
to date.

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:54.710
So people like you and me, our
job is to get ahead of that,

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:56.720
and to be ready to
teach them, and to be

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.920
ready to share our experiences.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.430
One of the nice things is
that you're not a salesperson.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.760
CARTER MORGAN: I'm
not a salesperson,

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.540
and so that's really important.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.580
There's got to be some
times where I say,

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.130
I don't think this
tool is the best.

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.700
I don't think this is
the right way to do it.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.520
And I think that's something
a salesperson couldn't say.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.853
They'd have to be like, use
this product no matter what.

00:04:15.853 --> 00:04:16.490
It's the best.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:18.890
LAURENCE MORONEY: You don't have
a quota to meet or anything.

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:20.029
You love this
technology, and you

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:21.200
get to share it with people.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.010
CARTER MORGAN: 100.

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.580
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now, I know
you have a new video series,

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.500
the "Cloud Rolling Update."

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.800
Could you tell us about it?

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.633
CARTER MORGAN: Yeah.

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:28.550
So the "Cloud Rolling
Update" is a series

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.580
where we show why Google
Cloud Platform is the place

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.752
to deliver code to and from.

00:04:33.752 --> 00:04:35.420
And so the first
couple of videos

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.060
are brief overviews of this
tool called Google Container

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.350
Builder.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.600
It's like a Docker tool, but
you don't use it locally.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.690
You use it in the cloud.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.104
It's really cool.

00:04:44.104 --> 00:04:45.770
And then after that,
we're going to talk

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.400
about Spinnaker and continuous
integration delivery

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.260
using Kubernetes.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.930
So the idea is you have
an application, well,

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:54.930
how do you update it?

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.620
And we're going to show how
to do that on Google Container

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.160
Engine.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.820
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now,
I know you've brought

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.170
a clip of the show with us.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.100
What's this clip?

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.360
CARTER MORGAN: So this
clip is the first video

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.429
in the series, where you
probably get started,

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:06.470
and it's just covering
Container Builder, so what

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:07.970
is it, how do I use it.

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.800
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh,
let's check it out.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.280
CARTER MORGAN: And on
top of that, it's fast.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.970
It has support for
custom build steps,

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.655
which can be concurrently.

00:05:14.655 --> 00:05:16.530
And there's support for
using build triggers,

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.110
so that you can create
images automatically.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.750
And all of this comes
with full integration

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.270
with Google Container Registry,
the same service that's

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.760
being used by Google Cloud
Functions, App Engine

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.340
Flex, and more.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.640
So let's see this in action.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.919
For example, if you
already have a Docker file,

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:35.710
you can just use it
like you normally would

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.360
to build a container image.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.402
Here, you can see we have
a standard Docker file.

00:05:39.402 --> 00:05:40.901
LAURENCE MORONEY:
In that video, you

00:05:40.901 --> 00:05:42.760
were talking about
Container Builder.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.010
So if I'm a developer,
and there's just

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.552
this array of options
in front of me,

00:05:46.552 --> 00:05:48.843
what's a good way for me to
get started with this stuff

00:05:48.843 --> 00:05:50.000
to take advantage of it?

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.800
CARTER MORGAN: Well, the
first thing I would do

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.290
is check out the link
in the description.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.290
We've got tutorials and videos
showing how to use the tool,

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:57.870
and why you want to.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.310
That's first.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.940
So Container Builder just
replaces, on the cloud side,

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.520
tools that are common to
most developers like Docker.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.840
So now instead of having
to run it locally,

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.500
you can just send
that out to the cloud

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.450
and it'll run for you.

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.070
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.510
So in addition to
all that, I know

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:16.195
you've done teaching through
things like Udacity courses.

00:06:16.195 --> 00:06:17.290
CARTER MORGAN: You have, too, yeah?

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.020
LAURENCE MORONEY: I have, and
they're really fun, because--

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.400
has your experience
been the same as mine?

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.350
That whenever you go to an
event, and you're talking,

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:25.540
there's usually somebody
that goes, I know that face.

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:25.870
CARTER MORGAN: Yeah.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.619
Sometimes I've had
the opposite, too.

00:06:27.619 --> 00:06:29.410
So I did this course
with Kelsey Hightower.

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:30.640
He's super popular.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.420
LAURENCE MORONEY:
We all know Kelsey.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:32.503
We've had him on the show.

00:06:32.503 --> 00:06:33.070
He's great.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.800
So we want to have
him on the show again.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.170
So just tell him we said that.

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.890
CARTER MORGAN: I'll tell him.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.540
But so, I was at a conference,
and someone came up to me,

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.373
and they're like, hey,
have you seen Kelsey?

00:06:42.373 --> 00:06:43.599
And I'm like, no, not yet.

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:45.140
Is there anything
I could pass along?

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.556
And this person
goes, yeah, I just

00:06:46.556 --> 00:06:48.460
wanted to tell him that
the course was great.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.735
And I'm like, I
was in the course.

00:06:51.735 --> 00:06:53.110
But no, normally,
a lot of people

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.210
come and they say
thank you for teaching.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.920
They really like the
guided progression

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.380
through a topic and
the really short videos

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.234
instead of this long overview.

00:07:01.234 --> 00:07:03.400
LAURENCE MORONEY: Because
it's hard to sit and watch

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.477
45 minutes on cloud.

00:07:04.477 --> 00:07:06.310
I love cloud, but it's
hard to sit and watch

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.270
45 minutes on cloud.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:08.680
But three or four
minutes of you,

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.138
three or four minutes of Kelsey,
and then and little a quiz

00:07:11.138 --> 00:07:13.999
afterwards, that kind of thing,
it also helps retain knowledge.

00:07:13.999 --> 00:07:14.790
CARTER MORGAN: Yes.

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:17.080
So, again, you're
changing up the nods

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.497
that's coming, the presenter,
and so it's always engaging.

00:07:19.497 --> 00:07:21.413
And so I think that's
the most important thing

00:07:21.413 --> 00:07:24.029
to think about, whether you're
writing a sample or an article,

00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:25.570
is how can I engage
people, how can I

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:27.945
write this in a way that makes
them want to reach the end

00:07:27.945 --> 00:07:29.695
and don't feel overwhelmed
to get started.

00:07:29.695 --> 00:07:32.028
LAURENCE MORONEY: So we spoke
a little about the Udacity

00:07:32.028 --> 00:07:34.420
course, and I just realized
for a lot of people

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.730
out there who don't understand
what Kubernetes is, it's

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.060
really cool, but what is it?

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.140
CARTER MORGAN: I should
have started there.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.180
Kubernetes is a
container orchestrator.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.610
So a container is just a way
to bundle an application.

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.340
So you can run it anywhere, and
it's going to behave the same.

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.350
That works really
well on one machine,

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:53.410
but when you scale up to 10
machines, 100 machines, 1,000,

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:55.215
it doesn't scale as well.

00:07:55.215 --> 00:07:56.590
And so what you
want is something

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:58.330
to manage all that
complexity for you.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.889
How does container A
talk to container B?

00:08:00.889 --> 00:08:02.680
What happens if container
B gets shut down?

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.110
Do I want to manually go to a
terminal and start it back up,

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.830
check if it's up?

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:06.830
No.

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:09.160
And so Kubernetes is
a container framework

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.445
that sits on top of something
like Google Container

00:08:11.445 --> 00:08:14.890
Builder or Docker and
runs these containers,

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.350
starts and stops them, makes
sure they're communicating,

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:18.925
helps check so much
more all for you.

00:08:18.925 --> 00:08:20.800
LAURENCE MORONEY: So if
I want to get started

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.008
by putting together an
infrastructure that uses that,

00:08:23.008 --> 00:08:23.790
where would I go?

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.790
CARTER MORGAN: Well, we
have the Udacity course,

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:28.289
which is free three hours of
training from myself and Kelsey

00:08:28.289 --> 00:08:29.120
Hightower.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:33.650
There's kubernetes.io,
which is a great start.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:35.309
Probably more links
in the description.

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:36.725
LAURENCE MORONEY:
OK, sounds good.

00:08:36.725 --> 00:08:38.380
Now, you've mentioned
Kelsey Hightower.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.880
You get to work
with some superstars

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.076
here on Google, right?

00:08:41.076 --> 00:08:41.909
CARTER MORGAN: I do.

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:44.200
That's probably my favorite
part about being at Google,

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.102
to be honest.

00:08:45.102 --> 00:08:47.560
One, I get to work with people
that are really intelligent.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.380
Part of the "Cloud
Rolling Update" series

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.730
is taking things I've learned
from other people like Vic

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:55.460
Iglesias, Ahmet Balkan,
Kelsey Hightower,

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.640
and putting that
into video format

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.341
for a different audience.

00:09:00.341 --> 00:09:01.840
I've also gotten a
lot of mentorship

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.795
from people like Kelsey,
Sarah Novotny, Colt McAnlis.

00:09:04.795 --> 00:09:06.670
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow,
some good names there.

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:07.750
CARTER MORGAN:
Yeah, and it's cool

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:08.990
because they've been so open.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:10.240
These are people
that are established

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.920
at a company like
Google, and they're still

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.211
taking the time to say, hey,
let me show you the ropes.

00:09:14.211 --> 00:09:15.894
Let me help you.

00:09:15.894 --> 00:09:18.310
LAURENCE MORONEY: So when you
wrote that nine page letter,

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:21.440
was that what you felt
would end up happening?

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.197
CARTER MORGAN: You
know, I had no idea.

00:09:23.197 --> 00:09:23.780
I had no idea.

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:26.470
I'd never been to a
company like Google,

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:31.270
like such a young
and open company.

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:33.824
And so I'm still learning
how to be a good Googler.

00:09:33.824 --> 00:09:35.740
LAURENCE MORONEY: You
got to blog that letter.

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:36.850
We all want to see it now.

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:38.808
CARTER MORGAN: I have it
if you want to see it.

00:09:38.808 --> 00:09:40.204
It's on Medium.

00:09:40.204 --> 00:09:42.120
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh,
yeah, if it's on Medium,

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.079
I'll look out for it.

00:09:43.079 --> 00:09:44.620
CARTER MORGAN: I'll
send it your way.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.350
LAURENCE MORONEY: Thanks,
we'll put it in the links.

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:50.044
One of the things
that we've seen,

00:09:50.044 --> 00:09:52.210
even with people we've been
talking to on this show,

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:54.640
is that just 18 months
or two years ago,

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.880
cloud was always that thing
that seemed to be in the future.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.900
But now it's like it's
almost the new normal, right?

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.740
That if I'm a developer
starting out today,

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.510
it should be cloud first.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:07.559
It should be let's
get going, right now.

00:10:07.559 --> 00:10:09.100
And is there any
advice that you give

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.950
to developers starting out?

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:14.680
CARTER MORGAN: So the best
thing that happened to me was,

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.320
again, someone told me to learn
this Kubernetes framework.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.781
And the reason why is it
abstracted away all the

00:10:19.781 --> 00:10:20.530
behind the scenes.

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:22.446
I didn't have to think
about machines anymore.

00:10:22.446 --> 00:10:25.600
So I learned one API that had
years of Google's experience

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:30.050
behind it, and then I could
manipulate objects at scale.

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:31.690
So that was really
useful for me.

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:33.190
And so, now, some
people look at me,

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:35.492
and they say, oh, I'm an expert.

00:10:35.492 --> 00:10:36.700
And I'm like, no I got lucky.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.710
I learned the right tool first.

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:40.900
So for me, I would
start off with learning

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.517
how to manipulate
or use Kubernetes

00:10:43.517 --> 00:10:45.100
and then using that
to think about how

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.920
I think about distributed
applications or cloud based

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.600
applications.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.900
LAURENCE MORONEY: So you're able
to do programming at your desk,

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.656
but expand that to cloud
scale and to Google scale

00:10:55.656 --> 00:10:57.280
in the cloud, which
is just phenomenal.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:57.670
CARTER MORGAN: Yeah.

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:59.470
So it's crazy, because
with Kubernetes you

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:01.570
can say something
like, Kubernetes run,

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:03.619
and it creates some
application instance for it.

00:11:03.619 --> 00:11:05.410
Then you can say,
Kubernetes scale that up.

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:07.360
Kubernetes expose that
so I can talk to it.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.450
And all the behind the scenes,
the networking, the scheduling,

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:12.230
all that's taken care of.

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:15.070
If you were starting from
scratch maybe two years ago,

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:17.810
you would have had to do
that yourself, all the steps.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.810
And so there's a lot of
power in these platforms

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:21.393
or these frameworks
that abstract away

00:11:21.393 --> 00:11:25.690
all the underlying mechanics of
working with cloud programming.

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:28.900
LAURENCE MORONEY: So you've gone
from a guy writing a nine page

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:30.910
letter to try to get
into Google into one

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:34.600
of the foremost recognized
experts in cloud at Google.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.600
Great cloud series,
teaching stuff on Udacity,

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.274
and it's just been
a privilege to be

00:11:39.274 --> 00:11:40.440
able to chat with you today.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.290
So thank you so much, Carter.

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:44.110
For everybody else
who's watching,

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:46.480
we've put the links in
the description below.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.330
Carter's video course
is a must watch.

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:49.230
And if you want to
learn about cloud,

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.070
and you want to learn
about Kubernetes,

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:52.700
check out his Udacity
course as well.

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.310
So thanks so much, Carter.

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:56.810
CARTER MORGAN: Thanks, Laurence.
