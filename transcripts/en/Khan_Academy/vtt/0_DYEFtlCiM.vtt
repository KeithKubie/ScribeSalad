00:00:00.735 --> 00:00:01.806
Voiceover:In the last video we saw

00:00:01.806 --> 00:00:03.561
that we could take a
system of two equations

00:00:03.561 --> 00:00:05.786
with two unknowns and represent it

00:00:05.786 --> 00:00:09.119
as a matrix equation where the matrix A's

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:11.792
are the coefficients here
on the left-hand side.

00:00:11.792 --> 00:00:13.669
The column vector X has our two

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:16.610
unknown variables, S and T.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:17.845
Then the column vector B is essentially

00:00:17.845 --> 00:00:20.529
representing the
right-hand side over here.

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:21.646
What was interesting about it,

00:00:21.646 --> 00:00:23.386
then that would be the equation A,

00:00:23.386 --> 00:00:25.230
the matrix A times the column vector X

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.605
being equal to the column vector B.

00:00:27.605 --> 00:00:29.900
What was interesting about that is we saw

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.640
well, look, if A is invertible,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.331
we can multiply both the
left and the right-hand sides

00:00:34.331 --> 00:00:35.540
of the equation,

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.410
and we have to multiply
them on the left-hand sides

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.440
of their respective sides by A inverse

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.878
because remember matrix,

00:00:40.878 --> 00:00:43.123
when matrix multiplication order matters,

00:00:43.123 --> 00:00:44.911
we're multiplying the left-hand side

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:46.666
of both sides of the equation.

00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:49.197
If we do that then we
can get to essentially

00:00:49.197 --> 00:00:52.680
solving for the unknown column vector.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.549
If we know what column vector X is,

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:55.980
then we know what S and T are.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.300
Then we've essentially solved

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.379
this system of equations.

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:00.913
Now let's actually do that.

00:01:00.913 --> 00:01:03.531
Let's actually figure
out what A inverse is

00:01:03.531 --> 00:01:05.533
and multiply that times
the column vector B

00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.980
to figure out what the column vector X is,

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.119
and what S and T are.

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:15.501
A inverse, A inverse is equal to

00:01:15.501 --> 00:01:17.847
one over the determinant of A,

00:01:17.847 --> 00:01:21.771
the determinant of A for a two-by-two here

00:01:21.771 --> 00:01:26.780
is going to be two times
four minus negative

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.416
two times negative five.

00:01:28.416 --> 00:01:32.559
It's going to be eight minus positive 10,

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:34.381
eight minus positive 10,

00:01:34.381 --> 00:01:36.031
which would be negative two.

00:01:36.031 --> 00:01:39.290
This would become negative
two right over here.

00:01:39.343 --> 00:01:42.114
Once again, two times four is eight minus

00:01:42.114 --> 00:01:44.700
negative two times negative five

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.960
so minus positive 10 which
gets us negative two.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.117
You multiply one over the determinant

00:01:50.117 --> 00:01:54.871
times what is sometimes
called the adjoint of A

00:01:54.871 --> 00:01:57.905
which is essentially swapping the top left

00:01:57.905 --> 00:02:00.847
and bottom right or at least
for a two-by-two matrix.

00:02:00.847 --> 00:02:03.641
This would be a four.

00:02:03.641 --> 00:02:05.639
This would be a two.

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:06.920
Notice I just swapped these,

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.291
and making these two negative,

00:02:08.291 --> 00:02:10.443
the negative of what they already are.

00:02:10.443 --> 00:02:11.919
This is from a negative two this is

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:13.501
going to become a positive two,

00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:14.627
and this right over
here is going to become

00:02:14.627 --> 00:02:16.237
a positive five.

00:02:16.237 --> 00:02:18.963
If all of this looks
completely unfamiliar to you,

00:02:18.963 --> 00:02:21.530
you might want to review the tutorial

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.693
on inverting matrices

00:02:22.693 --> 00:02:25.240
because that's all I'm doing here.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.551
So A inverse is going to be equal to,

00:02:28.551 --> 00:02:31.920
A inverse is going to be equal to,

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.720
let's see, this is negative 1/2 times four

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.773
is negative two.

00:02:36.773 --> 00:02:42.705
Negative 1/2, negative 1/2 times five

00:02:42.705 --> 00:02:48.309
is negative 2.5, negative 2.5.

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:52.810
And negative 1/2 times
two is negative one.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.180
Negative 1/2 times two is negative one.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.986
So that's A inverse right over here.

00:02:56.986 --> 00:02:59.371
Now let's multiply A inverse times

00:02:59.371 --> 00:03:01.720
our column vector, seven, negative six.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.710
Let's do that.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.175
This is A inverse. I'll rewrite it.

00:03:05.175 --> 00:03:09.433
Negative two, negative 2.5, negative one,

00:03:09.433 --> 00:03:15.157
negative one times seven and negative six.

00:03:15.157 --> 00:03:17.963
Times, I'll just write
them all in white here now.

00:03:17.963 --> 00:03:19.680
Seven, negative six.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.861
We've had a lot of practice
multiplying matrices.

00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:26.395
So what is this going to be equal to?

00:03:26.395 --> 00:03:28.120
The first entry is
going to be negative two

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.520
times seven which is negative 14 plus

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.548
negative 2.5 times negative six.

00:03:38.548 --> 00:03:40.780
Let's see. That's going to be positive.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.751
That's going to be 12 plus another 3.

00:03:43.751 --> 00:03:45.666
That's going to be plus 15.

00:03:45.666 --> 00:03:47.703
Plus 15.

00:03:47.703 --> 00:03:49.887
Negative 2.5 times negative six

00:03:49.887 --> 00:03:52.131
is positive 15.

00:03:52.131 --> 00:03:54.143
Then we're going to have negative one

00:03:54.143 --> 00:03:57.686
times seven which is negative seven plus

00:03:57.686 --> 00:04:00.130
negative one times negative six.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.697
Well, that is positive six.

00:04:02.697 --> 00:04:06.530
So the product A inverse B

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.812
which is the same things
as a column vector X

00:04:08.812 --> 00:04:09.999
is equal to,

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:11.840
we deserve a little
bit of a drum roll now,

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.716
the column vector one, negative one.

00:04:15.716 --> 00:04:18.914
We have just shown that this is equal to

00:04:18.914 --> 00:04:22.249
one, negative one or that X is equal to

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:23.852
one, negative one,

00:04:23.852 --> 00:04:27.891
or we could even say
that the column vector,

00:04:27.891 --> 00:04:32.720
the column vector ST,

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.772
column vector with the
entries S and T is equal to,

00:04:36.772 --> 00:04:43.306
is equal to one, negative one,

00:04:43.306 --> 00:04:46.596
is equal to one, negative one

00:04:46.596 --> 00:04:47.593
which is another way of saying

00:04:47.593 --> 00:04:49.250
that S is equal to one

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.411
and T is equal to negative one.

00:04:51.411 --> 00:04:52.470
I know what you're saying.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:53.539
I said this in the last video

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:54.808
and I'll say it again in this video.

00:04:54.808 --> 00:04:56.172
You're like, "Well, you
know, it was so much easier

00:04:56.172 --> 00:04:58.115
"to just solve this system directly

00:04:58.115 --> 00:05:01.127
"just with using elimination
or using substitution."

00:05:01.127 --> 00:05:05.910
I agree with you, but
this is a useful technique

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.664
because when you are doing problems

00:05:07.664 --> 00:05:10.125
in computation there may be situations

00:05:10.125 --> 00:05:12.111
where you have the left-hand side

00:05:12.111 --> 00:05:14.800
of this system stays the same,

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.362
but there's many, many,
many different values

00:05:16.362 --> 00:05:18.274
for the right-hand side of the system.

00:05:18.274 --> 00:05:20.426
So it might be easier to just compute

00:05:20.426 --> 00:05:23.907
the inverse once and
just keep multiplying,

00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:26.266
keep multiplying this inverse times

00:05:26.266 --> 00:05:29.885
the different what we have
on the right-hand side.

00:05:29.885 --> 00:05:32.132
You probably are familiar with some types,

00:05:32.132 --> 00:05:33.869
you have graphics processors,

00:05:33.869 --> 00:05:35.600
and graphics cards on computers

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.780
and they talk about
special graphic processors.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.397
What these are really all about

00:05:39.397 --> 00:05:41.875
are the hardware that is special-purposed

00:05:41.875 --> 00:05:45.480
for really fast matrix multiplication

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.553
because when you're
doing graphics processing

00:05:47.553 --> 00:05:48.864
when you're thinking about modeling things

00:05:48.864 --> 00:05:49.879
in three dimensions,

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:51.387
and you're doing all
these transformations,

00:05:51.387 --> 00:05:52.841
you're really just doing a lot of

00:05:52.841 --> 00:05:55.285
matrix multiplications
really, really, really fast

00:05:55.285 --> 00:05:57.693
in real time so that to
the user playing the game

00:05:57.693 --> 00:05:59.480
or whatever they're doing,

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.836
it feels like they're in some type

00:06:00.836 --> 00:06:03.866
of a 3D, real-time reality.

00:06:03.866 --> 00:06:05.761
Anyway, I just want to point that out.

00:06:05.761 --> 00:06:09.979
This wouldn't be, if I
saw this just randomly

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:13.297
my instincts would be to
solve this with elimination,

00:06:13.297 --> 00:06:16.930
but this ability to think of this

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.642
as a matrix equation is a
very, very useful concept,

00:06:21.642 --> 00:06:23.240
one actually not just in computation,

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.560
but also as you go into
higher level sciences

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.878
especially physics, you will see a lot of

00:06:28.878 --> 00:06:31.826
matrix vector equations like this

00:06:31.826 --> 00:06:33.356
that kind of speak in generalities.

00:06:33.356 --> 00:06:34.571
It's really important to think about

00:06:34.571 --> 00:06:36.508
what these actually represent

00:06:36.508 --> 00:06:39.270
and how they can actually be solved.
