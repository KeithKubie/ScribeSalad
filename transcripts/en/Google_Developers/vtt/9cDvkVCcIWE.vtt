WESLEY CHUN: Hey, Alison.

00:00:01.532 --> 00:00:02.020
ALISON CARROLL: Hey, Wes.

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:02.600
WESLEY CHUN: How's it going?

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.050
ALISON CARROLL: Good.

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.600
WESLEY CHUN: Congrats.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.200
I heard you made VP.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.575
ALISON CARROLL: Yeah, thank you.

00:00:05.575 --> 00:00:06.450
WESLEY CHUN: Awesome.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.550
Say, what's with
all the receipts?

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.640
ALISON CARROLL: I've got one
hour to file my expense report.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.290
I've got to run to
a meeting right now.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.150
It's just so frustrating
I have to spend

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.290
all this time doing this.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:16.890
WESLEY CHUN: I'm sorry.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.840
Hey, I've got this cool tool
I think you should check out.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.470
ALISON CARROLL: Yeah?

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.570
WESLEY CHUN: If you go through
all your receipts in Gmail,

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.330
there's this little tool
you click on at the bottom.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.371
It pulls in all the
information off your receipt,

00:00:25.371 --> 00:00:27.367
like the date, the
amount it was for.

00:00:27.367 --> 00:00:29.950
You just plug-in a spreadsheet,
and-- boom-- when you're done,

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:30.990
you'll have an
entire spreadsheet

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.667
full of all your
expenses and one place

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:33.750
to do your expense report.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.070
ALISON CARROLL: Really?

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.230
That is amazing.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.880
Can you show me how
to use that later?

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.470
I've got to run.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.720
WESLEY CHUN: OK.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.280
ALISON CARROLL: But
let's meet up later.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.520
WESLEY CHUN: All right.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.970
Good seeing you.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:39.803
ALISON CARROLL: Bye.

00:00:39.803 --> 00:00:43.800
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:46.480
WESLEY CHUN: Sometimes
the most powerful of tools

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.680
come in small packages.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.690
And today's example
is no exception.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.410
Hello, everyone, and welcome to
another episode of "The G Suite

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.200
Dev Show."

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.880
I'm your host, Wesley Chun.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.130
Today, we're solving a
common business use case

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.127
by building a Gmail add-on.

00:00:59.127 --> 00:01:01.210
I'm joined by Sundar Solai,
the engineer who built

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.900
the tool we'll be discussing.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.819
So, Sundar, what motivated
you to write this app?

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:08.360
SUNDAR SOLAI: One problem we
all try to tackle in our own way

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.370
is managing business expenses.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.250
These days, most businesses
send email receipts,

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.050
so it's natural to
have a tool for users

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.270
directly in Gmail, just
like when you demoed

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.400
the add-on to Alison earlier.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.300
WESLEY CHUN: So what's
the add-on again?

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.360
Well, it's a mini app
that runs within Gmail.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.480
And that cute little interactive
UI is called the card.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.790
Cards could be as
simple as text dialogs,

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.990
but could also include formatted
text, images, links, buttons,

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.970
and even forms, like ours.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.910
A variety of widgets are
available to developers.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.100
The best part is that
cards work seamlessly,

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.445
whether viewed on the
desktop or on mobile.

00:01:42.445 --> 00:01:43.820
SUNDAR SOLAI: The
add-on features

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.350
the code that creates the card.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.090
It also powers the
rest of the logic,

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.180
including parsing the email
and talking to Google Sheets.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.580
So how does one
create a Gmail add-on?

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.710
The secret is
Google Apps Script.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.720
Apps Script is
server-side JavaScript

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.060
customized to execute in
Google's Cloud, giving

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.140
your apps access to G Suite
data in Drive, Gmail, Sheets,

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.870
plus other Google and
external services.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.961
This link takes you to videos
to learn more Apps Script.

00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:11.210
WESLEY CHUN: While add-ons
are powered by Apps Script,

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.920
they extend the
standard functionality

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.570
that everyone gets
in G Suite apps,

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.000
like Docs, Sheets,
and now Gmail.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.520
See the blog post
for more information.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.490
The Gmail add-on we're covering
addresses that exact use case

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.660
for processing
business expenses.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.361
Sundar, can you give us a
bit more on your add-on?

00:02:28.361 --> 00:02:29.360
SUNDAR SOLAI: Sure, Wes.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.550
Our sample app is
called ExpenseIt.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.460
And like you saw with Alison,
it scans the date, amount,

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.590
and vendor from email
receipts, presenting

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.190
a mini form that's automatically
filled in with details.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.830
Users can edit, if necessary,
then submit those values

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.369
to a spreadsheet without
ever leaving Gmail.

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:47.660
Let's walk through some of
the core parts of the add-on

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.436
to give you an idea
of how they're built.

00:02:49.436 --> 00:02:50.810
Then you'll have
enough knowledge

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.260
to build your own when
an idea inspires you.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.200
The first function is
getContextualAddOn.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.970
This is the entry point that's
called to launch the add-on.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.450
Gmail add-ons run on
a per message basis.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.190
So whatever message
you're on, that's

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.070
the message ID that's passed
to getContextualAddOn.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.265
Here, with the help of
some utility functions,

00:03:09.265 --> 00:03:11.390
the email message is parsed
for the relevant values

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.590
from the receipt.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.080
Once we have all the values
in the prefills array,

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.070
the UI add-on is built and
given to Gmail to render.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.090
It calls createExpensesCard
to do this.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.030
createExpensesCard creates
the primary UI of the add-on

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.950
with the form values
being optional,

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.470
so users can edit if
desired, and finally,

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.330
a possible submission status.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.350
Because neither
parameter is required,

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.440
there's a lot more
flexibility in terms of the UI

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.460
that's rendered.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.140
With the same code,
you can have forms

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.170
with values but no status,
a status-only text dialog

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.157
without form fields, or both.

00:03:44.157 --> 00:03:45.740
Due to the size of
the function, we've

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.960
left out the optional
status processing code

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.020
to focus on the key
components here.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.450
The last function we'll
preview is submitForm.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.040
Once the user
submits the form, we

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.660
need to push that data
into a Google sheet.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.720
The first part validates
the form values,

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.909
then it adds a new row into
the sheet specified by the URL.

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.700
Note we've left out
the error checking code

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.280
so as to focus on adding
the expenses to the sheet.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.220
And that's it.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.320
You've now seen the key
pieces of a Gmail add-on.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.650
WESLEY CHUN: Thanks, Sundar.

Now it's time for you
to use your imagination

00:04:39.405 --> 00:04:42.290
to think about how else you can
extend Gmail to solve a problem

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.959
or make users more efficient
with Gmail add-ons.
