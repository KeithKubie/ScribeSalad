00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
These links started to be used in May 1941.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In August 1941, the Allies had a big break.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
An operating was sending a message starting with the initial configuration.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
These configurations came from code books.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The recipients at the other end needed to know that the configuration for that day was.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
But these could be distributed securely and

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
were much smaller than needing to distribute the key sequence.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Once you had the starting configuration, you could transmit

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
an arbitrarily large message if this assumption that the key was

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
completely unpredictable was true.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
In this case the operator sent the message.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The receiver did not receive it.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The receiver said, "Garbled transmission, please resend."

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So the annoyed operator had to send the message again for the insecure channel,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and this time it was received okay.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
If this is exactly what happened, it would have been fine.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
These would be exactly the same.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We restarted the machine in the same configuration.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
But what happened was a little different.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The operator got a little lazy the second time.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The operator was annoyed having to retransmit the message,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
so instead of sending exactly the same message sent a slightly different message.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
That meant that there was a slightly different ciphertext than we had the previous time.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Both of these messages were intercepted.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
That means the Allies now had access to both C and C'.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
They didn't know anything about the key.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
They didn't know anything about the original messages.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Well, maybe they knew a little bit about the original message.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
That's what's going to help them given these two ciphertexts to figure out both the key,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and, once they have the key, the structure of the Lorenz.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
What is the result of XORing these two messages?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
That means for each bit, we go through the bits to the messages XORing each bit.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I want to introduce a new variable here.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
The key that the machine generates we'll call K.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
That's the key that the machine generates starting from configuration C0.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Which one of these is the value that the interceptor would get

00:02:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
by XORing the two intercepted ciphertexts.
