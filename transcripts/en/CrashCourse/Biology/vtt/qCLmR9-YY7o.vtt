00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.110
Reproduction!

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:04.640
Always a popular topic,
and one that I don't mind

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.039
saying that I'm personally
interested in.

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:09.309
The kind of reproduction that
we're most familiar with

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.259
of course is sexual reproduction,
where sperm meets egg,

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:15.669
they share genetic information,
and then that fertilized egg

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:18.330
splits in half, and then those
halves split in half,

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.920
and so on and so on and so on,
to make a living thing with

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.869
trillions of cells that
all do specialized things.

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.109
And if you're not suitably
impressed by the fact that

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.980
we all come from one single cell
and then we become THIS:

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.800
then I don't- just- I don't
know how to impress you!

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.840
But riddle me this my friends:
If sexual reproduction begins

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.780
with sex cells,
the sperm and the egg

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.719
Where do the sperm
and egg come from?

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:42.910
Oh dude

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.739
So how do sex cells form so that
they each have only half

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.489
of the genetic information that
the resulting offspring

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:49.489
will end up with?

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.930
And for that matter, why aren't
all of our sex cells the same?

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.120
Like, why are my brother John
and I are different?

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.070
Sure we both wear glasses and
we both kind of look like

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.920
a tall Dr. Who, but, you know,
we have different color hair

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.760
and different noses and I'm way
better at Assassin's Creed

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.430
than he is.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.860
So why aren't we identical?
As far as we know, we both came

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.140
from the same two people with
the same two sets of DNA, right?

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.550
The answer to these questions,
and a lot of other of life's

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.580
mysteries, is meiosis.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.580
In the last episode we talked
about how most of your cells

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.140
your body, or somatic, cells

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.520
clone themselves through
the process of mitosis.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.770
Mitosis replicates a cell with a
complete set of 46 chromosomes

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.200
into two daughter cells that are
each identical to each other.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.780
But of course, even though the
vast majority of your cells can

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.800
clone themselves,
you cannot clone yourself,

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.550
and for good reason.
Actually, reasons.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.240
If mitosis were the only kind of
cell division we were capable of,

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.100
that would mean:

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.740
A) you would be a clone of one
of your parents, which would be,

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.160
awkward to say the least,
or possibly

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.230
B) half of your cells would be
clones from your mom, and half

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.520
would be clones from your dad.
And you would look REALLY weird.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.369
But that's not how we roll;
we do things a better way,

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.570
where all of your body cells
contain the same mix of DNA

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.200
46 chromosomes grouped into
23 pairs, one in each pair

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.350
from your mom,
and one from your dad.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.100
Those pairs of chromosomes
are pretty similar,

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.820
but they're not identical.
They contain versions of

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.970
the same genes, or alleles, in the
same spot for any given trait.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.980
Since they're so similar,
we call the pairs

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.150
homologous chromosome pairs.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.700
Homologous is a word that comes
up a lot in genetics.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.390
It just means that two things have
the same (homo) relation (logos)

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.230
even if they are
a little bit different.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.040
However there are some very
special cells that you have that

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.410
have only one half of that amount,
23 chromosomes. Those are sperm

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.370
and egg cells.
These are haploid cells

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.030
they have half of a full set of
chromosomes. And they need

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.140
each other to combine
to make the complete 46.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.930
Creating those kinds of cells
requires a process

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.860
that's very similar to
mitosis but with a

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.030
totally different outcome: meiosis.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.490
That's when a specialized diploid
cell splits in half twice,

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.490
producing four separate cells,
each of which is genetically

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:09.520
distinct from the others.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.710
Meiosis is a lot like mitosis,
except, twice.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.920
It goes through the
same stages as mitosis:

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.500
prophase, metaphase,
anaphase, and telophase.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.200
But then it goes through another
round of those stages again

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.210
and they have the same names,
conveniently, except with a 'II'

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.080
after them, they're like sequels.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.410
And just as with the
Final Destination movies,

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.110
the sequels have pretty much the
same plot, just some new actors.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.590
So the raw materials for this
process are in your ovaries or

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.920
your testes, depending on...
you know...

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.940
you know what it depends on.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.020
They're diploid cells called
either primary oocytes or primary

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.580
spermatocytes, depending on what
kind of gamete they make.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.920
Men produce sperm, you may
have heard, and they produce

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.000
it throughout their adult lives,
whereas women are born with a

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.030
certain amount of eggs
that they'll release over

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.510
many years after puberty.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.490
Here you might want to watch the
previous episode about mitosis

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.700
again because that's where we
go into detail about

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.770
each stage of the process.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.319
Once you're done with that,
we can start making

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.950
some baby-makers!

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.670
Now, just like with mitosis,
there's a spell between rounds

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.349
of cell division where the cell is
gearing up for the next big split.

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.520
This is called interphase,
when all the key players

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.380
are replicating themselves.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.530
The long strings of DNA in the
nucleus begin to duplicate,

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.870
leaving two copies of every strand.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.120
To jog your memory about how DNA
does this, we did a whole episode

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.760
on it you can watch it
and come on back.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.460
A similar process takes place
with the centrosomes, the set

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.270
of protein cylinders next to the
nucleus that will regulate how

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.960
all of the materials will be
moved around, along these ropey

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.810
proteins called microtubules.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.860
That brings us to the first
round of meiosis, prophase I.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.330
This is nearly the
same as in mitosis

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.590
as the centrosomes start heading
to their corners of the cell,

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.540
unspooling the microtubules,
and the DNA clumps up with

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.210
some proteins into chromosomes.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.850
Each single chromosome is linked
to its duplicate copy to make an

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.600
X-shaped double chromosome.
Now keep this in mind:

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.400
once attached, each single
chromosome is called a chromatid,

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.850
one on each side of the X.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.889
Each double chromosome
has 2 chromatids.

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.740
Here, meiosis prophase I
includes two additional

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.710
and VERY IMPORTANT steps:

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.050
crossover and
homologous recombination.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.290
Remember that the point here
is to end up with four sex cells

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.350
that each have just one single
chromosome from each

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.840
of the homologous pairs.
But unlike in mitosis,

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.020
where all the copies
end up the same,

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.430
here every copy is going to
be different from the rest.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.669
Each double chromosome lines up
next to its homolog, so there's

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:35.490
your mother's version lined up
right next to your father's

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.790
version of the same chromosome.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.090
Now If you look, you'll see that
these two double chromosomes,

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.760
each with two chromatids,
add up to 4 chromatids.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.930
Now watch: One chromatid from
each X gets tangled up

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.889
with the other X.
That's crossover.

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:52.199
And while they're tangled,
they trade sections of DNA.

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:53.510
That's the recombination.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.660
The sections that they're trading
are from the same location on each

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.070
chromosome, so one is giving up
its genetic code for, like,

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.889
hair color or body odor, and in
return it's getting the other

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:05.000
chromosome's genes for that trait.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.650
Now this is important.
What just happened here,

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.500
creating new gene combinations
on a single chromosome,

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.990
is the whole point of
reproducing this way.

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.610
Life might be a lot less stressful
if we could just clone ourselves,

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.919
but then we'd also clone all our
bad gene combinations,

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:22.729
and we wouldn't be able to change
and adapt to our environment.

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:25.669
Remember that one of the pillars
of natural selection is variation.

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:27.580
This is a major source
of that variation.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.600
What's more, since all of the
four chromatids have swapped

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.550
some DNA segments at random,
that means that all four chromatids

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.860
are now different.
Later on in the process,

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.300
each chromatid will end up
in a separate sex cell.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.150
This is why all eggs produced
by the same woman have a slightly

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.470
different genetic code;
same for sperm in men.

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.110
And that's why my brother
John and I look different,

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.930
even though we're both made
from the same two sets of DNA.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:51.880
Because of the luck
of the genetic draw

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.979
that happens in recombination,
I got this mane of luscious hair,

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:00.650
and John was stuck
with his trash, brown puff.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.669
And don't forget about my mad
Assassin's Creed skills.

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:05.699
But then of course,
there is that one pair

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:08.690
of chromosomes that doesn't
always go through the crossover

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:12.009
or recombination:
that's the 23rd pair.

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:15.509
And those are your sex chromosomes.
If you're female, you have two

00:07:15.509 --> 00:07:19.919
matched, beautiful, fully capable
chromosomes there, X chromosomes.

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:23.160
Since they're the same,
they do the whole crossover

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:27.180
and recombination thing.
But, if you, like me, are a male,

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.300
you get one of those X chromosomes
and another from your dad

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.009
that's kinda ugly and short
and runted and doesn't have

00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:35.949
a lot of genetic information on it.
During prophase, the X wants

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:39.860
nothing to do with the little Y,
because they're not homologous,

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.139
so they just don't match up.

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:43.669
And because the X-Y pairs on
these chromosomes will split

00:07:43.669 --> 00:07:47.639
later on into single chromatids,
half of the four resulting sperm

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:50.479
cells will be X
(leading to female offspring),

00:07:50.479 --> 00:07:53.419
and half will be Y
(leading to male offspring).

00:07:53.419 --> 00:07:56.270
Now what comes next is another
kind of amazing feat of alignment.

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.050
This is Metaphase I, and in
mitosis you might recall that

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:02.350
all of the chromosomes lined up
in a single row, powered by

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:06.270
motor proteins, and were then
pulled in half. But Not here.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:09.400
In meiosis, each chromosome lines
up next to its homologous

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.410
pair-partner that it's already
swapped a few genes with.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.729
Now the homologous pairs get
pulled apart and migrate to

00:08:15.729 --> 00:08:18.800
either end of the cell.
That's Anaphase I.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.380
The final phase of the first round,
Telophase I, rolls out in

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.360
pretty much the same
way as mitosis.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:28.570
The nuclear membrane re-forms,
and nucleoli form within them.

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:31.110
The chromosomes fray out
back into chromatin.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.519
Then a crease forms between
the two new cells,

00:08:32.519 --> 00:08:35.149
called cleavage,
and as the two new nuclei

00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:37.579
move apart from each other,
the cells separate

00:08:37.579 --> 00:08:41.429
in a process called cytokinesis
literally again "cell movement."

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:45.179
That's the end of round 1.
We now have two haploid cells,

00:08:45.179 --> 00:08:49.199
each with 23 double chromosomes
that are new, unique combinations

00:08:49.199 --> 00:08:51.819
of the original chromosome pairs.
In these new cells,

00:08:51.819 --> 00:08:54.170
the chromosomes are still
duplicated and connected

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.600
at the centromeres
they still look like X's.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.519
But remember the aim is
to end up with four cells,

00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:04.290
so it's time for those sequels.
Here the process is exactly

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:07.279
the same as mitosis,
except that the aim here isn't

00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:09.809
to duplicate the double
chromosomes, but instead to

00:09:09.809 --> 00:09:13.110
pull them apart into separate
single-strand chromosomes.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.910
Because of this, there's no
DNA replication involved in

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:18.339
Prophase II; instead the DNA
just clumps up again

00:09:18.339 --> 00:09:21.389
into chromosomes, and the
infrastructure for moving them,

00:09:21.389 --> 00:09:23.179
the microtubules, are
put back in place.

00:09:23.179 --> 00:09:26.569
In metaphase II, the chromosomes
are moved into alignment into the

00:09:26.569 --> 00:09:29.009
middle of the cell.
And in anaphase II,

00:09:29.009 --> 00:09:32.889
the chromatids are pulled apart
into separate, single chromosomes.

00:09:32.889 --> 00:09:36.649
The chromosomes uncoil into
chromatin, and the crease-forming

00:09:36.649 --> 00:09:39.629
cleavage and the final
separation of cytokinesis

00:09:39.629 --> 00:09:41.949
then mark the end of telophase II.

00:09:41.949 --> 00:09:44.740
From one original cell with
46 chromosomes, we now have

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.490
four new cells with 23
single chromosomes each.

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:51.050
If these are sperm,
all four resulting cells

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:52.740
are the same size,
but they each have

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.959
slightly different
genetic information.

00:09:54.959 --> 00:09:58.069
And half will be for making girls,
and half will be for making boys.

00:09:58.069 --> 00:09:59.579
But if this is the
egg-making process,

00:09:59.579 --> 00:10:01.819
then it goes a little bit
differently here and the result

00:10:01.819 --> 00:10:02.929
is only one egg.

00:10:02.929 --> 00:10:05.470
To rewind a little,
during telophase I,

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:08.579
more of the inner goodness
of a cell(the cytoplasm,

00:10:08.579 --> 00:10:13.649
the organelles, heads into one
of the cells that gets split

00:10:13.649 --> 00:10:15.110
off than to the other one.

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:17.889
In telophase II, when it's time
to split again the same thing

00:10:17.889 --> 00:10:21.189
happens, with more stuff going
into one of the cells

00:10:21.189 --> 00:10:25.519
than the other. This big old fat,
remaining cell becomes the egg,

00:10:25.519 --> 00:10:28.720
with more of the nutrients,
cytoplasm, and organelles

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.879
that it will take to
make a new embryo.

00:10:30.879 --> 00:10:33.339
The other 3 cells that were
produced, the little ones,

00:10:33.339 --> 00:10:36.689
are called polar bodies,
and they're totally useless

00:10:36.689 --> 00:10:39.209
in people, though they are
useful in plants.

00:10:39.209 --> 00:10:43.040
In plants, those polar bodies
actually also get fertilized too,

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.239
and they become the endosperm,
that's the starchy-proteiny stuff

00:10:46.239 --> 00:10:48.559
that we grind into wheat
or pop into popcorn.

00:10:48.559 --> 00:10:53.519
And it's basically the nutrients
that feed the plant embryo seed.

00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:55.170
And that's all there is to it.

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:57.179
I know, you probably were really
excited when I started talking

00:10:57.179 --> 00:11:00.009
about reproduction but then I
rambled on for a long time

00:11:00.009 --> 00:11:01.860
about haploid and diploid cells.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:06.290
But now you can say you know more
about the miracle of reproduction.

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:10.100
It's not actually a miracle.
It's science!

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:14.779
Thank you for joining us here
on Crash Course Biology/Meiosis.

00:11:14.779 --> 00:11:18.819
If you want to re-watch anything
you can do that now.

00:11:18.819 --> 00:11:23.429
Just click the annotations that
are on top of the words next to me.

00:11:23.429 --> 00:11:24.920
Just do it.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.259
Otherwise, congratulations on
learning stuff and being smarter.

00:11:28.259 --> 00:11:30.499
Thanks to everybody who
helped make this video.

00:11:30.499 --> 00:11:33.179
