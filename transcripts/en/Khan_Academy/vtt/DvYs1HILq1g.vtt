00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.565
Let's think a little bit about
the molecule sodium chloride.

00:00:06.565 --> 00:00:09.590
If we look at the periodic
table right over here,

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.930
we see that sodium
is a Group 1 element.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.340
It's an alkali metal.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.910
It has one valence electron.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.000
It's also not too
electronegative.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.764
It's sitting here on
the left-hand side

00:00:20.764 --> 00:00:21.680
of the periodic table.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.360
We know the general trend
for electronegativity

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.650
is that it increases as
we go to the top right.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.390
So these elements
over here generally

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.990
like to hog electrons.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.310
These elements
over here generally

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.250
like to give away electrons.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.130
These are electropositive,
these are electronegative.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.500
So sodium right over here,
with its one valence electron,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.600
it's a very good candidate
for giving away an electron.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.980
On the other side of
the periodic table,

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.750
we have chlorine
right over here.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.640
It's a Group 7 element.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.550
It's a halogen.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.690
It would love nothing more than
to gain an electron so that it

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.370
can get to the magic number
of eight valence electrons.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.210
It is very electronegative.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.350
So what you can
imagine would happen

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.400
is that if these two
things were to interact?

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.460
The chlorine would nab sodium's
extra electron over here,

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.090
and it would become
the chloride anion.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.860
And then sodium would
become the sodium cation.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.440
Cation just is a positive ion.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.890
Anion is just a negative ion.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.850
And so this one right
over here is now positive.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.560
Sodium is now positive.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.985
Chloride is a negative ion.

00:01:39.985 --> 00:01:42.110
And so they're going to be
attracted to each other,

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.990
and they're going to
form this ionic bond.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.520
So this right over
here is an ionic bond.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.800
Now let's think about
something that's not ionic,

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.240
where the electrons are
not being fully nabbed

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.490
from one atom to another,
but they're being shared.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.820
And one of the most famous
examples of that is water.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.150
So we know water is H2O.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.470
Each water molecule is one
oxygen bonded to two hydrogens.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.050
And these two bonds
are covalent bonds.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.780
In each of these
bonds, you have a pair

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.050
of electrons that
are being shared

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.549
by both the hydrogen
and the oxygen.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.860
But we also know that this
isn't a completely equal sharing

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.480
of the electrons.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.530
We look on the
periodic table here,

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.210
oxygen is far more
electronegative

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.230
than hydrogen is.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.220
And so because of that, the
electrons in these two bonds

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.250
are going to spend
more time around oxygen

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.610
than they are going to
spend around the hydrogens.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.790
And we've seen this before.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.510
This would give the oxygen
end of the water molecule

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.440
a partially negative charge.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.780
That's the lowercase
Greek letter delta.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.500
We use that for the notation
of partially negative.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.690
And on the hydrogen
ends of the molecule,

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.550
we're going to have a
partially positive charge.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.130
Now, this is the reality.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.030
But as we'll see later
on in future videos,

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.350
it's sometimes inconvenient to
have this partial messiness.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.150
And so what I'm
going to do right now

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.140
is introduce you to
what is fundamentally

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.990
just an intellectual tool.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.140
It's just a convention
that chemists

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.740
have invented that
allow us to get

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.490
our heads around
a lot of reactions

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.510
and allow us to think about how
is a reaction likely to occur.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.090
And that intellectual tool is
the idea of oxidation states.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.902
What the oxidation
state is, even if you're

00:03:43.902 --> 00:03:46.110
in a situation where you
have covalent bond, you say,

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.860
well, look, I understand.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.370
Those are partial charges.

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.560
These are covalent bonds.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.940
The electrons are being shared.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.300
But I don't like
this partial stuff.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.920
I want to just assume
hypothetically,

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.150
what if these were ionic bonds?

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.340
And you say, well, if these
had to be ionic bonds,

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.880
then the oxygen would nab the
electrons from these pairs.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:17.140
And so the oxygen would have
a fully negative charge,

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.839
a negative 2 charge.

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:27.200
And the hydrogens would have
a fully positive charge each.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.910
And so, if we were to
write down the oxidation

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.570
states for the atoms
in the water molecule--

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:42.340
let's write that
down, so H2O-- we

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.090
would say that oxygen has an
oxidation state of negative 2,

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:55.610
and each hydrogen atom has
an oxidation state of plus 1.

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.970
And notice, the whole
molecule is neutral,

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.200
and these things cancel
out with each other.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.880
Positive 1, positive 1,
that gets you to positive 2.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:04.970
Then you have negative 2.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.042
They cancel out.

00:05:06.042 --> 00:05:08.250
Now, the one thing, I keep
saying this is negative 2,

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.666
but I wrote the
negative after it.

00:05:09.666 --> 00:05:12.990
If I wanted to write positive
1 as an oxidation state,

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.907
I would actually write
it as 1 positive,

00:05:14.907 --> 00:05:16.740
although you can assume
that if someone just

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:17.770
writes the positive.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.970
And this is just the
convention, to write the sign

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.370
after the number when we are
writing actually ionic charges

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.470
or oxidation states, because
an oxidation state is nothing

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.810
but a hypothetical ionic charge.

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.340
If you really had to-- if
you were forced to assume

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.150
these aren't covalent bonds,
but these are ionic bonds.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.580
Once again, I want to stress.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.460
This is the reality.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:41.501
These are covalent bonds.

00:05:41.501 --> 00:05:43.960
These are partial charges,
the oxidation state,

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.560
intellectual tool,
that's forcing

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.920
us to pretend like
these are ionic bonds.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.380
And you might say well,
this kind of makes

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:56.640
sense right over here.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.580
This involved
oxygen in some way.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.450
That's why it's called
oxidation states.

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.200
And that's how I initially
conceptualized it

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.780
when I first learned about this.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.450
You say, well, look,
each of these hydrogens

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.010
lost an electron to oxygen.

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:18.420
So it makes sense that we
say that each hydrogen got

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:25.590
oxidized, so hydrogen
oxidized by oxygen.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:33.550
It makes sense that oxygen
would oxidize something else.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.750
This got done to it.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:41.670
The charge was taken away by
oxygen, so it got oxidized.

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:46.350
Now, the other term on the other
side of oxidized is reduced.

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:48.990
And the word "reduced"
really comes from the idea

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.790
that oxygen's charge
has been reduced.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.810
So we could say,
O, or we could say

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:59.080
oxygen has been reduced
by the hydrogens.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.500
And so there there's a
temptation here to say,

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.700
well, OK, this must always
involve oxygen in some kind,

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.040
because it seems to begin
with the same words.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.380
Well, that is not the case.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:23.600
Let's take, for example, if
this is an aqueous solution,

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.240
hydrofluoric acid
right over here.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:33.390
You have a hydrogen covalently
bonded to a fluorine.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.990
Now, just like we saw
in water, fluorine

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.900
is one of the most
electronegative elements.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.340
It's going to hog the electrons
in this covalent bond.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:45.670
So this is going to have a
partial negative charge here.

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.000
This is going to have a
partial negative charge here.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.120
And this is going to have a
partially positive charge.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.580
But if we were going to think
about it in terms of oxidation

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.340
states, we would say
when push comes to shove,

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:02.390
if this had to be at an ionic
bond and not a covalent bond,

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:06.470
what would be the charges
on each of these atoms?

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:08.810
We can say, well, in
that case, hydrogen

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:10.780
would lose an
electron, and it would

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.890
have a full positive charge.

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:17.110
And fluorine would
gain an electron

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:19.030
and have a full negative charge.

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:20.019
This is a hypothetical.

00:08:20.019 --> 00:08:21.810
Once again, the reality
is they're partial.

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:22.940
It's a covalent bond.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.647
But the hypothetical one is
a full positive charge here

00:08:25.647 --> 00:08:26.980
and a full negative charge here.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.320
And so we would say
that the oxidation

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.940
state in this molecule
for hydrogen is plus 1

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:36.940
and the oxidation state for
fluorine in this molecule

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.370
is negative 1.

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:43.629
And we would say that
hydrogen has been oxidized.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:50.452
And we could even say it's
been oxidized by the fluorine.

00:08:50.452 --> 00:08:51.910
And we would say
that the fluorine,

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:56.970
because its hypothetical
ionic charge has been reduced,

00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:01.160
we would say fluorine
might be reduced.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.410
And you would say, wait, wait.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:04.243
Look, oh wow, we're
using the word "oxidize"

00:09:04.243 --> 00:09:07.820
even though there is no
oxygen to be seen here.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.760
And one way to think
about it, if someone

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.600
had told that you had been
Bernie Madoffed, that doesn't

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.440
necessarily mean that you
interacted with Bernie Madoff.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.780
It means that someone
did to you what

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.900
Bernie Madoff would have done.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.310
Someone else-- someone
took your money,

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:24.920
told you they were
going to invest it,

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.790
and then put it
into a Ponzi scheme.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:28.520
Even if that person
is not Bernie Madoff,

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.890
you could say that you
have been Bernie Madoffed.

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:34.100
So here, fluorine
did to hydrogen

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:35.890
what oxygen tends to do.

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:37.800
It took an electron away.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.560
It oxidized the hydrogen.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.020
Now, that's how I
tend to remember it.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:49.200
If something has been oxidized,
it's losing an electron.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.950
And what I think about
it is, well, that's

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:52.840
what oxygen would
have done to you.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.520
Oxygen is very electronegative.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:58.366
It tends to take electrons
away from other atoms.

00:09:58.366 --> 00:09:59.990
Now, there are other
mnemonics that you

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:02.970
might see for remembering
what oxidation

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:05.687
and reduction
actually represent.

00:10:05.687 --> 00:10:07.770
And I'll introduce those
to you, just because they

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.730
might be helpful, and
they are introduced

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:12.980
in a bunch of chemistry classes.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:21.170
One of the mnemonics is
LEO the lion says GER.

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:26.435
I'll write says
in lowercase here,

00:10:26.435 --> 00:10:27.810
because it's really
not relevant.

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:33.150
But LEO the lion says GER.

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.970
And this is to remember that
losing an electron means

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:41.760
you are being oxidized, or
losing electrons is oxidation.

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.870
And gaining electrons
is reduction.

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:46.000
So that's just a mnemonic.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.160
Another one that's
often used is OIL RIG.

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:59.250
And this, essentially--
oxidation is losing electrons,

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:02.680
reduction is gaining electrons.
