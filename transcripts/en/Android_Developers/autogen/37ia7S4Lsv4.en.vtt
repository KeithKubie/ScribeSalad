we've learned a lot about what signals

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:39.820
we've learned a lot about what signals
 

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:41.700
we've learned a lot about what signals
are important for people and where

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:41.710
are important for people and where
 

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:44.010
are important for people and where
problems can arise and so Maurice is

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:44.020
problems can arise and so Maurice is
 

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.210
problems can arise and so Maurice is
going to talk a little bit about those

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:45.220
going to talk a little bit about those
 

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:47.340
going to talk a little bit about those
problems and some solutions we have for

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:47.350
problems and some solutions we have for
 

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:54.260
problems and some solutions we have for
you great thanks Bobby

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:54.270
 
 

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:57.120
 
all right so we have nine api's these

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:57.130
all right so we have nine api's these
 

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:58.890
all right so we have nine api's these
help you sense basically where the user

00:13:58.890 --> 00:13:58.900
help you sense basically where the user
 

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.840
help you sense basically where the user
is what they're doing and what's around

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:00.850
is what they're doing and what's around
 

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:03.780
is what they're doing and what's around
them and in my opinion kind of the real

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:03.790
them and in my opinion kind of the real
 

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:05.370
them and in my opinion kind of the real
power of these signals is not what you

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:05.380
power of these signals is not what you
 

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.050
power of these signals is not what you
can do with them individually but when

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:07.060
can do with them individually but when
 

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:08.760
can do with them individually but when
you combine them together and that we

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:08.770
you combine them together and that we
 

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:10.380
you combine them together and that we
can get kind of a holistic view about

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:10.390
can get kind of a holistic view about
 

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:13.290
can get kind of a holistic view about
what the users context really is now we

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:13.300
what the users context really is now we
 

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:14.820
what the users context really is now we
actually went back and tried to put

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:14.830
actually went back and tried to put
 

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:17.010
actually went back and tried to put
these together and we did run into some

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:17.020
these together and we did run into some
 

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:19.350
these together and we did run into some
issues and what we saw is that these a

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:19.360
issues and what we saw is that these a
 

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.519
issues and what we saw is that these a
guy is really looks something more like

00:14:20.519 --> 00:14:20.529
guy is really looks something more like
 

00:14:20.529 --> 00:14:22.560
guy is really looks something more like
this there are individual puzzle pieces

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:22.570
this there are individual puzzle pieces
 

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:24.090
this there are individual puzzle pieces
that don't quite fit together well

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:24.100
that don't quite fit together well
 

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.310
that don't quite fit together well
together so let me explain exactly what

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:26.320
together so let me explain exactly what
 

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.720
together so let me explain exactly what
I mean by how they're not quite fitting

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:27.730
I mean by how they're not quite fitting
 

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:30.960
I mean by how they're not quite fitting
together well all right so let's go back

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:30.970
together well all right so let's go back
 

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:32.520
together well all right so let's go back
to the example of getting a reminder

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:32.530
to the example of getting a reminder
 

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:34.740
to the example of getting a reminder
when you're driving near a store now

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:34.750
when you're driving near a store now
 

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:36.750
when you're driving near a store now
they implement this you know we have

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:36.760
they implement this you know we have
 

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.329
they implement this you know we have
basically a geofence API and that allows

00:14:39.329 --> 00:14:39.339
basically a geofence API and that allows
 

00:14:39.339 --> 00:14:40.770
basically a geofence API and that allows
you to set a region around the store

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:40.780
you to set a region around the store
 

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:42.630
you to set a region around the store
detect that the user is in there and

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:42.640
detect that the user is in there and
 

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.100
detect that the user is in there and
then we also have the activity

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:44.110
then we also have the activity
 

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:46.050
then we also have the activity
recognition API that can detect whether

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:46.060
recognition API that can detect whether
 

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.260
recognition API that can detect whether
the user is actually in a vehicle or not

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:48.270
the user is actually in a vehicle or not
 

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:50.579
the user is actually in a vehicle or not
now it's easy enough to just you know

00:14:50.579 --> 00:14:50.589
now it's easy enough to just you know
 

00:14:50.589 --> 00:14:52.710
now it's easy enough to just you know
invoke both of these API is call into it

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:52.720
invoke both of these API is call into it
 

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.390
invoke both of these API is call into it
get your callbacks and then try to

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:54.400
get your callbacks and then try to
 

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.570
get your callbacks and then try to
combine those signals together now at

00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:57.580
combine those signals together now at
 

00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:58.740
combine those signals together now at
this point we don't haven't given you

00:14:58.740 --> 00:14:58.750
this point we don't haven't given you
 

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:00.420
this point we don't haven't given you
any tools or utilities to actually put

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:00.430
any tools or utilities to actually put
 

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:02.040
any tools or utilities to actually put
these signals together so you're kind of

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:02.050
these signals together so you're kind of
 

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:04.140
these signals together so you're kind of
on your own now I say okay that's not

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:04.150
on your own now I say okay that's not
 

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:05.790
on your own now I say okay that's not
too big of a deal right just have a

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:05.800
too big of a deal right just have a
 

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.740
too big of a deal right just have a
couple of callbacks put them together no

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:07.750
couple of callbacks put them together no
 

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:09.720
couple of callbacks put them together no
big deal but the big issue here actually

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:09.730
big deal but the big issue here actually
 

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:12.180
big deal but the big issue here actually
is system health and what do I mean by

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:12.190
is system health and what do I mean by
 

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:14.280
is system health and what do I mean by
system health so system health is

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:14.290
system health so system health is
 

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:16.079
system health so system health is
everything about how well the phone is

00:15:16.079 --> 00:15:16.089
everything about how well the phone is
 

00:15:16.089 --> 00:15:18.030
everything about how well the phone is
functioning right and the two major

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:18.040
functioning right and the two major
 

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.130
functioning right and the two major
factors for mobile devices is the

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:20.140
factors for mobile devices is the
 

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.290
factors for mobile devices is the
battery in the RAM now battery is kind

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:22.300
battery in the RAM now battery is kind
 

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.720
battery in the RAM now battery is kind
of obvious right if you start using too

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:24.730
of obvious right if you start using too
 

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:26.130
of obvious right if you start using too
much of the battery then it will drain

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:26.140
much of the battery then it will drain
 

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:27.690
much of the battery then it will drain
and at that point you have a phone that

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:27.700
and at that point you have a phone that
 

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.220
and at that point you have a phone that
doesn't work which is not good for the

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:29.230
doesn't work which is not good for the
 

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:31.079
doesn't work which is not good for the
user and the second was a little bit

00:15:31.079 --> 00:15:31.089
user and the second was a little bit
 

00:15:31.089 --> 00:15:33.300
user and the second was a little bit
more subtle in terms of RAM usage if

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:33.310
more subtle in terms of RAM usage if
 

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:35.250
more subtle in terms of RAM usage if
there's too many things running on the

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:35.260
there's too many things running on the
 

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.170
there's too many things running on the
right this can cause some cpu thrashing

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:37.180
right this can cause some cpu thrashing
 

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:39.390
right this can cause some cpu thrashing
and the issue with that is that then the

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:39.400
and the issue with that is that then the
 

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.010
and the issue with that is that then the
phone starts to get sluggish and that

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:41.020
phone starts to get sluggish and that
 

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.390
phone starts to get sluggish and that
also leads to a pretty poor user

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:42.400
also leads to a pretty poor user
 

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.760
also leads to a pretty poor user
experience okay so why should you care

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:44.770
experience okay so why should you care
 

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:46.770
experience okay so why should you care
about this now the thing is if the user

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:46.780
about this now the thing is if the user
 

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.570
about this now the thing is if the user
suspects that is your app causing the

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:48.580
suspects that is your app causing the
 

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:50.550
suspects that is your app causing the
battery drain order app causing that

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.560
battery drain order app causing that
 

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.530
battery drain order app causing that
phone to become sluggish you know they

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:52.540
phone to become sluggish you know they
 

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:54.150
phone to become sluggish you know they
may actually in the worst case uninstall

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:54.160
may actually in the worst case uninstall
 

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.680
may actually in the worst case uninstall
your app and actually that that's

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:55.690
your app and actually that that's
 

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:57.030
your app and actually that that's
probably the worst case scenario here

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:57.040
probably the worst case scenario here
 

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.100
probably the worst case scenario here
and that kind of the irony of this

00:15:59.100 --> 00:15:59.110
and that kind of the irony of this
 

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:00.810
and that kind of the irony of this
situation is that you've been trying

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:00.820
situation is that you've been trying
 

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:03.030
situation is that you've been trying
your best to actually target those that

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:03.040
your best to actually target those that
 

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.070
your best to actually target those that
very specific situation when the user is

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:05.080
very specific situation when the user is
 

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.050
very specific situation when the user is
driving near the store and hence you

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:07.060
driving near the store and hence you
 

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:09.000
driving near the store and hence you
know make it very relevant to them but

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:09.010
know make it very relevant to them but
 

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:10.650
know make it very relevant to them but
if you don't do that right then you may

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:10.660
if you don't do that right then you may
 

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.150
if you don't do that right then you may
end up actually causing a worse user

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.160
end up actually causing a worse user
 

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.990
end up actually causing a worse user
experience alright so let me dig a

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000
experience alright so let me dig a
 

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.420
experience alright so let me dig a
little bit deeper about system health so

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:18.430
little bit deeper about system health so
 

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:20.460
little bit deeper about system health so
in this case like I said probably the

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:20.470
in this case like I said probably the
 

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:22.770
in this case like I said probably the
first way you could implement this is to

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:22.780
first way you could implement this is to
 

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.600
first way you could implement this is to
call into the geofence API and the

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:24.610
call into the geofence API and the
 

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:26.490
call into the geofence API and the
activity recognition API get the

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:26.500
activity recognition API get the
 

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:27.780
activity recognition API get the
callbacks and combine them together

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:27.790
callbacks and combine them together
 

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:30.390
callbacks and combine them together
sure no problem but now that you have

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:30.400
sure no problem but now that you have
 

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.800
sure no problem but now that you have
two signals you're hooking it to you

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:31.810
two signals you're hooking it to you
 

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:33.450
two signals you're hooking it to you
actually have some other options to do

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:33.460
actually have some other options to do
 

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.100
actually have some other options to do
things a little bit in a more optimized

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:35.110
things a little bit in a more optimized
 

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:38.010
things a little bit in a more optimized
way so another way to do it is instead

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:38.020
way so another way to do it is instead
 

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:40.830
way so another way to do it is instead
just turn on the geofence API first make

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:40.840
just turn on the geofence API first make
 

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.450
just turn on the geofence API first make
sure that the user has actually is near

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:42.460
sure that the user has actually is near
 

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.640
sure that the user has actually is near
the store and in that case and only in

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:44.650
the store and in that case and only in
 

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:46.050
the store and in that case and only in
that case do you turn on the activity

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:46.060
that case do you turn on the activity
 

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:47.760
that case do you turn on the activity
recognition to determine that the user

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:47.770
recognition to determine that the user
 

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:50.040
recognition to determine that the user
is in the vehicle and of course there's

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:50.050
is in the vehicle and of course there's
 

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:51.390
is in the vehicle and of course there's
an alternative you can do the opposite

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:51.400
an alternative you can do the opposite
 

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.700
an alternative you can do the opposite
direction instead caunty the activity

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:53.710
direction instead caunty the activity
 

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:55.980
direction instead caunty the activity
recognition API first and then when you

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:55.990
recognition API first and then when you
 

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:57.740
recognition API first and then when you
detect that the user is driving then

00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:57.750
detect that the user is driving then
 

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:01.290
detect that the user is driving then
come to the geofence API now the big

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:01.300
come to the geofence API now the big
 

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.810
come to the geofence API now the big
question is which is the best for system

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:03.820
question is which is the best for system
 

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.760
question is which is the best for system
health you know which is the ones going

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:05.770
health you know which is the ones going
 

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:07.530
health you know which is the ones going
to drain the battery the least which was

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:07.540
to drain the battery the least which was
 

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:09.270
to drain the battery the least which was
going to cause the least amount of CPU

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.280
going to cause the least amount of CPU
 

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.870
going to cause the least amount of CPU
thrashing all right so it's actually a

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880
thrashing all right so it's actually a
 

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.580
thrashing all right so it's actually a
trick question right there's actually

00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:14.590
trick question right there's actually
 

00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:16.440
trick question right there's actually
many many factors that really go into

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:16.450
many many factors that really go into
 

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:18.570
many many factors that really go into
determining which which is going to be

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:18.580
determining which which is going to be
 

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.280
determining which which is going to be
better than the other things like the

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:20.290
better than the other things like the
 

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:21.750
better than the other things like the
sampling rate that you choose for each

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:21.760
sampling rate that you choose for each
 

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.030
sampling rate that you choose for each
of these and then there's also lots of

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:24.040
of these and then there's also lots of
 

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.949
of these and then there's also lots of
implementation details that you may not

00:17:25.949 --> 00:17:25.959
implementation details that you may not
 

00:17:25.959 --> 00:17:27.690
implementation details that you may not
be aware of things like how many times

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:27.700
be aware of things like how many times
 

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:29.370
be aware of things like how many times
the radio wakes up and how much is times

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:29.380
the radio wakes up and how much is times
 

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.920
the radio wakes up and how much is times
the CPU is using and there's also all

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:31.930
the CPU is using and there's also all
 

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:33.270
the CPU is using and there's also all
they down to the hardware how much power

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:33.280
they down to the hardware how much power
 

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.300
they down to the hardware how much power
that the sensor is drawing alright so

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:36.310
that the sensor is drawing alright so
 

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:37.920
that the sensor is drawing alright so
anyways if you have to you might say

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:37.930
anyways if you have to you might say
 

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:39.690
anyways if you have to you might say
okay that's not too bad and you can do

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:39.700
okay that's not too bad and you can do
 

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:40.980
okay that's not too bad and you can do
some work to tune it and then make sure

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:40.990
some work to tune it and then make sure
 

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:43.380
some work to tune it and then make sure
that system health is good but really

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:43.390
that system health is good but really
 

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:45.810
that system health is good but really
the power is again combining all these

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:45.820
the power is again combining all these
 

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:47.820
the power is again combining all these
signals so imagine scaling up to all of

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:47.830
signals so imagine scaling up to all of
 

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:48.570
signals so imagine scaling up to all of
these

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:48.580
these
 

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:49.860
these
now at this point you're actually facing

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:49.870
now at this point you're actually facing
 

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:52.110
now at this point you're actually facing
a pretty tough problem it's a lot more

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:52.120
a pretty tough problem it's a lot more
 

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.700
a pretty tough problem it's a lot more
code to handle and if you're really

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:53.710
code to handle and if you're really
 

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:55.470
code to handle and if you're really
going to try to optimize system health I

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:55.480
going to try to optimize system health I
 

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.270
going to try to optimize system health I
mean I are talking exponentially more

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:57.280
mean I are talking exponentially more
 

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.410
mean I are talking exponentially more
different combinations you have to

00:17:58.410 --> 00:17:58.420
different combinations you have to
 

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:01.590
different combinations you have to
consider in order to do this well the

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600
consider in order to do this well the
 

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.540
consider in order to do this well the
other issue is that the more API is that

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:03.550
other issue is that the more API is that
 

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:05.820
other issue is that the more API is that
you hook into that means the more your

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:05.830
you hook into that means the more your
 

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:07.620
you hook into that means the more your
app will actually wake up and this

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:07.630
app will actually wake up and this
 

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:09.000
app will actually wake up and this
actually causes some pretty bad memory

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:09.010
actually causes some pretty bad memory
 

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:10.740
actually causes some pretty bad memory
pressure and in the end could actually

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:10.750
pressure and in the end could actually
 

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:12.420
pressure and in the end could actually
end up causing a sluggish phone and

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:12.430
end up causing a sluggish phone and
 

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:17.340
end up causing a sluggish phone and
again we don't really want that so the

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:17.350
again we don't really want that so the
 

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:19.890
again we don't really want that so the
issues today again are in order for you

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:19.900
issues today again are in order for you
 

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.390
issues today again are in order for you
to hook into these API is you do have to

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:21.400
to hook into these API is you do have to
 

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.250
to hook into these API is you do have to
learn multiple of them for each type of

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:23.260
learn multiple of them for each type of
 

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.500
learn multiple of them for each type of
context signal and the issue is that

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:25.510
context signal and the issue is that
 

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:26.850
context signal and the issue is that
there are subtleties you have to learn

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:26.860
there are subtleties you have to learn
 

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:28.440
there are subtleties you have to learn
about things like how do you choose the

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:28.450
about things like how do you choose the
 

00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:30.000
about things like how do you choose the
sampling rate and other things called

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:30.010
sampling rate and other things called
 

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:31.770
sampling rate and other things called
like priority level and these are pretty

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:31.780
like priority level and these are pretty
 

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:33.720
like priority level and these are pretty
subtle things to you to figure out how

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:33.730
subtle things to you to figure out how
 

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:36.150
subtle things to you to figure out how
to use properly the other thing is now

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:36.160
to use properly the other thing is now
 

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.800
to use properly the other thing is now
there's no support for combining these

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:37.810
there's no support for combining these
 

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:39.090
there's no support for combining these
signals together so you have to write

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:39.100
signals together so you have to write
 

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.190
signals together so you have to write
that code to do that and the furthermore

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.200
that code to do that and the furthermore
 

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.900
that code to do that and the furthermore
even after you've done all that you may

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:42.910
even after you've done all that you may
 

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:44.070
even after you've done all that you may
end up with battery drain and

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:44.080
end up with battery drain and
 

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.210
end up with battery drain and
sluggishness that can be pretty

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:45.220
sluggishness that can be pretty
 

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:48.990
sluggishness that can be pretty
difficult to solve so our challenge was

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:49.000
difficult to solve so our challenge was
 

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.250
difficult to solve so our challenge was
to figure out can we make these

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:50.260
to figure out can we make these
 

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:51.720
to figure out can we make these
individual puzzle pieces fit together

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:51.730
individual puzzle pieces fit together
 

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:55.140
individual puzzle pieces fit together
into a whole puzzle and our goals here

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:55.150
into a whole puzzle and our goals here
 

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:57.600
into a whole puzzle and our goals here
will say is it possible to arrange our

00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:57.610
will say is it possible to arrange our
 

00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:00.210
will say is it possible to arrange our
API so that we can make it very easy to

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:00.220
API so that we can make it very easy to
 

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:01.710
API so that we can make it very easy to
combine them together and so that you

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:01.720
combine them together and so that you
 

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:02.640
combine them together and so that you
can really target those specific

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:02.650
can really target those specific
 

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:05.370
can really target those specific
situations at the same time these issues

order just so you have an idea what's

00:20:07.569 --> 00:20:07.579
order just so you have an idea what's
 

00:20:07.579 --> 00:20:10.659
order just so you have an idea what's
there we also have some some code to

00:20:10.659 --> 00:20:10.669
there we also have some some code to
 

00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:12.999
there we also have some some code to
help you help basically combine time

00:20:12.999 --> 00:20:13.009
help you help basically combine time
 

00:20:13.009 --> 00:20:14.169
help you help basically combine time
with some of these other other

00:20:14.169 --> 00:20:14.179
with some of these other other
 

00:20:14.179 --> 00:20:16.479
with some of these other other
conditions as well and also the answered

00:20:16.479 --> 00:20:16.489
conditions as well and also the answered
 

00:20:16.489 --> 00:20:18.190
conditions as well and also the answered
questions like what are what is the user

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:18.200
questions like what are what is the user
 

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.409
questions like what are what is the user
doing via the activities and we also

00:20:20.409 --> 00:20:20.419
doing via the activities and we also
 

00:20:20.419 --> 00:20:21.310
doing via the activities and we also
found that there's some interesting

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:21.320
found that there's some interesting
 

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.229
found that there's some interesting
device States things like whether the

00:20:23.229 --> 00:20:23.239
device States things like whether the
 

00:20:23.239 --> 00:20:24.879
device States things like whether the
headphones are plugged in which have

00:20:24.879 --> 00:20:24.889
headphones are plugged in which have
 

00:20:24.889 --> 00:20:27.609
headphones are plugged in which have
some some notion about you know how the

00:20:27.609 --> 00:20:27.619
some some notion about you know how the
 

00:20:27.619 --> 00:20:30.159
some some notion about you know how the
user is using that device and finally

00:20:30.159 --> 00:20:30.169
user is using that device and finally
 

00:20:30.169 --> 00:20:31.810
user is using that device and finally
things like ambient conditions in the

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:31.820
things like ambient conditions in the
 

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:33.759
things like ambient conditions in the
environment things like weather which

00:20:33.759 --> 00:20:33.769
environment things like weather which
 

00:20:33.769 --> 00:20:35.469
environment things like weather which
actually do have a effect on users

00:20:35.469 --> 00:20:35.479
actually do have a effect on users
 

00:20:35.479 --> 00:20:37.659
actually do have a effect on users
behavior like today being extremely hot

00:20:37.659 --> 00:20:37.669
behavior like today being extremely hot
 

00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:41.319
behavior like today being extremely hot
and muggy outside all right so now the

00:20:41.319 --> 00:20:41.329
and muggy outside all right so now the
 

00:20:41.329 --> 00:20:42.639
and muggy outside all right so now the
biggest challenge that we have faced was

00:20:42.639 --> 00:20:42.649
biggest challenge that we have faced was
 

00:20:42.649 --> 00:20:45.190
biggest challenge that we have faced was
how do we simplify these 9 API into

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:45.200
how do we simplify these 9 API into
 

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.899
how do we simplify these 9 API into
something that's much easier to use and

00:20:46.899 --> 00:20:46.909
something that's much easier to use and
 

00:20:46.909 --> 00:20:48.699
something that's much easier to use and
also allows you to combine the signals

00:20:48.699 --> 00:20:48.709
also allows you to combine the signals
 

00:20:48.709 --> 00:20:50.889
also allows you to combine the signals
together and the way we approach this

00:20:50.889 --> 00:20:50.899
together and the way we approach this
 

00:20:50.899 --> 00:20:52.659
together and the way we approach this
problem was to consider well why don't

00:20:52.659 --> 00:20:52.669
problem was to consider well why don't
 

00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:54.639
problem was to consider well why don't
we think about the common usage patterns

00:20:54.639 --> 00:20:54.649
we think about the common usage patterns
 

00:20:54.649 --> 00:20:56.349
we think about the common usage patterns
of how app developers would want to use

00:20:56.349 --> 00:20:56.359
of how app developers would want to use
 

00:20:56.359 --> 00:20:58.119
of how app developers would want to use
these API s right what are the ways you

00:20:58.119 --> 00:20:58.129
these API s right what are the ways you
 

00:20:58.129 --> 00:20:59.829
these API s right what are the ways you
want to actually use and access these

00:20:59.829 --> 00:20:59.839
want to actually use and access these
 

00:20:59.839 --> 00:21:01.839
want to actually use and access these
context signals and we came out with two

00:21:01.839 --> 00:21:01.849
context signals and we came out with two
 

00:21:01.849 --> 00:21:03.879
context signals and we came out with two
of them that covers a good broad range

00:21:03.879 --> 00:21:03.889
of them that covers a good broad range
 

00:21:03.889 --> 00:21:06.519
of them that covers a good broad range
of these so the first one is called a

00:21:06.519 --> 00:21:06.529
of these so the first one is called a
 

00:21:06.529 --> 00:21:08.799
of these so the first one is called a
fence API and this is a callback style

00:21:08.799 --> 00:21:08.809
fence API and this is a callback style
 

00:21:08.809 --> 00:21:10.839
fence API and this is a callback style
API the idea is that you register

00:21:10.839 --> 00:21:10.849
API the idea is that you register
 

00:21:10.849 --> 00:21:12.969
API the idea is that you register
listener with the specific set of

00:21:12.969 --> 00:21:12.979
listener with the specific set of
 

00:21:12.979 --> 00:21:14.739
listener with the specific set of
conditions that you want and then that

00:21:14.739 --> 00:21:14.749
conditions that you want and then that
 

00:21:14.749 --> 00:21:16.119
conditions that you want and then that
gets called back and then you can react

00:21:16.119 --> 00:21:16.129
gets called back and then you can react
 

00:21:16.129 --> 00:21:16.749
gets called back and then you can react
accordingly

00:21:16.749 --> 00:21:16.759
accordingly
 

00:21:16.759 --> 00:21:18.699
accordingly
now the word fence may seem a little bit

00:21:18.699 --> 00:21:18.709
now the word fence may seem a little bit
 

00:21:18.709 --> 00:21:21.039
now the word fence may seem a little bit
mysterious but it comes from geo fencing

00:21:21.039 --> 00:21:21.049
mysterious but it comes from geo fencing
 

00:21:21.049 --> 00:21:23.079
mysterious but it comes from geo fencing
where the idea there was to set up a geo

00:21:23.079 --> 00:21:23.089
where the idea there was to set up a geo
 

00:21:23.089 --> 00:21:25.539
where the idea there was to set up a geo
fence and then the software will then

00:21:25.539 --> 00:21:25.549
fence and then the software will then
 

00:21:25.549 --> 00:21:27.639
fence and then the software will then
detect whether the user is in there now

00:21:27.639 --> 00:21:27.649
detect whether the user is in there now
 

00:21:27.649 --> 00:21:28.839
detect whether the user is in there now
we realize this is actually a

00:21:28.839 --> 00:21:28.849
we realize this is actually a
 

00:21:28.849 --> 00:21:30.879
we realize this is actually a
generalizable concept we don't have to

00:21:30.879 --> 00:21:30.889
generalizable concept we don't have to
 

00:21:30.889 --> 00:21:32.619
generalizable concept we don't have to
be doing just fences in location but

00:21:32.619 --> 00:21:32.629
be doing just fences in location but
 

00:21:32.629 --> 00:21:33.430
be doing just fences in location but
also

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:33.440
also
 

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.920
also
all types of users state things like is

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:35.930
all types of users state things like is
 

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:37.780
all types of users state things like is
the user walking or not are the

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:37.790
the user walking or not are the
 

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:39.820
the user walking or not are the
headphones plugged in is it hot and

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:39.830
headphones plugged in is it hot and
 

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:42.010
headphones plugged in is it hot and
sunny outside so all of these we can

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:42.020
sunny outside so all of these we can
 

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:43.330
sunny outside so all of these we can
consider a fence and that's what the

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:43.340
consider a fence and that's what the
 

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:45.730
consider a fence and that's what the
fence API gives you all right so let me

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:45.740
fence API gives you all right so let me
 

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:47.170
fence API gives you all right so let me
give you a concrete example of how we

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:47.180
give you a concrete example of how we
 

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.630
give you a concrete example of how we
can use this fence API to accomplish one

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:49.640
can use this fence API to accomplish one
 

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:50.800
can use this fence API to accomplish one
of the scenarios that we talked about

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:50.810
of the scenarios that we talked about
 

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:53.710
of the scenarios that we talked about
earlier now this one had two parts to it

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:53.720
earlier now this one had two parts to it
 

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.780
earlier now this one had two parts to it
the first was the user gets in the car

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:55.790
the first was the user gets in the car
 

00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:57.880
the first was the user gets in the car
and then now your device just goes into

00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:57.890
and then now your device just goes into
 

00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:00.160
and then now your device just goes into
amazingly into this in car mode and the

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:00.170
amazingly into this in car mode and the
 

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:01.420
amazingly into this in car mode and the
second half of it was that you're

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:01.430
second half of it was that you're
 

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:03.760
second half of it was that you're
driving nearby the pharmacy you actually

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:03.770
driving nearby the pharmacy you actually
 

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:05.650
driving nearby the pharmacy you actually
get a call back to go and remind get a

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:05.660
get a call back to go and remind get a
 

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:08.770
get a call back to go and remind get a
reminder to pick up medication alright

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:08.780
reminder to pick up medication alright
 

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:10.420
reminder to pick up medication alright
so with the final first fence API the

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:10.430
so with the final first fence API the
 

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:12.310
so with the final first fence API the
first thing to do is to determine the

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:12.320
first thing to do is to determine the
 

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.290
first thing to do is to determine the
condition that you want to detect so

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:14.300
condition that you want to detect so
 

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:15.820
condition that you want to detect so
that first one was to detect whether the

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:15.830
that first one was to detect whether the
 

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:17.830
that first one was to detect whether the
user has started driving now in this

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:17.840
user has started driving now in this
 

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.660
user has started driving now in this
case is very easy we have built in a

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:19.670
case is very easy we have built in a
 

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:22.270
case is very easy we have built in a
subset of primitive fences based on the

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:22.280
subset of primitive fences based on the
 

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:24.160
subset of primitive fences based on the
context types and we have the detected

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:24.170
context types and we have the detected
 

00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:26.350
context types and we have the detected
activity fence and just merely specify

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:26.360
activity fence and just merely specify
 

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.300
activity fence and just merely specify
ok I want to know when the user is

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:28.310
ok I want to know when the user is
 

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:30.430
ok I want to know when the user is
starting to be in a vehicle and this

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:30.440
starting to be in a vehicle and this
 

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.230
starting to be in a vehicle and this
condition is true when you first get

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240
condition is true when you first get
 

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:35.740
condition is true when you first get
into the vehicle simple ok now the other

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:35.750
into the vehicle simple ok now the other
 

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:37.360
into the vehicle simple ok now the other
condition is a little bit more involved

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:37.370
condition is a little bit more involved
 

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:38.800
condition is a little bit more involved
probably want to be driving near the

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:38.810
probably want to be driving near the
 

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:41.410
probably want to be driving near the
store while that's open so in this case

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:41.420
store while that's open so in this case
 

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:44.230
store while that's open so in this case
we'll start off at the bottom things you

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:44.240
we'll start off at the bottom things you
 

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.360
we'll start off at the bottom things you
need are first kind of a geofence or

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:46.370
need are first kind of a geofence or
 

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:48.520
need are first kind of a geofence or
location fence around the store that's

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:48.530
location fence around the store that's
 

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:50.590
location fence around the store that's
what that first line is the second line

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:50.600
what that first line is the second line
 

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.320
what that first line is the second line
shows a condition to basically detect

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:53.330
shows a condition to basically detect
 

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:54.910
shows a condition to basically detect
when the user is actually in the vehicle

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:54.920
when the user is actually in the vehicle
 

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.560
when the user is actually in the vehicle
itself and that's what that detected

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:56.570
itself and that's what that detected
 

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:58.780
itself and that's what that detected
activity fences and the last one is we

00:22:58.780 --> 00:22:58.790
activity fences and the last one is we
 

00:22:58.790 --> 00:22:59.470
activity fences and the last one is we
probably don't want to show

00:22:59.470 --> 00:22:59.480
probably don't want to show
 

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.480
probably don't want to show
notifications when the store is not open

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:01.490
notifications when the store is not open
 

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:03.760
notifications when the store is not open
so we can do instead is create a time

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:03.770
so we can do instead is create a time
 

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:05.320
so we can do instead is create a time
fence there is only true between those

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:05.330
fence there is only true between those
 

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:07.360
fence there is only true between those
open hours in this case we showed an

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:07.370
open hours in this case we showed an
 

00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:09.240
open hours in this case we showed an
example between 10:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m.

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:09.250
example between 10:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m.
 

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:12.640
example between 10:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m.
now one thing to to kind of think about

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:12.650
now one thing to to kind of think about
 

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:14.530
now one thing to to kind of think about
you know what is a fence here well it's

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:14.540
you know what is a fence here well it's
 

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.780
you know what is a fence here well it's
actually a boolean condition and you

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:16.790
actually a boolean condition and you
 

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:17.980
actually a boolean condition and you
know it takes a value of true or false

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:17.990
know it takes a value of true or false
 

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:20.020
know it takes a value of true or false
and actually that gives us our key to

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:20.030
and actually that gives us our key to
 

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:21.700
and actually that gives us our key to
how to combine these things once you

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:21.710
how to combine these things once you
 

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:23.440
how to combine these things once you
have boolean conditions you can combine

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:23.450
have boolean conditions you can combine
 

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:25.300
have boolean conditions you can combine
them with the boolean operators of an or

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:25.310
them with the boolean operators of an or
 

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:28.030
them with the boolean operators of an or
not so at this point for this specific

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:28.040
not so at this point for this specific
 

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.310
not so at this point for this specific
example let's actually do that so we

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:30.320
example let's actually do that so we
 

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.170
example let's actually do that so we
want to combine these and and the end

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:32.180
want to combine these and and the end
 

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:35.050
want to combine these and and the end
operators what's appropriate here so now

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:35.060
operators what's appropriate here so now
 

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:36.730
operators what's appropriate here so now
we have our full condition which is true

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:36.740
we have our full condition which is true
 

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:39.280
we have our full condition which is true
when the user is in the area around the

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:39.290
when the user is in the area around the
 

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:41.980
when the user is in the area around the
store the user is driving and it's open

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:41.990
store the user is driving and it's open
 

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:45.580
store the user is driving and it's open
hours ok so now you have your two fences

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:45.590
hours ok so now you have your two fences
 

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:46.180
hours ok so now you have your two fences
and

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:46.190
and
 

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:48.190
and
you need to basically register this with

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:48.200
you need to basically register this with
 

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.289
you need to basically register this with
the awareness API so you create your

00:23:50.289 --> 00:23:50.299
the awareness API so you create your
 

00:23:50.299 --> 00:23:52.629
the awareness API so you create your
offense update request add your fences

00:23:52.629 --> 00:23:52.639
offense update request add your fences
 

00:23:52.639 --> 00:23:54.490
offense update request add your fences
and then just call update fences and

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:54.500
and then just call update fences and
 

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:57.129
and then just call update fences and
while all your fences are registered a

00:23:57.129 --> 00:23:57.139
while all your fences are registered a
 

00:23:57.139 --> 00:23:59.980
while all your fences are registered a
couple things to note we do understand

00:23:59.980 --> 00:23:59.990
couple things to note we do understand
 

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:01.840
couple things to note we do understand
that probably you want to key off of

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:01.850
that probably you want to key off of
 

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:04.480
that probably you want to key off of
multiple conditions of the user so we

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:04.490
multiple conditions of the user so we
 

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:06.639
multiple conditions of the user so we
had that our API is situated so you can

00:24:06.639 --> 00:24:06.649
had that our API is situated so you can
 

00:24:06.649 --> 00:24:08.740
had that our API is situated so you can
actually add multiple fences and in

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:08.750
actually add multiple fences and in
 

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:10.269
actually add multiple fences and in
doing so you need to also give us a key

00:24:10.269 --> 00:24:10.279
doing so you need to also give us a key
 

00:24:10.279 --> 00:24:12.039
doing so you need to also give us a key
that's what that first string start

00:24:12.039 --> 00:24:12.049
that's what that first string start
 

00:24:12.049 --> 00:24:14.110
that's what that first string start
driving and driving your store so that

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:14.120
driving and driving your store so that
 

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.419
driving and driving your store so that
you can know which of the fences are

00:24:16.419 --> 00:24:16.429
you can know which of the fences are
 

00:24:16.429 --> 00:24:18.460
you can know which of the fences are
actually calling back to you the other

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:18.470
actually calling back to you the other
 

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:19.509
actually calling back to you the other
thing to note is that the pending

00:24:19.509 --> 00:24:19.519
thing to note is that the pending
 

00:24:19.519 --> 00:24:21.580
thing to note is that the pending
intents can all go to the same callback

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:21.590
intents can all go to the same callback
 

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:23.110
intents can all go to the same callback
mechanism that will help simplify your

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.120
mechanism that will help simplify your
 

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.419
mechanism that will help simplify your
code to handle all the callbacks and the

00:24:25.419 --> 00:24:25.429
code to handle all the callbacks and the
 

00:24:25.429 --> 00:24:28.659
code to handle all the callbacks and the
last point is that where you pass in a

00:24:28.659 --> 00:24:28.669
last point is that where you pass in a
 

00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:30.220
last point is that where you pass in a
pending intent and the nice thing there

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:30.230
pending intent and the nice thing there
 

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:31.509
pending intent and the nice thing there
is that your app doesn't even have to be

00:24:31.509 --> 00:24:31.519
is that your app doesn't even have to be
 

00:24:31.519 --> 00:24:33.039
is that your app doesn't even have to be
running will be competing these

00:24:33.039 --> 00:24:33.049
running will be competing these
 

00:24:33.049 --> 00:24:34.090
running will be competing these
conditions for you and give you the

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:34.100
conditions for you and give you the
 

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:36.100
conditions for you and give you the
callback at the right time and this is

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:36.110
callback at the right time and this is
 

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:37.330
callback at the right time and this is
how we're helping with system health

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:37.340
how we're helping with system health
 

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.310
how we're helping with system health
your app can stay completely out of the

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:39.320
your app can stay completely out of the
 

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.619
your app can stay completely out of the
way of the system and yet you can react

00:24:41.619 --> 00:24:41.629
way of the system and yet you can react
 

00:24:41.629 --> 00:24:49.640
way of the system and yet you can react
when these conditions happen thank you

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:49.650
 
 

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:52.110
 
okay so now let's finish this off let's

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:52.120
okay so now let's finish this off let's
 

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:54.450
okay so now let's finish this off let's
write the callback in this case we show

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:54.460
write the callback in this case we show
 

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:56.670
write the callback in this case we show
receiving the callbacks via broadcast

00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:56.680
receiving the callbacks via broadcast
 

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.740
receiving the callbacks via broadcast
receiver you get your data through the

00:24:58.740 --> 00:24:58.750
receiver you get your data through the
 

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:00.960
receiver you get your data through the
intent we have a utility function to

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:00.970
intent we have a utility function to
 

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:02.550
intent we have a utility function to
extract that state into what we call a

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:02.560
extract that state into what we call a
 

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.440
extract that state into what we call a
fence state and now for the first

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:04.450
fence state and now for the first
 

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:06.360
fence state and now for the first
condition if you know that the key that

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:06.370
condition if you know that the key that
 

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:07.830
condition if you know that the key that
you had pass in in this case start

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840
you had pass in in this case start
 

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.200
you had pass in in this case start
driving is true then based on the

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:10.210
driving is true then based on the
 

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:12.240
driving is true then based on the
condition of the state you can show the

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:12.250
condition of the state you can show the
 

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:14.790
condition of the state you can show the
Maps app in the in-car mode and for the

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:14.800
Maps app in the in-car mode and for the
 

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.220
Maps app in the in-car mode and for the
second one you can also key are for that

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:17.230
second one you can also key are for that
 

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:19.500
second one you can also key are for that
one which is driving your store check

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:19.510
one which is driving your store check
 

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:21.360
one which is driving your store check
the state of the fence and then show the

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:21.370
the state of the fence and then show the
 

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:24.270
the state of the fence and then show the
reminder so this is our fence API and it

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:24.280
reminder so this is our fence API and it
 

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.070
reminder so this is our fence API and it
allows you to react when the user is in

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.080
allows you to react when the user is in
 

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.900
allows you to react when the user is in
very specific contextual conditions that

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:27.910
very specific contextual conditions that
 

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:31.440
very specific contextual conditions that
you specify all right so let's talk

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:31.450
you specify all right so let's talk
 

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:33.840
you specify all right so let's talk
about the snapshot API now this is a

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:33.850
about the snapshot API now this is a
 

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:36.150
about the snapshot API now this is a
polling style API and the idea is that

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:36.160
polling style API and the idea is that
 

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.740
polling style API and the idea is that
your app while it's running can just ask

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:37.750
your app while it's running can just ask
 

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:39.780
your app while it's running can just ask
what the current values of these

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:39.790
what the current values of these
 

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:41.280
what the current values of these
different types of contexts are things

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:41.290
different types of contexts are things
 

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:43.560
different types of contexts are things
like the location the activity the

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:43.570
like the location the activity the
 

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:47.160
like the location the activity the
weather etc so let's go back to the

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:47.170
weather etc so let's go back to the
 

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:49.380
weather etc so let's go back to the
scenario so at this point Bhavik saw

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:49.390
scenario so at this point Bhavik saw
 

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:51.870
scenario so at this point Bhavik saw
this cute little dog so he wants to snap

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:51.880
this cute little dog so he wants to snap
 

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.270
this cute little dog so he wants to snap
a picture of that and on top of that

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:54.280
a picture of that and on top of that
 

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:55.770
a picture of that and on top of that
what do you want to do is tag it with

00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:55.780
what do you want to do is tag it with
 

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:58.170
what do you want to do is tag it with
the current semantic location and the

00:25:58.170 --> 00:25:58.180
the current semantic location and the
 

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:01.980
the current semantic location and the
weather okay and this is really easy

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:01.990
weather okay and this is really easy
 

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:04.260
weather okay and this is really easy
really we have a API called the snapshot

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:04.270
really we have a API called the snapshot
 

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:06.630
really we have a API called the snapshot
API you just call two methods one to get

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:06.640
API you just call two methods one to get
 

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.370
API you just call two methods one to get
the places others to get the weather

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:08.380
the places others to get the weather
 

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:11.040
the places others to get the weather
pull out the data they can tag it to

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:11.050
pull out the data they can tag it to
 

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:13.400
pull out the data they can tag it to
your photo and share it with the world

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:13.410
your photo and share it with the world
 

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:15.570
your photo and share it with the world
one thing we did do is that we added

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:15.580
one thing we did do is that we added
 

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:17.880
one thing we did do is that we added
caching underneath so that to kind of

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:17.890
caching underneath so that to kind of
 

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:19.890
caching underneath so that to kind of
basically not allow you to have to think

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:19.900
basically not allow you to have to think
 

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.810
basically not allow you to have to think
too much about what kind of cost there

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:21.820
too much about what kind of cost there
 

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:26.370
too much about what kind of cost there
is to to call into these api's okay so

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:26.380
is to to call into these api's okay so
 

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:28.830
is to to call into these api's okay so
the summarize the awareness API will be

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:28.840
the summarize the awareness API will be
 

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.360
the summarize the awareness API will be
releasing with seven different context

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:30.370
releasing with seven different context
 

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:33.240
releasing with seven different context
types and two simple API s we've

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:33.250
types and two simple API s we've
 

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:35.010
types and two simple API s we've
designed this so that in the future we

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:35.020
designed this so that in the future we
 

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:37.200
designed this so that in the future we
can add more context types and yet not

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:37.210
can add more context types and yet not
 

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:39.000
can add more context types and yet not
increase the complexity it takes for you

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:39.010
increase the complexity it takes for you
 

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:41.520
increase the complexity it takes for you
to incorporate the new signals as we go

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:41.530
to incorporate the new signals as we go
 

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:43.620
to incorporate the new signals as we go
forward and of course the other part of

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:43.630
forward and of course the other part of
 

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:44.670
forward and of course the other part of
it is that we try to handle system

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:44.680
it is that we try to handle system
 

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:46.410
it is that we try to handle system
health for you so that you don't have to

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:46.420
health for you so that you don't have to
 

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:48.360
health for you so that you don't have to
worry about it and by simplifying this

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:48.370
worry about it and by simplifying this
 

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:50.520
worry about it and by simplifying this
for you you can focus your efforts on

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:50.530
for you you can focus your efforts on
 

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:52.020
for you you can focus your efforts on
building that great experience for your

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:52.030
building that great experience for your
 

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:55.770
building that great experience for your
users all right so let me take a step

00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:55.780
users all right so let me take a step
 

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:57.720
users all right so let me take a step
back and talk a little bit about where I

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:57.730
back and talk a little bit about where I
 

00:26:57.730 --> 00:26:59.850
back and talk a little bit about where I
feel the awareness API kind of fits in

00:26:59.850 --> 00:26:59.860
feel the awareness API kind of fits in
 

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:01.219
feel the awareness API kind of fits in
the grander scheme of things

00:27:01.219 --> 00:27:01.229
the grander scheme of things
 

00:27:01.229 --> 00:27:04.109
the grander scheme of things
personally when I first got ahold of a

00:27:04.109 --> 00:27:04.119
personally when I first got ahold of a
 

00:27:04.119 --> 00:27:05.999
personally when I first got ahold of a
smartphone the thing that really amazed

00:27:05.999 --> 00:27:06.009
smartphone the thing that really amazed
 

00:27:06.009 --> 00:27:07.829
smartphone the thing that really amazed
me and the relief kind of like excited

00:27:07.829 --> 00:27:07.839
me and the relief kind of like excited
 

00:27:07.839 --> 00:27:09.359
me and the relief kind of like excited
me was the fact that I had a bunch of

00:27:09.359 --> 00:27:09.369
me was the fact that I had a bunch of
 

00:27:09.369 --> 00:27:11.759
me was the fact that I had a bunch of
sensors and just having sensors it's not

00:27:11.759 --> 00:27:11.769
sensors and just having sensors it's not
 

00:27:11.769 --> 00:27:12.959
sensors and just having sensors it's not
enough the fact that people actually

00:27:12.959 --> 00:27:12.969
enough the fact that people actually
 

00:27:12.969 --> 00:27:14.489
enough the fact that people actually
carry these phones with them everywhere

00:27:14.489 --> 00:27:14.499
carry these phones with them everywhere
 

00:27:14.499 --> 00:27:16.889
carry these phones with them everywhere
they want and once you do that there's

00:27:16.889 --> 00:27:16.899
they want and once you do that there's
 

00:27:16.899 --> 00:27:19.139
they want and once you do that there's
like a real opportunity for the phone to

00:27:19.139 --> 00:27:19.149
like a real opportunity for the phone to
 

00:27:19.149 --> 00:27:21.239
like a real opportunity for the phone to
really know you know who you are

00:27:21.239 --> 00:27:21.249
really know you know who you are
 

00:27:21.249 --> 00:27:22.799
really know you know who you are
what you care about what your intentions

00:27:22.799 --> 00:27:22.809
what you care about what your intentions
 

00:27:22.809 --> 00:27:26.190
what you care about what your intentions
are etc and if the phone can know that

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:26.200
are etc and if the phone can know that
 

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.259
are etc and if the phone can know that
and your apps can know that then I think

00:27:28.259 --> 00:27:28.269
and your apps can know that then I think
 

00:27:28.269 --> 00:27:30.149
and your apps can know that then I think
we could build these kinds of magical

00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:30.159
we could build these kinds of magical
 

00:27:30.159 --> 00:27:32.129
we could build these kinds of magical
experiences that have basically never

00:27:32.129 --> 00:27:32.139
experiences that have basically never
 

00:27:32.139 --> 00:27:33.659
experiences that have basically never
existed before and we have a kind of a

00:27:33.659 --> 00:27:33.669
existed before and we have a kind of a
 

00:27:33.669 --> 00:27:36.299
existed before and we have a kind of a
new relationship with computing so that

00:27:36.299 --> 00:27:36.309
new relationship with computing so that
 

00:27:36.309 --> 00:27:37.499
new relationship with computing so that
was kind of the moonshot and that's what

00:27:37.499 --> 00:27:37.509
was kind of the moonshot and that's what
 

00:27:37.509 --> 00:27:39.269
was kind of the moonshot and that's what
we've been working towards trying to get

00:27:39.269 --> 00:27:39.279
we've been working towards trying to get
 

00:27:39.279 --> 00:27:42.479
we've been working towards trying to get
to now the awareness API is kind of a

00:27:42.479 --> 00:27:42.489
to now the awareness API is kind of a
 

00:27:42.489 --> 00:27:44.279
to now the awareness API is kind of a
step in that direction and what we've

00:27:44.279 --> 00:27:44.289
step in that direction and what we've
 

00:27:44.289 --> 00:27:46.320
step in that direction and what we've
done with that is to basically take kind

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:46.330
done with that is to basically take kind
 

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:48.509
done with that is to basically take kind
of these separate individual sensing

00:27:48.509 --> 00:27:48.519
of these separate individual sensing
 

00:27:48.519 --> 00:27:50.489
of these separate individual sensing
capabilities put them all together into

00:27:50.489 --> 00:27:50.499
capabilities put them all together into
 

00:27:50.499 --> 00:27:53.729
capabilities put them all together into
a unified platform and you know whether

00:27:53.729 --> 00:27:53.739
a unified platform and you know whether
 

00:27:53.739 --> 00:27:55.139
a unified platform and you know whether
that's a big step or small step time

00:27:55.139 --> 00:27:55.149
that's a big step or small step time
 

00:27:55.149 --> 00:27:57.389
that's a big step or small step time
will tell but it is a step to simplify

00:27:57.389 --> 00:27:57.399
will tell but it is a step to simplify
 

00:27:57.399 --> 00:27:58.979
will tell but it is a step to simplify
things so that now you can build better

00:27:58.979 --> 00:27:58.989
things so that now you can build better
 

00:27:58.989 --> 00:28:01.129
things so that now you can build better
experiences now this is incredibly

00:28:01.129 --> 00:28:01.139
experiences now this is incredibly
 

00:28:01.139 --> 00:28:03.269
experiences now this is incredibly
powerful and we'll be putting it soon

00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279
powerful and we'll be putting it soon
 

00:28:03.279 --> 00:28:05.579
powerful and we'll be putting it soon
into your hands but really to reach this

00:28:05.579 --> 00:28:05.589
into your hands but really to reach this
 

00:28:05.589 --> 00:28:07.019
into your hands but really to reach this
moonshot it's not about the technical

00:28:07.019 --> 00:28:07.029
moonshot it's not about the technical
 

00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:08.789
moonshot it's not about the technical
capabilities as well right there's other

00:28:08.789 --> 00:28:08.799
capabilities as well right there's other
 

00:28:08.799 --> 00:28:11.430
capabilities as well right there's other
things that are of concern and one of

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:11.440
things that are of concern and one of
 

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.979
things that are of concern and one of
those things is privacy of course right

00:28:13.979 --> 00:28:13.989
those things is privacy of course right
 

00:28:13.989 --> 00:28:15.570
those things is privacy of course right
so we must be respectful of the user's

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:15.580
so we must be respectful of the user's
 

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:17.969
so we must be respectful of the user's
privacy and the real challenge here is

00:28:17.969 --> 00:28:17.979
privacy and the real challenge here is
 

00:28:17.979 --> 00:28:20.399
privacy and the real challenge here is
to build those experiences that really

00:28:20.399 --> 00:28:20.409
to build those experiences that really
 

00:28:20.409 --> 00:28:22.529
to build those experiences that really
simplify and delight the users in ways

00:28:22.529 --> 00:28:22.539
simplify and delight the users in ways
 

00:28:22.539 --> 00:28:23.940
simplify and delight the users in ways
that they have never felt before

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:23.950
that they have never felt before
 

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:27.180
that they have never felt before
and as far as I can tell in order to get

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:27.190
and as far as I can tell in order to get
 

00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:29.339
and as far as I can tell in order to get
to that moonshot right I don't see any

00:28:29.339 --> 00:28:29.349
to that moonshot right I don't see any
 

00:28:29.349 --> 00:28:30.329
to that moonshot right I don't see any
path to success

00:28:30.329 --> 00:28:30.339
path to success
 

00:28:30.339 --> 00:28:31.950
path to success
that doesn't include respecting the

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:31.960
that doesn't include respecting the
 

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.779
that doesn't include respecting the
user's privacy and I'm sure you'll agree

00:28:33.779 --> 00:28:33.789
user's privacy and I'm sure you'll agree
 

00:28:33.789 --> 00:28:34.639
user's privacy and I'm sure you'll agree
as well

00:28:34.639 --> 00:28:34.649
as well
 

00:28:34.649 --> 00:28:40.229
as well
thank you all right so there is one

00:28:40.229 --> 00:28:40.239
thank you all right so there is one
 

00:28:40.239 --> 00:28:41.879
thank you all right so there is one
thing so part of the addressing privacy

00:28:41.879 --> 00:28:41.889
thing so part of the addressing privacy
 

00:28:41.889 --> 00:28:44.039
thing so part of the addressing privacy
is what we can do and the awareness API

00:28:44.039 --> 00:28:44.049
is what we can do and the awareness API
 

00:28:44.049 --> 00:28:45.570
is what we can do and the awareness API
is built in with a permission model

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:45.580
is built in with a permission model
 

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:48.239
is built in with a permission model
using androids permission model so for

00:28:48.239 --> 00:28:48.249
using androids permission model so for
 

00:28:48.249 --> 00:28:50.430
using androids permission model so for
each type of context we do protect it

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:50.440
each type of context we do protect it
 

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.049
each type of context we do protect it
against one of these Android permissions

00:28:52.049 --> 00:28:52.059
against one of these Android permissions
 

00:28:52.059 --> 00:28:54.269
against one of these Android permissions
so that we can ensure that the user has

00:28:54.269 --> 00:28:54.279
so that we can ensure that the user has
 

00:28:54.279 --> 00:28:55.859
so that we can ensure that the user has
given consent to your app to actually

00:28:55.859 --> 00:28:55.869
given consent to your app to actually
 

00:28:55.869 --> 00:28:58.409
given consent to your app to actually
access that signal now most of these are

00:28:58.409 --> 00:28:58.419
access that signal now most of these are
 

00:28:58.419 --> 00:29:00.450
access that signal now most of these are
pretty intuitive but things like whether

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:00.460
pretty intuitive but things like whether
 

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:02.820
pretty intuitive but things like whether
for example does require access find

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:02.830
for example does require access find
 

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:04.649
for example does require access find
location permissions and the reason is

00:29:04.649 --> 00:29:04.659
location permissions and the reason is
 

00:29:04.659 --> 00:29:07.049
location permissions and the reason is
because we're giving you the weather at

00:29:07.049 --> 00:29:07.059
because we're giving you the weather at
 

00:29:07.059 --> 00:29:11.310
because we're giving you the weather at
the users current location okay so

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:11.320
the users current location okay so
 

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.209
the users current location okay so
that's what we've done

00:29:12.209 --> 00:29:12.219
that's what we've done
 

00:29:12.219 --> 00:29:13.979
that's what we've done
but of course addressing privacy doesn't

00:29:13.979 --> 00:29:13.989
but of course addressing privacy doesn't
 

00:29:13.989 --> 00:29:14.680
but of course addressing privacy doesn't
end there

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:14.690
end there
 

00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:16.660
end there
really has to be end-to-end and that

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:16.670
really has to be end-to-end and that
 

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:18.760
really has to be end-to-end and that
includes in your app and what kind of

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:18.770
includes in your app and what kind of
 

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:20.560
includes in your app and what kind of
experience that you're building now the

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:20.570
experience that you're building now the
 

00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:22.060
experience that you're building now the
two basic principles we follow for

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:22.070
two basic principles we follow for
 

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:24.250
two basic principles we follow for
addressing privacy or transparency and

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:24.260
addressing privacy or transparency and
 

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:26.500
addressing privacy or transparency and
control and transparency is about

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:26.510
control and transparency is about
 

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:29.230
control and transparency is about
basically letting the user know what it

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:29.240
basically letting the user know what it
 

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:30.490
basically letting the user know what it
is that we're using what personal

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:30.500
is that we're using what personal
 

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:31.870
is that we're using what personal
information we're using about them as

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:31.880
information we're using about them as
 

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:34.540
information we're using about them as
well as what we're using it for and the

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:34.550
well as what we're using it for and the
 

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:36.310
well as what we're using it for and the
second half it is of course control you

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:36.320
second half it is of course control you
 

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.590
second half it is of course control you
know we have to let the users give them

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:38.600
know we have to let the users give them
 

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.090
know we have to let the users give them
the ability to actually activate or

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:40.100
the ability to actually activate or
 

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:42.430
the ability to actually activate or
deactivate these features so just to

00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:42.440
deactivate these features so just to
 

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:44.350
deactivate these features so just to
give you a quick example I mean if if I

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:44.360
give you a quick example I mean if if I
 

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:46.210
give you a quick example I mean if if I
plug in my headphone and my favorite

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:46.220
plug in my headphone and my favorite
 

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:47.620
plug in my headphone and my favorite
music app starts playing automatically

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:47.630
music app starts playing automatically
 

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:48.820
music app starts playing automatically
starts playing music I mean that's

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:48.830
starts playing music I mean that's
 

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:51.610
starts playing music I mean that's
fantastic but only if it was transparent

00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:51.620
fantastic but only if it was transparent
 

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:52.750
fantastic but only if it was transparent
to me that that was going to happen and

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:52.760
to me that that was going to happen and
 

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:54.340
to me that that was going to happen and
I have the option to actually turn it

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:54.350
I have the option to actually turn it
 

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:58.600
I have the option to actually turn it
off if I don't want it okay

00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:58.610
off if I don't want it okay
 

00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:00.220
off if I don't want it okay
I think one of the immediate uses of

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:00.230
I think one of the immediate uses of
 

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:01.510
I think one of the immediate uses of
awareness will be the post notifications

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:01.520
awareness will be the post notifications
 

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:04.450
awareness will be the post notifications
to the user and we do ask that you try

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:04.460
to the user and we do ask that you try
 

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:06.460
to the user and we do ask that you try
to be as specific and as targeted as

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:06.470
to be as specific and as targeted as
 

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:08.620
to be as specific and as targeted as
possible that way you'll basically hit

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:08.630
possible that way you'll basically hit
 

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:10.450
possible that way you'll basically hit
the user at the most relevant moments

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:10.460
the user at the most relevant moments
 

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:12.070
the user at the most relevant moments
when they actually want to actually take

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:12.080
when they actually want to actually take
 

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.540
when they actually want to actually take
action on that notification you send

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:13.550
action on that notification you send
 

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:15.760
action on that notification you send
them one thing to note though as an

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:15.770
them one thing to note though as an
 

00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:17.890

Android end users can disable

00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:17.900
Android end users can disable
 

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:20.050
Android end users can disable
notifications for your app and also the

00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:20.060
notifications for your app and also the
 

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:21.610
notifications for your app and also the
notification shade is a shared resource

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:21.620
notification shade is a shared resource
 

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:24.070
notification shade is a shared resource
across all apps so of course you need to

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:24.080
across all apps so of course you need to
 

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:25.120
across all apps so of course you need to
give them a reason to turn your

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:25.130
give them a reason to turn your
 

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:29.380
give them a reason to turn your
notifications on okay and finally we've

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:29.390
notifications on okay and finally we've
 

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:30.940
notifications on okay and finally we've
done our best to be as efficient as

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:30.950
done our best to be as efficient as
 

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:33.280
done our best to be as efficient as
possible to address system health but

what fences you happen to register you
 

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:39.250
what fences you happen to register you
know make sure that you wait against

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:39.260
know make sure that you wait against
 

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:40.900
know make sure that you wait against
kind of the user experience enhancement

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:40.910
kind of the user experience enhancement
 

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:43.150
kind of the user experience enhancement
that you're providing now again to

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:43.160
that you're providing now again to
 

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:45.130
that you're providing now again to
conclude the awareness API is coming

00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:45.140
conclude the awareness API is coming
 

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:46.990
conclude the awareness API is coming
soon and I very much look forward to

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:47.000
soon and I very much look forward to
 

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.160
soon and I very much look forward to
seeing what you guys end up building

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:48.170
seeing what you guys end up building
 

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:48.610
seeing what you guys end up building
with it

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:48.620
with it
 

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:50.680
with it
now at this point let me turn this over
