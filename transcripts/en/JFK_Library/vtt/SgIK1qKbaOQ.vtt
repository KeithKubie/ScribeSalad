00:00:00.404 --> 00:00:03.291
- If your job is reach
out to and engage people

00:00:03.291 --> 00:00:05.237
who are in trouble, that's your job,

00:00:05.237 --> 00:00:09.404
that part of our community
does not trust the police.

00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:14.197
I'm a street worker, I'm engaging
people who are in trouble.

00:00:14.197 --> 00:00:16.902
I can say, "You know,
the police have a program

00:00:16.902 --> 00:00:21.227
"that they have that
can get you in the union

00:00:21.227 --> 00:00:25.574
"and get you a job, so
if you want to give up

00:00:25.574 --> 00:00:29.402
"this lifestyle, and get some training,

00:00:29.402 --> 00:00:30.993
"so that you could have some skills,

00:00:30.993 --> 00:00:33.640
"to be able to get a job,
and get placed in a job,

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.201
"I can help you do that.

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:37.843
"It's a program that comes
out of the police department."

00:00:37.843 --> 00:00:40.833
That's how you begin to
break down those barriers.

00:00:40.833 --> 00:00:44.676
And now that young person
goes from being unemployed,

00:00:44.676 --> 00:00:46.995
and involved in negative
activity in the community,

00:00:46.995 --> 00:00:48.156
to working.

00:00:48.156 --> 00:00:50.903
And the street worker, the
community, and the police,

00:00:50.903 --> 00:00:52.612
were all a part of making that happen.
