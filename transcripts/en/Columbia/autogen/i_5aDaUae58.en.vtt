they had no particular reason for
 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.359
they had no particular reason for
covering these topics I wonder what was

it is that we have some sort of concept
 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.039
it is that we have some sort of concept

in the later part of the 19th century

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400
and that we should give a nod to land

we do that simply to cover territory

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950
we do that simply to cover territory
 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.960
we do that simply to cover territory

as a point of terminus enabled us to

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890
as a point of terminus enabled us to
 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.440
as a point of terminus enabled us to
avoid issues related to late imperialism

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450
avoid issues related to late imperialism
 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.590
avoid issues related to late imperialism
in the late 19th century but it has no

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600
in the late 19th century but it has no
 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:16.370
in the late 19th century but it has no
particular value and yet the stories

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380
particular value and yet the stories
 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.580
particular value and yet the stories
that are told in the chapter make a

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590
that are told in the chapter make a
 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.670
that are told in the chapter make a
certain kind of sense the when you look

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680
certain kind of sense the when you look
 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.819
certain kind of sense the when you look
at the non-european independent states

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829
at the non-european independent states
 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.990
at the non-european independent states
the ones that do not become completely

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000
the ones that do not become completely

the ones that do not become completely
dominated by imperialism in the course

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639
dominated by imperialism in the course
 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:42.910
dominated by imperialism in the course
of 19th century you find that there is a

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920
of 19th century you find that there is a
 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.270
of 19th century you find that there is a
revolution in Turkey in 1908 there's a

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280
revolution in Turkey in 1908 there's a
 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.089
revolution in Turkey in 1908 there's a
revolution in China in 1911 is a

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099
revolution in China in 1911 is a
 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.990
revolution in China in 1911 is a
revolution in Iran in 1906 there's a

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000
revolution in Iran in 1906 there's a
 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.699
revolution in Iran in 1906 there's a
revolution in Russia in 1905 I'm

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709
revolution in Russia in 1905 I'm
 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.400
revolution in Russia in 1905 I'm
counting here Russia as a land Empire in

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410
counting here Russia as a land Empire in
 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.839
counting here Russia as a land Empire in
this sense because that's how it's

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849
this sense because that's how it's
 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:07.660
this sense because that's how it's
covered in the chapter

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670
 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.110
and so it might have made sense to go up

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120
and so it might have made sense to go up
 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.090
and so it might have made sense to go up
to the first first decade of the 20th

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100
to the first first decade of the 20th
 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.050
to the first first decade of the 20th
century and say isn't the long-term

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060
century and say isn't the long-term
 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:27.360
century and say isn't the long-term
takeaway of this of this 19th century

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370
takeaway of this of this 19th century
 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.820
takeaway of this of this 19th century
discussion of these empires isn't it the

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830
discussion of these empires isn't it the
 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.420
discussion of these empires isn't it the
fact that they all run into revolutions

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430
fact that they all run into revolutions
 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.620
fact that they all run into revolutions
and the revolutions are invariably very

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630
and the revolutions are invariably very
 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.159
and the revolutions are invariably very
messy so that the Chinese revolution

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169
messy so that the Chinese revolution
 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:44.950
messy so that the Chinese revolution
brings the Ching dynasty to an end but

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960
brings the Ching dynasty to an end but
 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.340
brings the Ching dynasty to an end but
it does not replace it with a coherent

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350
it does not replace it with a coherent
 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.159
it does not replace it with a coherent
government the Ottoman Empire goes

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169
government the Ottoman Empire goes
 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.590
government the Ottoman Empire goes
through a revolution if that does not

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600
through a revolution if that does not
 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.040
through a revolution if that does not
produce a very effective government

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050
produce a very effective government
 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.700
produce a very effective government
although it's very enthusiastic and

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710
although it's very enthusiastic and
 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.400
although it's very enthusiastic and
nationalistic one the constitutional

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410
nationalistic one the constitutional
 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.400
nationalistic one the constitutional
revolution in Iran does not produce a

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410
revolution in Iran does not produce a
 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.770
revolution in Iran does not produce a
terribly happy result and of course the

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780
terribly happy result and of course the
 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.000
terribly happy result and of course the
Russian Revolution of 1905 is simply a

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010
Russian Revolution of 1905 is simply a
 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.159
Russian Revolution of 1905 is simply a
entering into a waiting period until the

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169
entering into a waiting period until the
 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:18.580
entering into a waiting period until the
big revolution comes in 1918 in the

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590
big revolution comes in 1918 in the
 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.420
big revolution comes in 1918 in the
context of world war one and yet there

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430
context of world war one and yet there
 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.390
context of world war one and yet there
does seem to be this odd convergence

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400
does seem to be this odd convergence
 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.409
does seem to be this odd convergence
that you have revolutions at the at the

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419
that you have revolutions at the at the
 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:35.020
that you have revolutions at the at the
same time so if I were rewriting this

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030
same time so if I were rewriting this
 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:41.680
same time so if I were rewriting this
chapter I might be persuaded by by these

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690
chapter I might be persuaded by by these
 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.820
chapter I might be persuaded by by these
thoughts to extend the time frame of the

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830
thoughts to extend the time frame of the
 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:50.370
thoughts to extend the time frame of the
chapter and say that let us deal with

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380
chapter and say that let us deal with
 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.880
chapter and say that let us deal with
ends of empires now what what is

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:54.890
ends of empires now what what is
 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:06:01.210
ends of empires now what what is
conducive toward the the end of a of a

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220
conducive toward the the end of a of a
 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:07.120
conducive toward the the end of a of a
dynastic regime and at the end of the

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.130
dynastic regime and at the end of the
 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.300
dynastic regime and at the end of the
19th century instead of stopping around

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310
19th century instead of stopping around
 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.770
19th century instead of stopping around
1870

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:13.780
 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.500
but there's another perspective that we

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:17.510
but there's another perspective that we
 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.830
but there's another perspective that we
do fulfill without really making it
