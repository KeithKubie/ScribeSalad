00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.770
- I just learned how to
hold a bat correctly.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.920
This is what they do to learn more

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.570
about the different species that live

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.880
in this region.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.713
They're nervous.

00:00:11.713 --> 00:00:14.210
We're told to not hold them for very long.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.460
It's easy to forget that the
nocturnal world is teeming

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.610
with wildlife.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.810
Night creatures like bats are key

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.790
to the environment's survival,

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.120
but their mysterious lives and our fear

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.312
of them have kept bats on the edge

00:00:27.312 --> 00:00:29.640
of conservation efforts.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.080
How can we preserve the
wild habitats we love

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.410
if we ignore the darker
side of the planet?

00:00:43.491 --> 00:00:45.430
Many bat species are endangered,

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.100
yet few people know why they matter.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.480
National Geographic and
Rolex are sending me

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.420
across Mexico to investigate
the link bats have

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.270
to humans and what average citizens can do

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.330
to help them.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.870
My first stop is the Calakmul Biosphere.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.470
The birthplace of an ancient Maya empire

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.624
that revered bats and home to one

00:01:04.624 --> 00:01:08.290
of the country's densest bat populations.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.840
My journey begins with Begona and Daniela,

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.760
two researchers

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.137
taking me to a family

00:01:13.137 --> 00:01:17.500
of leaf-nosed bats that live
in an ancient Maya temple.

00:01:29.446 --> 00:01:30.900
Threatened by shrinking jungle,

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.400
ruins like these are their last refuge.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.170
Damp and high up, the temples

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.860
of Calakmul provide leaf-nosed bats

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.630
with a safe environment,
far from human threats

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.390
like habitat destruction and vandalism.

00:02:05.238 --> 00:02:07.970
Wow, beautiful.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:08.958
The nose.

00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:09.850
Wow.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.170
A keystone species,
bats indicate the health

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.420
of an ecosystem.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.010
They keep insect populations in check,

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.270
pollinate plants, and disperse seeds

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.040
across large areas.

00:02:48.758 --> 00:02:52.780
Seen as a symbol of fertility,
ancient Maya revered bats,

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.560
endowing them with a mystical status.

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.410
As dusk settles, we wait at the mouth

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.350
of a Volcan de las Murcielagos,
known as the bat volcano.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.260
Sacred to the Maya, it was believed

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.930
to be an entrance to the underworld.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.830
Right now, there is
around four million bats

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.180
leaving the cave and going up in a spiral.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.900
They're gonna spread all over.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.650
What's so amazing about this is the sound.

00:03:35.648 --> 00:03:38.815
(inspirational music)

00:03:45.707 --> 00:03:48.280
They feast on millions of insects,

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.360
making the environment habitable.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.580
I can see why the Maya revered them.

00:04:26.256 --> 00:04:27.910
But Begona and Daniela warn me

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.360
that the bat populations are plummeting,

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.900
and one of their biggest
threats is human persecution.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.020
To understand why, I traveled to Tepoztlan

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.560
to meet the world authority on bats,

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.410
Dr. Rodrigo Medellin.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.810
- We are taking you into the real home

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.640
of the one and only mating cave

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.760
of a Mexican long-nosed bat.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.050
We need to use infrared light all along.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.440
Be as little disturbance as you can be.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.320
- [Alexandra] Feeding on nectar,

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.060
the Mexican long-nosed bat

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.560
is a migrating species closely tied

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.110
to the seasonal flowering of plants.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.740
Due to recent climate changes,
having no food source,

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.690
many are starving to death.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:20.700
- [Rodrigo] Two or three times

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.300
I have witnessed a very sad view,

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.250
which is, walking into the cave

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.170
and finding the floor of
the cave completely covered

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.348
with the bones of baby bats.

00:05:31.348 --> 00:05:33.610
- [Alexandra] As a result of modern myth

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.600
and pop culture, bats
have become synonymous

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.640
with vampires and the devil.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.897
This has led to the
vandalism and destruction

00:05:40.897 --> 00:05:41.990
of their caves.

00:05:44.929 --> 00:05:48.280
- And what you can see here is not a toy.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.620
It's a real altar to the devil.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.410
So people come and do ceremonies

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.510
and things here for the devil.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.420
Unfortunately, they are endangered

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.020
because people destroy their caves,

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.480
so the numbers have dropped heavily

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.838
over the past years.

00:06:05.838 --> 00:06:07.740
- [Alexandra] Rodrigo's
dispelling these myths

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.620
by changing common perceptions

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.920
of bats from demonic villains
to ecological superheroes.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.740
- There's three main ecosystem services,

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.930
or benefits that we get from bats.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.350
Pest control, seed dispersal,

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:30.130
and the third service is pollination.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.510
Without bats, we wouldn't have any crop.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.890
Mexicans have a very tight link.

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.600
The spirit that really designates part

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.240
of our identity is connected to bats.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.900
You drank coffee or tea in the morning,

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.330
you have a link to bats.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.715
You're eating your tortilla corn here,

00:06:47.715 --> 00:06:49.870
you have a link to bats.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.800
Or you're drinking your tequila.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:52.820
Guess what?

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.210
You have a drink to bats.

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:58.540
The Maya really had the right idea.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.060
These bats do a lot for us.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.040
- [Alexandra] Species like
the long-nosed bats travel

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.160
from places like the Devil's Cave

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.530
to Oaxaca to pollinate one of
Mexico's most important crops,

00:07:12.376 --> 00:07:15.200
agave, the plant used to make tequila

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.033
and mezcal.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.720
Mezcal is at the heart
of the Oazacan culture

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.410
and economy.

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:24.110
Agava shortages and a rise

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:27.100
in demand for mezcal are
posing a compounded threat

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.640
to bats.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.410
Agavas must be harvested
before they flower,

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.950
leaving no food for the bats who rely

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.390
on pollinating them.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.170
I've come here to meet Graciela,

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.780
a fourth generation mezcal producer.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:51.950
She harvests in a bio-dynamic manner,

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.840
leaving a portion to be fertilized

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.540
by bats, making her mezcal bat friendly

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.860
and supporting the symbiotic relationship

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.700
between the animal and the plants.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:40.120
Bats have suffered from
being misunderstood

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.000
and ignored.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.290
Bat friendly distilleries help shed light

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:45.890
on the connection between bats

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:47.200
and people.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.170
But what bats need the most is

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:51.710
to be championed for what they are,

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:53.180
unseen heroes.

00:09:56.741 --> 00:09:59.324
(gentle music)
