00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:02.790
PROFESSOR: So let's
do a basic example

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.230
of counting that
illustrates the use

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.870
of these new generalized
rules of the Division

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.140
Rule and the Generalized
Product Rule.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.040
And let's count some
particular kind of poker hands

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.590
called a 2-pair.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.980
So poker is a game where each
player is dealt five cards

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.260
from a deck of 52 cards.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.800
And the definition
of a 2-pair hand

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.030
is that there are 2
cards of some rank.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.190
The ranks are Ace,
Deuce, up through King,

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.090
so the ranks are
13 possible ranks.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.120
Ace is 1, 2, 3, up through
10, and then Jack, Queen, King

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.910
is 11, 12, 13.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.050
So there are 13 possible ranks.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.450
We're going to choose 2
cards of some rank-- that's

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:51.860
called a pair.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.110
Then we're going to choose 2
cards of a different rank--

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.800
a second rank.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.190
And finally, we're
going to choose

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.410
a card of still a third rank.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.400
So I get a pair,
and another pair,

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.220
and another card that does
not match the ranks of either

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.420
of the first two.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.630
And that is the
definition of a hand that,

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.960
in poker, is called 2-pair.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.790
Let's take an example.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.620
Here's a typical 2-pair hand.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.130
I've got 2 Kings.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.820
They both have rank 13.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.330
One is a King of Diamonds,
the other is a King of Hearts.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.680
There are four of these suits,
so-called-- Diamonds, Hearts,

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.090
Spades, Clubs.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.547
There are 2 Aces,
a pair of Aces.

00:01:34.547 --> 00:01:36.880
One is an Ace of Diamonds,
the other's an Ace of Spades.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.250
And finally, there hanging
loose, this third rank

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.905
that doesn't match the Kings or
the Aces-- namely a 3 of Clubs.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.370
Now, the way that
I'm going to propose

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.820
to count the number
of 2-pair hands

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.110
is to think about it this way.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.790
I'm going to begin by choosing
the rank for the first pair,

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.970
and there are 13 possible ranks
that the first pair might have.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.790
Once I've fixed the
rank for the first pair,

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.370
the second pair has to
have a different rank.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.449
So there are 12 ranks left.

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:15.110
And once I've picked the
ranks for the 2 pairs,

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.370
then I have the rank
of the last card,

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.200
which is 11 possible choices.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.067
Then, in addition,
once I've chosen

00:02:24.067 --> 00:02:26.400
the rank of the first pair,
the rank of the second pair,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.910
and the rank of the loose
card, the fifth card,

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.241
I select a pair of suits
to go for the first pair.

00:02:37.241 --> 00:02:39.490
So let's say if the first
pair, I've figured out we're

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:40.810
going to be 2 Aces.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.600
Which two aces should they be?

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.000
Well, pick two of
the four suits.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.650
And there are four
choose two ways to choose

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.460
the suits for the pair of aces.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.480
Likewise, there are four choose
two ways to choose the two

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.630
suits for the pair of kings.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.160
And finally, there are
four possible suits

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.440
I can choose for the
rank of the last card.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.770
So that says that I might,
for example, specify

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.290
a two-pair hand by
saying, OK, let's

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.800
choose a pair of kings to
come first and a pair of aces

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.950
to be the second pair and a
three to be the loose card.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.170
Let's choose the set of
two elements diamonds

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.140
and hearts for the
kings, the two elements

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.380
diamonds and spades for the
aces, and a club for the three.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.970
This sequence of
choices specifies

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.130
exactly the two-pair
hand that we illustrated

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.503
on the previous slide,
namely two kings, a diamond

00:03:39.503 --> 00:03:42.700
and a hearts; two aces,
a diamond and a space;

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.950
and the three of clubs.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.750
So I can count the number
of two-pair her hands fairly

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.910
straightforwardly.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.280
There were 13 choices for
the rank of the first pair,

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.410
12 for the second, 11 for
the rank of the third card,

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.290
four choose way to choose
the suits of the first pair,

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.490
four choose way to
choose two ways to choose

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.280
the suits of the second
pair, and four ways

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.680
to choose the suits
for the last pair.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.620
So this is the total-- 13 times
12 times 11 times 4 choose 2

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.930
twice times 4.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:13.990
And that's not right.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.650
There's a bug.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.110
What's the bug?

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.050
Well, the problem
is that what I've

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:25.260
described in this number on the
previous slide, that number,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.160
is exactly the
set of six tuples,

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.900
consisting of the first card
ranks and the second card ranks

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.140
and the last card rank
and the first card suits

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.370
and the second card suits
and the last card suit.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.500
That is, if it's counting
the number of possible ranks

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.870
for a first choice,
the number of possible

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.690
ranks for a second
choice, third,

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.540
and so on, this
set of six things

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.090
are being counted
correctly by the formula

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.740
on the previous page.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.160
The difficulty is that
counting these six tuples

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.890
is not the same as counting
the number of two-pair hands.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.790
We've counted the number of six
tuples of this kind correctly,

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.440
but not the number of
two-pair, because this mapping

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.060
from six tuples to two-pair
hands is not a bijection.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.440
Namely, if I look
at the six tuple,

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.220
choose kings and
then aces and a three

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.840
with these suits and
those suits and final suit

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.321
for the three, which
determines this hand-- the king

00:05:31.321 --> 00:05:33.820
of diamonds, king of hearts,
ace of diamonds, ace of spades,

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.470
three of clubs-- there's
another six tuple that

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.360
would also yield the same hand.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.060
Namely, what I can
do is I'll keep

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.350
the three of clubs specified.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.140
But instead of choosing
the kings and their suits

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.790
and the aces and
their suits, I'll

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:56.400
choose the aces and their suits
and the kings and their suits.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.800
So I'm just switching these two
entries and those two entries.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.170
And if I do that, here's
a different six tuple

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:09.300
that's specifying the
same two-pair hand.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.150
That is, this
tuple is specifying

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.080
a pair of aces and a pair of
kings, where the aces have

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.330
suits diamonds spades and
the kings have suits diamonds

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.830
hearts and the three
has suits clubs.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.690
So the bug in our reasoning
was that when we were counting

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.660
and we said there
are 13 possible ranks

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.760
for the first pair
and there are 12

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.950
possible ranks for
the second pair

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.860
and we were distinguishing
the first pair

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.080
from the second pair,
that was a mistake.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.900
There isn't any first
pair and second pair.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.660
There are simply two pairs.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.560
And there's no way to
tell which is first

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.380
and which is
second, which is why

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:52.450
we got two different ways
from our sextuples of mapping

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:59.430
to the same two-pair,
depending in the sextuple which

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.880
of the two-pair I
wanted to list first.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.920
So in fact, since either
pair might be first

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:09.790
what I get is this map, from
six tuples to two-pair hands,

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.670
is actually a
two-to-one mapping.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.430
It's not a bijection,
because there's

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:18.440
no difference between the
first pair and the second pair.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.290
There's just a couple of pair.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:24.460
If I do that, then I
can fix this formula.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.740
Now that I realize that
the mapping from these six

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.660
tuples, which I've
counted correctly

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.390
to the things I want to count--
namely, the two-pair hands-- is

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.420
two to one, then, by the
generalized product rule,

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.470
or by the division
rule, all I need to do

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.410
is divide this number by a half.

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:44.943
And that is really the answer
of the number of two-pair hands.
