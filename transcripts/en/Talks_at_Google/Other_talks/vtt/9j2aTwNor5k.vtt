00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:04.140
Ilana Weiss: So hello, everyone. Welcome.
My name is Ilana Weiss, and I work on the

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.680
Learning and Leadership Development Team here
at Google.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.900
And today, it is my pleasure to welcome Daniel
Pink to the "Leading@Google" series.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.701
Many of us are here today because we are big
fans of Daniel's last bestseller, "A Whole

00:00:16.701 --> 00:00:20.939
New Mind: Why Right-brainers will Rule the
Future."

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.630
As Googlers who love data, we appreciate his
use of hard science to drive his insights.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.729
Daniel is an expert on economic transformation
and the new workplace.

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:35.850
And his articles on business and technology
appear in publications, including the New

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.429
York Times, Harvard Business Review, and Wired
where he is also a contributing editor.

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:48.019
Dan jokes that he held his last real job in
the White House where he served from 1995

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:53.039
to '97 as chief speech writer to Vice President
Al Gore.

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.309
He also worked as an aide to U.S. labor secretary
Robert Reich.

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.920
Today, we're also lucky to be among the first
to hear from Daniel about his new book, which

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.340
just came out last week.
And today it is Number 3 on the Wall Street

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.560
Journal list.
And his book is called, "Drive: The Surprising

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.320
Truth about what Motivates Us."
Please join me in welcoming Dan Pink.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.750
[Applause]

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.549
Daniel Pink: All right. Thank you, Ilana,
for that nice introduction.

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.780
Thanks to all of you for being here. It's
great.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.170
This is my first trip to the Google plex,
and I think on the way out, I'm going to get

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.409
a haircut. [laughter]
So it's really kind of cool.

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.909
I sank to Ilana this idea -- this kind of
mobile haircutting place.

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.490
We actually have that in my neighborhood in
Washington, D.C., but it's for dogs.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.219
Because there was sort of roving dog-grooming
places.

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:47.119
I said, "Oh, my God, I got to apply this to
human beings. This is awesome."

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:53.869
Well, it is great to be here, and I'm actually
really excited to talk about this new book

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.429
 -- Drive: The Surprising Truth about What
Motivates Us -- which is about the endlessly,

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:03.240
endlessly -- truly endlessly -- fascinating
and interesting topic of motivation and what

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.610
motivates us and why we do what we do.
But -- before we do that -- I just have a

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.880
quick question.
I know that it's lunchtime.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.771
Has anyone not eaten lunch? All right.
Wow, a lot of you. All right.

00:02:14.771 --> 00:02:18.830
Now, there's a smell of food wafting from
the cafeteria down here.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.170
Some of your colleagues are eating food.
I bet some of you who haven't had lunch are

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.660
hungry.
Anybody who hasn't had lunch hungry?

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.871
Pretty hungry. Who's pretty hungry?
You pretty hungry? What's your first name?

00:02:30.871 --> 00:02:31.980
&gt;&gt; John.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.410
Daniel Pink: John. John is pretty hungry.
You're pretty hungry, John. All right.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:43.710
We're establishing that. Here you go.
Can you come up here for a second, John? [laughter]

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:50.790
On the way over here, I went to Quiznos.
And here's a sub and some Cheetos, all right?

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:58.450
Enjoy your lunch. [laughter] All right?
You can sit down now, John. [laughter]

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.510
What did we just see there, ladies and gentlemen?
We saw motivation right there, right?

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.560
John exemplified one of our drives that we
have as human beings.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:15.290
We have a biological drive, right?
We eat to sate our hunger; we drink to slake

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.030
our thirst; we have sex to satisfy our carnal
urges.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.180
That is part of what it means to be human.
No one would say "That's not part of what

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.100
it means to be human," right?
But no one would also say that "That's all

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.620
it is to be human," right?
Because humans are more complex than that.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:41.570
So let's try something else here. [pause]
Martin -- hang on a second, Martin.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:47.330
Now, we know -- this is for this little YouTube
video series, "Leading at Google."

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:53.540
And so, Martin, if you come up here right
now and hold this book to that camera for

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.430
30 seconds, I'll give you ten bucks.
All right. [laughter] All right. Martin's

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.041
psyched.
Okay. Hold it right there. All right.

00:04:01.041 --> 00:04:05.650
I want to get my money's worth -- 30 bucks
 -- I mean, 30 seconds, all right?

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:17.090
So we're at like 15 now?
14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7 -- look interested

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:26.639
in the book please -- [laughter] 6, 5, 4,
3 -- a little thumbs up sign -- 2, 1.

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:35.889
Thank you, Martin. All right, don't sit down.
Can you hold this for a second, Martin?

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:41.030
Let's hope I have ten bucks.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.030
Martin: I'll take 20.
[laughter]

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.289
Daniel Pink: Here you go. Here's ten bucks.
Martin, thank you. All righty. Here you go.

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:45.669
Give Martin a hand -- round of applause.

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:46.669
[Applause]

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:51.039
Daniel Pink: Now, ladies and gentlemen.
That's also motivation, right?

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:56.430
That's another form of motivation.
Human beings respond exquisitely to rewards

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.289
and punishments in their environment.
You reward something, you typically get more

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:02.050
of it.
You punish something, you typically get less

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.080
of it.
I mean, it's a shame that we couldn't show

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.771
Martin's face on this screen.
Because when I said, "If you come up here,

00:05:10.771 --> 00:05:13.900
I'll give you ten bucks," Martin's -- I mean,
I'm not joking around -- and I'm assuming

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.240
Martin is not like woefully underpaid, okay?
[laughter] Maybe he deserves to be, but he's

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.969
not.
Martin's -- I'm not joking around here -- this

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:23.199
is true.
Martin's eyes widened.

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.150
It was like, "I'll give you ten bucks."
Martin's like -- Oh! -- and he's out of his

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.360
seat ready to stand up there.
Now, Martin, have you and I ever met?

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.409
Have you and I -- have you ever read -- have
you read this book?

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:38.490
No. So here's Martin -- for ten bucks, Martin's
willing to come up in front of his peers,

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.770
on to a TV camera, and hold up -- for 30 seconds
 -- a book he's never read, by an author he's

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:49.080
never met -- all for ten bucks.
Money's a powerful motivator.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.810
Carrots and sticks are powerful motivators.
But that second drive -- to respond to rewards

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.710
and punishments in our environment -- is obviously
part of what it is to be human.

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.159
But, it's not All that it is to be human.
No one would ever say that's all we are.

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:06.569
We have other drives too, right?
We have the John drive -- the biological drive.

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:08.550
We have the Martin drive -- the reward and
punishment drive.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:13.259
But we also have a third drive.
We do things because they're interesting.

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:17.719
We do things because we like to do them.
We do things because we're curious, because

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:20.219
we want to learn, because we want to make
a contribution.

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:24.069
That is also part of what it is to be human
 -- that third drive to do things for their

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:28.550
own sake, because they're interesting, because
we get better at them, because they advance

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.389
some kind of purpose.
Now, does that make sense? We have those drives.

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:35.520
And for those of you who -- actually, there
were a handful of you who looked a little

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.289
skeptical at that claim of this third drive.
And for you, let me ask the following question:

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:46.870
If you're skeptical of the existence of this
third drive -- what are you doing here?

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:51.960
No, I mean that. What are you doing here?
Here in this hour that we're going to spend

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:57.099
here at this little session?
It's a very, very attractive audience, full

00:06:57.099 --> 00:07:02.389
of attractive people, but my guess is that
in the next 45 minutes, no one is going to

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:04.900
find a mate, okay?
So it's probably not going to answer your

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:10.979
biological urges being here.
Second, except for Martin, no one's making

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:15.219
a buck here in the next hour, right?
So why are you here?

00:07:15.219 --> 00:07:17.159
You're here because you're curious.
You're here because you want to learn.

00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:20.120
You're here because you're part of a community.
You're here because you're going to engage.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.430
That third drive is fundamental to what it
is to be a human being.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:28.300
The trouble is -- and I think that you should
be grateful -- I mean, I think that you should

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.610
be grateful working here.
The trouble is that, in many businesses -- Google

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:37.511
being the exception in many ways -- many businesses
treat human beings as if that third drive

00:07:37.511 --> 00:07:40.169
doesn't exist, and that the second drive is
what it's all about.

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:45.029
So that the way that they architect the systems
in their company -- the way they architect

00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:49.210
the compensation schemes -- the way they architect
their human resources policies -- is really

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:53.900
built around carrots and sticks, around "if-then"
rewards, "if you do this, then you get that."

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:58.680
And here's the thing -- and for this book,
I looked at -- and I'm grateful to Ilana for

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.400
mentioning that a lot of the books that I
write are very much grounded in the science.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.850
I looked at 40 years of research -- 50 years
of research in the field of behavioral science

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:11.589
 -- huge numbers of experiments by economists,
by sociologists, by psychologists about what

00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:14.780
really motivates us.
And what is clear from this 40 or 50 years

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:19.180
of research is that those "carrot and stick"
motivators -- those "if-then" motivators -- "if

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:23.680
you do this, then you do that" -- they work.
They work really, really well.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:29.409
But they only work in a surprisingly narrow
band of circumstances -- a surprisingly narrow

00:08:29.409 --> 00:08:32.339
band of circumstances.
And that -- for many things that we do, and

00:08:32.339 --> 00:08:37.020
much of the work that you do here -- those
kinds of motivators -- those "if-then" motivators

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:41.090
 -- don't work.
In fact, they often do harm.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:47.110
So let me try to lay out some of this case
to you, because the research on this is absolutely

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:50.250
fascinating.
And so much of the research on human motivation

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:53.560
is counterintuitive.
We have this notion that human beings are

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.500
these purely mechanistic creatures -- that,
if you simply push the levers the right way

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.630
at the right time, people will do what you
expect them to do.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:04.160
And that ain't true.
We're a lot more complicated than that.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.830
Let me give you some experiments, because
experiments are totally cool.

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:15.560
I mean, I don't want to, it's warm in here.
I don't want to empty the room by reciting

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.941
all 40 years of research.
But some of these studies are totally interesting

00:09:18.941 --> 00:09:20.760
and cool.
My clicker is in my pocket.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.120
That sounds like -- "My clicker is in my pocket"
 -- that sounds like a euphemism, doesn't

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.120
it? [laughter]
[pause] My clicker is in my hand -- which

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:37.020
also sounds like a euphemism. [laughter]
Where was I? Oh, yes.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:45.100
We're talking about the science. Okay. It's
cool.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:49.950
Let me tell you about some experiments, because
these experiments are really, really interesting.

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:54.490
And they're really, really surprising.
So, let me tell you about one experiment that

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:58.380
comes from the mean streets of Cambridge,
Massachusetts. All right?

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:02.560
At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
MIT.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.460
Very interesting piece of research done by
some economists there.

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:10.320
Some economists at MIT in collaboration with
some -- an economist at Carnegie Mellon and

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.200
at the University of Chicago.
So really -- not only the mainstream of the

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.670
economic profession -- but in some ways sort
of the 'elite' mainstream of the economics

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:19.780
profession.
They did this really interesting study.

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:24.470
They gave these MIT students a series of challenges
 -- a series of games and other kinds of tasks

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:28.230
to play.
Some physical tasks -- "Can you throw a ball

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:31.840
through a hoop?"
Memorizing strings of digits, solving complex

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:37.190
conceptual puzzles -- a whole set of challenges.
And they said, "We're going to incentivize

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.460
you.
We're going to incentivize you and reward

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:43.280
you based on your performance.
So if you do reasonably well, you get this

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:49.870
small monetary reward.
If you do medium well, you get a medium monetary

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:52.100
reward.
But if you do really well -- if you're one

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:57.640
of the top performers -- you get a sizable
monetary reward." Okay?

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:00.780
The classic kind of motivational scheme.
Now, what happened?

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:05.530
Let's go to the videotape. Or -- it's not
videotape -- but let's go to this.

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:12.100
As long as the task involved only mechanical
skill, bonuses worked as they would be expected:

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:18.960
The higher the pay, the better the performance.
Nothing surprising about that, right?

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:25.020
Here's where the surprise comes.
But once the task called for even rudimentary

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:29.440
cognitive skill.
Look at that phrase again -- "rudimentary

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:35.000
cognitive skill" -- and in an incredibly innovative
act of right-brain thinking, I made it red.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:42.080
In a rudimentary cognitive skill, a larger
reward led to poorer performance.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:46.490
Now, that's kind of weird isn't it?
That's not the way it's supposed to work.

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:48.180
You know -- if you want more of something,
reward it.

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.420
But that's not happened here.
So they say, "This is weird.

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.890
What's going on here?"
So they test the assumption.

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:57.610
Maybe giving 50 bucks to a student in MIT
isn't sufficiently motivating.

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:00.240
So let's take the same experiment and do it
somewhere else.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:05.230
Let's do it in Madurai, India -- rural India,
where the standard of living is far lower,

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:09.200
so a reward that's modest by American standards
is going to be more impactful.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:13.130
Same deal -- small rewards, medium rewards,
large rewards.

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:15.860
Same set of tasks.
Here's what happened this time.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:21.030
People offered the medium reward did no better
than people offered the small reward.

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:29.350
But this time around, people offered the largest
reward -- they did worst of all.

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:34.200
Here we go. In eight of the nine tasks we
examined across three experiments, higher

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:41.070
incentives led to worse performance.
This is strange. This is not what I learned

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:44.570
when I studied economics.
This is not the way it's supposed to work.

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:48.780
This seems to defy some of the laws of behavioral
physics.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:54.040
This seems -- in its own way -- vaguely leftist
and socialist to me.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:59.110
It sort of undercuts certain tenets of capitalism.
Okay?

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:02.480
But who spots -- first of all, these are done
by economists.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:08.000
Let's look at the socialist organization that
sponsored the research -- Federal Reserve

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.600
Bank.
So this is the mainstream of the mainstream.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:16.030
Top flight economists sponsored by the Federal
Reserve saying, "Higher incentives can lead

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:18.860
to worse performance."
Here's what's interesting about this.

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:22.260
We think that if you reward something that
you want, you get more of it.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.630
And that is not always the case.
And particularly for creative, conceptual

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:31.220
tasks, that is actually rarely the case.
If you offer an "if-then" incentive for a

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:36.880
kind of conceptually-challenging complex task,
people routinely perform worse.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:41.090
This is actually so clear that it's hardly
even controversial in the world of behavioral

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:42.680
science.
It's hardly even controversial.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:46.170
We see it over and over and over again.
So let's talk about -- that's "rewards" -- let's

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:49.660
talk about "punishments".
Because punishment is actually a very powerful

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.240
motivator as well.
And punishment is much more predictable.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:57.340
So let's go from the mean streets of Cambridge
to the country of Israel.

00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:01.160
And let's talk about some day care centers
in Israel who had a problem.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.990
Day care centers in Israel -- the chain of
day care centers -- they noticed that some

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:07.880
parents were coming up late to pick up your
kids -- their kids.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.610
You had to come and pick up your kid by 4
p.m.

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:15.250
Some parents were coming late.
So how do you disincentivize people from showing

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:18.760
up late?
What would you do?

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:23.990
Charge them! Exactly. You charge them.
You impose a fine; you impose a penalty.

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:27.350
Absolutely right. Common place practice.
So that's what they do.

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:30.160
They say, "You know what? People are showing
up late.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:35.030
That's wrong. We're going to stop this behavior.
If you punish something, you get less of it."

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:39.410
So they put up this sign, "Announcement: Fine
for Coming Late.

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:42.020
As you know, the official closing time is
4 o'clock.

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:45.910
Since some parents have been coming late,
we -- and of course, with the approval of

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:50.870
the Authority for Day-Care Centers in Israel
 -- have decided to impose a fine on parents

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:55.830
who came late to pick up their children.
As of next Sunday, a fine of ten Israeli shekels

00:14:55.830 --> 00:15:01.030
 -- about $6.00 U.S. -- will be charged every
time a child is collected after 4:10."

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:05.910
So it's every child -- many people have more
than one kid there -- every child, every instance,

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:08.810
you're paying a fine.
This fine will be calculated monthly.

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:11.070
It is to be paid together with the regular
monthly payment.

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:18.340
Sincerely, the manager of the day-care center."
So of course, tell me your first name. Patsy?

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:22.240
So of course, Patsy said -- had the same instinct
that I had -- you wanted to turn this behavior

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:28.830
 -- charge them for it! And of course, when
you charge them for it, what happens, Patsy?

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:31.892
After the introduction of -- sorry, Patsy
 -- that was kind of a rhetorical question.

00:15:31.892 --> 00:15:38.850
[laughter]
After the introduction of the fine, we observed

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:45.100
a steady "increase" in the number of parents
coming late.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:51.190
The rate was finally settled at a level that
was higher and almost twice as large as the

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:57.190
initial one.
So you impose a fine to deter bad behavior

00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:02.000
and the consequence of the fine is, you get
"more" of the bad behavior?

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.240
And then what happened?
You double the rate of bad behavior, and then,

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.490
when you withdraw -- I don't have this in
there -- when they withdrew the fine, what

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:11.840
happened?
The incident -- no! -- it didn't go down!

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:15.290
The incidents of lateness stayed up.
You did permanent damage.

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:18.780
Now, this is -- seems on the surface as we
think about things.

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:24.010
If we think about human beings as these purely
mechanistic creatures, it seems inexplicable.

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:25.710
But Patsy, seriously -- how would you explain
this result?

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:30.690
Patsy: Well obviously we said it's OK to come
late if you pay this extra amount of money.

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:39.480
So people who couldn't make it there on time
thought, "Oh no big deal I'll just pay this

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.920
money and show up late".

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:45.350
Daniel Pink: You said, "It's no big deal to
show up late, I'll just pay them money."

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:49.810
Why were people showing up late -- why were
most people showing up on time in the first

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:51.070
place under the earlier regime?

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:54.580
Patsy: They didn't think they had an option
probably.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:55.580
Daniel Pink: They didn't think they had an
option?

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:59.200
What is another reason you think they might
have been showing up on time?

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:12.299
Social convention? Okay. What else?
Guilty? Shame? They liked their kids? [audience

00:17:12.299 --> 00:17:18.929
laughter]
They didn't want their child to sit on the

00:17:18.929 --> 00:17:25.089
street.
Here's the thing -- okay, this is good.

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:29.289
Their relationship with the caregiver was
not a purely economic, market relationship.

00:17:29.289 --> 00:17:34.249
They want it to be fair to the person -- and
not just any person -- the person caring for

00:17:34.249 --> 00:17:37.850
their children.
So, they had a social obligation -- social

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:41.919
convention.
I would even -- I would see your "social,"

00:17:41.919 --> 00:17:45.929
and raise it -- "moral." That is, they have
a moral obligation in some ways.

00:17:45.929 --> 00:17:50.529
They have a relationship, and that encouraged
them to -- that's why they actually -- most

00:17:50.529 --> 00:17:54.509
people actually -- complied with the rule.
But when you -- what it did is, it shifted

00:17:54.509 --> 00:18:00.309
this out of the social realm into the market
realm and it became nothing more than buying

00:18:00.309 --> 00:18:03.309
 -- it became similar to buying the bag of
Cheetos I got for John, all right?

00:18:03.309 --> 00:18:07.100
"Hey, I want three bags of Cheetos."
Open up your wallet; buy three bags of Cheetos.

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:10.690
And so, human beings are not that mechanistic.
We do things for other reasons.

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:16.100
We do things because they're good and because
we care about other people and because we

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:19.650
want to maintain that relationship.
So when you look at the science, it actually

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:22.570
calls into question a lot of what we think
about human beings.

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:25.390
And so, here's the gist of it.
Let's talk about -- we're going to talk about

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:30.370
how this applies to work, but let me just
give you, in some ways, the "thumbnail sketch"

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:37.740
here.
If you want people to do work that is routine,

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:42.029
that is rule-based -- I can use this word
here -- you want people to do work that is

00:18:42.029 --> 00:18:47.639
"algorithmic," okay?
Where you are -- this is the only place on

00:18:47.639 --> 00:18:53.309
the planet where you can say the word "algorithmic,"
and a third of the audience smiles in response

00:18:53.309 --> 00:18:54.309
to that one word.
[audience laughter]

00:18:54.309 --> 00:18:59.130
It's almost this Pavlovian nerd instinct [audience
laughter].

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:07.690
"Algorithmic" -- woe! If the work is "algorithmic"
 -- that is, there's a set of rules, a process

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:13.591
that you follow, a clear set of steps that
leads to a single conclusion -- the carrot

00:19:13.591 --> 00:19:16.899
and stick motivators are excellent for that
kind of work.

00:19:16.899 --> 00:19:20.889
They're really good.
For work that's not especially interesting,

00:19:20.889 --> 00:19:25.649
carrot and stick motivators are pretty good.
One of the dangers of carrot and stick motivators

00:19:25.649 --> 00:19:29.670
is that they can sometimes dampen or even
extinguish people's intrinsic motivation for

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.470
a task.
But if there's no intrinsic motivation to

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:34.820
extinguish, then, you're not taking a big
risk.

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:38.391
So for tasks that are simple, tasks that aren't
especially interesting, tasks where you want

00:19:38.391 --> 00:19:43.149
a short-term result -- carrot and stick motivators
are awesome if you want short-term results.

00:19:43.149 --> 00:19:45.250
Awesome.
You get the Martins of the world leaping out

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:50.370
of their seat for ten bucks, instantly.
Uninteresting -- not particularly interesting,

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:52.879
not especially complicated, short-term -- they're
awesome.

00:19:52.879 --> 00:19:57.870
But here's the thing -- how much of the work
that you do at Google is "not especially interesting,"

00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:01.960
"not especially complicated," and "only has
short-term results?"

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:06.490
Maybe some portion of it, but the vast majority
of what you do is actually reasonably interesting.

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:09.669
It's actually quite sophisticated and complicated
and conceptual.

00:20:09.669 --> 00:20:13.480
And you actually want the results to endure
for a long time.

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:18.869
And for those kind of work -- these contingent
"if-then" motivators simply don't work.

00:20:18.869 --> 00:20:23.820
There's 40 years of science that says this.
And the danger is -- or at least from my perspective

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:27.059
 -- is that the science hasn't migrated to
the business world.

00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:30.740
That many people -- I think this company is
an exception -- many aspects of the business

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:35.820
world, many institutions in the business world,
are basically operating on notions of human

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:39.389
motivation that is rooted in folklore, not
in science.

00:20:39.389 --> 00:20:43.110
But I think if you listen to science, you
can run your companies in a fundamentally

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:45.590
different way.
And there's some cool examples of how to do

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:49.179
it differently.
So, let's talk about how to do this.

00:20:49.179 --> 00:20:54.409
Number one -- money is a motivator.
Money is a motivator. We saw it with Martin.

00:20:54.409 --> 00:20:58.100
Money is a motivator.
But money is the motivator in slightly different

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:01.590
way than we think.
The gist of it basically is that, for money

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:06.950
to be a motivator, you got to pay people enough.
If people aren't being treated fairly, if

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:10.610
people feel like they're being compensated
inadequately, if they feel like someone in

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:14.720
the adjoining office, the adjoining cube,
is doing similar work, or isn't as good -- is

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.610
getting paid more than them, you don't have
motivation.

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:22.369
That is a motivation sinkhole.
If people can't support their family, this

00:21:22.369 --> 00:21:28.999
notion of a "third drive," is nonsense. Okay?
But once you pay people enough -- in fact,

00:21:28.999 --> 00:21:33.779
once you pay people a little bit more than
enough -- what you do as a motivator is, you

00:21:33.779 --> 00:21:38.570
take the issue of money off the table so people
can focus on their work.

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:43.429
That is the best use of money as a motivator
 -- to take the issue of money off the table.

00:21:43.429 --> 00:21:48.450
Now, after the fact, profit sharing, even
stock options -- those are less corrosive.

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:53.399
It's very difficult for any single one of
you to game -- to basically -- I hope it's

00:21:53.399 --> 00:21:59.309
very difficult for any of you to single-handedly
game the Google stock price.

00:21:59.309 --> 00:22:02.520
I hope that's true.
You might be smarter than I give you credit

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:06.789
for, but I hope that's true.
So after the fact, it's not so bad. But contingencies

00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:09.830
are bad.
Pay people enough so that they don't think

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:12.559
about money, they think about work.
What else can you do?

00:22:12.559 --> 00:22:16.039
Well, there are three components that science
shows us that really lead to effective, enduring

00:22:16.039 --> 00:22:18.789
motivation, especially for complicated, conceptual
tasks.

00:22:18.789 --> 00:22:26.330
They are: Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose.
Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose.

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:30.799
Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose.
Let's start with "autonomy," which is in some

00:22:30.799 --> 00:22:38.919
ways the first among equals.
We want to be self-directed. You want to direct

00:22:38.919 --> 00:22:40.520
your own lives.
That is human nature.

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:44.259
There's a notion out there -- in companies
not like this one -- that if human beings

00:22:44.259 --> 00:22:50.211
were left alone without the threat of a punishment,
without the dangling of a carrot, people would

00:22:50.211 --> 00:22:55.850
do nothing.
This sort of the "lump" view of human nature.

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:58.870
I'm serious -- Oh, there are plenty of people
who believe this.

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:02.010
Plenty of people who believe that if people
were not threatened with a punishment or enticed

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:06.590
with a reward, they would just sit there and
do nothing.

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:10.759
Now, what's curious about this is that no
one ever believes this about him or herself.

00:23:10.759 --> 00:23:14.519
They only believe it about other people. And
I think it's wrong.

00:23:14.519 --> 00:23:20.009
I think that is not human nature -- that human
nature is to be active and engaged.

00:23:20.009 --> 00:23:25.399
That is -- let's use a computer metaphor here
 -- I think that being active and engaged

00:23:25.399 --> 00:23:28.210
and curious?
That is our default setting.

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:34.970
That is our default setting, okay?
When the product ships, when the box ships,

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:37.470
that's the default setting -- to be active
and engaged.

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:42.529
And any of you have kids or have seen kids
 -- I have yet to see a 2-year-old who's not

00:23:42.529 --> 00:23:45.679
active and engaged.
I have yet to see a 4-year-old who's not active

00:23:45.679 --> 00:23:49.880
and engaged.
It is manifest as day that that is our natural

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:53.909
state -- that that is our default setting.
Now, I've seen plenty of 14-year-olds and

00:23:53.909 --> 00:23:57.889
34-year-olds and 44-year-olds who are not
active and engaged -- who are passive and

00:23:57.889 --> 00:24:00.429
inert.
But looking at that doesn't mean that's their

00:24:00.429 --> 00:24:03.989
natural state.
What it means is that the default got changed

00:24:03.989 --> 00:24:07.649
through a whole set of experience.
But if we awaken that default, I think great

00:24:07.649 --> 00:24:10.200
things can happen.
And I think you guys have done actually -- in

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.600
many ways -- a masterful job of that.
Truly, masterful job of that.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.889
And I've said that in venues other than this
one. [audience laughter]

00:24:16.889 --> 00:24:21.999
Just for credibility's sake.
I mean, I used to work in politics before

00:24:21.999 --> 00:24:24.860
I chose the equally noble calling of writing
business books. [audience laughter]

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:31.610
And one person in politics -- actually, a
legendary political consultant -- we were

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:37.239
in a meeting -- legendary political consultant
 -- we were in a meeting, and he leaned over

00:24:37.239 --> 00:24:44.119
to me and he said something sort of kind of
unctuous cloying to the person in charge.

00:24:44.119 --> 00:24:49.190
And he leaned over to me and almost in a staged
whisper he said, "In politics, you can never

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:53.129
pander too much."
And I think that's true in politics. I don't

00:24:53.129 --> 00:24:55.419
think that's true here.
So, my credibility is that I've said this

00:24:55.419 --> 00:24:56.610
other places.
But let's not talk about you.

00:24:56.610 --> 00:25:01.559
Let's talk about some other cool places -- cool
places that might yield some lessons for this

00:25:01.559 --> 00:25:05.570
equally cool place.
Let's talk about this company, yes.

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:10.299
This company -- Atlassian. Atlassian -- Australian
company.

00:25:10.299 --> 00:25:13.279
Software company. Obviously much smaller than
Google.

00:25:13.279 --> 00:25:16.169
Atlassian. Has some offices in San Francisco
along with Sydney.

00:25:16.169 --> 00:25:21.050
They do something really cool.
Once a quarter, they say to their software

00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:25.600
developers, "You can work on anything you
want for the next 24 hours."

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.309
It starts usually Thursday at 2:00 in the
afternoon.

00:25:28.309 --> 00:25:31.100
Starting now, you can work on anything you
want, as long as it's not part of your regular

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:34.009
job.
You can work on it with whomever you want.

00:25:34.009 --> 00:25:37.499
You can work on it the way you want.
You can work on it wherever you want.

00:25:37.499 --> 00:25:43.370
The only thing we ask is that, at the end
 -- at 4:00 on Friday -- you show what you've

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:47.440
created to the rest of the company. Okay?
But not in this kind of star chamber, American

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.960
Idol kind of setting.
But in this kind of -- no seriously, it's

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:55.340
like kind of a -- it's sort of like, I don't
know, are TGIFs fun here? They are.

00:25:55.340 --> 00:26:00.780
Okay, so it's sort of like the poor man's
TGIF, where you show the results to the company

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:04.940
at the end of those 24 hours.
They have beer and cake and other kinds of

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:08.049
things like that.
I guess "other kinds of things like that"

00:26:08.049 --> 00:26:19.399
would be carbohydrates.
They call these things "FedEx Days." Why?

00:26:19.399 --> 00:26:24.360
Because you have to deliver something overnight.
[audience laughter]

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:29.799
Little Australian humor.
Well, it turns out that this one day of intense,

00:26:29.799 --> 00:26:34.159
undiluted autonomy has produced this whole
array of software fixes -- a whole array of

00:26:34.159 --> 00:26:37.559
ideas for new products -- that had never otherwise
emerged.

00:26:37.559 --> 00:26:41.049
Now, this was not a contingent motivator,
"if you do this, then you get that."

00:26:41.049 --> 00:26:45.269
This is basically leaving people alone, saying,
"Do something cool if you feel like it," and

00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:49.779
getting out of their way.
One day of intense autonomy produced these

00:26:49.779 --> 00:26:52.809
things.
And they have actually then raised it -- which

00:26:52.809 --> 00:26:55.429
is something much more familiar to you -- I
don't even want to talk about it here.

00:26:55.429 --> 00:26:58.460
Which is, they now -- because of the success
of "FedEx Days" -- they now do 20 percent

00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:03.269
time.
So, FedEx Days turned out to be kind of this

00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:07.080
baby step on the way to 20 percent time, which
you obviously do here.

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:10.071
And for those of you watching at home who
don't know about 20 percent time.

00:27:10.071 --> 00:27:13.890
20 percent time down here at Google -- some
people can spend 20 percent of their time

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:17.360
 -- although no one ever hits that mark usually
 -- 20 percent of their time -- working on

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:30.580
anything they want, and Google keeps the IT
rights. [audience laughter]

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:32.970
Give you another example of this, because
here's the thing that's really important to

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:38.999
me personally just as a human being.
This is not reserved only for people who are

00:27:38.999 --> 00:27:41.880
doing high-level sophisticated work like you
are, okay?

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:45.549
This urge for autonomy and self-direction
is a human urge.

00:27:45.549 --> 00:27:50.350
And it's possible to infuse this in all kinds
of jobs -- in all kinds of work.

00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:52.409
And let me give you an interesting example
of this.

00:27:52.409 --> 00:27:54.889
Let's take call centers.
Let's take call centers.

00:27:54.889 --> 00:27:59.899
Has anybody ever worked in a call center?
Okay, right back -- you work in a call center.

00:27:59.899 --> 00:28:05.899
Right there. You with the glasses.
Tell me -- oh, it's an early call center here,

00:28:05.899 --> 00:28:10.169
so we don't want to talk about that.
How about a less-evolved call center?

00:28:10.169 --> 00:28:17.970
Anybody? Oh yeah, you worked in a call center.
Tell me what it was like. How long ago was

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:18.970
it?

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:24.350
Man: Ten years ago, I supported systems for
Amazon.com's call center.

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:28.419
Daniel Pink: I don't want to bring in another
brand here.

00:28:28.419 --> 00:28:31.850
No, but -- yeah, okay.
So tell me, what was it like working at a

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:33.580
call center?
Describe the physical setting.

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:37.409
It doesn't have to be where you said it was,
but just in general.

00:28:37.409 --> 00:28:45.029
You're packed in. You're always visible.
Ooh, that's a nice way to put it. You're always

00:28:45.029 --> 00:28:49.070
visible to somebody.
So it's basically a warren of cubicles, hamsterlike

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:53.399
cubicles.
You had a headset on? Headset on.

00:28:53.399 --> 00:28:55.299
You're always visible to somebody -- that's
an interesting way to put it.

00:28:55.299 --> 00:28:56.299
Were your calls monitored?

00:28:56.299 --> 00:29:01.830
Man: Oh yeah, the manager wanders over and
sits down and just start listening.

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:02.830
Daniel Pink: Sits down and starts listening.
And were your calls timed?

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:04.169
Man: Oh yeah.

00:29:04.169 --> 00:29:09.499
Daniel Pink: Okay, how long did you stay at
this job?

00:29:09.499 --> 00:29:17.399
Don't say the name again! [audience laughter]
Yeah, it's a high turnover job -- six months

00:29:17.399 --> 00:29:20.799
is long.
That's exactly right. Tell me your first name?

00:29:20.799 --> 00:29:21.799
Man: Benji.

00:29:21.799 --> 00:29:24.330
Daniel Pink: Benji? As Benji says, it's a
high turnover job.

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:27.549
You did a brilliant job of describing it.
It's like, you're sitting there in a hamster

00:29:27.549 --> 00:29:36.049
cage with your time monitored, your voice
being listened to, and people are not calling

00:29:36.049 --> 00:29:38.440
to see how you're doing.
They're calling because they're a little bit

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.769
miffed about this, that, or the other thing,
right Benji?

00:29:40.769 --> 00:29:46.489
So you know what the turnover rate is in this?
In a typical -- in the call center industry?

00:29:46.489 --> 00:29:52.080
Annual? About a hundred percent.
I mean, think about that for a second.

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:55.840
It'd be like if you came back here a year
from now, on average, it'd be a totally different

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.880
group of people.
I mean, that's basically, essentially treating

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:03.830
human beings like lightbulbs.
"Oops, a lightbulb burnt out. Go to the closet;

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:09.450
get another one.
[special emphasis] 'Screw' it in." [audience

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:13.400
laughter]
Now, there's a notion out there that this

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:18.619
kind of job is sort of inherently soul-hollowing
 -- inherently deadening -- but that's not

00:30:18.619 --> 00:30:20.169
the case.
So let's talk about a different way.

00:30:20.169 --> 00:30:24.130
How could you do this a different way?
Well, talk to the good folks at Zappos, okay?

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:28.629
Talk to the good folks at Zappos.
Here's what Zappos does -- trains their call

00:30:28.629 --> 00:30:32.799
center representatives over two weeks.
"Here's our policies. Here's our values.

00:30:32.799 --> 00:30:36.850
Here's our approach to customer service."
And then, they do something totally cool and

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:40.609
just kind of wacky -- bizarre -- in motivational
terms.

00:30:40.609 --> 00:30:45.239
They say, "If, at the end of those two weeks
of training, you don't want to work at here,

00:30:45.239 --> 00:30:50.330
I'll give you $2,000."
Isn't that? I don't even know what to call

00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:51.619
that.
You know what I mean?

00:30:51.619 --> 00:30:54.600
I mean, I -- seriously, I don't know how to
describe -- it's like a negative carrot or

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:59.090
something like that.
And then, they go and they take their jobs

00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:08.899
as call center representatives and here are
their instructions: "Serve the customer. Solve

00:31:08.899 --> 00:31:17.239
the customer's problem."
That's it. "Do it the way you want. If it

00:31:17.239 --> 00:31:20.359
takes you one minute, great.
If it takes you one hour, no problem."

00:31:20.359 --> 00:31:22.869
Now, of course, they get feedback from customers
to make sure that they're being treated well.

00:31:22.869 --> 00:31:25.720
What happens?
Zappos comes out of nowhere to be one of the

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:29.729
highest customer-service-ranked companies
in any industry in this country -- higher

00:31:29.729 --> 00:31:33.799
than the Four Seasons.
Okay? Taking this job that we think is inherently

00:31:33.799 --> 00:31:40.940
deadening, infusing it with some autonomy,
boom! People perform, because we're not innately

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:43.289
passive and inert.
Let's talk about mastery.

00:31:43.289 --> 00:31:46.440
Mastery is a second urge.
Mastery is our desire to get better at something,

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:49.690
particularly better at something that matters.
It is a fundamental human impulse.

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:54.759
It is so powerful that people do things that
seem economically irrational. Okay?

00:31:54.759 --> 00:31:58.369
Let's talk about economic irrationality, and
let's talk about open source.

00:31:58.369 --> 00:32:05.039
Now, open source in economic terms is very
weird, okay? And we forget that.

00:32:05.039 --> 00:32:07.229
We're so kind of anchored in the present,
we forget that.

00:32:07.229 --> 00:32:13.239
So if you go back say 15 years or 20 years
and if you described open source as a business

00:32:13.239 --> 00:32:18.609
model to anybody -- particularly an economist
or a business school professor -- they would

00:32:18.609 --> 00:32:22.509
think that you were high.
I mean, I just ima -- can you -- I mean, imagine

00:32:22.509 --> 00:32:26.479
 -- "Oh, I got this great business model."
If it's 1995, "Hey, I've got this great business

00:32:26.479 --> 00:32:29.179
model.
Here's what it is: People will work to create

00:32:29.179 --> 00:32:32.330
software."
Okay, 1995 -- the year of Window's '95, right?

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:36.809
And those of you who remember.
You remember when Windows '95 came out.

00:32:36.809 --> 00:32:40.899
It was like huge news, okay?
"But you know, I think there's another model

00:32:40.899 --> 00:32:45.330
out there, and here's how it would work.
You got these people -- these really technically-skilled

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:47.859
people who fetch decent wages in the labor
market.

00:32:47.859 --> 00:32:51.239
And what they do is, they volunteer their
labor.

00:32:51.239 --> 00:32:55.090
They work really hard for free.
And then, wait -- it gets better.

00:32:55.090 --> 00:33:01.779
Then, they give away their product.
You with me? This is going to be awesome."

00:33:01.779 --> 00:33:06.950
I don't think you could -- I mean, you could
go down to Menlo Park or any venture capital

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:10.420
firm, or any economist or anybody who thought
they knew anything about business, they would

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:15.539
say, "Uh, it doesn't quite work that way.
That seems actually vaguely delusional to

00:33:15.539 --> 00:33:19.299
think that it could."
You look at something like -- what's curious

00:33:19.299 --> 00:33:23.200
about this is that, they're wrong.
It does work -- Linux.

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:28.600
It does work -- Apache.
It does work -- reasonably well -- Wikipedia.

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:34.320
Wikipedia. You realize that Microsoft who
created Encyclopedia, vaguely around the same

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:39.460
time as Wikipedia, had all the right incentives
 -- all the things that economists at business

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:43.220
school professors would tell you to do.
Encarta is out of business.

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:44.919
Wikipedia is the biggest encyclopedia in the
world.

00:33:44.919 --> 00:33:50.029
That seems to have sort of almost sort of
biologically impossible 15 years ago.

00:33:50.029 --> 00:33:53.309
And yet, that's what it is.
So what's going on? Why are people doing this?

00:33:53.309 --> 00:33:56.509
Think about motivation.
Think about mastery and open source from the

00:33:56.509 --> 00:34:00.009
employer's perspective.
Here you have technically-sophisticated people

00:34:00.009 --> 00:34:05.239
doing demanding work for decent wages.
But their urge for something is so deep that

00:34:05.239 --> 00:34:10.530
they spend their discretionary time doing
equally -- if not more -- challenging work

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:15.429
for someone else for free.
Think about being the employer.

00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:19.929
You say, "What am I missing?
What am I not providing?" That economist asks,

00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:22.720
because this is a very curious puzzle.
They asked the question, and here's what they

00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:27.919
find out: The biggest motivator is enjoyment-based,
intrinsic motivation -- how creative people

00:34:27.919 --> 00:34:30.399
feel while working on the project. That's
what it is.

00:34:30.399 --> 00:34:32.589
People are looking for challenges.
They're looking to get better.

00:34:32.589 --> 00:34:35.349
They're looking for mastery.
They're looking for engagement.

00:34:35.349 --> 00:34:39.399
You see this over and over and over.
Another example.

00:34:39.399 --> 00:34:45.429
Just to go to even -- this is percolating
to the mainstream in a place like Harvard

00:34:45.429 --> 00:34:48.330
Business Review.
Harvard Business Review has a story in the

00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:51.409
January issue -- good piece of research -- about
what motivates people at work.

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:57.070
Long, multiyear study of what motivates people
at work where people kept very extensive time

00:34:57.070 --> 00:35:02.010
diaries over several years to report how they
were feeling, to report their subjective well-being.

00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:05.910
Over the years, they find this -- there's
one motivator above all.

00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:08.900
One motivator stands out well above anything
else.

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:14.049
And here's what it is: Making progress in
one's work.

00:35:14.049 --> 00:35:17.910
Making progress -- that was the biggest motivator
for people.

00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:21.920
Making progress.
And the really good managers out there are

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:26.059
managers who recognize this.
Who recognize progress.

00:35:26.059 --> 00:35:31.030
Who say, "Wow, yesterday you were here, today
you're here."

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:33.670
Who help people who honor that. Who respect
that.

00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:38.010
Who help people move toward that. Making progress.
What about incentives?

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:41.250
Here's what the Harvard researchers say.
The key to motivation doesn't depend on elaborate

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:46.339
incentive systems.
In fact, the people in our study rarely mentioned

00:35:46.339 --> 00:35:50.750
incentives.
Making progress is the biggest motivator.

00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:54.690
Finally, last but not -- oh, let's skip that
 -- last but not least.

00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:58.650
Last but not least -- Purpose.
Purpose. We want to be part of a cause larger

00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:02.270
than ourselves.
That's part of what it is to be human.

00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:07.030
We perform at a higher level sometimes when
we're animated by some kind of bigger purpose.

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:10.950
We perform at a higher level when we feel
like our contributions to teammates actually

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:13.420
creates something bigger than we could create
ourselves.

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:17.700
Very, very powerful motivator.
And "purpose" -- I think more broadly -- is

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:21.440
becoming an enormous animator of effective
business today.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:25.349
And you see that here.
You know, your mission what -- is "to organize

00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:28.950
the world's information," right?
So that people can -- what's the rest of it?

00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:36.940
Say again? So it's universally available.
Organize the world's information so it's universally

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:39.780
available and -- useful.
Okay.

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:42.750
This looks like it's sort of a surprise to
some of you, which is alarming.

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:45.450
[audience laughter] But trust me. Check your
website.

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:51.161
That's a big, transcendent purpose.
That's not -- that's not -- think about that

00:36:51.161 --> 00:36:54.930
purpose.
That is not profit maximization.

00:36:54.930 --> 00:37:01.710
That's not a purpose.
That is not even the light and engaged customers.

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:04.340
It is at a higher order of magnitude than
that.

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:07.520
It is about some kind of transcendent purpose.
And what you see here more and more among

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:10.590
effective businesses is that, we have the
profit motive.

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:13.990
The profit motive is a good thing.
The profit motive is actually a really good

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:16.369
thing.
The profit motive is one reason why we have

00:37:16.369 --> 00:37:19.869
such a high standard of living.
I think the profit motive is good.

00:37:19.869 --> 00:37:25.440
It's not universally, permanently, you know,
unequivocally good, but I think the profit

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:29.730
motive is good -- good in the sense of effective
and actually good in the sense of moral in

00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:34.079
its own way.
But, the profit motive is not the only thing.

00:37:34.079 --> 00:37:39.450
And what's happening now more and more is
that, if you want really talented people to

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:43.420
come work at a place, you got to have a bigger
purpose, okay?

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:47.670
Maximizing shareholder gain is not going to
get a lot of people up in the morning.

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:50.390
It's not going to say, "Wow, I'm going to
do something really cool.

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:56.950
I'm going to like --" If you have a mission
of maximizing shareholder gain, I don't think

00:37:56.950 --> 00:38:01.391
you would have that groovy thing that Ilana
just showed me Aned's globe, right?

00:38:01.391 --> 00:38:05.000
That's unbelievable, okay?
If you're animated by profit-seeking, you're

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.041
not going to get that kind of stuff.
You're not going to get the cool stuff.

00:38:09.041 --> 00:38:12.599
And so, what I think's going on right now
is that, the profit motive -- in order to

00:38:12.599 --> 00:38:16.270
be effective, but also to be good in a deeper
sense -- has to be anchored in some way to

00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:20.170
the purpose motive.
That when the profit motive becomes unmoored

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:25.900
from the purpose motive, sometimes bad things
happen, but also, it's less effective.

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:29.180
It's really less effective.
And I think that we see this in the high-performing

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:32.790
organizations today.
And I'll give just one quote from a venture

00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:35.760
capitalist -- an investor.
He says, "Today you have to have a purpose

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:38.349
bigger than your product."
You have to have a purpose bigger than your

00:38:38.349 --> 00:38:39.849
product.
And I think that's a lot of what you're doing

00:38:39.849 --> 00:38:41.510
here.
I think it explains your success.

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:45.000
So it's a delight to be with you, because
I think in many ways -- not in all ways -- but

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.890
in many ways, your purpose is bigger than
your product.

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:51.430
In many ways, you have people in this place
who have the privilege of being able to move

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:54.400
toward mastery.
And you actually have a more autonomous, self-directed

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:57.329
environment than in most places.
And I think that's the recipe -- not only

00:38:57.329 --> 00:39:01.079
for a great company -- but I think it's a
recipe for a good company.

00:39:01.079 --> 00:39:12.280
And so, my hats off to you.
So let's take some questions. Yes.

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:13.560
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:29.670
Daniel Pink: Yeah. [pause]
Yeah, "How would you frame the behavior of

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:33.770
the financial industry in response to these
things?" It is pretty clear.

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:39.150
This goes back to the utterly shocking slide
that I put up there that money is a motivator.

00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:42.690
Okay?
If you give people -- one of the dangers of

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:47.579
carrot and stick "if-then" rewards -- particularly
if they're short-term and high stakes -- is

00:39:47.579 --> 00:39:52.750
that some people, many people, will take any
route there, even if it means cheating.

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:56.210
There's no question about that. And that's
some of what we saw.

00:39:56.210 --> 00:40:02.890
The other thing is that people become myopic
in the sense that they don't see the long-term

00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:05.560
consequences of it.
And they don't care, even if it's against

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:09.230
their own self-interest.
So you bundle up a package of securities based

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:15.770
on essentially fraudulent -- not in the legal
sense -- dicey, let's say "dicey" mortgages,

00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:19.859
and then pass it off to somebody else.
Short-term, all is good.

00:40:19.859 --> 00:40:24.500
Long-term, you could be caught in the total
downdraft of this whole economy.

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:28.930
So it forces us to be myopic, and it also
gets us to be very -- it narrows the breadth

00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:32.400
of our thinking as well.
So you actually become in some ways less creative.

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:37.799
So I think that, in many ways, the financial
crisis -- an element of it -- shows you what

00:40:37.799 --> 00:40:42.039
happens when it's all carrot and stick -- or
it's all "carrot" -- and when people have

00:40:42.039 --> 00:40:44.660
 -- and especially short-term.
And the short-term thing is actually really

00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:50.750
important, because if the payoff is only short-term,
people will respond to that.

00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:53.660
There's pretty little question about that.
Now, let's go more broadly.

00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:57.119
Let's talk about executive compensation here
for a moment, because I think it's a slightly

00:40:57.119 --> 00:41:01.940
 -- it's a sort of connected issue.
The thing about executive compensation that

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:06.619
I think actually does verge on fraudulent
 -- and not in the legal sense, but in the

00:41:06.619 --> 00:41:11.390
sort of a moral sense -- is that a lot of
executive compensation isn't even an "if-then"

00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:13.069
incentive.
Here's what it is.

00:41:13.069 --> 00:41:17.450
If you're an executive -- a high-level executive
 -- and your company does well, you get a

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:21.401
huge amount of money.
If you're an executive and you run your company

00:41:21.401 --> 00:41:24.520
into the ground, you get a huge amount of
money.

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:28.440
So it's not even like an incentive as much
as it is an entitlement in that regard.

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:32.930
Now, there's also this talk out there that
you hear in the financial industry -- "Hey,

00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:39.490
if we didn't pay these outlandish salaries,
these people wouldn't work here."

00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:43.230
Right? You've heard that. Okay?
I actually think that's a very interesting

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:49.020
research question.
Let's try it, okay? [audience laughter] I'm

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:51.279
serious. Let's try it.
Let's see what it is empirically.

00:41:51.279 --> 00:41:55.339
You're making a -- it's an interesting hypothesis.
Let's test it empirically.

00:41:55.339 --> 00:41:59.230
I actually think that you'd get a lot of talented
people going to jobs that pay a half million

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:03.730
dollars a year even if two years ago they
paid $3 million a year.

00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:10.690
So I think there's a lot of -- you know -- it's
somewhat irritating because of the -- it's

00:42:10.690 --> 00:42:15.240
more than somewhat irritating -- it's extremely
irritating because of those kinds of factors.

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.240
Yes, sir.

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.640
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:30.630
Daniel Pink: Yeah. Yeah.
If you force caps on CEO pay, you take away

00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:33.250
that person's autonomy.
You mean, sort of government caps.

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:37.150
Yeah, I think you're right about that, actually.
And I think that that is sort of imposing

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:40.630
a solution to this from the top down is not
going to work.

00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:44.280
Because all -- it's sort of squeezing a balloon.
And so, what people are going to come up with

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:49.420
"work arounds" around.
You saw this in the early 1990s when they

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:55.950
put a -- sort of a supertax on executive compensation
above the then-lofty figure of 1 million.

00:42:55.950 --> 00:43:01.109
And so, what happened is that everybody put
their regular compensation at 1 million and

00:43:01.109 --> 00:43:04.130
then found other ways to compensate people
that were even more lucrative.

00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:09.400
So I don't think the solution is necessarily
to impose a law or regulation to stop that.

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:11.849
I think the solution is actually in the hands
of shareholders.

00:43:11.849 --> 00:43:15.750
I think the solution is in the hands of boards.
And you have very compliant boards.

00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:19.240
Google's the exception.
You have very compliant boards, and you have

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:25.280
actually very passive shareholders.
And the shareholders are getting mistreated.

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:35.720
[pause]
Who's next? What are your questions? Yes.

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:38.510
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:47.940
Daniel Pink: Well, we have all kinds of motivations.
I mean, fear is a great motivator.

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:49.960
You know, and so these kinds of things.
I mean, I think there's an interesting thing

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:53.970
about what you see in open source is that
people say, "Well, what about reputation?

00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:58.710
What about a acclaim? Is that a motivator?"
And it is, in a way, but not quite in the

00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:01.720
pure way that we think.
Because if you think about reputation and

00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:07.440
acclaim, it is itself a form of feedback.
It gives you a sense of feedback, and feedback

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:12.000
is necessary if you want to move toward mastery.
And so, what's curious -- I'll tell you about

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.430
one study about this, about sort of the importance
of feedback and reputation.

00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:20.190
It's an interesting study of artists.
So they went to -- they studied these artists

00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:24.859
in the 1960s who were at the Art Institute
School in Chicago, okay?

00:44:24.859 --> 00:44:29.240
They were preparing to be artists.
And they talked to these -- they interviewed

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:32.079
these students -- and they found out -- they
did these qualitative interviews to find out

00:44:32.079 --> 00:44:35.001
what their motivation was.
And they noticed two groups of people.

00:44:35.001 --> 00:44:38.510
Basically, because they were curious, "Why
are people coming to art school?

00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:41.630
What do they want to get out of art school?
How does it fit into their path?"

00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:46.220
And so, they noticed that some people had
very much an extrinsic orientation. Okay?

00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:50.549
"I'm really good at art, and I can become
rich and famous doing art."

00:44:50.549 --> 00:44:54.220
That was one motivator for people.
"I want the acclaim. I think I'm really good

00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:57.059
at it.
I think I can make a decent living off of

00:44:57.059 --> 00:44:59.000
it."
There were other people who said -- had a

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.470
more intrinsic orientation.
"I want to paint. I love painting; it's cool.

00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:07.290
It's what I do." Okay?
Sometimes you talk to artists, and they don't

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:10.100
even have an actual -- they can't even articulate
why they're -- it's like, "This is what I

00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:12.550
do." Okay?
So you had two different orientations here.

00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:16.609
Now, what's so interesting about this -- so
they use this data to figure out admission.

00:45:16.609 --> 00:45:19.221
"Okay, so we have two different kinds of mindsets
coming in here.

00:45:19.221 --> 00:45:24.410
Okay da da da da."
So this sits there for awhile.

00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:26.990
Somebody then realizes that there's this trove
of qualitative data -- 20 years later.

00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:33.270
"Wow, I wonder what happened to these folks?"
It's fascinating, right? Follow up. What happens?

00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:41.510
Well, it turned out that a decent number of
them actually had attained decent amounts

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:46.579
of acclaim and had great reputations and actually
were making good livings as artists.

00:45:46.579 --> 00:45:50.799
And you know who they were?
The intrinsically-oriented ones.

00:45:50.799 --> 00:45:55.700
So there's this kind of zen-like thing going
on that if you "pursue it, you won't attain

00:45:55.700 --> 00:46:00.410
it."
[audience laughter] You know? Grasshopper.

00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:05.770
And that's so interesting.
So it's like, you know, that if you -- that

00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:10.530
the folks who are most committed to those
kinds of external rewards were the ones who

00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:15.740
were least likely to get it.
Why? We can speculate why.

00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:21.870
Being an artist is really, really hard, okay?
Doing anything well is really, really hard.

00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:27.650
It takes a really long time.
And you're less likely to stick with it if

00:46:27.650 --> 00:46:31.490
you don't really love it.
And so, because they really loved it, it was

00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:36.170
"what I do," they got a lot better at it.
They were willing to stick through the -- The

00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:42.420
other folks who were more extrinsically motivated:
"You know? I'll go sell insurance" -- not

00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:44.940
that there's anything wrong with selling insurance.
What do you think? One more, then we'll wrap

00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:46.670
up.
Yes, sir.

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:52.010
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:46:52.010 --> 00:47:13.770
Daniel Pink: Okay. In themselves? Okay.
So let's take that one. So the question's

00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:17.970
a good question.
"How can someone sort of lower in the ranks

00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:21.540
foster this kind of sense of motivation in
him or herself?"

00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:23.830
Okay, I think people can do a lot more than
they think.

00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:30.530
So let me offer actually a tactical idea on
that, okay?

00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:33.450
Let's talk about performance reviews here
for a moment.

00:47:33.450 --> 00:47:40.579
You're laughing about performance reviews.
What's the point of a performance review?

00:47:40.579 --> 00:47:44.160
Ideally, to provide -- tell me your first
name? Court.

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:48.900
Court says ideally to provide feedback.
Ideally to provide feedback.

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:53.549
Now, we all know that that is actually not
the best mechanism for providing feedback.

00:47:53.549 --> 00:47:57.240
What's wrong with it as a mechanism for providing
feedback?

00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:00.740
It's too late. Very good.
Your first name was -- Patsy.

00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:03.789
Patsy says it's too late.
What's another flaw in that?

00:48:03.789 --> 00:48:10.710
It's tied to the money. That's a good point.
What about the session itself?

00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:18.920
Most performance reviews sessions -- you know
this -- it's Kabuki Theater, okay?

00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:21.390
[audience laughter]
It's basically people playing certain kind

00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:25.950
of rehearsed roles, right?
It's not typically -- sometimes it is -- an

00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:29.170
open conversation.
It's Kabuki Theater.

00:48:29.170 --> 00:48:34.349
And so, it doesn't work very well.
As Patsy said, it's too late, and it's also

00:48:34.349 --> 00:48:36.299
too infrequent.
Think about an athlete.

00:48:36.299 --> 00:48:42.589
Athletes get feedback all the time. Serena
Williams doesn't have a biannual performance

00:48:42.589 --> 00:48:46.920
review, you know? [audience laughter]
I mean, you're laughing, but it's crazy to

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:49.039
think about that, right?
How are you going to get better at tennis

00:48:49.039 --> 00:48:52.510
if you only get feedback twice a year, all
right?

00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:55.619
And so, I think there's a better way to do
this -- a better way to do performance reviews.

00:48:55.619 --> 00:48:59.210
And basically, is a much more autonomous way.
And I think it's very effective for people

00:48:59.210 --> 00:49:03.250
 -- that Court says -- who are not the folks
in positions of traditional power.

00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:07.599
And it is basically to take performance reviews
back. Take them back.

00:49:07.599 --> 00:49:14.650
Do not outsource your performance review to
managers or bosses or people of formal authority.

00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:18.240
Take it back. And here's how it would work.
Basically, a Do It Yourself performance review.

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:25.000
At the beginning of a month, set out your
goals -- your learning goals, and your performance

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.020
goals, okay?
Set them out at the beginning of the month.

00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:34.099
And then, at the end of the month, call yourself
into the office. [audience laughter]

00:49:34.099 --> 00:49:40.660
Give yourself a stern, but loving, assessment
of how you're doing.

00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:43.410
Where are you making progress?
Where are you falling behind?

00:49:43.410 --> 00:49:47.130
The other question that we don't ask enough
in performance reviews is, "What tools or

00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:50.750
information do you need to do things better?"
Okay?

00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:54.940
Ask yourself that. Ask yourself that question.
And that's how you can move toward greater

00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:57.190
and greater mastery on your own.
Take them back.

00:49:57.190 --> 00:50:00.590
The other thing that's very interesting that
goes toward aspect of Court's question is

00:50:00.590 --> 00:50:04.040
that -- what I've seen is that -- this is
happening in a really interesting, somewhat

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:08.130
self-organized way.
So that you see this -- sometimes people will

00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:10.240
say, "It's too weird to call myself into the
office.

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:15.210
I'm not going to have this secret conversation
with myself.

00:50:15.210 --> 00:50:18.680
But I will have it with a peer.
Or I will have it with two peers or three

00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:22.089
peers or four peers."
And so, you see this less inside of organizations

00:50:22.089 --> 00:50:26.170
but more among people who are self-employed
or small entrepreneurs who will fashion these

00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:30.400
groups and meet monthly and say -- So, Court,
Patsy, and I meet.

00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:33.010
And I say, at the beginning of the month,
I say, "Listen, Patsy and Court, here's what

00:50:33.010 --> 00:50:36.910
I'm hoping to do this next month".
"Okay, great. Maybe think about this, that,

00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:39.319
the other thing," they say to me.
They tell me what they're trying to do in

00:50:39.319 --> 00:50:41.359
the next month.
At the end of the month, we meet.

00:50:41.359 --> 00:50:44.190
We sit down informally. Have some coffee.
"Okay, how'd you do?"

00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:49.900
"Well, I didn't quite make those sales calls."
"Why not, Court?" Hold you accountable a little

00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:50.900
bit.
Give you feedback.

00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:53.380
"Oh, that was a really" -- and so, people
are yearning for this.

00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:56.160
So they're taking these back in a self-organized
way.

00:50:56.160 --> 00:51:02.670
So I think that reclaiming performance reviews
is one thing that individual contributors

00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:07.579
can really do to get better at stuff.
And I don't think that most organizations

00:51:07.579 --> 00:51:12.230
are fully committed to helping everybody get
better at stuff.

00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:15.410
And on that note, thanks for having me.

00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:16.049
[Applause]
