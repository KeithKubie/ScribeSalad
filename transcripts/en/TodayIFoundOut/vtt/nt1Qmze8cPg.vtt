00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.840
The story of the slot machine is one of intrigue,
theft, controversy, and murder.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.590
Okay, not murder, but everything else.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.830
And it starts in Bavaria….

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.560
Augustinus Charles Fey was the youngest of
sixteen children born in 1862 in the small

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.259
village of Vohringen, Bavaria which sits at
the edge of the Alps.

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:28.779
Early on, he displayed an interest in mechanics,
following his brothers’ footsteps and working

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:30.700
in a farm tool factory in Munich.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.059
At fifteen, August hit the road (apparently
fearful of his strict father and not wanting

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:36.430
to serve in the military) and walked across
Europe.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.480
He stopped in France for about three years,
working as an intercom equipment manufacturer,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.460
and then made his way to a British shipyard
(approximately 750 miles and an English channel

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.239
away from home), where he settled down for
five years as a nautical instrument maker.

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.210
Several years before, August’s uncle (his
mother’s brother) had moved to and settled

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.289
in New Jersey.

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.899
The family received letters from him talking
of fortune and the good life America provided.

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.659
So, August saved his money and made the pilgrimage
to the United States.

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.650
He arrived in New Jersey and lived with his
uncle’s family in Hoboken (the birth place

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.882
of baseball), but quickly made the decision
to try his hand out west in the “lawless”

00:01:12.882 --> 00:01:14.160
town of San Francisco.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.740
He arrived there approximately in 1884/1885
at around 23 years old, right when the city

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.479
was attempting to change itself, for better
and worse.

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.590
In 2013, maps of San Francisco were uncovered
from the late 19th century.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.119
These maps showed numerous gambling halls,
opium dens, and brothels dotting the city,

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.390
with each vice-ridden location color-coded
on the maps.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.300
Despite this, little was done at this time
by the local government and police force about

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.979
these illegal establishments.

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.270
In this environment, Fey used his skills as
a mechanic and found a job at California Electric

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.909
Works (later Western Electric, which went
defunct in 1995).

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.020
He worked as an instrument maker and while
doing this befriended a German foreman, Theodore

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.840
Holtz, who will come into this story again
later.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.369
It was also about this time that he met Marie
Christine Volkmar, the daughter of a cigar

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.030
shop owner, with whom he fell in love with.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.721
Unfortunately, he contracted consumption,
aka tuberculosis (see: Why Tuberculosis was

00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:07.020
Called Consumption), and hit the road again,
this time for warmer weather in Mexico.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.820
While there, his health did not improve, so
he returned to San Fran, thinking if he was

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.500
going to die, it might as well be near the
woman he loved.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.720
He miraculously got better (potentially due
to the controversial use of creosote, obtained

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.360
through the distillation of tar) and married
Marie in 1889.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.260
They would go on to have four children together.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.959
To top off the metamorphosis going on in his
life, August Charles Fey changed his name

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.090
to Charles Fey, reportedly because he hated
being called “Gus.”

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.900
At this point, Fey began tinkering with creating
and inventing his own mechanical devices.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.940
Always a fan of making money, he frequented
the gambling halls of San Francisco and noticed

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.599
the so-called “nickel-in-the-slot” machines
that were rapidly becoming popular.

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:50.230
These machines were much closer to vending
machines than to what we think of slot machines

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.830
today, dispensing cigars or drink tickets.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.940
These also usually required a human, the cigar
shop owner or barkeep, to give you your prize.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.900
The most popular ones were the poker machines
that would actually flip real playing cards

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.220
on five reels, revealing the hand.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.580
The better the hand, the more drink/cigar
tickets you earned.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.840
These types of machines were so ubiquitous
that a San Francisco Daily News headline noted,

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.620
“Fiveteen Hundred Swindling Machines in
One City!”

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.840
In 1893, Fey thought he could make a better
gambling machine.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.110
His work friend Theodore Holtz introduced
him to another German who was working at California

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.200
Electric Works, Gustav Friedrich Wilhelm Schultze.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.340
On August 8, 1893, Schultze had patented his
own “coin-controlled apparatus,” called

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.740
the “Horseshoe.”

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.120
This was the first US patent issued for a
gambling machine and was the first to somewhat

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.159
resemble what we now know as a modern slot
machine.

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:42.450
In fact, some historians have argued that
Schultz, not Fey, should be the one known

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.680
as the “Thomas Edison of slot machines.”

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.390
We will come back to that later.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.230
Either way, Fey was impressed and “inspired”
by the Horseshoe and went to work on his own

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.670
coin-controlled apparatus.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.659
In 1894, Fey designed a version of the Horseshoe,
quite simply the same machine, but with a

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:00.310
better mechanical reel, and asked Holtz to
be his equal business partner (and not Schultz.)

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.030
Holtz agreed and they both quit their jobs
at California Electric, setting up shop as

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.550
“Holtz and Fey Electric Works” at 39 Stevenson
Street.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.650
Purposefully, they positioned their shop close
to Schultz’s shop, who had also quit his

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.420
job to make gambling machines.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.860
This should have set up a rivalry, except
for the fact that Holtz and Fey were also

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.860
selling leftover parts to Schultz, presumably
because Schultz had no clue that they were

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.660
also making gambling machines and had essentially
stolen his idea.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.890
In any event, in the basement of his house
in 1895, Fey completed his next mechanical

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:34.610
wonder, an even more modified version of the
Horseshoe he called the “4-11-44” in homage

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.440
to a popular lottery game at the time called
“Policy,” in which the rare winning sequence

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.889
was 4-11-44.

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.860
This machine is one of the reasons so many
give Fey the credit for inventing the slot

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:46.860
machine.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.400
It was a three-disc floor machine and was
unlike any other ever created because instead

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.530
of spitting out tokens or slips, it had the
ability to dispense actual coins.

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.720
They put it in a local San Francisco saloon
and it was a hit and a huge money maker.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.250
Fey and Holtz went to work producing more,
but before they got very far, Fey, once again,

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.250
went packing.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.310
Fey sold his share of his company with Holtz
to start his own company, Charles Fey &amp; Company.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.000
(Holtz also founded his own company and called
it “Novelty Machine Works”.)

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.261
In 1897, Fey further staked his claim as the
“Thomas Edison of slot machines,” when

00:05:17.261 --> 00:05:22.919
he devised the Card Bell slot machine, a “three-reel,
staggered-stop machine with automatic payout.”

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:27.330
Essentially, what it did was stagger the stops
– first one reel, then the second, and then

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.669
the third – just like modern slot machines,
creating suspense, drama, and excitement.

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:32.389
At first, he used playing card symbols, but
two years later, he replaced them with stars

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:35.530
and bells and called it the “Liberty Bell”
slot machine.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.690
With ten symbols on each reel and ten stops,
it allowed for numerous combinations.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.240
It was unlike anything else on the market,
including Schultz’s machines.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.440
It should be noted here that, technically,
slot machines at this time were illegal (though,

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.760
most law officials rarely policed them).

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.870
As such, even though Schultz was awarded a
patent in 1893 for his machine, when he tried

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.110
to sue Holtz (he did name several other defendants
in his documents, including Fey, but Holtz

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.630
was the main defendant), the courts ruled
that the patent didn’t protect him because

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.180
a gambling machine was illegal.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.660
Because of this, the gambling and slot machine
industry, from then on, was a bit like the

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:10.460
wild wild west – ideas, designs, and concepts
were stolen right and left.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.110
As for Fey, he never patented any of his machines
nor sold or leased them.

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:19.570
He would operate them himself by making agreements
with the proprietors (bars, cigar shops, etc.)

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.850
for a 50/50 split of the profits.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.740
In the end, Fey’s machines were a hit and
became the “the largest slot operation in

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:47.069
the country during 
the early 1900s.”
