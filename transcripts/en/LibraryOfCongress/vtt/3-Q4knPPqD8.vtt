00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.340
&gt;&gt; Scott Walter: Good
morning, everyone.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.640
It's a real pleasure to
be here and I really feel

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.320
like I'm amongst friends.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.870
So thank you for inviting me.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.360
I'm the Executive Director.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.690
My name's Scott Walter,
Executive Director of CODE,

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.220
which is known as the
Canadian Organization

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.270
for Development through
Education.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.540
We've been around for some
60 years supporting access

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.390
to quality education.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.690
Our vision is one
of every child,

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.380
every young person
having the ability

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.060
to pursue quality
education and, through that,

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.290
to realize their full potential,
really with the belief

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.830
that perhaps the best way --

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.780
perhaps the only way to really
sustain and generate human

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.970
and economic growth is
through quality education.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.980
Our model of development, which
is fairly straightforward,

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.350
but is based on years and years
of experience and practice,

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.610
is one of essentially saying
that, if you want to make

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.620
and support literacy
gains, on one hand,

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.060
you need the sustained access
to quality, relevant learning

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.640
and reading materials and, on
the other hand, having educators

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.980
with the skills to use
those materials effectively

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.110
in the classroom or in the
library or in the home.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.470
And then, together with a
focused program of evaluation

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.550
and assessment to ensure
that you know what --

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.530
we know what we're doing and
that we're improving quality.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.920
So on the book side, this
is a big part of what we do.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.770
Sixty years ago we started
off as a donated book program.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.710
But, thankfully, we've become
a much more sophisticated

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.970
organization and really it's all

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.460
about the quality
of the materials.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.200
So the what -- the context
we what we're doing.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.520
And, in that regard,
we work very closely

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.590
with publishing industries
locally working with authors

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.660
and illustrators and editors to
ensure that we're working right

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.920
across the entire book chain
and supporting materials

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.970
in mother tongue, but also
that it's a sustained supply.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.860
It's -- and I think
that's an important point.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.850
That if materials are not
from that likely context,

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.590
it's really difficult to ensure

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.570
that the materials are
reflecting the local environment

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.890
and engaging children.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.960
So these are pictures of
some of the materials.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.330
We work in about 17 different
languages, local language,

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.990
but as well in English,
French, and Portuguese.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.760
We also -- most of -- many
of the materials or much

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.700
of the work that we
do is in early grade.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.520
So there's a lot of
work with mother tongue,

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.390
but we believe strongly
that the reading habit has

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.040
to be one that's
lifelong in nature.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.430
So over the last 10 years, we've
become more active and worked

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.910
with young adult
literature and trying

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.980
to support the development and
access to material that, again,

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.270
will reflect the child's
environment and material

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.730
that they relate to their own
lives and what they're doing,

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.620
and hopefully be getting them
to become engaged readers

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.970
and lovers of reading
as a result.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.210
We work through teaching.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.440
I think this is actually
my older PowerPoint

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.740
that I sent [laughing].

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.240
But the point is that
much of what we do with --

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.900
we realized that the books
on their own are not enough.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.440
That you have to have
those skills for teachers

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.490
and educators to be able to
use the materials effectively.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.070
And a lot of that is in early
grades is in the actual teaching

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.400
of reading and writing.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.480
I used to work for
the International

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.780
Reading Association.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.290
They had a book called "Teaching
Reading is Rocket Science."

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.240
And it's an approach
that we believe in

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.390
and it's an area that's
been much neglected.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.840
So a big emphasis on the
teaching and the skills

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.580
of reading and writing
and insuring that --

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.490
also that we're moving from that
rote learning, memorization,

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.810
teacher-centered approach,
to the active learning,

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.630
participatory, child-centered
approach.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.720
And we have to have a program.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.150
We want to make sure that
there's quality control

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.440
and standards and certification
that go along with that,

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.050
that we're negotiating
performance standards,

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.880
and that we're working closely
with ministries of education

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.850
to ensure that that is part
of the national program.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.300
This is an example
of our partner

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.970
in Liberia that's
accredited as a provider.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.680
Where we work?

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.980
Mainly in Africa.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.760
We're in about eight
different countries.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.330
Very challenging.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.850
We do a lot of Liberia
and Sierra Leone recently.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.490
Very, very challenging, but
we're making huge strides

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.470
and it's really one of
the most rewarding areas

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:22.770
that we're working.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.880
We also work in the Caribbean
and part of a newer program

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.380
that I really like is
we're in Canada itself.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.210
We're working with
our aboriginal piece,

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.200
the First Nation Inuit and
Metis, which share a lot of --

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.980
unfortunately, share a lot
of the problems that we see

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.710
in the developing world in terms
of marginalization and lack

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.920
of access to quality education.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.790
So thank you very, very
much for having me be here.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.090
That's part of a network

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:53.730
that we're involved
with and in Africa.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.720
What a pleasure to be here?

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.250
Thank you, again.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.110

of the Library of Congress.
