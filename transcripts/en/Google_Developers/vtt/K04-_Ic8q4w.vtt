MIMI FOX MELTON: Hi.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.330
I'm Mimi Fox Melton, director
of Technical Applicant Prep

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.615
Programs at CODE2040.

00:00:16.615 --> 00:00:20.430
CODE2040 is a San
Francisco-based non-profit

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.690
that creates pathways to
success in the innovation

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.020
economy for blacks and Latinos.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.130
Right now, there is a huge
wealth gap in this country.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.850
And it's impacting our
communities, our businesses,

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.860
and our economy, especially
as our country's demographics

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.660
continue to shift.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.940
However, the new
tech economy also

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.550
presents a huge
opportunity, especially

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.600
for those of us in
the tech industry.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.280
We have the power to
change the face of tech

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.046
and close this wealth gap.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.230
So here's what we're doing.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.660
We have four programs exploring
pathways to increase access

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.320
into the tech sector.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.650
I came on board to build
out our TAP programs

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.350
and answer the
question, how do we

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.100
reach every single black
and Latino computer science

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.235
major in the country?

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:10.360
You may already be familiar
with our summer Fellows

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.750
program, which started in
2012 with five students.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.990
This summer, we're
growing to 80 students

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.665
who snag paid summer internships
at top Bay Area tech companies.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.240
Despite efforts like
these as an industry,

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.860
we haven't made
significant gains

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.800
towards increasing diversity.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.820
Though in the US,
blacks and Latinos

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.980
make up 28% of the population
and 18% of computer science

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.264
degrees, we're only represented
in tech at 5% to 9%.

00:01:39.264 --> 00:01:40.680
Through the Fellows
program, we've

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.630
worked with over
70 companies who

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.930
are taking action towards
building more diverse teams

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.420
and exploring and implementing
operational and cultural

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.790
changes to retain those
diverse team members.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.440
Our Fellows program
successes are

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.260
enabling us to tackle
that question, how do we

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.510
support the 32,000 black
and Latino computer science

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.530
majors in the US who are
struggling to survive

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.850
as first generation college
students, immigrants, or women

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.590
of color?

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.570
In 2015, my team launched
a series of workshops,

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.720
webinars, and local
retreats designed

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.460
to build professional
development skills

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.080
and community for
those 32,000 students.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.980
We piloted with about 600
students, and we learned a lot.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.810
At the end of the
year, I hit the books

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.350
to analyze our surveys, review
our focus group data, interview

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.480
volunteers and
university faculty,

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.010
and read every study I
could find on the minority

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.580
experience in CS.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.250
What I found was staggering.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.220
The overall dropout rate
for CS students in the US

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.110
is around 30%.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.790
For blacks and Latinos, that
number jumps to around 70%.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.230
One historically black
college in the US

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.400
reports an annual
dropout rate of 96%.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.392
The data show four reasons why
students of color drop out.

00:02:55.392 --> 00:02:56.850
I talk to students
all the time who

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.680
don't know a single
other black or Latino

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.050
person in their major.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.250
They don't know that
they can start a company,

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.600
make a lot of money, or change
the world with their degree.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.920
We hear from students
dealing with depression,

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.160
diminished self-worth, and
intense imposter syndrome.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.050
At best, some of them suffer
through it and graduate.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.050
The vast majority change majors,
and some drop out of school

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.550
entirely.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.370
I believe that there's
a fourth option,

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.690
a space where black and
Latino students are thriving.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.300
They understand their
potential in the industry,

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.220
and they see a clear path
to achieving their goals.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.700
I created TAP 2016
to be that program.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.800
TAP 2016 is a year-long program
with in-person and virtual

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.830
engagement designed to
connect computer science

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.863
and academia with software
engineering careers.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.530
As part of TAP 2016, we're
launching a new initiative,

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.930
First Years on Campus, which
is an early intervention cohort

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.540
program for black and Latino CS
freshman, designed especially

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.230
for programming that address
those common causes of CS

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.930
dropout.

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.390
We are constantly asked by
techies, what can I do to help?

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.900
So we're building out our
professional leadership

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.980
development work with our
alumni and our volunteers,

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.730
specifically to expand their
mentorship and facilitation

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.290
skills.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.770
So whether you work
with us or someone else,

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.140
it is vital that you, as an
individual, get involved.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.800
Reach out to us and
apply the volunteer.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.210
Design a webinar, sit on a
panel, or write a blog post.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.190
We'll help.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.850
Let us know that you can
give a tour of your office

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.370
or even have a student
shadow you for a day.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.120
We are always in need
of virtual coaches

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.940
who can give resume feedback,
general career advice,

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.480
or practice interview skills.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.990
We can help you pitch an
internship at your organization

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.390
or in your department.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.180
This summer, you can mentor
a fellow for eight weeks.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.000
Introduce them to your
network, invite them

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.920
to your office-- you know,
just spend your time with them.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.020
Look, this is not a problem
that people of color

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.460
alone are going to
be able to solve.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.770
This is an all-hands-on-deck,
America-is-in-trouble kind

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:16.770
of problem.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.740
But there is action
that you can take today

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.130
to make a difference.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.190
Email us and let us
know that you're in.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.840
