00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.160
There may come a point in one's relationship where you hit a bump in the road.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.880
To maintain a strong chemistry with one another, here are seven tips on how to have a strong relationship.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.320
Physical contact:

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.840
Intimacy plays an important role in a relationship.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.989
Putting your guard down and becoming more vulnerable with each other by either holding hands, hugging, or cuddling,

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.469
shows the other person that you have a great interest with them.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.190
Open communication:

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.890
Communication is key in a relationship.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.779
You want to be comfortable with your partner and be able to share your thoughts on any type of subject.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.070
You also want to have that mutual agreeance, that you are able to handle any

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.130
situations that come your way, and be able to talk them out.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.290
Becoming a friend with the person you are interested before dating them can be a bonus.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.720
Because then you know that they can be your best friend, and you can be comfortable around them.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.200
You have the same sense of humor:

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.440
It's important to laugh together, especially when times are tough, and you're able to break the tension somehow.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.160
When you both laugh together at the same thing, it creates a bond between one another,

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.800
and you're able to accept each other for who you are.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.180
Emotional bonding:

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.600
Having an emotional bond between one another is a good way

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.080
to build a connection and be able to trust, and care for each other.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.260
When you ask your partner how their day is, or if they are feeling okay that day,

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.540
it lets the other person know that you care, and are taking an interest in what they have to say,

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.940
which brings you closer together.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.920
Making up after arguments:

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.120
It's important to make amends after an argument, no matter how small or big.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.220
Being stubborn and fighting with one another is what causes you to become distant,

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:05.880
which could lead to a breakup.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.680
Talking to your partner about the fight, and how you two can resolve it, is

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.020
a great communication form, and will only bring the two of you closer than ever.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.819
Do not take your partner for granted:

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.100
Letting your partner know how special they are, and how much they mean to you,

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.220
can keep the relationship strong.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.860
Being there for them is a great way to show that you care.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.820
If a person is constantly letting their partner pay for everything, and pushing away what they have to say,

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.800
it's a sign that they're taking that person for granted.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.380
Do you see a future with your partner?

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.980
Maintaining the relationship and faith in one another, even in hard situations, is a big deal.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.540
Are you able to always count on your partner?

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.560
Planning your future together can be a joyous occasion, in which the two of you will forever share the bond that you have.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.560
If the two of you really care about one another and see a future, do not let them go.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.960
