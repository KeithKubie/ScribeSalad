00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.196
Here's another way of estimating Pi. Take a one inch needle, and repeatedly

00:00:04.196 --> 00:00:10.119
drop it on a sheet of ruled paper whose lines are two inches apart. Call it a

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:14.626
hit if the needle is hitting one of the lines. If you do this a whole bunch of

00:00:14.626 --> 00:00:18.136
times, Pi will be approximately equal to the number of drops over the number of

00:00:18.136 --> 00:00:22.051
hits. If you're curious about the details, you can check out a Wikipedia page

00:00:22.051 --> 00:00:26.500
on this. Clearly, dropping a needle on the floor, and measuring whether it

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.575
touches a line thousands of times is not a job that anybody wants to do.

00:00:30.575 --> 00:00:35.360
Thankfully, we can make our computer simulate the experiment for us. We

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.455
randomly generate a yLow, or the lowest point of the needle, which should be

00:00:39.455 --> 00:00:45.954
somewhere between zero and two. Then we calculate an angle a between zero and

00:00:45.954 --> 00:00:53.012
180 and use this angle to figure out y high. If y high is more than two we have

00:00:53.012 --> 00:00:58.310
a hit. Now do this many thousands of times and you'll have an estimate for pi.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:04.355
So again you want to randomly generate y low, randomly generate and angle a And

00:01:04.355 --> 00:01:12.070
then calculate y high. Which will be y low plus the sine of the angle. And be

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.583
careful, because math.sine takes radiance, not degrees. Math.toradians can help

00:01:18.583 --> 00:01:22.650
you with the conversion. You can always review the math facts sheet if you

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.970
don't quite remember how this works. Here's the start of the program to do

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.336
this. And when you put in the number of tries, I recommend using a large

00:01:30.336 --> 00:01:36.004
number. At least 30,000. When you write this code, make sure to use the

00:01:36.004 --> 00:01:39.760
variable tries to control how many times you drop the needle.
