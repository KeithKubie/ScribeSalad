Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radio lab radio from W N Y s t e n n p r I am Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab and today my name is Peter Lang Stanton. My name is Nick Faraga. Well we're gonna get a story from two reporters. Um, I'm a freelance film maker, freelance reporter, writer slash radio producer to many slashes. It's a story that goes back about 70 years. It's, it all feels like unreal in some way, but there's something about this story that just is, you hear it and you can't help but think about now. Yeah. Should we start with, with air currents or like go with, I mean I I want to start with can we go to Thermopolis Wyoming cause that was, that was one of the first really well documented landings. Thermopolis, Wyoming. Well it's the first week of December, 1944 this is Ross Cohen. He's a historian and he wrote a book. That's pretty much the definitive account of the story you're about to hear. Any health Thermopolis, Wyoming, December, 1944

Speaker 2:          01:04          and there are three liners at a place called the highline coal mine, which is outside of Dimopoulos. They step outside the mine one evening. It's just about dusk and just as they step out of the mind, they hear this whistling sound over their heads and then a moment later,

Speaker 3:          01:20          yes,

Speaker 2:          01:25          a tremendous explosion and they see this rising cloud of dust about a mile away across the valley. They turn and look. It's dusk and so in the fading twilight, they can't be sure exactly what they're looking at,

Speaker 1:          01:40          but above them there's sort of this fluttering white circle just floating there. They made sense of it by thinking it was

Speaker 2:          01:48          parachutists. They watched this parachute as it's drifting away from them. They get in their car and they chase after it until eventually they lose sight of it in the dark.

Speaker 1:          01:57          Yes. Right around that same time, about 500 miles away in Colorado, a boy and his dad are working in the barn. When they hear an explosion, they run outside and in their yard. There's just this smoldering crater

Speaker 2:          02:14          in Wyoming, a nine year old boy playing in his front yard. Here's an explosion all throughout the winter of 1944 in Burwell, Nebraska. Strange parachute thing. Native residents here, a loud explosion, just start appearing in

Speaker 1:          02:27          the skies all over America, Napa, California, lame deer, Montana, 20 or so miles from downtown Detroit over farms, Nogales, Arizona, slipping behind hills, Rigby, Idaho. Everybody who sees these things, all of them have different explanations for what they think they're witnessing. They think it's a plane crash, an oil tank exploding. The U s military sends out an APB to local police station saying, we need information. What are these things? Try again. Testing, testing. Ah, there we go. Okay. Hello. Hello. Enter Sheriff Warren. Hide. Uh, my name is Marianne hide. Warren hide actually died in 1989 so I'm the oldest son of sheriff. We talked to his son. He had a presence about him, the to, he kind of commanded a room. Sheriff Hyde was a big guy, black wavy hair, brought out the shoulder, narrow at the hips that's in gun on his hip and one day he's at his office, north of Salt Lake City. When his phone rings, from what I understand, a dry farmer called, he said, there's this strange contraption in my field, some kind of balloon parachute looking thing floating around. So he jumped in the car and uh, went hell bent for leather out into the Blue Creek area. There's this crazy story where he rushes out to this farm to investigate hops out of his car, rips off his belt with this 38 pistol because a man can run with a 38 pistol on his waist and took off after the bloom.

Speaker 2:          03:55          Here's what he sees in that field. It was, I mean if you look at a picture of this thing, it's this huge globe, 30 feet in diameter. Oh Wow. Paper, White, and then coming down from this globe or these thick 40 foot ropes and at the bottom attached to it is a, is a heavy metal chandelier

Speaker 1:          04:14          with bombs hanging off the bottom and sheriff hide. He sees this thing, runs out into the field, grabs onto the ropes to maybe tie it down, but just as he grabbed that Augusta wind comes by, lifts him up off the ground like he was papered off and so he's dangling from the ropes of this thing. The balloon is above him, the explosives or are below him and it takes him across this canyon and he's holding on just dangling from it, still trying to wrangle it like, like some bucking Bronco. He lands again, he tries to tie it to a juniper Bush or something, but the wind catches it again and goes back over the canyon back to the first time, back to the first sign they started to float around the field. He kept wrestling this balloon for a long time. He's nauseous from being spun around on this balloon.

Speaker 1:          05:05          His Vision's getting blurry, his hands are becoming raw from the rope, but he feels this like sense of duty. He knew that the government wanted one of these balloons, his territory. So he's got to take it down. That's ride. He finally lets himself free fall so he can grab it again. So his weight will jerk the balloon to the ground. Then finally the balloon came down in kind of a little ravine where a sage rush were growing and a root had been exposed on the side of the ravine from a sagebrush and he hooks his arm around this, this route. Then he was able to hold the balloon without being carried into the air here. So we actually captured the thing. Yeah. J Edgar Hoover wrote him a personal letter of thanks. They ended up shipping all of the evidence off to the Aberdeen Military Research Facility where they had gathered all this different evidence from all over the country.

Speaker 1:          05:56          And after looking at this stuff for awhile, they were able to tell that apparently this bomb was not of any particular, uh, American make and match known characteristics of Japanese bombs. So it's Japanese. Yeah, but it's impossible to send a balloon across the Pacific Ocean at this point. I mean, it's never, never been done. I mean, it's basically an intercontinental ballistic missile, so they're trying to figure out where it's coming from. They thought maybe they were being launched from submarines. Maybe they were coming from beaches in North America from saboteurs. There was even speculation at one point that maybe they were coming from Japanese internment camps in North America. Then two days before Christmas, 1944 in Alaska, a native Alaskan trapper tracks went down and it has two sandbags still attached to the bottom most ring, and that turns out to be the key to the mystery sand.

Speaker 1:          06:56          Yeah. Well, just Sam, there's a lot in there. My name is Elisa, Berks Lynne, and I am a forensic geologist. We call the Balisa to help us understand this next part. What happened was the sand from the balloons was sent to Washington DC to some scientists at the US Geological Survey. Right away they discover that there's no coral, so you don't have finding no coral. You know you're talking cold water. Now they look at the diatoms marine [inaudible] microscopic fossils mollusks by compiling all of these different characteristics, put that all together. Where would you find these diatoms, these minerals that you wouldn't find coral though all those different pieces of information all together, the geologists are able to determine that there are two or perhaps three beaches in the world that fit all of these qualifications where they believe this sand could have come from and all of which are on the east coast of Honshu, the largest of Japan's four main islands. You can get that kind of specific from sand. Yup. That kind of specific. Pretty incredible. All right, so they came all the way from these particular beaches on the coast of Japan? Yeah. Six thousands of miles across the Pacific Ocean. And why would the Japanese choose to s to deliver bomb payloads by balloon? But it's a strange choice in particularly after Pearl Harbor, they, we know where, you know they can do planes. Farragut planes. Yeah. Why balloons? Well,

Speaker 2:          08:21          I would can be told history in the making. It grew directly out of the Doolittle raid. Back in April of 1942 United States Navy aircraft carrier haunted deems westward across, represented Jimmy Doolittle and his Raiders took off from an aircraft carrier deep in the Western Pacific and dropped bombs on Tokyo and Yokohama and Kobe and a number of other cities across Japan. Great as the fries raid in the history of aerial warfare. Now, they didn't do a lot of damage physically, but it was such a shock to the Japanese to think that their homeland could be invaded, that these planes could actually fly over the imperial palace. The home of the emperor and do little went over the palace head is you realize that? Yeah. He went all the way downtown in Tokyo. Oh yeah. Right over the city. And so immediately after the Doolittle raid, an order went out, it was just find a way to bomb America.

Speaker 3:          09:17          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          09:21          no, Japan's navy is stretched so thin at this point in the war. There's no way they can pull off something like the do little rate. They didn't have aircraft carriers that could get their planes close enough to the US mainland. But what they did have

Speaker 2:          09:36          was the wind. Today we call this the jet stream. That name didn't come along until after the war. At that point, we barely knew about the jet stream, but prior to and during the war, the Japanese did a extensive research into these wins. Okay, so

Speaker 1:          09:53          in 1924 there's this meteorologist named Watson Burrow Ichi and he goes to the top of a mountain and he releases a bunch of these little paper weather balloons and he discovers

Speaker 2:          10:04          that at about 30,000 feet up, there's this river of fast moving air speeds up to 175 miles an hour carrying anything in its Miss Pollen, insects all the way to North America within days.

Speaker 1:          10:19          And after the Doolittle raid, they thought maybe if we were to release a bunch of balloons in just the right place at just the right time, maybe this jet stream of air could push these balloons across the Pacific Ocean. [inaudible] so this is Tesco Tanaka. She was interviewed in this independent documentary called on-paper wings [inaudible] in 1944 she says she was a teenager when the Japanese military came to her school and basically turned it into a factory. [inaudible]. She and hundreds of other schoolchildren were conscripted to begin making this special kind of paper out of mulberry wood called [inaudible].

Speaker 5:          11:00          Was she handmade? This traditional paper?

Speaker 1:          11:04          This is my host Sheena, who now works at the new Burrito Institute in Japan.

Speaker 5:          11:08          Huge amount of paper was required.

Speaker 1:          11:11          My host says that girls would work 12 hour days making thousands, tens of thousands of these sheets and gluing them together. Why didn't they have adults in the factories? They were all fighting the war or what

Speaker 5:          11:21          young girls have either been good for that boat. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          11:27          the girls had a certain dexterity for the name Burmese, Nimble fingers. I think I read that song somewhere and after they finished producing the balloons and after the balloons were strapped with bombs, they were shipped off to those beaches and just let go. People from the Japanese side watching them take off said they like huge

Speaker 2:          11:53          jellyfish swimming through a pale blue sky. These perfectly silent vehicles. The only sound was the rustling of the paper as they took off

Speaker 3:          12:08          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          12:08          How many were launched from November, 1944 to April, 1945 they launched 9,000 balloons. Wow.

Speaker 3:          12:23          [inaudible] no,

Speaker 2:          12:26          the engineers in Japan who designed this faced a very serious problem. Once they got the balloons up into the jet stream and they were cruising along there floating at speeds from 50 to a hundred miles an hour, but every night temperatures are going to fall to minus 40 centigrade and the fixtures volume of hydrogen inside that envelope is going to contract. The balloon is going to lose altitude drop out of the jet stream and down into the ocean altogether. So to solve this says Ross, they, what they did was this, they took 32 sandbags, hung them on the balloon, and then connected those sandbags to an altimeter set to a preset and minimum such as 30,000 feet in the nighttime. When the balloon loses altitude, the altimeter will engage, trigger a fuse, which cuts off one of those sandbags and drops it into the ocean.

Speaker 2:          13:17          And now the vehicle will reascend back into the jet stream because it's lighter because it's lighter. So these balloons, they're riding the jet stream and then every night they start to descend. But then off would go a sandbag and they'd go back up and whenever they cooled off enough to drop, same thing drop, then rise, drop, then rise over and over 32 times until every sandbag was gone. Once all the sandbags have been dropped, now you have only the bombs remaining and the bombs are held in place with the exact same mechanism as the sandbags. And now by the very same system, the bombs are the last to go. And presumably the balloon is now somewhere over North America.

Speaker 6:          14:02          Okay, I see. So it's a sandbag countdown, 30209208432 one I hope I'm in Oregon. Right.

Speaker 2:          14:14          And when it was in Oregon or wherever the idea was that it would drop its last bomb Floataway in basically self destruct. They, I guess figured it would be, it would be more terrifying to have bombs raining down silently from above with no calling card at all. Then with a Japanese calling card.

Speaker 7:          14:40          Damn, that was the last sandbag is la. Now only the central payload is left.

Speaker 2:          14:44          This is audio from a declassified navy instructional video made about these balloon bombs in 1945

Speaker 7:          14:50          in the advanced. One of units is found.

Speaker 1:          14:52          Do these two things to render at Armas explains to soldiers how to, what to do if they find one of these bombs and how to diffuse the bomb. No, but I think the most interesting thing about the video is this text that's written in huge block letters. Right at the bottom of the screen it says, do not aid the enemy by publishing or broadcasting or discussing information.

Speaker 8:          15:15          Information can be a powerful tool. It can be a powerful tool for good and a powerful tool for evil. This is professor Mike Sweeney and I'm a historian. I've wartime censorship. And he says that immediately after those first balloons landed, there are a few stories that appear in the local newspapers in the far west, stories about a Japanese attack on the mainland of United States time. And Newsweek even picked it up saying, we're not sure what these are, but you know, are these Japanese spies coming in on these balloons? Is this a large scale attack? What is going on? And then

Speaker 1:          15:48          very shortly thereafter, just three days after those time and Newsweek articles, the office of censorship initiated a press blackout. This blackout on news. They sent out memos and telegraphs to all the major wire services, the UPD P in the ins saying, keep any news of these Japanese balloons off the wires and out-of-print any stories about these bombs will have to be approved by the appropriate authority or the U s army if you wish to publish or broadcast news about them. And why would they want to keep this secret? So the government's ideas about why balloon bombs should be censored. In particular, the army's ideas were number one, to avoid panic. These things are instruments of terror, right? You can't be afraid of something you don't know exists. Number two is a avoid helping Japan. It was thought then that if we printed exact coordinates of particular bomb landings that this would help Japan better target the bombs and what are the reporters think about this. They grumbled some times, but they complied. Really? Yup. Everyone in the news industry was as patriotic as the rest of the country. That is the vast majority of journalists supported the war. And of course if you screwed up and you sent out a story that got American lives killed, you can be prosecuted under the espionage act. Furthermore, can you imagine what your listeners would do if you're the radio station identified as killing a hundred American sailors?

Speaker 3:          17:12          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          17:13          So the newspapers and radio stations kept their mouth shut, which meant that most Americans never even heard this was happening. And more importantly, the Japanese weren't really hearing about whether their bombs made it or not. So they probably concluded that it was basically a failed experiment, which largely it was of the 9,000 released virtually none cause any damage. And certainly not any terror

Speaker 3:          17:42          except

Speaker 1:          17:46          for this one balloon that's coming up.

Speaker 9:          17:50          Hi, this is well calling from Northumberland England. Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred peace known foundation, enhancing public understanding of science and technology in the modern world. More information about slow@wwwdotsloan.org

Speaker 10:         18:12          hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab. We continue now with our story from reporters, Peter Link, Stanton and Nick Farago about, uh, the 9,000 or so balloon bombs Japan sent to America in 1944 and 45 that rained down on American soil and created nothing. Really nothing happened, no damage, no terror,

Speaker 6:          18:35          nothing. But then we get to this tiny little town called [inaudible]. To me, there's no place like old Bli. Bli Is this sleepy little logging town at the base of your Heart Mountain in South Central Oregon. A lot of pretty scenery. And Cora Connor, who you just heard was born and raised there. You know everybody in here, they're just like a big family out there in the forties, when Cora was a young girl, there were about 700 people living there. Yeah. But we did all kinds of fun things. We had a fish fry up at dog lake, huge cat fish fry up there. The whole town stayed all night, went back home the next day, and the winner, the canals would freeze over and we to have bonfire in ice skating parties and it was a fun place to live. Tell me about, um, uh, the morning. Was it a Sunday? Let's see what happened.

Speaker 6:          19:27          I am trying to think. Saturday, I think May 5th that's all I can remember. Yup. That was May 5th, May 5th, 1945. I thought it was a beautiful day. The Sun was shining bright and the Reverend Archie Mitchell and his wife Elsie, who was five months pregnant with her first child doing very well at Sunday school. I went to church occasionally up there. They took their Sunday school class out for a picnic. There were five children that went along on that trip, ages 11 to 14 and one of the kids, we called him Dickey. He had a crush on my sister who has little younger than me and they wanted her to come on this picnic. So Nate came by and stopped the pastor and his wife stopped and the kids all piled out. They stopped when they went up. Yeah, trying to talk, convinced my mom to let my sister go or both of us or whatever, but mom didn't want us to go because Saturday was our Chore Day and my day at work, the switchboard, which usually made me pretty angry, but that was my job and she said, no, I'm no way. Well, my sister didn't really want to go because she really wasn't encouraging this relationship too much. Yeah, Dickey. Yeah. No. So Archie and LZ and the five kids get back into the car and they drove up to Gearhart mountain a couple of miles up a logging road. They passed some forest service guys working

Speaker 11:         20:48          on the road. They go a little further to where the road comes near Creek and Archie pulled the car around and parked the kids, jumped out of the car and started running down toward the creek. Elsie who was pregnant, as I mentioned, and she was feeling a bit car sick. She jumped out to get some fresh air and to chase after the kids. While Archie went around to the trunk of the car to get up the fishing poles and the picnic baskets, et cetera. One of the children saw something on the ground, a large canvas, white, gray balloon of some kind spread out on the ground, called her the other children to come have a look. The children and Elsie apparently gathered in a tight circle around the balloon. Archie later reported that while he was getting the picnic basket out of the trunk, his wife called to him, honey, come look at what we found. He turned and just took a few steps toward them and at that moment we'll never know exactly what happened, but apparently one of the children reached down to pick up the device. The bomb detonated.

Speaker 3:          22:03          Yeah.

Speaker 11:         22:03          All five children and Elsie Mitchell were killed instantly. The forest service guys down the road, we're close enough to hear the blast. They come running when they hear the explosion and they see Archie Mitchell has run to the site and his wife's clothes were ablaze and Archie was kneeling over his prostrate wife beating up the fire with his bare hands.

Speaker 3:          22:43          [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         22:43          on our last day in GLI, we went to visit the site where the bomb went off

Speaker 3:          22:48          in the middle of nowhere. It's just a chain, just a little chink fenced off area. It's a little pen and there are these tall pine trees. It's just huge. Cuts in the tree is a shrapnel cuts in the tree. Yeah. Yeah. They still, it hasn't a, has not healed eerie place.

Speaker 11:         23:26          Of course. I didn't know since dwindle what was going on? This is Cora Connor again. At the time she was at her job watching the switchboard when the guy that was working up there for the forest service in Russian and to the telephone office and I mean he was scared, pure white and scared and I thought, my God, what's on what's happening?

Speaker 6:          23:46          And he came in and made the call to Lakefield, the naval base in lake view and about a half an hour later this, you know, big imposing military guy comes in. He was on metals and all and he's full uniform, you know, and he must have made it, it seemed like in a blink of an eye. And I thought, my God, what has happened? And then when he talked over the phone, I knew what was going on. He said they'd had a bomb explode up there with the casualties. And then he talked to me. He said, do you not talk to anybody about anything that you've heard here? Not your mother, not anybody. He says, now you're not to leave this office. By then I was just jelly. I was still terrified. He leaves and the word is is trickling around, spreading around town. They knew something had gone wrong and they gathered at the phone office because the phone office knows everything in the whole valley.

Speaker 6:          24:43          Then they knew, I knew what was going on and that's when it all hit. Pretty soon there was a crowd outside screaming and yelling at me. And, yeah, yeah, yeah. We know. You know what's going on. You better come out and tell us we're coming in there and you're going to tell us what's happened and all your neighbors and things like, yeah, no, you, they're saying and they know. Yeah. Cause blinds is very tiny place. I probably knew every one of them. I was about, you could imagine the state I was in and uh, Mr Passkey Dickey's father Dickey was the boy who had a crush on Cora's sister. I can tell you exactly how he has dressed that day. He had on a red and black checkered hunting shirt and his red hunting cat at the time, all he knew is that his son was missing. He stood out there and they shook his fist and he yelled and he scared me half to death, threatening to come in and all that. He says, you know what's happening? Let us know what's happening. And I couldn't do anything. I sat there all day.

Speaker 6:          25:55          Okay 16 you know, it really, really tore me apart. That was just in a complete fog for days. No, I'd never, never talked too much about it. Nope. Within a day or so, the military told most of the town what actually happened that day and then a short time after that, a big army truck. Well, it was two big army trucks. They stopped right out in front of our house. We wondered what was going on. You know your little town like that. Anything different. Everybody goes to the window and bakers look and here come, okay, this is awfully hard for me. A woman and a little kid jumped out of the back of truck. She was Japanese. They run their way to the, to lake, the Japanese interment camp nearby and she's screaming and crying and praying, please, we need water. We need water. It was hot.

Speaker 6:          26:57          It was really hot that day and they were in a canvas covered truck jammed in there and I grabbed a picture of a bucket or whatever was there in the kitchen, filled it with water and stuttered it out the door. By that time they were throwing rocks at that lady and her kid, people in that town were so terribly upset and they were throwing rocks at her and mom would let me go and I screamed and cried at my mother because she wouldn't let me go. She goes, you can't go out there. They'll throw rocks at you. I won't let you go. And do they stay that pictures in my mind and I have prayed to the Lord to forgive the people that were doing that and try to, I can't accept it. There's no, nothing could make me accept what had happened. I thought that was the most horrible thing in the world. People could do a woman and child. They had nothing to do with the bomb. Nothing to do with the war. Nothing.

Speaker 12:         27:58          Okay.

Speaker 6:          28:03          It does. It's still hard. How can people be that way?

Speaker 12:         28:10          Hmm.

Speaker 6:          28:12          It upset me so horribly bad, but didn't want to talk about it. I couldn't talk for 40 years.

Speaker 12:         28:26          [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         28:33          it's weird, like it's a kind of weird, scary symmetry to this whole thing. Like the Japanese military was trying to create terror, right? Like what they felt after too little and so they wanted to make the situation where like bombs were falling silently from the sky. We couldn't even tell where they were coming from. Almost like the gods were dropping them, but we kept it quiet so nobody panicked except by not saying anything. At least in this one small instance, it created exactly the situation that the Japanese military wanted. I mean not on the scale that they wanted, but like in it's effect, it's like a concentrated version of the thing they're trying to create. Right.

Speaker 6:          29:13          That's the problem. That's not a problem. Five is five is a sacrifice in war. What is it? Five six people? Yeah. There were, there were. There were 125 million people in America then.

Speaker 10:         29:25          Hmm. I think there actually might have been a little bit more. Yeah,

Speaker 6:          29:28          well you can see what it would have been like. Listen to this story. You could see what a room like if, if this story had been well known and had been told from person to person. If everybody was looking

Speaker 1:          29:42          up and wondering where the next strange thing was coming from. Well they wouldn't, there might've been panic but those kids wouldn't have talked on the balloons. That's that's the choice cause they would have known. Yeah. Hey, I'm sorry to jump in here. I just know that we don't have Ross much longer in order to respect your time. Um, separate. Is there any males who worked with Nick and Peter on this, on the story before they kick you out? The only last question I kind of was had on my list is I'm like, why is it that we don't know about this? Like I've never heard of this before. I don't know if Robert, if you've heard this before, like why like why the hell is this not a thing we know. I think it's directly an outgrowth of that censorship policy.

Speaker 11:         30:22          At the end of the war, the war department destroyed all of the evidence. They didn't want these, any evidence of these balloons. I'm just out there in general circulation. Huh? This is one of those footnotes to the war that you know, at the end of the war, just never people, people forgot about something that they didn't know about anyway. Wow. Ross, are there any more out there? That is a very interesting question. It's estimated by the war department that of the 9,000 release, they thought that maybe seven to 10% of the total would have survived the transoceanic crossing and arrived in North America. That's 900 300 are confirmed as having arrived in North America, so that means there are dozens, perhaps hundreds that arrived in North America but were never accounted for in the 10 or 12 years. Immediately after the end of World War Two, a couple dozen of these things were found several in Oregon in 1948 when in Alaska in 1955 one in Idaho in the early 1960s and then the recoveries stop

Speaker 1:          31:34          where the, where they live. Like the one in Oregon, like if you touched them with the blow of them.

Speaker 11:         31:39          Well, some of them were. Now here's the fascinating part. Last October, October of 2014 I kid you not.

Speaker 13:         31:46          Dave was ahead of me and he'd stopped and said, I think I saw, I'm the bomb.

Speaker 11:         31:52          A couple of loggers.

Speaker 13:         31:54          Yeah. My name is Preston Linger. His name's Dave Bridgeman

Speaker 11:         31:56          in Lumby, British Columbia, who are doing some survey work.

Speaker 13:         32:00          You know, this is the middle of nowhere.

Speaker 11:         32:01          Found the remnants of a Japanese balloon that had been on the ground for 70 years.

Speaker 13:         32:07          Definitely work in remote areas and in general, and we don't see much except trees and rock. But, uh, you know, there, there are those odd special days where you, where you see things that no one else gets to see.

Speaker 11:         32:18          This happened just a few months ago. I tell you, if you're hiking, if you're out in the woods in the Pacific northwest, watch where you step.
