00:00:01.291 --> 00:00:03.666
- What digits could replace
the question mark in the

00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:06.645
hundreds place to make
this statement true?

00:00:06.645 --> 00:00:10.777
Four thousand question
mark hundreds 29 rounds

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:14.444
to 5000 if we round to
the nearest thousand.

00:00:15.816 --> 00:00:19.649
So we want a number whose
nearest thousand is 5000.

00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:23.700
It's closer to 5000
than any other thousand.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.603
And what we know about our
number so far is it starts

00:00:26.603 --> 00:00:30.770
with 4000 then we'll fill in
the digit for the hundreds

00:00:31.855 --> 00:00:34.962
and ends with 29.

00:00:34.962 --> 00:00:38.186
So, we want to know what
digits from zero to nine

00:00:38.186 --> 00:00:43.008
can we fill in here so that
this number is closer to 5000

00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:45.008
than any other thousand.

00:00:45.942 --> 00:00:47.949
Well the only other
thousand this could be close

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:51.242
to is 4000 because we're
starting with a four here,

00:00:51.242 --> 00:00:55.193
all of our numbers will
be between 4000 and 5000,

00:00:55.193 --> 00:00:58.607
so let's draw that, let's
show that on a number line.

00:00:58.607 --> 00:01:02.607
Here's a number line that
goes from 4000 to 5000

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:05.920
and then the hundreds here
are marked so this would

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.016
be 4100, 4200, 4300,

00:01:10.016 --> 00:01:14.501
4400, so on all the way to 4900

00:01:14.501 --> 00:01:16.418
and then finally, 5000.

00:01:18.488 --> 00:01:21.628
So if we want to fill in
digits here, then we can

00:01:21.628 --> 00:01:25.183
graph them on our number
line and see what are they

00:01:25.183 --> 00:01:26.433
nearest to.

00:01:26.433 --> 00:01:30.600
Are they nearest to 5000 or
are they nearest to 4000?

00:01:31.661 --> 00:01:36.350
Just, for example, if we
plot a number right here,

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.429
whatever number this point
represents, what is its

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:41.389
nearest thousand?

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:45.498
Well, it is literally nearest
to 5000, so it would round

00:01:45.498 --> 00:01:49.165
to 5000, that would be
its nearest thousand.

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:55.659
But, if for example we had
a point that was somewhere

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.970
like this, this points nearest
thousand would be 4000.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.021
This point would round
down to 4000 because we can

00:02:03.021 --> 00:02:07.699
look and see, it is closer
to 4000 than it is to 5000.

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:08.782
It is nearer.

00:02:10.796 --> 00:02:12.965
So, let's look back now
at our number and try to

00:02:12.965 --> 00:02:15.627
fill in some digits and
see where they land on this

00:02:15.627 --> 00:02:16.627
number line.

00:02:18.352 --> 00:02:20.388
Let's draw in the first
possible digit we could fill

00:02:20.388 --> 00:02:21.971
in here, is a zero.

00:02:23.413 --> 00:02:27.850
So this would be 4000 zero
hundreds 29, well that

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.794
would be between 4000 and
4100, it's greater than

00:02:31.794 --> 00:02:36.257
4000 but not quite all the
way to 4100, so we could

00:02:36.257 --> 00:02:39.818
put that probably somewhere,
estimating a little bit,

00:02:39.818 --> 00:02:44.317
about right here, a little
closer to 4000 than 4100.

00:02:44.317 --> 00:02:48.433
And now looking at this
number, we can see it is much

00:02:48.433 --> 00:02:52.879
closer to 4000, its nearest
thousand is definitely 4000.

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.945
It takes us far longer to get to 5000,

00:02:56.945 --> 00:03:00.944
so zero will not work.

00:03:00.944 --> 00:03:04.389
So, we can take away, it's
not going to be a zero.

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:06.343
And I don't know that we
need to try all 10 numbers,

00:03:06.343 --> 00:03:08.736
what we can do is look down
here, let's look at this

00:03:08.736 --> 00:03:12.454
graph and see which section
of it, which section

00:03:12.454 --> 00:03:16.198
of this number line is closer to 5000.

00:03:16.198 --> 00:03:18.807
And the answer will be if
we find right in the middle,

00:03:18.807 --> 00:03:22.974
here, 4500, anything greater than this

00:03:24.097 --> 00:03:26.198
will round up to 5000.

00:03:26.198 --> 00:03:30.577
From the halfway point
up will round up to 5000.

00:03:30.577 --> 00:03:33.349
So, what points knowing that this

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.722
right here is 4500,

00:03:37.722 --> 00:03:41.825
what numbers or what
digits can we fill in here

00:03:41.825 --> 00:03:46.033
to get a number that's greater than 4500?

00:03:46.033 --> 00:03:48.246
Because anything less than
that's going to round down,

00:03:48.246 --> 00:03:49.746
be closer to 4000.

00:03:51.665 --> 00:03:55.582
And so, we could try,
let's just put a five in.

00:03:56.846 --> 00:04:01.013
4529 would be right after 4500,

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:05.971
somewhere about like this, that is closer,

00:04:05.971 --> 00:04:10.210
just barely but it's closer
to 5000, so five works.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.043
Five is a digit that we could use.

00:04:14.378 --> 00:04:18.646
What about four, if we fill
in a four here, we have

00:04:18.646 --> 00:04:22.827
4400, well that's going
to be just to the left

00:04:22.827 --> 00:04:25.077
of 4500, this line is 4400,

00:04:28.143 --> 00:04:31.236
here's 4500, so that
point will come somewhere

00:04:31.236 --> 00:04:34.144
around her, which just barely

00:04:34.144 --> 00:04:37.187
rounds down to 4000, it's
close to the middle but

00:04:37.187 --> 00:04:41.319
a little bit closer, a
little bit nearer to 4000,

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:44.159
its nearest thousand is 4000.

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:48.578
So, four will not work,
five does work and from here

00:04:48.578 --> 00:04:50.926
I think we can figure out
our solution almost without

00:04:50.926 --> 00:04:52.960
using the number line.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.816
If 4400 was too small, well then

00:04:56.816 --> 00:05:00.651
4300 is definitely too
small and 200 and 100

00:05:00.651 --> 00:05:03.612
and we already saw zero
hundreds was way here,

00:05:03.612 --> 00:05:05.713
way down here which is way too

00:05:05.713 --> 00:05:08.546
small, and now we know 4529 works,

00:05:10.864 --> 00:05:13.773
that's big enough, so
anything bigger will only

00:05:13.773 --> 00:05:15.605
get closer to 5000.

00:05:15.605 --> 00:05:18.452
Anything bigger than 5
int he hundreds place will

00:05:18.452 --> 00:05:22.341
only move us closer,
farther to the right, so any

00:05:22.341 --> 00:05:25.693
digit five or greater
would work here, would

00:05:25.693 --> 00:05:27.110
round up to 5000.

00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:31.395
So the digits that are
five or greater are five,

00:05:31.395 --> 00:05:36.211
and then six, seven, eight and nine.

00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:40.325
Those are the possible digits
that we could fill into

00:05:40.325 --> 00:05:44.905
our hundreds place so that
our number rounds to 5000

00:05:44.905 --> 00:05:46.901
as its nearest thousand.

00:05:46.901 --> 00:05:51.068
The solutions are five,
six, seven, eight and nine.
