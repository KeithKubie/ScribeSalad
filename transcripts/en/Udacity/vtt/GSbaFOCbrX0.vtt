00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.290
Android Wear devices operate in two
main modes, interactive, and ambient.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.310
Your watch face design should
take these modes in account.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.110
When the user moves their wrist
to glance at their watch, or

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.550
if the user touches it,
the screen goes into interactive mode.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.030
Your design can use full color,
with fluid animation,

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.140
along with a background image or
gradient in this mode.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.230
And you can press the side button
to go back into ambient mode, or

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.930
it will time out by itself.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.420
Ambient mode helps
the device conserve power.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.090
Your watch face design needs to include
a separate design for ambient mode.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.040
How similar or
different it is, is up to you.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.290
Your watch face can use some color,
such as that red there,

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.770
on screens that support it.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.840
As long as it's still obvious that
the device is in ambient mode.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.770
In this mode, the screen is
only updated once every minute.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.110
So you should not show the second hands
that we saw moving around earlier.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.800
Your watch face will spend most
of its time in ambient mode, so

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.150
you should thoughtfully design for it.
