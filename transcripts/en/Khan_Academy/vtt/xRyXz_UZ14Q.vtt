00:00:00.707 --> 00:00:03.127
- [Voiceover] Let's now
explain to ourselves,

00:00:03.127 --> 00:00:05.544
I guess you could say, a more formal

00:00:05.544 --> 00:00:09.094
communication of the Integral Test.

00:00:09.727 --> 00:00:11.820
Integral Test.

00:00:12.192 --> 00:00:17.192
So it tells us that if we
assume that we have sum f of x,

00:00:17.376 --> 00:00:21.310
if we have sum f of x that is positive...

00:00:22.143 --> 00:00:25.164
positive, continuous...

00:00:25.643 --> 00:00:27.058
continuous...

00:00:27.058 --> 00:00:30.475
continuous, and decreasing...

00:00:30.475 --> 00:00:32.397
and decreasing...

00:00:32.844 --> 00:00:37.844
and decreasing on some interval, on...

00:00:38.593 --> 00:00:43.593
So starting at k, and including
k, all the way to infinity.

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:47.342
Then we can make one of two statements.

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:52.377
We could say either that
if the improper integral

00:00:52.377 --> 00:00:57.377
from k to infinity of f
of x dx is convergent,

00:00:59.293 --> 00:01:03.677
is convergent, then...

00:01:04.627 --> 00:01:09.627
then the sum, the infinite
series from n is equal to k

00:01:11.809 --> 00:01:16.809
to infinity of f of n, is also convergent.

00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:23.685
Is also convergent...

00:01:24.433 --> 00:01:25.609
Convergent.

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:27.352
And this is actually the
case that we saw when

00:01:27.352 --> 00:01:28.802
we looked at one over n squared,

00:01:28.802 --> 00:01:30.317
but I'll look at that in a second.

00:01:30.317 --> 00:01:32.233
But the second claim that we could make,

00:01:32.233 --> 00:01:34.884
or the second deduction that we might be

00:01:34.884 --> 00:01:36.833
able to make using the Integral Test,

00:01:36.833 --> 00:01:38.900
is if that's the other way around.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.583
That if the integral from k to infinity,

00:01:42.583 --> 00:01:47.583
the improper integral of
f of x dx, is divergent,

00:01:48.094 --> 00:01:50.695
divergent, then the same thing is true for

00:01:50.695 --> 00:01:53.078
the corresponding infinite series.

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:57.296
Then this infinite series right over here

00:01:57.296 --> 00:01:59.496
is also going to be...

00:01:59.496 --> 00:02:04.395
is also divergent.

00:02:04.478 --> 00:02:06.463
And as I already mentioned,
in the last video

00:02:06.463 --> 00:02:08.245
we already saw this in the case of

00:02:08.245 --> 00:02:10.912
f of x is equal to one over x squared.

00:02:10.912 --> 00:02:15.912
We saw that since the
integral from one to infinity

00:02:17.094 --> 00:02:22.094
of one over x squared,
over one over x squared dx,

00:02:23.795 --> 00:02:26.972
is convergent, in fact, it equals one.

00:02:26.972 --> 00:02:28.189
It equals one.

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:33.189
Because of that, we were
able to say that the sum

00:02:33.404 --> 00:02:38.404
from n equals the sum
from n is equal to one

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:44.139
to infinity of one over n
squared, is also convergent.

00:02:48.555 --> 00:02:51.870
Also convergent.

00:02:52.155 --> 00:02:54.727
And now we can see an example
where we go the other way.

00:02:55.087 --> 00:02:58.321
For example, we know that this integral...

00:02:58.321 --> 00:03:00.422
Let me write the integral down.

00:03:00.422 --> 00:03:02.170
Let's start with this integral.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.272
From one to infinity,
not of f of x is equal

00:03:05.272 --> 00:03:06.903
to one over x squared, but let's say that

00:03:06.903 --> 00:03:08.780
f of x is equal to one over x.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.056
Actually let me just write that down.

00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:15.056
Let's just start with f of
x is equal to one over x.

00:03:15.138 --> 00:03:17.787
It definitely meets our
conditions that it is positive,

00:03:17.787 --> 00:03:19.555
and let's say we were going to consider it

00:03:19.555 --> 00:03:21.105
over the interval...

00:03:21.105 --> 00:03:26.105
over the interval from one to infinity.

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:29.522
So it meets this first constraint.

00:03:29.522 --> 00:03:33.104
Over this interval,
one over x is positive,

00:03:33.104 --> 00:03:36.272
it is continuous, and it is decreasing.

00:03:36.272 --> 00:03:39.355
As x increases, f of x decreases.

00:03:39.355 --> 00:03:41.971
So the Integral Test should apply.

00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:45.105
So let's see what the improper integral

00:03:45.105 --> 00:03:47.889
from one to infinity of this would be.

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:49.859
So if we take...

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:54.097
If we go from one to
infinity of one over x,

00:03:54.635 --> 00:03:59.635
of one over x dx, this is equal to...

00:04:01.493 --> 00:04:04.359
We could write this as the limit

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:08.327
as t approaches infinity
of the definite integral

00:04:08.327 --> 00:04:12.860
from one to t, of one over x dx,

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.860
which is equal to the limit,
as t approaches infinity, of,

00:04:19.194 --> 00:04:22.494
take the antiderivative, is going to be of

00:04:22.494 --> 00:04:24.542
the natural log of x,

00:04:24.542 --> 00:04:29.123
the natural log of x going from one to t.

00:04:29.785 --> 00:04:31.213
One to t, we could do the...

00:04:31.213 --> 00:04:33.244
Well, it's really the absolute value of x,

00:04:33.244 --> 00:04:34.993
but we're dealing with positive x's here

00:04:34.993 --> 00:04:37.026
so it's just going to
be the natural log of x,

00:04:37.026 --> 00:04:41.193
which is going to be the
limit as t approaches

00:04:41.193 --> 00:04:45.659
infinity of the natural log of t,

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:46.943
or I could even say the natural log of the

00:04:46.943 --> 00:04:48.543
absolute value of t, which is going to be

00:04:48.543 --> 00:04:51.495
the natural log of t,
because it's positive t's,

00:04:51.495 --> 00:04:54.109
minus the natural log of one.

00:04:54.109 --> 00:04:56.909
Minus the natural log of
the absolute value of one.

00:04:57.647 --> 00:05:00.008
The natural log of one
is zero, so it's going

00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:01.458
to be the natural log of t.

00:05:01.458 --> 00:05:03.110
The limit of that approaches infinity.

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.508
But the limit as that approaches infinity

00:05:04.508 --> 00:05:05.543
is just going to be unbounded,

00:05:05.543 --> 00:05:06.875
this is going to go to infinity.

00:05:06.875 --> 00:05:10.186
This right over here is divergent.

00:05:10.494 --> 00:05:14.378
So this right over here is divergent.

00:05:15.326 --> 00:05:18.243
So this is divergent.

00:05:19.292 --> 00:05:22.841
And because this is
divergent, we can then say,

00:05:22.841 --> 00:05:25.359
we can then say, by the Integral Test,

00:05:25.359 --> 00:05:27.891
we can then say the Integral Test...

00:05:27.891 --> 00:05:30.409
Once again, our function
over this interval,

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:32.525
positive, continuous, decreasing.

00:05:32.525 --> 00:05:34.642
We saw that this improper
integral right over here

00:05:34.642 --> 00:05:36.707
is divergent, and then by the second point

00:05:36.707 --> 00:05:39.224
of the Integral Test we can say therefore,

00:05:39.224 --> 00:05:41.126
and I haven't rigorously
proved it yet, but hopefully

00:05:41.126 --> 00:05:42.875
I gave you a good intuitive justification

00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:45.077
in the previous video,
that the integral...

00:05:45.077 --> 00:05:49.689
that the infinite series
from n equals one to infinity

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:53.588
of one over n, which
is the harmonic series,

00:05:53.588 --> 00:05:58.413
that this is also, this is also...

00:05:59.339 --> 00:06:02.007
this is also divergent.

00:06:02.207 --> 00:06:04.021
So we've already shown
that the harmonic series

00:06:04.021 --> 00:06:06.805
is divergent using that
very beautiful, elegant

00:06:06.805 --> 00:06:10.871
proof by Oresme, I think
I'm probably mispronouncing

00:06:10.871 --> 00:06:13.739
his name, though used the
comparison test, but just

00:06:13.739 --> 00:06:16.605
like this we have used the Integral Test

00:06:16.605 --> 00:06:19.288
to show that it is also divergent.

00:06:19.288 --> 00:06:21.238
And once again, let's
remember what the whole

00:06:21.238 --> 00:06:23.419
motivation of the Integral Test is.

00:06:23.604 --> 00:06:26.672
Let me draw f of x is equal to one over x.

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:30.089
So f of x is equal to one
over x would look like...

00:06:30.488 --> 00:06:32.671
Do my best attempt here.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.648
So let's say that's one, two, three,

00:06:37.064 --> 00:06:41.417
and that is one, two...

00:06:41.924 --> 00:06:45.588
And so let's see, when
x is one f of x is one,

00:06:45.588 --> 00:06:49.321
when x is two f of x is 1/2 or 1/3.

00:06:49.321 --> 00:06:51.872
If it's 1/2 here, it
will be two over here.

00:06:51.872 --> 00:06:53.477
So it looks like this.

00:06:53.477 --> 00:06:55.372
So this is f of x is equal to one over n,

00:06:55.372 --> 00:06:56.971
and once again we see that
then over the interval

00:06:56.971 --> 00:06:59.604
we care about, from one to
infinity, it's definitely

00:06:59.604 --> 00:07:04.604
positive, continuous, and decreasing.

00:07:05.671 --> 00:07:08.822
And if we look at this
sum right over here,

00:07:08.822 --> 00:07:11.821
we could view this sum as...

00:07:13.238 --> 00:07:15.037
Let's do that, let me write it down.

00:07:15.037 --> 00:07:16.645
So the sum...

00:07:17.355 --> 00:07:21.656
The sum from n equals one
to infinity of one over n,

00:07:21.656 --> 00:07:26.656
is equal to one plus 1/2
plus 1/3, and of course

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.289
we keep going on and on and on and on.

00:07:32.289 --> 00:07:34.721
In this case, since we want
to show it's divergent,

00:07:34.721 --> 00:07:37.138
we could say, "Hey, look,
this is an overestimate of,

00:07:37.138 --> 00:07:39.338
"of this area here."

00:07:39.338 --> 00:07:40.221
Let me be clear.

00:07:40.221 --> 00:07:42.015
So we have this area.

00:07:42.354 --> 00:07:45.332
We have this area in green,

00:07:45.671 --> 00:07:49.019
which is what the improper
integral is denoting.

00:07:49.019 --> 00:07:50.740
So that right over there
is the improper integral

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:55.740
from one to infinity of one over x dx.

00:07:57.905 --> 00:07:58.954
Now you could view this as

00:07:58.954 --> 00:08:01.322
an overestimate of that area.

00:08:01.322 --> 00:08:03.118
So this first...

00:08:03.288 --> 00:08:04.554
This one right over here, you could say

00:08:04.554 --> 00:08:08.854
that this is this one
height times one width,

00:08:09.223 --> 00:08:11.621
so that's that block right over there,

00:08:11.621 --> 00:08:13.249
that's the area of that...

00:08:13.249 --> 00:08:15.189
is going to be equal to one.

00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:18.388
Then this over here,
1/2, you could view that

00:08:18.388 --> 00:08:20.706
as the area of the next block,

00:08:20.706 --> 00:08:23.047
of the next block.

00:08:23.754 --> 00:08:26.422
So you could kind of view this
as a left-sided Riemann sum,

00:08:26.422 --> 00:08:28.255
I guess is one way to think about it.

00:08:28.255 --> 00:08:30.789
And so this is going to be 1/2...

00:08:30.789 --> 00:08:32.489
Yeah, left-sided Riemann sum.

00:08:32.489 --> 00:08:34.239
So this is going to be 1/2,

00:08:34.239 --> 00:08:37.706
and then the 1/3 is going to be this one,

00:08:37.706 --> 00:08:39.371
it's going to be this one.

00:08:39.371 --> 00:08:40.706
I noticed they're all...

00:08:40.706 --> 00:08:43.338
The actual area we care
about, the improper integral,

00:08:43.338 --> 00:08:46.122
it's all contained in these blocks.

00:08:46.122 --> 00:08:48.138
So this is going to be an over...

00:08:48.138 --> 00:08:50.721
is going to be larger than
this, but we've already

00:08:50.721 --> 00:08:53.289
seen that this is
unbounded towards infinity.

00:08:53.289 --> 00:08:54.822
This is divergent.

00:08:54.822 --> 00:08:56.353
So if this is larger than this,

00:08:56.353 --> 00:08:58.572
and this is divergent,
this goes to infinity,

00:08:58.572 --> 00:09:00.706
then this must also go to infinity.

00:09:00.706 --> 00:09:03.622
So that's exactly where the
Integral Test is coming from.
