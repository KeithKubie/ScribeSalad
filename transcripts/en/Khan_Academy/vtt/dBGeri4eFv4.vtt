00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:05.840
I scream, you scream, we
all scream for ice cream.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.400
The following table
describes the relationship

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.670
between the number of
scoops in an ice cream cone,

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.380
represented by x.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.410
So this is the number of
scoops in an ice cream cone.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.470
So that's x, and the price of
the cone, represented by y.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.450
I'll do y in purple.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.080
Write the equation that
describes this relationship.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.660
So let's see.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.229
When x is 0, y is 0.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:35.320
When x is 1, y is 1 and 3/4.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.320
So let me write this as
an improper fraction,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.990
just so I can
visualize it better.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:44.050
So this is 4/4 plus 3/4,
which is equal to 7/4.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.946
When x is 2, y is 3 and 1/2.

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:48.320
So let me see if
I can write this

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.694
in a little bit
of a clearer way.

00:00:49.694 --> 00:00:53.460
So 2 times 3 is 6,
plus 1 is 7, so this

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.530
is 7/2-- which is the
same thing as 14 over 4.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.600
And then here we
have, when x is 3,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.390
y is equal to-- so 5 and
1/4-- if I would write it

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.850
as an improper fraction-- 4
times 5 is 20, plus 1 is 21.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.010
So this is equal to 21 over 4.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.080
And then finally, if we were to
write this as something over 4,

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.320
this is equal to 28 over 4.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.610
7 is the same
thing as 28 over 4.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.340
So you see that this is a
proportional relationship.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.910
The ratio between y and x.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.120
So let me write this.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:34.470
The ratio between y and
x is always equal to 7/4.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.240
Notice here, y is 7/4 of x.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.030
7/4-- it's a bigger number.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.410
Or you could say 1 and 3/4 of x.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.600
So let me make that clear.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.960
So y over x is equal to 7/4.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.910
Or, we can say that
y is always 7/4 of x.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.500
We can multiply both
sides by x, if we like.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.810
So if we multiply
both sides by x,

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:08.400
we get y is equal
to 7/4 times x.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.610
And you see it here.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.010
When x is 4, 7/4 times 4 is 7.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.820
When x is 0, y is 0.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.400
When x is 3, 7/4
times 3 is 21 over 4,

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.700
which is the same
thing as 5 and 1/4.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.360
So there we go.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.550
And let me input
it, just to make

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.674
sure we can input it right.

00:02:28.674 --> 00:02:30.535
So y is equal to 7/4 x.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:43.000
We would just write y
is equal to 7/4 times x.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.380
And let's check our answer.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.860
And we got it right.
