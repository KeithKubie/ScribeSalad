investments that seem uncorrelated can
 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.360
investments that seem uncorrelated can
be correlated simply because we're

the world is much more correlated than

the world is much more correlated than
 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.090
the world is much more correlated than
we give credit to and so we see more of

more correlated so I think one lesson we

more correlated so I think one lesson we
 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.610
more correlated so I think one lesson we
have to learn is that there's a lot more

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620
have to learn is that there's a lot more
 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.890
have to learn is that there's a lot more
risk than we're giving credit to a lot
