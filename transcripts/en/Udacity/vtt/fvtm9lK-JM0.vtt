00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.470
I really liked that last demo where we turned circles into squares.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.520
It really shows the awesome power of style and

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.150
also represents that everything on a webpage is actually a box.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.560
But why is it so important to really understand that concept?

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.220
You might be thinking to yourself, hey, I'm not a square.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.499
I'm actually a really cool person and I don't like to think about boxes.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.260
But actually thinking of the things in terms of

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.610
boxes makes your life as a front-end web developer a lot easier.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.500
Take an example website here.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.820
We have many different elements, images, text, a header.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.960
And by thinking of things in terms of boxes we can actually easily rearrange

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.130
things if we decide to give users a different experience.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.250
Say, for example, we don't want to keep the text up here.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.940
We want more pictures of puppies because users like more pictures and

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.000
might not want to read the text.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.010
So we'll take away the text here, move some cute pictures of puppies up here,

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.100
and then put the text along the bottom.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.580
Now readers can read the text if they'd like to or

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.480
just look at cute pictures of puppies.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.890
There's also a grid in the background which serves to make sure that

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.210
everything is properly aligned.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.919
But we'll talk more about that in lesson two.
