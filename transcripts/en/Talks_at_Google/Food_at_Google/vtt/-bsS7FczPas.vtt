00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.439
&gt;&gt; Female Interviewer: Thanks everyone for
coming.

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.799
It is such a pleasure to
have Chef Andrew Carmellini here at Google

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:06.799
New York.

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:07.799
Welcome.

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:08.799
&gt;&gt; Andrew: Good to be here.

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:10.050
Thanks for having me.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.350
&gt;&gt; Female Interviewer: I'm having this very
James Lipton moment right now.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.560
"So, tell me about your 12-year-old performance
in

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.560
Annie."

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.179
So Chef Carmellini has trained throughout
the

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:24.440
great restaurants of Italy and New York from
Michelin

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:30.589
two star San Dominico in Emilia-Romagna to
Lespinasse to Le Cirque in New York.

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:34.149
He spent six years
at c Café Boulud winning a James Beard Award

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:37.250
for rising star
chef of the year, and was added to Food and

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.829
Wine magazine's Best
Chef roster.

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.860
In his last month at Café Boulud, he was
awarded best chef New York City by the James

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.800
Beard
Foundation.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.940
He then went onto open A Voce in 2006 earning
a three star review from the New York Times.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.700
His first
Michelin star and a James Beard Award nomination

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.679
for Best Restaurant in
2007.

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:02.550
And in 2008 he published his first book of
recipes

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.290
and stories with his wife, Urban Italian.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.540
And his second
cookbook, American Flavor, just came out this

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.960
week -- which, hopefully, you all
got in the audience.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.080
Chef Carmellini also owns two
highly-celebrated restaurants.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.340
One of my personal
favorites in New York, Locanda Verde, that's

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.369
just my plug to get a table, in the Greenwich
Hotel in Tribeca.

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:22.369
&gt;&gt;Andrew: It works.

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:23.369
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: It does work.

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.369
I know.

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:25.369
It's all up here.

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.790
And that has two
stars from the New York Times and was also

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.369
nominated by
the James Beard Foundation for Best New Restaurant

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:31.369
in
2009.

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:32.429
&gt;&gt; Andrew: They like me.

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:33.429
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: They do.

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:34.640
What's with that foundation?

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.590
And also the Dutch in Soho and he's opening
a second

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.159
location of the Dutch in just a couple of
weeks.

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:41.159
.
&gt;&gt; Andrew: Next month.

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.479
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Next month so there you go.

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.110
And he's very busy.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.470
And we're excited
that you made time to come here to Google,

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.470
so thank you
for that.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.470
&gt;&gt; Andrew: Thanks for having me.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.470
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: It's a pleasure.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.610
And you obviously have this
incredible laundry list of accomplishments.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.430
So I thought
we'd just go over them one by one.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.909
&gt;&gt; Andrew: No, that's sounds awful.

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.750
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Like I say, how did you get

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.909
into cooking?

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.070
&gt;&gt; Andrew: You know I was either going to
be a rock star or I was

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.509
going to be a chef.

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.050
You know, in the late -- I've
started cooking when just kind of this is

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.110
a little bit
cliché but I just started cooking with my

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.280
mom, my grandmother.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.510
I really liked it.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.129
In the 70s when I grew up, you know,
there was that whole health food thing going

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:23.129
on.

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.450
You
know, there was carob and wheat germ and my

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.390
mom was
kind of into that.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.670
They didn't want to eat process
foods.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.470
They just liked good food.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.140
We had a garden in
the back.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.860
This was long before the word foodie existed.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.610
There wasn't that hyper restaurant culture,
chef culture

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.310
that exists today, which is great.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.110
They just wanted good food.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:53.129
And they
were big influences on me to get me into cooking.

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.330
I was
also a musician.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.019
I was either going to go to a school of music
or I was going to go to cooking school.

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.629
And I'm
not sure -- still to this day -- why I went

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.120
to cooking
school besides I'm actually glad I didn't

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.990
go to music
school back then because it was 1989.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.020
It was pre-Grunge
and hair was very long still.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.549
[Interviewer giggles] And I'm glad I didn't
go

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.260
that route, [chuckles] because who knows what
would happen today.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.680
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Was there one dish that inspired
your love of food in

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.950
maybe the carob and the kale.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:21.950
&gt;&gt; No.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:22.950
No carob.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.490
[laughter] You know, I used to like baking
too

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.470
when I was a kid just because I had a crazy
sweet tooth.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.620
And still today.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.650
That's why I'm blessed with two amazing
pastry chefs at both restaurants.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.680
That's mostly for my
own satisfaction.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.200
But you know, I just really liked
cherry pie.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.470
[chuckles] That was like you know I grew up
in the

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.780
Midwest and it's kind of like that iconic.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.720
You know it's
just something very satisfying about it.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.950
That's why
Dutch that restaurant was built just for pie.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.090
At the
time no one was doing pies anymore.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.969
And so, that was a
big inspiration behind it.

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:07.260
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: So what was your inspiration
for the book -- for the

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.260
new book?

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.849
&gt;&gt; Andrew: You know the book it's not a restaurant
cookbook like

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.879
Urban Italian my first cook book.

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:19.090
I have 500 plus cook
books around the world.

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.350
They're not chef cookbooks even
though I'm a chef.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.600
My wife Gwen Hyman wrote the book
Urban Italian with me.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:33.760
That process for us is in our New York
City apartment kitchen, she is on her laptop

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.410
sitting next
to me and I am in the kitchen and we make

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.020
every single
recipe together.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:46.690
And, since she's not a chef, she needs
to measure things and she doesn't have that

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.780
kind of
instinct to just kind of throw something together.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.550
So
she is making me -- she wants to make sure

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.070
that anyone
can make that.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.920
Or when you make it or I make it or
someone else makes it it's going to work.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.050
So that's kind
of both books really -- they're not restaurant

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.740
cookbooks,
but they tell a story of what's influenced

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.610
me over the
years or just what kind of gets me cooking

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:11.610
really.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.420
And
so, you know American flavor really is that

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.230
kind of
journey of being American chef.

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:22.260
It's a little bit like I
think chefs born in America are kind of afraid

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.690
to use
that word like I'm American chef.

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.930
It's a little bit
of -- I don't know it's not flattering in

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:29.930
some ways or I
think.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:30.930
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Why do you think that.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:31.930
&gt;&gt;Andrew: I don't know.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.860
I just think that American cooking --
we're not blessed with thousand years of history

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.510
like
France or China in that term.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:46.930
And so American cooking --
I think American cooking now -- the modern

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:52.480
kind of look
at it -- it's a combination of all this kind

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.690
of
root-inspired cooking.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.470
It's kind of like what your
grandmother was cooking, what my grandmother

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.000
was cooking
but not mixed.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.400
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: [chuckling] Probably not what
my grandmother was cooking.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.890
&gt;&gt; Andrew: What was that actually?

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.790
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: She wasn't doing a lot of
the cooking probably.

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:06.790
That's part of it.

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.420
I think her daughter-in-law including
my mother were probably doing it.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:15.070
It was Indian stuff but in India
so not in America.

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.640
&gt;&gt;Andrew: But still that influence with your
cooking at home

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.640
that's what?

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.970
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: It's Italian food.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:21.970
But I'm Indian.

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.550
I know, it
doesn't make any sense.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.570
&gt;&gt;Andrew: My grandmother was Italian, but
she.

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:26.630
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Made Indian food?

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.440
That would be weird.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.550
&gt;&gt;Andrew: That would be really strange.

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.750
They were in Miami in
the 30s, 40s and 50s and Miami back then was

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.250
a southern
town.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.150
It was kind of like Mobile, Alabama more than
it

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:43.480
is kind of the Miami today.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:48.080
And so, they would -- you
know, she was Italian, but she eventually

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.570
was cooking up
until she passed away on New Year's Eve she

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.360
would cook
beans and black-eyed peas and she would cook

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.360
biscuits and
she would make pies.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.770
And so, you know, we have that kind
of -- both those things going on at the same

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:03.770
time.

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.640
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Yeah, my mother would make
Indian food with oregano

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.190
which is not a traditional Indian spice.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:10.190
&gt;&gt; Andrew: Interesting.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.190
Like dahl with oregano.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.760
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: They didn't get all the spices
here.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.389
&gt;&gt; Andrew: It's very fusion.

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:18.030
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: She was fusion before fusion
was fusion.

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:20.479
&gt;&gt; Andrew: She's a really trend setter.

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:23.330
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Yeah, she was a foodie back
then.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.970
[chuckles] And so, about the
book, what's your favorite recipe in the book

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.250
or do you
have a favorite recipe.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.900
&gt;&gt; Andrew: Kind of like the menus at both
restaurants, I like to

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.170
have something for everybody.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:37.610
And so, it kind of just
depends what you're in the mood for really.

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:40.230
You know, so
it could be something like there's a lot of

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:42.971
vegetables
inside the book, but there's also what I would

00:07:42.971 --> 00:07:46.530
say is
like a ridiculous over the top American dish

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:52.210
which is --
it's a barbecued meatloaf that has macaroni

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.120
and cheese
stuffed inside it [laughter].

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.800
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: That sounds awesome.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.480
&gt;&gt; Andrew: Which is like.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.710
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: That's so wrong, it's right.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:02.490
&gt;&gt; Andrew: It's one of those dishes that's
like so wrong it's

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:03.490
right.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:11.530
So I have -- you know, there's a dish of organic
red quinoa with wild rice and pecans and some

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.680
other stuff
and then there's also.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.310
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Whiskey I believe is in there.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:16.310
&gt;&gt; Andrew: Whiskey.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:20.910
It's healthy and not healthy at the same
time because it's all about balance.

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:23.410
But I don't know --
the meatloaf thing is fun because it's kind

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:25.340
of a cool
thing you can totally do at home and then

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:28.260
bring it to the table
and cut it and people are going to be like,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:29.260
"Whoa!"

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:30.560
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: "What's happening?"

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.860
So what's the technique?

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:35.880
You
know, you just kind of make the macaroni then

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.880
you roll it
into kind of like log and then put it in the

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.880
freezer and
then you make your meatloaf and then you take

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.280
out the
frozen log and you kind of wrap it around

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.280
it.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.770
You bake
it you glaze it with this homemade barbecue

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:50.800
sauce and it
has some other stuff in it too, but it works

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.570
out with the
temperature of the macaroni and cheese just

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.900
oozes out perfectly as
the meatloaf is cooked.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.040
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: That sounds so good; I'm really
hungry.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.476
I know I should not have skipped breakfast
this morning.

00:08:59.476 --> 00:09:01.390
&gt;&gt; Andrew: It's kind of like molecular gastronomy
with no

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:02.390
chemicals.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.140
It's just about temperature.

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:05.670
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: That's awesome.

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.950
And so, obviously we're here in New
York.

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:10.040
And you mentioned your tiny New York kitchen
which

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.580
many of us share that challenge.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.670
What do you recommend
from the book is easy enough to make in a

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:16.890
tiny New York
kitchen?

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.750
Can you make meatloaf stuffed with macaroni
and

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:20.750
cheese?

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:26.691
&gt;&gt; Andrew: Again, I made everything in my
kitchen and so I tried

00:09:26.691 --> 00:09:29.090
to like maybe -- I remember with Urban Italian,
my first

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:32.210
book, I'm fortunate enough at the restaurant
that I don't

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:33.510
have to do dishes anymore.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:36.110
When I first started in the
restaurant business, I was definitely washing

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:37.110
dishes.

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:39.080
And
you have to remember that when you're a chef

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.350
for a lot of
years it was always -- I was cooking at home

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:44.020
and it was
15 pots.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.030
You want to do this you want to do that.

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.770
We
try to make with the home versions of everything,

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:50.950
I try
to do everything with one or two pots or one

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:53.450
pot and a
pan you know so you don't have to -- that's

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:55.890
the worst you
make the whole dinner and you have to deal

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:56.890
with the clean
up afterwards.

00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:58.440
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: That's what my husband's for
&gt;&gt;Andrew: Clean up as you go.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.440
It's really
important.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.790
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Clean up as you go.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:04.320
Or have a husband who will do dishes who's
so

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.580
particular about cleanliness.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.279
&gt;&gt; Andrew: You're very gendered about these
things.

00:10:08.279 --> 00:10:12.860
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: That's true, because I do
the cooking and he does the

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:13.860
cleaning.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:14.860
It's a good division of labor.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.520
Sometimes cooking involves ordering
&gt;&gt; Andrew: That's good.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.680
I would take that role if you cooked for
me every night.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:19.780
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Or order.

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:22.900
I can call up with the best of them.

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.040
Tell
us more about the restaurants speaking about

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.040
those.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.890
Locanda Verde and The Dutch; how did they
come about?

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:33.140
--
&gt;&gt; Andrew: Locanda Verde is -- originally

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:36.770
I was going to open up
a little pasta bar on Tenth Street between

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:37.770
Second and
Third.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:43.440
And Bob DeNiro has the Greenwich Hotel and
they were having some problems there with

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.110
the restaurant there And I started talking
to them

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:48.860
about doing something there and that's kind
of how

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.130
Locanda came to be.

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:52.730
And I just wanted like Locanda Verde
and the Dutch really.

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:58.480
Because for a long time I did
really high-end French and Italian food uptown

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.900
and it was
great and I like that to be able to give people

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.460
that
experience but I always lived downtown but

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:05.880
I was always
working uptown.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:11.980
And I just -- you know, for me in my
ripe old age of 35 when I did Locanda Verde,

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:14.900
I just
wanted restaurant, a corner New York City

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.800
restaurant you
could stop by any time of day.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:22.480
And that's kind of the
spirit at both places, but one's Italian and

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.480
one's American.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.300
And just that sense you can come at noon and
get a bowl

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.110
of pasta and a glass of wine and split or
you can come on

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:33.090
Saturday night with your wife or friends or
whoever and

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:36.510
go crazy or you can just stop by at 6 with
clients.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:39.710
I
like that idea restaurants have -- it's like

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:43.900
a tie to
the community and just becomes all day kind

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:49.550
of, you know,
just serves like a lot of different needs.

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:53.310
And it brings
like the crazy energy to it also.

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:55.322
You know, just kind of
get an eclectic group of people dining there

00:11:55.322 --> 00:11:58.291
for
different reasons and that's what I wanted

00:11:58.291 --> 00:11:59.291
to do at both
restaurants.

00:11:59.291 --> 00:12:01.310
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Do you think you could not
have done that same

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:03.690
restaurant in a different location like what
was special

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:05.070
about -- apart from.

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:08.380
&gt;&gt; Andrew: It's funny because one restaurant
the Dutch is in Soho

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:11.080
and Locanda Verde is in Tribeca.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.980
Tribeca is so different
from Soho.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.670
And I didn't even realize that.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.410
Didn't even
notice the difference really until I opened

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:20.980
up the Dutch and
you just saw the people that were walking

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:26.480
by and just saw
kind of the cycle and the rhythm of the neighborhood.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.930
And that, you know, it's neighborhood but
it's also

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:30.930
destination.

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:33.350
So like to have both those things going on.

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:34.670
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Right.

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:35.670
Cool.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:38.580
So couple of off topic questions.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.500
What
do you eat when no one else is looking.

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.150
&gt;&gt; Andrew: What do I eat when no one else
is looking.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:45.380
I am not
embarrassed by any foods.

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:48.910
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: It's got to be something.

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:54.660
Something that gives you
pleasure something you don't want to tell

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:55.660
your chef
friends.

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:56.660
&gt;&gt; Andrew: What do I eat when I'm not cooking?

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:57.660
I don't know.

00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.630
I would happily eat like a Twix bar right
now if you wanted.

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:01.280
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Like a challenge?

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.320
[laughter] Does anyone have one?

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.709
I don't
think we have them.

00:13:04.709 --> 00:13:05.709
&gt;&gt; Andrew: I don't know.

00:13:05.709 --> 00:13:12.660
I think even if you're working at a
three star Michelin restaurant or you're cooking,

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:16.500
you
know, whatever you're doing really I think

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.380
you have you
know I think there's no -- it doesn't matter

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:22.670
if it's a Twix
bar or it's a chocolate soufflé For me it's

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:23.670
the same
really.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:25.630
It's the same emotional response.

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:28.220
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: So what do you eat from the
walk in?

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.050
&gt;&gt; Andrew: What do I eat from the walk in?

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:33.250
These days I try to
eat an apple once in awhile.

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:34.870
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Very healthy.

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:40.430
&gt;&gt; Andrew: Just try to --. Eat an apple and
stay away from -- you know, because

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:45.010
I'll probably have a slice of steak upstairs,
I'll have a piece of this and I'll eat

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:46.010
an apple.

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:47.430
Winesaps are very good right now.

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:48.649
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: What are they?

00:13:48.649 --> 00:13:50.600
&gt;&gt; Andrew: Winesap
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: What's a wine sap?

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.160
&gt;&gt; Andrew: It's a variety of apple.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.160
Comes from upstate.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.380
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Oh, it's a type of apple.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.779
&gt;&gt; Andrew: Very good eating apples.

00:13:56.779 --> 00:13:58.910
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: As opposed to what apples?

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:02.230
&gt;&gt; Andrew: Cooking apple -- as one you can
just pick up or you

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:04.400
can bake, theres a big difference.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.580
Apples are not apples.

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:06.580
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Ah.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:07.820
Did not know that.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.610
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Just complicated my trip to

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:12.420
the farmer's market
measurably.

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.980
Is there any culinary mountain that you want
to climb?

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:20.110
Like something you've always wanted to do?

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:23.050
&gt;&gt;Andrew: Culinary mountain.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:26.820
You know, I'd like to to do a
French restaurant one day.

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:31.290
You know, French food kind of
like -- American food -- the idea of American

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:35.300
food it's
just like especially French because it's a

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.040
little bit out
of fashion a little bit.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:42.960
And I kind of want -- I love, I
mean France it's such an amazing culinary

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.460
journey really
in all the different regions.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:49.480
And I kind of want to
revisit that and do that one day.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.310
Probably not on a
super high-end level.

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:52.750
Probably approachable level.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:56.000
But I
want to kind of get back to the country that

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.770
first kind
of inspired me with cooking which is France

00:14:58.770 --> 00:14:59.770
at first even
before Italy.

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:02.580
And so, yeah I would like to do something
French.

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.640
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: All right.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:14.370
Are there any unexpected influences in
your cuisine?

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:19.770
&gt;&gt; Andrew: You know for example there's an
Indian technique

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:24.360
called tarka where you kind of will heat up
ghee and then

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.500
kind of bloom spices in it.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:31.250
Sometimes mustard seeds and
it's interesting to take like that technique

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:36.230
and apply it
to a sauce from someone else or some other

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:38.870
kind of
country but it's not fusion necessarily.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:44.460
So for example,
if you were to make like a 'sauce mutard'

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:47.430
or a mustard
sauce typical with fish or meat.

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:51.220
In French cooking,
you -- the way to approach that really is,

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:55.690
you take that
technique of tarka and taking mustard seeds

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:58.530
and kind of
blooming them a little bit and making them

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:00.510
pop.

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:02.260
And
then, doing that with maybe a French sauce.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.560
So you're
not really again it's not fusion in the sense

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:09.460
you're
mixing curry powder with mustard with, you

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.540
know, some
kind of French preparation.

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.930
It's more like taking this
particular technique and applying to a sauce

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:16.630
and making
it even better even though it comes from another

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:20.130
culture
which is kind of interesting.

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:24.110
For example, like the
French sauce you might have your glace de

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:27.930
viande and you might add
some reduced cream to it and finish it with

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:29.470
Dijon
mustard.

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:36.940
Here you can take the tarka and make those
mustard seeds pop in the hot ghee.

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.950
We might not use hot
ghee for that sauce.

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:42.200
We might just use butter.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.630
And then add
your glace de viande . So I look at food that

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:46.630
way sometimes.

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:52.440
In
the balance sweet and sour in Thai food or

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.440
Vietnamese
food.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.920
You can apply to Italian food.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:58.810
Not that you can
use fish sauce in Italian food but just balsamic

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:02.010
vinegar
and olive oil.

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:04.680
I kind of look for parallels that way.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:07.589
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: What challenges you?

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:09.010
&gt;&gt; Andrew: People.

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:10.900
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Like right now?

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:16.240
&gt;&gt; Andrew: Actually, a person made me happy
today because in an

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:21.050
e-mail exchange last year with someone that
had a very

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:25.720
nice meal at Locanda Verde and was telling
me about limoncello

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.689
that someone in their family made.

00:17:27.689 --> 00:17:31.740
A nice gentleman
brought me some of that homemade limoncello.

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:33.431
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Is that that?

00:17:33.431 --> 00:17:34.431
&gt;&gt;Andrew: Yes, this is that.

00:17:34.431 --> 00:17:35.431
This is not Orangina; this is limoncello.

00:17:35.431 --> 00:17:36.889
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: You're just going to pound
it?

00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:40.480
&gt;&gt; Andrew: I can tell you from experience
that it's not a good

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.480
idea.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.150
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: It's not a good idea; I can
tell you from experience too.[giggles]

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:46.990
&gt;&gt; Andrew: There was a experience in Umbria
once that it's not a good idea

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:48.530
to chug Limoncello.

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:49.870
It's for sipping purposes only.

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:51.490
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: So you just have that in case.

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:53.950
&gt;&gt; Andrew: This is my prop if things get crazy.

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:54.950
&gt;&gt; [laughter].

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:58.650
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Just bust it open if this
isn't going well.

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:02.180
So you
already told me you'd be a rock star.

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:03.180
What would you
play?

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:06.060
&gt;&gt; Andrew: Well, that's changed since 1988.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:10.720
If I would have a
band today?

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.800
You know, I have a studio at my house.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.880
I
have everything from vintage keyboards to

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:23.290
MPC players and vinyl --. I
started as a guitarist but I fallen in love

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:27.620
with hip hop and
trip hops and beats.

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:29.820
That's where I spend all my money
and time.

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:32.630
]&gt;&gt; Interviewer: So you'd be like a rap star?

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:34.330
[laughter[
&gt;&gt; Andrew: No, absolutely not.

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:36.039
I'm an awful, awful, awful rapper.

00:18:36.039 --> 00:18:38.500
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: I'm totally going to make
you do one at the end.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.510
&gt;&gt; Andrew: I'm a very bad rapper.

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:43.720
I'm all about the music part.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.830
Don't ask me to rhyme . I can
barely spell.

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:48.860
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: I'm not I'm going to left
you off the hook only

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:51.390
because I want that table.

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:53.750
What is the best meal you've
ever had?

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:59.860
&gt;&gt; Andrew: You know, the best meal I've ever
had -- you know,

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:02.640
it's such a tough question, because I've had
a lot of

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.640
great meals.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.970
I'm very fortunate to have a lot of great
meals.

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:10.710
I think the best meal you ever have it's on
different planes really.

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:14.490
You can say I went to ElBulli four
times and those were the.

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:15.490
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: You did?

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:17.480
You went to ElBulli
&gt;&gt; Andrew: I can say I went to elbulli four

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:22.470
times but I did not.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:24.440
I went three times.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:28.990
[laughter] .
&gt;&gt; Andrew: I went actually in the early 90s

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:32.380
kind of before he was
really known before he was using chemicals

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:33.380
and stuff like
that.

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:37.420
So I've seen kind of the evolution over time.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:39.100
You
know, that's a meal as performance art and

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:41.200
kind of a meal
as discovery.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:49.490
And that's different than like having like
an awesome outdoor barbecue or that's can

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:53.300
be a great meal
because you're with awesome people and this

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:58.100
whole other
layer of the dining experience.

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:02.360
Which is interesting, too,
because over in Italy for example you can

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:06.299
go to Michelin
starred restaurant you can have alta cocina

00:20:06.299 --> 00:20:07.419
experience.

00:20:07.419 --> 00:20:08.419
And it's great.

00:20:08.419 --> 00:20:12.960
It may not be the best meal you've had in
your life that might have been some spaghetti

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:18.290
and clams you had in
trattoria somewhere.

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:20.420
That's what it is for me.

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:23.770
I love
great food and I, both in the high and both

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:27.290
in the low,
that 26Twix bar and that chocolate soufflé

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:30.490
But really I
think a great meal is made up of -- it's so

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:34.240
many other
things.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:37.299
So can I pinpoint one, like, great meal?

00:20:37.299 --> 00:20:38.880
Umm.

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.250
I
don't know that's a tough one.

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:45.720
That could be breakfast
sushi at the Tokyo fish market at 6 o'clock

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:48.380
in the
morning or that could have been that spaghetti

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:54.530
and clams
at Batabota in Ligoria.

00:20:54.530 --> 00:21:00.190
It's-- I'm fortunate to have that
experience a lot.

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:05.320
It also can be I don't know that bowl
of oatmeal with your -- maybe not oatmeal.

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:08.630
[laughter] I'm sorry, I
take that back.

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:10.549
That was completely off.

00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:13.790
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: So what do you think of the
whole molecular

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:15.450
gastronomy trend.

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:18.650
Your food is so much more like rustic.

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:23.040
I
think of it as rustic almost like home cooking

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.970
but
obviously elevated but there's something very

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:27.539
approachable I guess about it.

00:21:27.539 --> 00:21:31.100
&gt;&gt; Andrew: You know, I had bring up ElBulli
that's one of the stories in

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.100
American flavor.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:38.679
I, in 1996 I was working at France and
after a year I took three months off and just

00:21:38.679 --> 00:21:39.980
traveled.

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:43.280
And a couple chefs said go down to Spain check
this guy

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.580
out, check this guy out, and I went.

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:52.140
I went by myself and
I was the only person there for lunch.

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:55.070
And you know, I
was 25.

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:56.960
I didn't really know what I was getting into.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.600
I
thought I was going to have paella and pan

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:06.030
con tomate all this kind of
classic kettle and dishes and I sat down and

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:11.410
we had 20 amuse-bouche
and there was all this stuff going on.

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:12.559
Interviewer: Forty courses later --
Andrew: And it was

00:22:12.559 --> 00:22:14.080
like a 35 course lunch.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:21.220
And it wasn't -- it was cooking
I never seen anything like it before.

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:24.780
And so, I asked
can I see the chef.

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:27.910
In my mind for some reason I thought
it was going to be a couple -- because I was

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:30.190
the only
customer I thought it would be just a couple

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:32.549
of guys in
the kitchen hanging out.

00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:35.761
And the glass doors open there was 40 people
back there.

00:22:35.761 --> 00:22:36.761
There were sculptures
inside.

00:22:36.761 --> 00:22:41.450
The first thing I noticed there were no ovens
inside the kitchen.

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:44.830
And I was like, "What is this
place?"

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:48.320
And so, I met Ferran and he was lovely.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:51.130
And I
said, "Well, I'm not doing anything for the

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:53.350
rest of the
summer can I just stay here and work?"

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:55.350
He said, "I have
too many people here.

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:58.410
I'll tell you what, come back for lunch.

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:02.550
I could even I couldn't even afford
the the gas to get back to Rosas.

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:03.929
And at that point.

00:23:03.929 --> 00:23:08.190
He's like no no please come for lunch with
my guest.

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:11.559
I took
him up on it and I slept in the car and in

00:23:11.559 --> 00:23:14.700
the morning I
took swim and put on my clothes from the day

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:19.500
before and
went for lunch and he had put a table in the

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.570
kitchen for
two people.

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:27.299
And he was the second person and another 40
courses completely different from the day

00:23:27.299 --> 00:23:28.299
before came out.

00:23:28.299 --> 00:23:29.299
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: That's amazing.

00:23:29.299 --> 00:23:32.049
&gt;&gt;Andrew: And he sat down and ate every one
with me and we just

00:23:32.049 --> 00:23:34.820
talked about food and what he was trying to
do.

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:38.559
This is
kind of before he really had that international

00:23:38.559 --> 00:23:41.580
fame and
started working with the chemicals and trying

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:45.160
to change
the perception of the diner and change that

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.910
kind of
experience because he was complaining to me

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:53.250
he was tired
of going to France, you know, going to the

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:55.060
great
restaurants and almost every menu was the

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:57.470
same.

00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:59.519
So I had
that experience very early on but I didn't

00:23:59.519 --> 00:24:03.130
-- it didn't
speak to me as something I wanted to replicate

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:06.799
or come
back because really the soul there was kind

00:24:06.799 --> 00:24:09.760
of a certain
soul that I really liked about cooking and

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.460
serving that
type of food.

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:16.240
Even though it was amazing and I
appreciated it and I went back many times

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.240
after that.

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.470
I know the techniques and learned them.

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:23.750
It's not something I wanted to copy if that
makes sense.

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:29.200
I appreciate that as a diner and as a chef
but it's not something I wanted to replicate.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.470
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: That's an extraordinary story.

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:34.830
&gt;&gt; Andrew: Yeah, it's a cool story.

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:36.010
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Pretty cool.

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:38.410
&gt;&gt; Andrew; I wish I took a picture of it because
I didn't.

00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:39.410
It
was pre-iPhone.

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:42.780
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: So talking about that, what
do you think about people

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:45.100
who do that in your restaurants like taking
photographs

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.530
of the food and tweeting it and yelping.

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:51.910
&gt;&gt; Andrew: I think at the beginning it kind
of really bugged me

00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:53.290
out a little bit.

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:54.990
Completely honest.

00:24:54.990 --> 00:25:00.420
I if I sat next to
you at your desk and said, "What are you doing?

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:02.140
What's
that e-mail you just sent?"

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:06.750
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: People do that everyday and
poke at me.

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:10.540
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Andrew: Over the years become more comfortable

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:11.540
with it.

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:15.299
And
it was especially when you first open, too,

00:25:15.299 --> 00:25:20.820
because
restaurants are so -- it's such a crazy experience.

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:24.809
Anticipate and blessed with people wanting
to come and

00:25:24.809 --> 00:25:27.540
experience that in the beginning, but it's
also maddening

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:29.280
for me.

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.740
It's not like if you're a musician and you
make

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:36.310
your perfect song and you put it on a CD or
you put it in

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:38.670
MP3 and you can play it ten years later and
it's the

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:39.670
same.

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:42.910
There are so many other factors.

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:44.730
The fish came
late.

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:46.780
The temperature in the dining room is two
degrees

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:47.780
more.

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:49.830
I'm in a bad mood; you're in a bad mood.

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:55.880
There's
always these other factors involved.

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:59.690
So, you know, that
kind of like immediate reaction to the thing

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:01.040
pictures
thing.

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:04.450
It would bug me out in the beginning when
like that culture

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:05.450
first happened.

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:08.210
Now I don't care, go ahead and take
pictures.

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:10.140
We'll take a picture together in front of
the

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:11.320
meat ball.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.320
Hey.

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:16.480
[laughter] So I think it's part of the social
experience now.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:19.400
It's part of-- I mean, it's the same.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:20.650
I
love street art.

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:27.910
So if I go by and want to take a
picture of this tag or that illustration,

00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:28.910
it's the same.

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:29.910
So I've given it up.

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:32.630
I've given up the hate.

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:36.290
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: So what do you think about

00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:40.990
-- like, how has technology,
if at all, affected the way you cook or maybe

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:43.540
the way you
wrote your book start with that.

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:48.570
&gt;&gt;Andrew: You know, I'm always -- I've always
kind of been

00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:53.169
inspired kind of what your grandparents were
cooking more

00:26:53.169 --> 00:26:55.590
than what the great chefs were cooking.

00:26:55.590 --> 00:27:01.260
Food for me
was -- especially it's -- with travel especially

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:06.320
is, I
like the anthropology and discovery of food

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.110
and how it
relates to culture a little bit.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:14.179
And so, I've found
inspiration in old Fanny Farmer cookbooks

00:27:14.179 --> 00:27:20.570
and you know
just translating older cook books to see kind

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:25.100
of how
things were done before so, you know, because

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:26.280
some things
get forgotten.

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:33.690
You know, there's one technique where you
take -- I love pickled cherries.

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:37.630
It's a thing we use a
lot in the summer time or in June when sour

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:40.590
cherries
come in, we'll pickle hundreds of pounds of

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:43.730
sour cherries
and we'll use them for sauces and for garnishes.

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:49.350
This is a
really cool technique where you save all the

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:53.530
cherry pits
and you roast them in the oven and then crush

00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:57.570
them and
then pickle the cherries with the cherry pits.

00:27:57.570 --> 00:27:59.059
You put
them in a cloth.

00:27:59.059 --> 00:28:02.410
Because the cherry pits have kind of an
almond flavor to them.

00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:06.870
It give kind of this natural almond essence
to the cherries.

00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:08.520
It's a really
primitive technique.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:12.669
You're taking the inside of this
food and then roasting it and crushing it

00:28:12.669 --> 00:28:18.059
and then pickling inside it as
opposed to using technology to transform the

00:28:18.059 --> 00:28:19.860
cherry into
something else.

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:24.970
That kind of -- I know that's
fascinating to me because it's not extracting.

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:27.549
It's
very elemental in a way.

00:28:27.549 --> 00:28:30.869
I like that kind of -- that
approach to it.

00:28:30.869 --> 00:28:34.009
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: So what's next for you as
a chef?

00:28:34.009 --> 00:28:35.250
&gt;&gt; Andrew: What's next for me as a chef.

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:36.250
I don't know.

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:37.251
We're doing the book.

00:28:37.251 --> 00:28:39.600
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Apart from the restaurant
opening and the book you're

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.600
busy.

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:46.690
&gt;&gt; Andrew: You know, it's constantly evolving
and because the

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:50.280
restaurant -- it's a very organic thing, a
very living

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.280
thing.

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:55.740
You know, the next thing it's just next we're
going to change some more fall menu items

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:56.740
next week.

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:58.610
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Don't take that ricotta off
the menu.

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:01.880
I will hunt you down
and find you.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:05.750
&gt;&gt; Andrew: The simplest dish we ever did before.

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:10.130
One of the
simplest and it's the most popular thing we

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:11.130
ever created.

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:12.130
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Have you guys had this.

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:13.130
Go now.

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:15.030
You must leave the
office right now.

00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:16.030
I give you permission.

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:19.440
I have no
authority to do this, but you must go have

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.440
it.

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.440
It's
amazing.

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.810
It's the most popular thing
&gt;&gt; Andrew: That's answer example of something

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:28.940
that can be really
so simple but so soul-satisfying and it's

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:30.390
really about
the ingredients.

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:32.080
We got the sheep milk ricotta.

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.840
Because most
ricotta is made from buffalo milk -- I mean

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:40.561
cow milk, which is delicious
The sheep milk has more tang to it.

00:29:40.561 --> 00:29:43.799
It comes from
Sardinia.

00:29:43.799 --> 00:29:46.590
The peanut brothers.

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:52.309
It's like 400,000 sheep
of which I think I use 200,000 sheep because

00:29:52.309 --> 00:29:53.680
we sell so
much of it.

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.730
But we buy everything they import because
we

00:29:56.730 --> 00:29:57.890
go through so much of it.

00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:01.260
So it's just highlighting that
in an amazing way.

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:02.740
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: It's incredibly delicious.

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:04.010
I dream about it.

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:08.150
[chuckles]I know
it's not normal but it's really delicious.

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:09.150
How are we
doing on time?

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:10.250
So I want to make sure to leave time.

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:13.490
So
we'll just do a few more questions before

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:14.490
we wrap up.

00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:16.130
So
if I came to your house for dinner what would

00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:17.390
you make.

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:19.559
&gt;&gt; Andrew: Invited or not invited.

00:30:19.559 --> 00:30:21.080
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Either way.

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.510
I'm getting your address after.

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:28.929
&gt;&gt; Andrew: The last guest I had at my house
was Wylie Dufresne

00:30:28.929 --> 00:30:30.840
He's a chef at wd~50.

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:34.770
He's a neighbor of mine and a friend.

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:39.610
He
came to my house and his wife brought cookies

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:43.299
and I
ordered Motorino pizza.

00:30:43.299 --> 00:30:45.320
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: That will do.

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:46.320
&gt;&gt; Andrew: It was.

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.450
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Cookies from Mrs. Dufresne.

00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:52.030
&gt;&gt; Andrew: That was the last meal that was
served at my house to

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:53.030
a guest.

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:56.279
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Sounds like what's served
at my house, not gonna lie.

00:30:56.279 --> 00:30:59.299
&gt;&gt; Andrew: You know it's the great thing about
being in New York.

00:30:59.299 --> 00:31:04.390
You know the -- it's you can get so many great
things

00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:07.419
like so easily and you can run out to Queens
and get Thai

00:31:07.419 --> 00:31:11.140
food or you can go to Flushing and go to Golden
Mall or

00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:15.110
you can run up and have a 5 course French
meal if you

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:16.110
want.

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:18.460
There's so much access to, you know, that
-- if

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:22.660
I'm cooking at home though, my 'go to' is
two things.

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:27.409
It's
pasta with tomato sauce or it's like a roast

00:31:27.409 --> 00:31:29.110
chicken and
a salad.

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:30.670
Big huge salad and a roast chicken.

00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:33.950
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Sounds interesting because
that seems to influence the two restaurants.

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:37.960
Locanda is your pasta with tomato sauce
restaurant and roast chicken at the Dutch.

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:42.669
&gt;&gt; Andrew: It's so simple.

00:31:42.669 --> 00:31:46.669
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: So, what would you recommend
-- what is your favorite

00:31:46.669 --> 00:31:49.809
restaurant that everyone should know about?

00:31:49.809 --> 00:31:51.940
In New York
since we're in New York.

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:53.929
&gt;&gt; Andrew: Again, it's one of those questions,
because there's so

00:31:53.929 --> 00:31:56.400
many different levels of, you know.

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.940
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: One that people wouldn't necessarily
know about a

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:01.340
little hidden gem that we're all going to
turn up to on

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:02.340
Saturday.

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:04.211
&gt;&gt; Andrew: It goes back to that technology
question, what

00:32:04.211 --> 00:32:06.370
restaurant haven't you heard about.

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:08.850
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: That's probably true.

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:13.450
&gt;&gt; Andrew: As soon as something is discovered.

00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:16.250
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Somebody's tweeting about
it.

00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:18.270
&gt;&gt; Andrew: Somebody's tweeting about it.

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:23.230
It's great at the same
time it's -- what is that place?

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:24.230
Maybe we'll create it.

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:26.489
Maybe we'll go out to like, you know, I don't
know.

00:32:26.489 --> 00:32:27.690
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: And we won't tell anybody.

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:28.690
&gt;&gt; Andrew: We'll go out to Midway.

00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:29.840
We won't tell anybody.

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.100
It'll
just be me and you.

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:35.909
We'll have spaghetti and roast
chicken every night.

00:32:35.909 --> 00:32:37.710
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: That sounds amazing.

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:40.350
It has been a very successful
interview from my perspective.

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:44.190
Okay, I'm going to do my
James Lipton moment because I'm feeling very

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:46.070
"Inside the Actor's Studio"
right here.

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:51.960
So a little word association finish the
sentence sort of thing before we open it up

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.500
for
questions.

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:57.390
Italy is --
&gt;&gt; Andrew: Complicated.

00:32:57.390 --> 00:33:05.090
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Junk food is&gt;&gt; Andrew: Appropriate
when necessary [laughter] .

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:15.090
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Your favorite thing about
New York is&gt;&gt; Andrew: The food.

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:16.960
Yeah.

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:20.840
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Best thing about bacon is
.

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:22.940
&gt;&gt; Andrew: Tasty.

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:27.870
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: A food trend I like is&gt;&gt; Andrew:
A food trend I like.

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:30.220
Ice cream trucks.

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:35.770
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: A food trend I hate is
&gt;&gt; Andrew: Hamburgers.

00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:40.679
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: You don't like hamburgers.

00:33:40.679 --> 00:33:43.270
&gt;&gt; Andrew: I love hamburgers.

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:44.270
[chuckling]
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Hmm.

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:45.270
Okay.

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:48.480
Food trucks are
&gt;&gt; Andrew: Good some places, bad other places.

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:51.409
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Reality chef competitions
are...

00:33:51.409 --> 00:33:52.409
.

00:33:52.409 --> 00:33:53.409
&gt;&gt; Andrew: Dreadful.

00:33:53.409 --> 00:33:56.750
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: The most surprising thing
about Google to me is

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:59.789
&gt;&gt; Andrew: That it exists.

00:33:59.789 --> 00:34:02.179
[laughter] .
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: We're not really here.

00:34:02.179 --> 00:34:04.179
It's all smoke and mirrors.

00:34:04.179 --> 00:34:05.179
Thank you so much.

00:34:05.179 --> 00:34:10.589
I'm going to open it up for questions
if anyone has any.

00:34:10.589 --> 00:34:11.649
[Applause].

00:34:11.649 --> 00:34:17.389
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: You need to go to the mic
so, please.

00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:19.329
&gt;&gt; Andrew:Wow.

00:34:19.329 --> 00:34:20.329
I didn't notice that before.

00:34:20.329 --> 00:34:22.359
&gt;&gt; Female#1: So, two questions actually.

00:34:22.359 --> 00:34:26.950
First is, I'm going to the
Dutch for the first time on Friday.

00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:27.950
What should I order?

00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:30.359
What do I have to order do you think?

00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:34.079
And the second is; oh you can answer that
one first

00:34:34.079 --> 00:34:36.200
&gt;&gt; Andrew: You know, if you haven't had them
yet, the little

00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:40.389
oyster sandwiches are kind of tasty.

00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:45.030
I highly suggest a
beer with them.

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:50.609
And you know, I'm really, really digging
the the smoked chicken stroganoff right now

00:34:50.609 --> 00:34:53.329
which
stroganoff you don't really hear that word

00:34:53.329 --> 00:34:54.329
very much
anymore.

00:34:54.329 --> 00:34:57.809
&gt;&gt;Female #1: I do; I'm from Minnesota
&gt;&gt;Andrew: It is available at the Dutch right

00:34:57.809 --> 00:34:58.809
now.

00:34:58.809 --> 00:34:59.950
&gt;&gt; Female #1: Nice.

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:01.819
And then how do you make your roast chicken.

00:35:01.819 --> 00:35:05.440
&gt;&gt; Andrew: The roast chicken -- how do -- at
the restaurant how

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.440
do we make it?

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.940
&gt;&gt; Female #1: How do you make it at home.

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:15.380
&gt;&gt; Andrew: The roast chicken at home is very,
very simple.

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:19.809
You
take a half stick of French butter and you

00:35:19.809 --> 00:35:24.789
put it in the
cavity with maldon sea salt and cracked pepper.

00:35:24.789 --> 00:35:29.910
Half a
garlic head cut in half, little bit of thyme,

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:33.910
salt and
pepper on the outside and that is it.

00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:34.910
I don't even tie

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:35.910
it.

00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:36.910
That whole trussed chicken thing.

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:39.369
At home, --at the
restaurants , different story -- at home don't

00:35:39.369 --> 00:35:40.440
even tie it.

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:45.190
Just put it
inside and then for an hour go watch TV or

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:46.190
do something
else.

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:49.489
&gt;&gt; Female #1: Do you salt and pepper it and
let and leave it sit or

00:35:49.489 --> 00:35:50.680
you just put it on?

00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:51.680
&gt;&gt; Andrew: No.

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:54.839
And if you want to make it really great the
simple thing to do for roast chicken to make

00:35:54.839 --> 00:35:58.339
it really, really
crispy is put it in the refrigerator the night

00:35:58.339 --> 00:36:03.130
before and
don't cover it so the outside gets nice and

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:04.130
dry.

00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:06.880
&gt;&gt; Female #1: Butter on the inside.

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:11.260
&gt;&gt; Andrew: I don't do temperature or anything
like that just at

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:14.739
home it's just again that old technique of
just picking

00:36:14.739 --> 00:36:16.920
it up and then when the juices are clear and
it doesn't

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:20.859
have the little blood specks in it, it's good
to go.

00:36:20.859 --> 00:36:21.859
Yeah.

00:36:21.859 --> 00:36:24.160
&gt;&gt; Female #1: Nice.

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:26.640
&gt;&gt; Female #2: Yeah.

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:30.339
I was wondering, you know, so much of a
restaurant in New York is the ambiance.

00:36:30.339 --> 00:36:33.310
How involved are
you in the decorations of the restaurant and

00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:36.749
the plating
how does that whole process work.

00:36:36.749 --> 00:36:42.220
&gt;&gt; Andrew: We have two great designers at
both restaurants.

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:45.469
Probably I micromanage too much with my partners
on how

00:36:45.469 --> 00:36:46.469
that gets done.

00:36:46.469 --> 00:36:51.910
I know at both restaurants the art
that's on the wall, the photographs, the kind

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:56.900
of random
object that's here and there I bought myself.

00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:59.589
I know
over at the Dutch I probably started like

00:36:59.589 --> 00:37:02.059
two years ago
just kind of collecting things because we

00:37:02.059 --> 00:37:05.739
had this idea
of what we wanted to do exactly.

00:37:05.739 --> 00:37:09.109
So it's
combination of some Internet finds a trip

00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:14.079
to up state
here and there, just kind of, you know, Brooklyn

00:37:14.079 --> 00:37:16.059
Flea and
Chelsea Market.

00:37:16.059 --> 00:37:23.469
Just kind of like to help tell a
story -- because it's the corner restaurant.

00:37:23.469 --> 00:37:25.480
Both are
corner restaurants, I wanted to have that

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:28.010
sense of warmth
a little bit.

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:33.049
You have something that's kind of a little
bit funny and then something that's kind of

00:37:33.049 --> 00:37:35.529
a nod to the
neighborhood and something that's a nod to

00:37:35.529 --> 00:37:36.529
the cuisine.

00:37:36.529 --> 00:37:37.529
I

00:37:37.529 --> 00:37:42.279
just put all that together in a random type
of way to

00:37:42.279 --> 00:37:45.239
help tell the story of the place which most
people never

00:37:45.239 --> 00:37:46.239
notice really.

00:37:46.239 --> 00:37:49.979
It just kind of helps tell the story
really.

00:37:49.979 --> 00:37:51.130
&gt;&gt;Female #3: Hi.

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:52.279
How are you?

00:37:52.279 --> 00:37:54.359
&gt;&gt; Andrew: How are you doing?

00:37:54.359 --> 00:37:55.920
&gt;&gt; Female #3: Good.

00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:01.349
I was wondering, after listening to your story
about your experience at ElBulli, spending

00:38:01.349 --> 00:38:04.829
the entire day
in the kitchen, learning, talking about food

00:38:04.829 --> 00:38:08.910
if you could
have a similar experience today with anyone

00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:11.489
who would you
spend a day the kitchen with learning and

00:38:11.489 --> 00:38:13.329
collaborating with.

00:38:13.329 --> 00:38:22.720
&gt;&gt; Andrew: You know, I think I'd love to go
to -- I don't know if

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:25.410
it necessarily would be a chef.

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:29.589
I'd love to go to Japan
and fish, I think, is what the next thing

00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:31.289
I'd like to do.

00:38:31.289 --> 00:38:35.309
I want to get on a -- I want to see what fishing
is in

00:38:35.309 --> 00:38:36.309
Japan.

00:38:36.309 --> 00:38:44.079
Because seeing -- Japan, it's such an amazing
place to eat and I think I'd like to go on

00:38:44.079 --> 00:38:47.369
a boat and
catch some octopus with like a Japanese -- and

00:38:47.369 --> 00:38:48.369
I have
that connection.

00:38:48.369 --> 00:38:50.000
I've established the connection.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.210
They're in a town called Atami and it's -- the
brother of

00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:58.349
a cute Japanese girl that cuts my hair.

00:38:58.349 --> 00:39:04.170
[laughter]And I am going
to -- next time I go to Japan maybe the end

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:07.200
of next year
I am going octopus fishing with her brother.

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:10.940
[laughter] I'd like to
find out where things come from and what their

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:11.940
process
is.

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:13.269
&gt;&gt; Female #4: Hi.

00:39:13.269 --> 00:39:14.719
How are you.

00:39:14.719 --> 00:39:16.069
I have three questions.

00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:18.450
&gt;&gt; Andrew: We'll charge you extra.

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:21.329
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Female #4: My first is what's your favorite

00:39:21.329 --> 00:39:22.700
pizza place in New
York.

00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:24.249
&gt;&gt; Andrew: Favorite pizza.

00:39:24.249 --> 00:39:27.160
You know, pizza is funny.

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:29.539
Pizza --
people have a lot of love and a lot of hate

00:39:29.539 --> 00:39:30.710
for pizza.

00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:33.819
It's all about the pizza they grew up with
and the pizza

00:39:33.819 --> 00:39:35.890
in their neighborhood.

00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:39.339
I like Motorino . I like that
style pie.

00:39:39.339 --> 00:39:41.890
Keste is good, also.

00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:47.799
But if I want to get a
slice up by Columbia, La Familia is fine because

00:39:47.799 --> 00:39:49.789
it's a
slice joint.

00:39:49.789 --> 00:39:51.549
That's a New York phenomenon.

00:39:51.549 --> 00:39:55.839
So I, I'll
enjoy one of those, too.

00:39:55.839 --> 00:39:57.740
But there's no excuse for bad
pizza.

00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:00.950
[audience chuckles] There's absolutely no
excuse for that.

00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:01.950
So
Motorino.

00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:03.229
I like that Neapolitan style.

00:40:03.229 --> 00:40:04.759
I really like.

00:40:04.759 --> 00:40:09.239
&gt;&gt; Female #4: Question No. 2 -- what's your
favorite ingredient to

00:40:09.239 --> 00:40:13.900
use and how do you feel about flavored oils
and vinegars.

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:18.499
&gt;&gt; Andrew: Favorite ingredient to use probably
tomatoes just in

00:40:18.499 --> 00:40:19.499
general.

00:40:19.499 --> 00:40:22.300
So much you can do with that and sweet and
sour

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:27.979
and sauce bases and many cuisines.

00:40:27.979 --> 00:40:33.069
Flavored oils,
flavored vinegars not a big fan.

00:40:33.069 --> 00:40:38.180
Vinegar is -- good
vinegar there's no replacing good vinegar.

00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:41.339
Even like red
wine vinegar to have a good quality like aged

00:40:41.339 --> 00:40:43.410
French
vinegar usually.

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:46.380
We were making our own vinegar for
awhile which was kind of like a interesting

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:51.640
experiment
that led to lots of mold and sometimes flies.

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:55.180
[laughter] But
sometimes those results -- actually cider

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:59.420
vinegar is
really easy to make at home.

00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:00.569
It's really easy to make at
home.

00:41:00.569 --> 00:41:03.910
If you get a small barrel and some cider you
can

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:05.849
have some good results with that.

00:41:05.849 --> 00:41:09.410
Flavored oils.

00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:11.979
There's like chemicals involved and it's not.

00:41:11.979 --> 00:41:15.640
You can
get better results just combining those two

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:16.849
ingredients
by themselves.

00:41:16.849 --> 00:41:17.960
&gt;&gt; Female #4: Right.

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:22.089
And in terms of marinating red meat, some
chefs don't really believe in that.

00:41:22.089 --> 00:41:26.739
Some will just do it
marinate it for hours some will just throw

00:41:26.739 --> 00:41:27.739
it on the
grill.

00:41:27.739 --> 00:41:29.220
How do you feel about that.

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:35.579
&gt;&gt;Andrew: It depends what the
application is really if you're going to -- like,

00:41:35.579 --> 00:41:37.410
in the
book, in American flavor, we have -- there's

00:41:37.410 --> 00:41:42.720
a rib recipe
that you put the spices all over the ribs

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:45.749
and then you
put it in the fridge for six hours.

00:41:45.749 --> 00:41:49.339
That is a certain
application because it's the way we're going

00:41:49.339 --> 00:41:51.469
to cook it
afterwards.

00:41:51.469 --> 00:41:52.760
If you're going to -- it just depends.

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.170
Depends on the cut, too.

00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:56.559
&gt;&gt; Male: What if it's a 16 ounce rib eye.

00:41:56.559 --> 00:42:01.029
I ask because I've heard both sides.

00:42:01.029 --> 00:42:04.289
&gt;&gt; Andrew: 16 ounce rib eye?

00:42:04.289 --> 00:42:07.270
You know, again, I wouldn't
marinate it.

00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:10.819
If you have a great -- if you have a great
piece of meat like that.

00:42:10.819 --> 00:42:15.450
I don't know, you went to
somewhere and sourced something that's really

00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:18.829
great, I'd
rather like it to be beefy.

00:42:18.829 --> 00:42:24.309
At the restaurant, at the
Dutch, I just feel like if I want to open

00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:27.670
up an American
restaurant we had to make it would be pretentious

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:30.980
of me
not to make the best steak we could.

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:34.630
So we spend a lot
of time trying to source from a particular

00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:41.559
farm and we
were dry aging for 28 days and we're doing

00:42:41.559 --> 00:42:43.160
this technique
called re-aging.

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:49.430
Because you dry age the whole piece of meat
and

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:51.690
then you cut your steaks, you trim it up and
then you cut

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:52.690
your steaks.

00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:58.930
We cut the steaks and we're aging the
steaks individually again afterwards.

00:42:58.930 --> 00:43:03.400
So there's more dry age
flavor on them.

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:04.890
It's just salt and pepper.

00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:08.400
So it's kind
of about the natural minerality of the steaks

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:11.160
and getting
a really good char on the outside instead

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:15.130
of trying to infuse it with
other flavors.

00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:18.940
I don't think there's a reason to do a
chili rubbed steak necessarily if you have

00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:19.940
a great piece of
meat.

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:28.489
If I'm going to eat a piece of steak, do
steak [laughter], I want to taste the beefiness

00:43:28.489 --> 00:43:32.309
of it instead of
trying to make it taste like something else.

00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:35.190
With steak
I try to be kind of pure about it.

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:36.960
&gt;&gt; Female#4: Thank you.

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.910
&gt;&gt;Andrew: Cheers
&gt;&gt; Female #5: Hi.

00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:43.380
So I have a question about the business end
of

00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:44.380
things.

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:47.260
I mean, it's obvious you go on the reputation
of

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:48.329
your talent as well.

00:43:48.329 --> 00:43:52.880
But you're also in a very
competitive restaurant market in New York

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:53.880
City.

00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:55.299
So I
think conventional wisdom always says it's

00:43:55.299 --> 00:43:57.670
one of the
hardest businesses to go into.

00:43:57.670 --> 00:44:01.859
So what do you think
aside from the buzz you get as a chef and

00:44:01.859 --> 00:44:05.789
kind of your
talents what else do you do to run a successful

00:44:05.789 --> 00:44:06.789
operation.

00:44:06.789 --> 00:44:11.489
&gt;&gt; Andrew: It is true, you know, that the
art of cooking is very

00:44:11.489 --> 00:44:13.950
different than the business of food.

00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:16.430
It's like very
very -- they're different.

00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:20.390
And there's no road map to
success.

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:23.770
No one ever taught me how to do that.

00:44:23.770 --> 00:44:26.460
No one
ever -- there's no book on it.

00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:27.979
They don't teach you that
in school.

00:44:27.979 --> 00:44:32.050
There's no -- it's a lot of mistakes I made.

00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:34.019
I made so many mistakes.

00:44:34.019 --> 00:44:37.210
The thing about mistakes I make
ten a day but I try not to let everyone know

00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:38.210
about them.

00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:40.569
[audience chuckles]
Cover your tracks.

00:44:40.569 --> 00:44:43.190
It's a very human business.

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:45.619
I have
two operating partners.

00:44:45.619 --> 00:44:49.279
One guy who is a -- we cooked
together for many years.

00:44:49.279 --> 00:44:54.679
He was a chef for me and a cook
for me for many years who has now moved into

00:44:54.679 --> 00:44:59.329
-- he takes
care of the kitchen design and scheduling,

00:44:59.329 --> 00:45:00.329
costing,
organizing.

00:45:00.329 --> 00:45:05.650
He builds the restaurants and then I have
another guy, Josh Picard, who takes care of

00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:09.660
the front end
of the business part of it so I can concentrate

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:13.940
on what
I'm good at or at least what I aspire to be

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:15.079
good at.

00:45:15.079 --> 00:45:21.420
And
I think that, again, it's like we can have

00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:25.099
all the opening
buzz you want for a restaurant but that only

00:45:25.099 --> 00:45:28.440
works for
three months, four months and then it's -- you

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:31.839
have to be
consistent in what you do and I think that's

00:45:31.839 --> 00:45:33.200
really the
biggest thing.

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:39.279
Doesn't matter if -- if you're the diner
on the corner and you do the dried out grilled

00:45:39.279 --> 00:45:42.339
piece of
chicken on top of the Caesar salad, you want

00:45:42.339 --> 00:45:44.099
to go back
because that's the thing you want to go back

00:45:44.099 --> 00:45:45.329
for.

00:45:45.329 --> 00:45:47.640
It's like the same, every single time.

00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:50.390
So it
doesn't matter if you're doing fois gras three

00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:53.969
ways or pork buns or a bowl of spaghetti or
you're doing the dried

00:45:53.969 --> 00:45:57.940
out piece of chicken, you have to be like
the same and try

00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:00.719
to deliver the same kind of experience.

00:46:00.719 --> 00:46:04.009
And I think
that's the most important thing.

00:46:04.009 --> 00:46:06.049
&gt;&gt; Female #5: Thank you.

00:46:06.049 --> 00:46:08.599
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Any other questions, guys?

00:46:08.599 --> 00:46:12.810
You need to go to the mic
Matthew.

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:15.400
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Andrew: Maybe you should rap.

00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:17.579
&gt;&gt; [laughter] Go ahead.

00:46:17.579 --> 00:46:23.059
&gt;&gt; female #6: So I just have this perception
of chefs always making

00:46:23.059 --> 00:46:25.900
the perfect meal every single time never any
flaws.

00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:28.759
&gt;&gt; Andrew: Oh, that's not a perception -- that's
how it is.

00:46:28.759 --> 00:46:34.930
&gt;&gt; Female #6: But have you as a chef put some
things together how

00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:37.200
much is supposed to go together and then just
say, "oh,

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:38.200
this is awful."

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:40.310
And just throw it away and start over.

00:46:40.310 --> 00:46:43.030
&gt;&gt; Andrew: That happens all the time.

00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:45.039
&gt;&gt; Female #6: That's good to know.

00:46:45.039 --> 00:46:46.390
&gt;&gt; Andrew: that happens all the time.

00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:51.890
Just for when the --
usually my process is I'll probably have -- if

00:46:51.890 --> 00:46:54.799
we're
going to do a menu change or we're going to

00:46:54.799 --> 00:46:56.430
come up with
a new restaurant like we just did with The

00:46:56.430 --> 00:47:00.220
Dutch probably
four or five pages of ideas.

00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:05.910
You know, the type on the
computer will be just like local something

00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:07.270
something with
garlic.

00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:10.359
Hey, let's do something with veal ribs.

00:47:10.359 --> 00:47:14.299
Or, you
know, they end up being not -- you have just

00:47:14.299 --> 00:47:17.089
like whittle
down the ideas, kind of.

00:47:17.089 --> 00:47:23.209
And my formula is if one out of
five ideas work, then you had a good day.

00:47:23.209 --> 00:47:26.950
So just kind of
have to like -- sometimes, you know, it sounds

00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:32.630
really
good and "let's try this thing" -- but, you

00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:34.779
know, maybe you
can't get a supply of it every day which happens

00:47:34.779 --> 00:47:36.069
sometimes.

00:47:36.069 --> 00:47:41.820
Or maybe I can make it awesome but then you
try to put it in the production of the restaurant

00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:44.960
making
it every day and it never works because making

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:49.069
one thing
and making 150 of something it's a different

00:47:49.069 --> 00:47:50.069
context.

00:47:50.069 --> 00:47:52.510
&gt;&gt; Female #6: Thanks.

00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:55.089
&gt;&gt; Male #1: Hi.

00:47:55.089 --> 00:47:57.839
So I sort of -- like, when I go out to eat,
I

00:47:57.839 --> 00:47:59.809
sort of differentiate between the times when
I go out to

00:47:59.809 --> 00:48:02.959
eat and I'm starving and I just want a burger
and fries

00:48:02.959 --> 00:48:07.339
versus something where on a Saturday night
and I've been planning all week to go to a

00:48:07.339 --> 00:48:08.339
restaurant.

00:48:08.339 --> 00:48:11.140
And I just want to know if you have a
thought there were any sort of tips or hard

00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:13.489
and fast
rules to ordering to sort of get the most

00:48:13.489 --> 00:48:17.069
out of your
restaurant experience whether it's ordering

00:48:17.069 --> 00:48:20.150
thematically
or balancing.

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:27.099
&gt;&gt;Andrew: I think it's all about context and
where you are and

00:48:27.099 --> 00:48:29.749
what type of restaurant it is or who you're
out with or

00:48:29.749 --> 00:48:31.180
what the purpose is.

00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:34.279
Like, obviously you're just eating
to eat, you're going to get a turkey wrap

00:48:34.279 --> 00:48:35.829
and you're
going to split, you know?

00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:43.200
I think that, you know, just
the restaurateur chef in me, any restaurant

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:45.180
is going to
give.

00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:48.819
I never judge a place on one try.

00:48:48.819 --> 00:48:53.309
Because I know,
as a diner, just eating out so much in all

00:48:53.309 --> 00:48:56.729
of the world,
you can be having the meal of your lifetime

00:48:56.729 --> 00:48:58.980
and the
person next to you can be having the worst

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:00.849
experience
ever.

00:49:00.849 --> 00:49:03.440
It's just kind of -- it's just the theater
of a

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:04.440
restaurant.

00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:11.469
And so, I think the thing is, you know --
you know there's obvious.

00:49:11.469 --> 00:49:16.380
On some menus you can just
look at that and that's just wrong I'm going

00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:18.960
to stay away
from that.

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:21.119
And then, there's the obvious choices.

00:49:21.119 --> 00:49:22.910
Kind
of just depends on how many times you've been

00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:23.910
there.

00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:24.910
Depends on the mood you're in.

00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:29.690
That's why what I try to
do is always balance out the menu so there's

00:49:29.690 --> 00:49:32.630
a little
something kind of for everyone.

00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:37.509
So I have tripe on my
menu but I also have a quinoa salad with squash

00:49:37.509 --> 00:49:38.900
and hazel
nuts.

00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:42.170
It just depends what night it is.

00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:44.510
So if you're
balling with like your buddies and you're

00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:48.369
doing tequila
shots or did you go for the '82 Bordeaux?

00:49:48.369 --> 00:49:49.519
Kind of depends.

00:49:49.519 --> 00:49:52.049
&gt;&gt; Male #1: Just go with your gut.

00:49:52.049 --> 00:49:55.699
&gt;&gt;Andrew: Yeah, just go with your gut
&gt;&gt; Male #1: Thank you.

00:49:55.699 --> 00:49:58.829
&gt;&gt; Male #2: So I guess this is a little bit
related to how you as

00:49:58.829 --> 00:50:01.009
a chef, you know, dine out.

00:50:01.009 --> 00:50:06.539
I think all of us that dine
out a lot you, end up with your pet peeves.

00:50:06.539 --> 00:50:09.410
Just curious
what drives you nuts as a diner.

00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:15.650
&gt;&gt; Andrew: I think the biggest thing is just
not caring.

00:50:15.650 --> 00:50:20.579
That's -- it doesn't matter if it's the Greek
salad.

00:50:20.579 --> 00:50:24.549
It's just blatantly not giving a shit [laughter]
is really kind of

00:50:24.549 --> 00:50:27.670
like the -- that's the thing that like, always.

00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:29.059
Again,
mistakes are going to happen.

00:50:29.059 --> 00:50:34.119
Someone's going to, you
know, they're going to open up their oyster

00:50:34.119 --> 00:50:36.809
and there's
going to be a little sand in it.

00:50:36.809 --> 00:50:37.809
There's too much salt
in it.

00:50:37.809 --> 00:50:42.109
That's going to happen; that's the human aspect
of it.

00:50:42.109 --> 00:50:46.869
Blatant attitude or just
that just like drives me crazy.

00:50:46.869 --> 00:50:50.369
And you can feel it
sometimes when you sit down.

00:50:50.369 --> 00:50:53.000
You know, you can feel it
right away.

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.559
So that's the biggest thing -- yeah.

00:50:55.559 --> 00:50:57.289
&gt;&gt; Male #2: Thanks.

00:50:57.289 --> 00:51:01.309
&gt;&gt; Male #3: Who are your favorite green market
suppliers what

00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:04.589
you're taking that winesap out of the walk
in, and where do you like it to

00:51:04.589 --> 00:51:05.900
be from?

00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:11.989
&gt;&gt; Andrew: You know, I've been buying from
the market here since

00:51:11.989 --> 00:51:13.249
I first came to New York.

00:51:13.249 --> 00:51:17.410
And just being, working
restaurants whatever since the early 90s,

00:51:17.410 --> 00:51:22.980
they're usually
there every Wednesday.

00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:28.340
You know, Franca at Berried
Treasures, we buy a lot from Franca and we

00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:33.859
buy a lot from
Rick Bishop.

00:51:33.859 --> 00:51:36.400
Fortunate enough that I don't have to
physically go to the markets to get those

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:40.920
things because
they're both busy restaurants.

00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:44.819
We pay cash to the
farmers [chuckles] and so they like to deliver

00:51:44.819 --> 00:51:48.430
to us.

00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:54.539
But
Millerelli, Franca, Berried Treasures, those

00:51:54.539 --> 00:51:57.180
are kind of like
our 'go to' people.

00:51:57.180 --> 00:52:01.599
And then, we have like one or two that
could get us just stuff that they don't even

00:52:01.599 --> 00:52:04.989
put out at
the green market because they know we're going

00:52:04.989 --> 00:52:06.959
to sell it right
away or that's what I want.

00:52:06.959 --> 00:52:10.680
Like someone's going to bring us local chanterelles
the one month they're in season.

00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:13.690
Or
local huckleberries the one month in season.

00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:17.380
I've always
bought a lot from the market even though I

00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:21.229
don't necessarily use that
as a marketing plan.

00:52:21.229 --> 00:52:25.650
It's kind of like, I think, if you're
a good American chef or just a good chef in

00:52:25.650 --> 00:52:28.219
general
that's what you're doing these days.

00:52:28.219 --> 00:52:29.219
Good.

00:52:29.219 --> 00:52:30.789
&gt;&gt; Male #3: Thank you.

00:52:30.789 --> 00:52:33.359
&gt;&gt; Interviewer: Any other questions, guys?

00:52:33.359 --> 00:52:35.039
Okay, thank you so much.

00:52:35.039 --> 00:52:36.069
This has been really fun.

00:52:36.069 --> 00:52:36.790
[applause]
&gt;&gt; Andrew: Thanks for having me.
