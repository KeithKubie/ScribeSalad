00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.730
The next oil spill won’t be a matter of
if — but when.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.120
Deepwater Horizon may have happened years
ago, but significant research is still being

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.740
conducted to learn as much as possible from
the biggest oil disaster in recent United

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.840
States history, and to find new, less toxic
ways to reverse future oil spill damage.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.860
During Deepwater Horizon I believe there were
15,000 actual phone calls into the command

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.980
post suggesting different ways of cleaning
up and doing things.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.200
If we're doing the same thing every different
spill, we're not doing the best we can.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.280
Michael Ziccardi spent five months in 
Louisiana during Deepwater Horizon

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.100
responding to the disaster.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.880
It’s his job to think of every aspect 
of oil spill response.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.280
Recently, he has been tracking the behavior
of affected marine birds after they have been

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.540
cleaned by the Oiled Wildlife Care Network,
a world-wide model for oil spill preparedness

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.060
and response.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.240
Just by going to the Oiled Wildlife Care Network
website we can actually see real time

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.060
where these animals are at.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.140
I honestly think that every oil spill needs
to be a learning opportunity.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.940
During the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, they
did a lot of what are called

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.180
alternative response techniques.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.110
They burned the oil off the surface of the
water, but they also used a larger volume

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.120
of chemical dispersants.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.780
Nearly seven million liters of dispersants known

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.960
as Corexit 9500 and 9527 were used.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:52.360
The concept is it's a surfactant, or a detergent,
that goes on top of the oil

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.940
and breaks it up into very small molecules,

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.140
driving it into the water column itself.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.540
The idea with that not only is it less risk
to animals that might be on the surface of

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.209
the water, but by sending it into the water
column it's actually allowing bacteria to

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.540
break down the oil.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.800
Dispersants work similarly to dish soap.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.480
Surfactants are long molecules that are water-seeking
on one end, or hydrophilic,

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.060
and oil-seeking, or oleophilic, on the other end.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.249
When the surfactant is in turbulent, moving
water, it reaches across the oil-water boundary

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:36.180
and lowers the tension between water and oil
— allowing it to break apart.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.700
This was the first time dispersants had ever
been used at such an enormous scale.

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.450
Mike’s research centers on how Corexit may
affect wildlife — specifically, marine birds

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.840
and their complex feather structure, which
is responsible for keeping them warm.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.510
So the feather structure of birds is fascinating.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.609
It's a combination of barbs and barbules and
hooklets.

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:03.180
Think of a piece of Velcro.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.180
The feathers basically make that Velcro.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.480
When oil affects a bird, there's an artificial
separation in that Velcro so it can't stick

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.590
together.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.020
So what ends up happening,

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.159
is water can seep through the feathers
and down to the skin.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.279
What we found was something
we did not expect at all.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.000
At high concentrations, they lost their waterproofing
almost immediately.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.600
But that waterproofing actually resolved itself
within a matter of a day.

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:38.709
So it seems like it was a temporary loss and
just by swimming in water, or over time they

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.029
could actually lose that impact.

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:45.279
It could be that if dispersant application
occurs, you can throw out a raft that animals

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:49.900
can haul out on to get themselves warm. They don't need to be captured, they don't need

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.930
to be brought into rehabilitation where they're
going to be there two or three weeks.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.460
It's just that temporary fix.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:03.680
Animals could survive it, as long as they're
not in the oil as far as the dispersant application.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.120
Although the birds’ waterproofing seems
to recover, Corexit is still very controversial.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.060
And Mike and his team&nbsp;— as well scientists around

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.400
the country&nbsp;— are still investigating the
impacts of Corexit’s toxicity.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.240
Mike hopes this information will shape future
decision-making during oil spill response

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.030
efforts, and encourage alternative approaches
that could be less costly and less intrusive

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.150
to wildlife.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.880
I think for the foreseeable future oil spills
will always be there.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.910
I believe that we have a moral obligation
to try to repair the damage and to try to

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.330
reduce the impacts on the wildlife.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:47.320
It is truly the only thing I've ever wanted
to do, is to try to help animals in crises,

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.980
especially in crises that humans cause.
