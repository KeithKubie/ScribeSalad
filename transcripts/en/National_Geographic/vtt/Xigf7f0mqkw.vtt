00:00:01.667 --> 00:00:03.967
It is important to learn the
history of the United States

00:00:03.967 --> 00:00:06.800
because you can learn new
things about what happened then,

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.700
and how it is now, and how
you can change the world.

00:00:14.934 --> 00:00:18.800
We learn about history
so we don't repeat mistakes

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.567
that people made in history.

00:00:20.567 --> 00:00:22.667
Sometimes history
have a lesson.

00:00:22.667 --> 00:00:25.667
Abraham Lincoln saved
the enslaved people.

00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:27.433
Yes, I think it's important
to know about slavery

00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:29.467
so that nothing like that
will ever happen again.

00:00:29.467 --> 00:00:32.000
It's illegal now, and it
wasn't for part of Abraham

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.333
Lincoln's presidency.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.867
And he decided, no, we
can't do this anymore.

00:00:35.867 --> 00:00:37.767
They weren't treated equally.

00:00:37.767 --> 00:00:40.066
You would have to get
bossed around in chains.

00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:43.433
I don't think anyone should
ever be forced to do something

00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:44.500
they don't want to do.

00:00:48.433 --> 00:00:51.133
People shouldn't be judged
off the color of their skin.

00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.266
Whatever color they
are, that doesn't matter.

00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:54.500
It just counts
what's on the inside.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.066
Some people are
definitely treated

00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:58.166
differently sometimes because
of the color of their skin.

00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:00.600
There was like, some riots
that happened recently.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.333
We just want like, happiness,
peacefulness, and no racism.

00:01:08.233 --> 00:01:12.100
Well, a statue is
to show thankfulness.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.834
I think for
remembrance and honor.

00:01:14.834 --> 00:01:16.900
I think the person that
would deserve a statue

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.166
is Abraham Lincoln.

00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:19.600
I think Obama.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.934
John Cena.

00:01:20.934 --> 00:01:23.834
Because he's the
most lit person,

00:01:23.834 --> 00:01:25.834
and he can fight really good.

00:01:25.834 --> 00:01:27.066
Emma Watson.

00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:28.400
She stands up for
women's rights,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.433
and I think that's very
good and important.

00:01:31.433 --> 00:01:34.533
I think people who have
made big changes to the world.

00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:38.033
If someone's changes
last, so should they.

00:01:38.033 --> 00:01:39.800
Like Albert Einstein.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.100
Martin Luther King.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.266
He fought for civil
rights and for all of us

00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:47.633
to be treated the same
way, not different.

00:01:47.633 --> 00:01:51.200
America Inside Out
with Katie Couric,

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.200
only on National Geographic.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.700
[laughter]

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.533
That's a tongue twister.
