00:00:00.537 --> 00:00:04.067
In the last video, we first
thought about externalities,

00:00:04.067 --> 00:00:05.610
the negative externalities

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.603
of having plastic bags around.

00:00:07.603 --> 00:00:09.612
It causes litter, it might damage animals

00:00:09.612 --> 00:00:11.614
and the environment in some way.

00:00:11.614 --> 00:00:14.275
We're assuming ... And
we assumed in that video

00:00:14.275 --> 00:00:16.613
that we were able to calculate the actual

00:00:16.613 --> 00:00:19.282
external cost of a plastic bag.

00:00:19.282 --> 00:00:21.692
This two cents a bag is the impact on

00:00:21.692 --> 00:00:22.668
litter in the environment.

00:00:22.668 --> 00:00:24.268
Then we were able to figure out

00:00:24.268 --> 00:00:25.667
that if we factor this in,

00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:27.139
instead of just having the regular

00:00:27.139 --> 00:00:28.540
marginal cost cover the suppliers,

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.360
if we added that marginal cost curve

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.139
to the external cost,

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:33.699
we would get a supplier plus

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:36.334
external costs, marginal cost curve,

00:00:36.334 --> 00:00:37.999
and then we'd get what is actually

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:42.111
the optimal price and
quantity of plastic bags

00:00:42.111 --> 00:00:44.454
so that we actually do not eat into

00:00:44.454 --> 00:00:45.935
our surplus by creating all of this

00:00:45.935 --> 00:00:49.156
negative surplus where the total cost

00:00:49.156 --> 00:00:50.210
of the bags are higher than

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.134
the total benefit.

00:00:52.134 --> 00:00:53.719
One thing that we did not touch on

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.042
in that video, is how
does this actually happen?

00:00:56.042 --> 00:00:59.216
If we just let things be,

00:00:59.216 --> 00:01:00.471
and we just had the supplier's

00:01:00.471 --> 00:01:01.668
marginal cost curve

00:01:01.668 --> 00:01:04.332
and we have the consumer's demand curve,

00:01:04.332 --> 00:01:06.717
in this case, the consumers
were the supermarkets,

00:01:06.717 --> 00:01:08.340
then the equilibrium price that'll be

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.932
reached will be right over here

00:01:09.932 --> 00:01:12.209
because although we're theoretically

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:14.004
saying that there's this cost over here,

00:01:14.004 --> 00:01:17.544
the cost won't be factored in

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:18.884
into the markets.

00:01:18.884 --> 00:01:21.135
So if you are the benevolent emperor

00:01:21.135 --> 00:01:23.875
in this society, what do you do?

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:26.298
What do you do to get the quantity

00:01:26.298 --> 00:01:28.550
closer to this point right over here

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.133
than what the equilibrium quantity

00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:31.801
will be when you don't factor in

00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:33.009
the external cost?

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.742
There's a bunch of options here.

00:01:34.742 --> 00:01:37.468
You could just ban plastic bags ...

00:01:37.468 --> 00:01:41.134
ban plastic bags,

00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:44.066
you could put a quota on plastic bags,

00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:47.883
you could put a quota, so saying that

00:01:47.883 --> 00:01:50.467
more than a certain amount of bags

00:01:50.467 --> 00:01:52.404
could not be produced, or

00:01:52.404 --> 00:01:54.468
you could tax plastic bags,

00:01:54.468 --> 00:01:57.332
or you could tax plastic bags.

00:01:57.332 --> 00:01:59.340
Let's think about which of these will

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.596
result in the most surplus,

00:02:01.596 --> 00:02:05.042
the most benefit to society in aggregate.

00:02:05.042 --> 00:02:06.963
One core assumption we're going to make

00:02:06.963 --> 00:02:10.404
is that this is an accurate assessment

00:02:10.404 --> 00:02:13.331
of the external cost per bag.

00:02:13.331 --> 00:02:15.403
If you were to just ban plastic bags

00:02:15.403 --> 00:02:16.885
as this benevolent emperor,

00:02:16.885 --> 00:02:18.070
maybe seemingly or hopefully

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.403
benevolent emperor of
this society right here,

00:02:20.403 --> 00:02:22.067
if you just banned plastic bags,

00:02:22.067 --> 00:02:23.404
what would happen?

00:02:23.404 --> 00:02:25.468
Well, then this market just won't exist.

00:02:25.468 --> 00:02:27.883
All of this surplus
that could have existed,

00:02:27.883 --> 00:02:29.550
won't exist anymore,

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.130
so you would actually
be destroying surplus.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.669
You could say, "No,
no, no ... plastic bags

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:35.736
are horrible. They should
just be outright banned.

00:02:35.736 --> 00:02:37.465
There's no amount of benefit for which

00:02:37.465 --> 00:02:40.337
plastic bags are worth using,"

00:02:40.337 --> 00:02:41.884
but in that case, you're actually arguing

00:02:41.884 --> 00:02:43.711
this point right over here.

00:02:43.711 --> 00:02:45.069
You'd be arguing that, "No, it's not

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.920
2 cents a bag, it's 10 cents a bag,"

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.281
of negative externality,
and because of that,

00:02:50.281 --> 00:02:52.449
you would have this
curve shift up even more

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:54.784
and then there's no
positive quantity there

00:02:54.784 --> 00:02:56.611
and maybe a ban would be all right.

00:02:56.611 --> 00:02:58.922
But if the 2 cents is the externality,

00:02:58.922 --> 00:03:00.358
the negative externality,

00:03:00.358 --> 00:03:02.050
and if you were to ban plastic bags,

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.194
then you would actually be removing,

00:03:04.194 --> 00:03:07.522
you would be removing
this surplus from society.

00:03:07.522 --> 00:03:10.386
That doesn't seem like a good option.

00:03:10.386 --> 00:03:12.354
Now what about a quota?

00:03:12.354 --> 00:03:15.191
You kind of look at the
study right over here

00:03:15.191 --> 00:03:17.747
and you say, "Look, the optimal amount

00:03:17.747 --> 00:03:20.623
of plastic bags is 1.9
million bags per week,

00:03:20.623 --> 00:03:22.802
so I will just say that that's most

00:03:22.802 --> 00:03:24.872
that the market can produce."

00:03:24.872 --> 00:03:26.667
But when you say that, that's assuming

00:03:26.667 --> 00:03:28.538
that you really do understand what this

00:03:28.538 --> 00:03:30.206
demand curve looks like.

00:03:30.206 --> 00:03:31.403
I just drew a straight line here

00:03:31.403 --> 00:03:32.617
just out of simplicity, and

00:03:32.617 --> 00:03:33.933
assuming that you really do understand

00:03:33.933 --> 00:03:36.287
what this marginal cost curve looks like.

00:03:36.287 --> 00:03:38.371
Throughout this playlist,

00:03:38.371 --> 00:03:39.672
we've been assuming that we kind of do

00:03:39.672 --> 00:03:40.869
understand those things, but

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:43.736
in the real world, it's actually very hard

00:03:43.736 --> 00:03:45.533
to know exactly what the marginal cost

00:03:45.533 --> 00:03:46.705
of the curve looks like,

00:03:46.705 --> 00:03:47.808
and it's also hard to know exactly

00:03:47.808 --> 00:03:49.737
what the marginal benefit curve,

00:03:49.737 --> 00:03:51.207
or the demand curve looks like,

00:03:51.207 --> 00:03:53.330
especially because
they're always changing.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.446
There's always more competitors,

00:03:54.446 --> 00:03:56.451
less competitors, more
substitute products,

00:03:56.451 --> 00:03:58.665
more R&amp;D, things are
getting more efficient,

00:03:58.665 --> 00:04:00.621
less efficient; and so it's very hard

00:04:00.621 --> 00:04:03.615
to know what the true equilibrium

00:04:03.615 --> 00:04:05.598
quantity should be.

00:04:05.598 --> 00:04:07.951
A quota is difficult.

00:04:07.951 --> 00:04:10.469
We don't have quite the right information.

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:12.403
A tax is interesting.

00:04:12.403 --> 00:04:14.468
A tax says, "Look, regardless of

00:04:14.468 --> 00:04:16.205
what the marginal cost curve really is,

00:04:16.205 --> 00:04:19.286
we're just going to
shift it up by 2 cents."

00:04:19.286 --> 00:04:21.933
We saw that when we
first talked about taxes.

00:04:21.933 --> 00:04:24.534
When we first talked about
taxes, we talked about

00:04:24.534 --> 00:04:26.623
they're introducing a dead weight loss

00:04:26.623 --> 00:04:28.884
because you're not
producing as much quantity

00:04:28.884 --> 00:04:30.735
as you would have otherwise, or

00:04:30.735 --> 00:04:32.955
as much quantity isn't being consumed.

00:04:32.955 --> 00:04:34.673
But here, a tax could actually prevent

00:04:34.673 --> 00:04:36.954
a dead weight loss because if you have

00:04:36.954 --> 00:04:40.394
a 2 cent tax, essentially adding the cost

00:04:40.394 --> 00:04:43.067
of the negative externality
in the form of a tax

00:04:43.067 --> 00:04:46.136
on top of the supplier's
cost right over here,

00:04:46.136 --> 00:04:48.736
you are going to cause
the equilibrium quantity

00:04:48.736 --> 00:04:51.367
to be the quantity where you're not

00:04:51.367 --> 00:04:53.735
generating all of this negative surplus,

00:04:53.735 --> 00:04:56.202
and it's just a positive side effect,

00:04:56.202 --> 00:04:57.341
and once again, this is all assuming

00:04:57.341 --> 00:04:58.538
that this is the right number,

00:04:58.538 --> 00:05:00.602
but it would be a positive side effect

00:05:00.602 --> 00:05:02.289
that you would also generate some revenue

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:03.467
for the government.

00:05:03.467 --> 00:05:05.803
What's good about the
tax in this circumstance

00:05:05.803 --> 00:05:07.866
right over here, you're
not assuming anything

00:05:07.866 --> 00:05:09.800
about what the marginal
cost curve looks like

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.138
or what the demand curve looks like.

00:05:12.138 --> 00:05:13.676
As long as you're assuming that this

00:05:13.676 --> 00:05:14.622
is the right number,

00:05:14.622 --> 00:05:18.070
the tax will always shift whatever

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.537
the marginal cost curve is,

00:05:19.537 --> 00:05:21.452
it'll always shift it to the right point

00:05:21.452 --> 00:05:26.372
to intersect wherever the demand curve is

00:05:26.372 --> 00:05:28.203
at this equilibrium point,

00:05:28.203 --> 00:05:29.534
that gives us an equilibrium price

00:05:29.534 --> 00:05:30.948
and an equilibrium quantity.

00:05:30.948 --> 00:05:32.618
So if this is the right number and

00:05:32.618 --> 00:05:34.404
you put a 2 cent tax per bag,

00:05:34.404 --> 00:05:37.282
a 2 cent tax per bag,

00:05:37.282 --> 00:05:40.382
then this is probably
going to be the best option

00:05:40.382 --> 00:05:43.696
in terms of optimizing the total surplus.
