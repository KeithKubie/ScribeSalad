00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:06.259
Dinosaur evolution seems pretty straight forward.

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.250
Creepy lizardish thing, to creepy raptor thing,
to slightly less creepy chicken.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.670
but what if evolution reversed itself?

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.900
Hey everyone, Julia here for DNews,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.770
Dollo’s law, named after 19th century Paleontologist
Louis Dollo, states that once a structure

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.650
is lost in evolution, it’s lost forever.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.010
But sometimes, on a rare occasion, the past
pops back up.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.750
Researcher Alexander Vargas and others from
the University of Chile who analyzed modern

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.910
birds discovered one such case.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.070
They found an ancestral wrist bone may have
made a comeback.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.580
The ancestors of some dinosaurs walked on
all fours and needed strong wrists with 11

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.990
bones to support their weight.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.100
One of these bones is called the PIE ZAH FORM
pisiform.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.960
When some dinosaurs started walking on just
two legs, the wrists changed.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.690
They weren’t so good for getting around,
but they were pretty good at tearing apart

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:56.690
prey.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.970
In the change they lost some weight and some
bones.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.440
This wrist had just 3 bones.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.060
The pisiform either disappeared or became
so soft it left no trace in the fossil record.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.850
When dinosaurs took to flight, the wrist changed
again to be more flexible wing.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.229
These early bird-like raptors evolved a different
type of wrist bone, the ulnare.

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.920
To figure out the fate of the missing bone,
the researchers examined evidence from both

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.400
the fossil record and from the development
of modern bird embryos.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.640
In developing embryos, they used a tracking
technique using stains to see how the bones

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.640
formed.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.310
Looking at the more modern birds, the researchers
noticed the ulnare was suspiciously present

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.060
in the early stages of development but wasn’t
present in fully grown birds like previously

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.060
thought.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.979
But there was a bone there in adult forms.

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.920
Upon closer inspection, it was really the
old missing pisiform back again.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.150
The researchers think the reemerging bone
is the result of vestigial genes.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.450
Vestigial limbs or organs, like our tailbone
or appendix are traces of the past.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.630
They are the remains of parts that are no
longer evolutionary advantageous so they either

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.900
disappear into our history or become almost
useless.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.509
Over the millennia the genes that coded for
the pisiform were still there, just dormant.

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.450
And when they were expressed again, they were
no longer good for walking around on all fours,

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.119
but for flying.

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.069
So the bone appeared, disappeared and reemerged
to perform a different function, which is

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.269
a radical concept for scientists.

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.129
The idea of evolutionary reversal is still
met with resistance.

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.450
It goes against Dollo’s law, which treats
evolution like a one way street.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.379
Even though several cases of reversal happening
have been identified.

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:27.630
Like teeth reemerging in some South American
frogs after 200 million years of absence.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.480
This recent research is just one piece of
a puzzle that could turn one of the most closely

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.739
held scientific concepts on its head.

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.749
It’s cool, it’s weird, it’s evolution.

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:40.060
On that note, if you want your web presence
to “evolve” then consider buying a domain

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.830
name from domain.com!

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.919
No domain extension will help you tell your
story like a DOT COM or DOT NET domain name.

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:53.469
What do you think?

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:55.200
Can evolution reverse itself?

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.790
What if one day our descendents get their
tails back?
