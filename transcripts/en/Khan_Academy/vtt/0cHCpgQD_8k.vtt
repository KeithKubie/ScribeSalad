00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.519
- [Voiceover] Let's say that
we run a car dealership,

00:00:02.519 --> 00:00:04.788
and we have 11 salespeople,

00:00:04.788 --> 00:00:07.359
and we record the number of cars

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:11.139
each of the 11 salespeople
sold in the past week.

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.379
So that's one of them,
two, three, four, five,

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.589
six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11.

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:21.379
So we record how much each of them sold.

00:00:21.379 --> 00:00:24.979
So maybe one person sold,
maybe they sold five cars.

00:00:24.979 --> 00:00:27.239
Maybe the next person sold seven cars.

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:29.499
Maybe the next person sold 10 cars.

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:31.142
And so that's how we would do it.

00:00:31.142 --> 00:00:33.499
So we're going to record all of that.

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:37.685
But then we're told that
the median car sold is six.

00:00:37.685 --> 00:00:39.759
So if we ordered all of these numbers,

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:41.699
so let's just assume
that we ordered them all

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:43.499
from least to greatest.

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:45.539
So maybe, and I'm just
making up numbers here,

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.699
maybe this is four.

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:48.119
This is four.

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:53.119
Maybe this is five,
five, five, six, seven,

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.439
seven, eight, nine, 10.

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:59.819
The median car sold, meaning
that the middle number here

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:01.179
is going to be six.

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:03.379
Now we don't know whether
all of these other numbers

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:04.799
are the actual numbers.

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:05.803
I just made those up.

00:01:05.803 --> 00:01:08.099
But we know that the middle
number needs to be six.

00:01:08.099 --> 00:01:10.419
So let me just fill out
only the middle number.

00:01:10.419 --> 00:01:12.699
So the middle number, if
you have 11 data points,

00:01:12.699 --> 00:01:14.535
the middle number's going
to have five on either side.

00:01:14.535 --> 00:01:15.719
So that's that one right over there.

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:17.059
One, two, three, four, five.

00:01:17.059 --> 00:01:19.659
One, two, three, four, five.

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.165
So we know that the median,
we know the median--

00:01:22.165 --> 00:01:23.617
Actually, let me do that a purple color.

00:01:23.617 --> 00:01:27.619
The median is going to be six.

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:28.848
Now the other thing we know is that

00:01:28.848 --> 00:01:32.272
the range of cars sold is four.

00:01:32.272 --> 00:01:33.519
Now let's remind ourselves,

00:01:33.519 --> 00:01:36.499
the range is the maximum
number of cars sold

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:39.079
minus the minimum number of cars sold,

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.880
and if we have sorted all of these out,

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.519
if we take--

00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:45.548
If this is our max right over here,

00:01:45.548 --> 00:01:47.339
because we've sorted them all out,

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:50.279
and this is our min right over here,

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:55.279
our range is going to be
our max minus our min.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.884
So let me write that down.

00:01:56.884 --> 00:01:58.731
So you take your min and your max.

00:01:58.731 --> 00:02:00.608
You have your range.

00:02:00.608 --> 00:02:05.608
Range is equal to the
maximum minus the minimum.

00:02:05.837 --> 00:02:07.479
And they're telling us that that is four.

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.179
This range is four.

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.659
So the maximum minus the minimum,

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:14.099
the difference between the number of cars

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.259
that the most productive salesperson sold

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:17.579
and the number of cars

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.069
that the least productive
salesperson sold,

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.117
that difference is going to be four.

00:02:22.117 --> 00:02:24.129
So given all of those assumptions,

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.259
giving all of that information,

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:28.981
I'm now going to give you a statement,

00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:32.319
and our challenge is if we assume

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.155
everything I just said is true,

00:02:34.155 --> 00:02:36.651
is this statement going to be true,

00:02:36.651 --> 00:02:38.439
or is this statement going to be false,

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:40.319
or do we not know?

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.259
So let me write this down.

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:46.688
So is this going to be true, false,

00:02:48.224 --> 00:02:49.455
or do we not know?

00:02:49.455 --> 00:02:51.619
Do we not have enough information to say

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:53.739
it's for sure going to be true,

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.619
for sure going to be false,

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:57.519
or for sure we don't know?

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.499
And so I encourage you
to pause the video now

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:00.563
and try it out.

00:03:01.163 --> 00:03:03.019
All right, so let's work
through it together.

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.939
This is kind of a fun puzzle here,

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:06.579
where we've been given some clues,

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:07.459
and then we have a statement,

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.779
and we figure out can
we make this statement.

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:12.619
Can we say it's true or can we
say for sure that it's false,

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:14.600
or do we just not know?

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.445
So a couple of ways to tackle it.

00:03:18.445 --> 00:03:20.580
One way to tackle it is, well look,

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.988
one of the salespeople
must have sold six cars.

00:03:23.988 --> 00:03:25.888
If the median sold is six,

00:03:25.888 --> 00:03:28.539
and there's 11 salespeople here,

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:31.199
the middle number here,
that if we order it,

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:34.779
one of them must have sold six cars.

00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:36.179
If we had an even number here,

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:37.942
then that would be the
average of the two middles,

00:03:37.942 --> 00:03:39.106
but if we have an odd number here,

00:03:39.106 --> 00:03:44.106
that is literally the
middle number of cars sold.

00:03:44.606 --> 00:03:46.845
So someone sold six cars.

00:03:46.845 --> 00:03:48.059
So if we assume--

00:03:49.428 --> 00:03:51.959
We're trying to find a
world where someone sold

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.043
more than 10 cars.

00:03:54.043 --> 00:03:56.538
So if someone sold six cars,

00:03:56.538 --> 00:03:58.799
is there a way, with a range of four,

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.814
that someone sold more than 10?

00:04:01.752 --> 00:04:03.115
Well let's just think about it.

00:04:03.115 --> 00:04:05.051
Let's just assume that the min is six.

00:04:05.051 --> 00:04:06.387
We don't know that the min is six,

00:04:06.387 --> 00:04:08.119
but let's just try it out.

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:12.316
If the minimum is six,
if the minimum is six,

00:04:12.316 --> 00:04:14.539
what's the maximum going to be?

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:18.989
Well remember, the range is equal to--

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.549
We know that the range is four.

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.839
The range is equal to the
maximum minus the minimum,

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:27.479
maximum minus the minimum,

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:32.479
and so the maximum in this
case would be 10, would be 10.

00:04:33.392 --> 00:04:37.905
The max would be equal
to, would be equal to 10.

00:04:37.905 --> 00:04:40.597
If the min is equal to
six, and instead of colons

00:04:40.597 --> 00:04:41.797
I'm going to write an equals sign,

00:04:41.797 --> 00:04:43.435
if the min is equal to six,

00:04:43.435 --> 00:04:46.705
then the max at most can be equal to 10.

00:04:46.705 --> 00:04:48.112
And we can't take a higher min,

00:04:48.112 --> 00:04:49.719
because we know that the six

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:51.839
is going to be one of the values.

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:53.480
We could try a lower minimum value.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.439
We could say the minimum
value is five or four

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:56.919
or three or two or one,

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:58.831
but then the maximum
would go down even more,

00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:00.779
because remember, the
maximum is no more than

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:02.539
four larger than the minimum.

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:04.199
So if we assume six, and we know that

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:06.479
one of the salespeople sold six cars,

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.519
then the maximum that
any of the salespeople

00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:10.879
could have sold is 10.

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:12.539
And so the statement, at
least one of the salespeople

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:16.142
sold more than 10 cars,
that's got to be false.

00:05:16.142 --> 00:05:18.399
That's got to be false.

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:20.399
Now there's another way that
you could think about it.

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:24.039
You could assume that
someone sold more than 10.

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:25.700
You could assume.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.059
In the last example, or the
last way of thinking about it,

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:31.419
we assumed that the min was six,

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:33.306
but now let's just assume,

00:05:33.321 --> 00:05:36.011
let's just assume that someone sold--

00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:37.459
Let's just try it out.

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:38.249
Let's see if it's possible.

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:41.277
Let's just assume that the max is 11,

00:05:41.277 --> 00:05:43.559
that someone sold more than 10 cars.

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:46.339
If the max is equal to 11,

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:48.659
what's the min going to need to be?

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:50.119
Well we just have to remind ourselves,

00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:52.619
range is equal to max minus min.

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:56.433
So four is equal to the maximum, 11,

00:05:56.433 --> 00:05:58.234
minus the minimum.

00:05:58.234 --> 00:06:01.619
So 11 minus what is equal to four?

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:04.319
Well 11 minus seven is equal to four.

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:06.359
So if we assume that the maximum is 11,

00:06:06.359 --> 00:06:09.659
then the minimum is going to have to be,

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:13.399
the minimum is going to
have to be equal to seven.

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:17.495
Now can the minimum be seven
when your median is six?

00:06:17.495 --> 00:06:18.354
No.

00:06:18.354 --> 00:06:20.619
If your median is six,
that means you have--

00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:24.499
That means if you have an
odd number of data points,

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:26.239
that means one of the data points is six,

00:06:26.239 --> 00:06:27.859
and if you had an even
number of data points,

00:06:27.859 --> 00:06:29.905
that means that the middle two

00:06:29.905 --> 00:06:31.351
are going to average out to be six,

00:06:31.351 --> 00:06:33.119
which means you even have data points

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:34.399
that are less than six.

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:36.819
So your minimum can't be seven.

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:40.059
You're going to have a value
that is at least as low,

00:06:40.059 --> 00:06:41.879
at least as low as six.

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:45.799
So your assumption can't
be true, can't be true,

00:06:45.799 --> 00:06:48.459
so once again, the assumption
based on the statement

00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:49.499
can't be true.

00:06:49.499 --> 00:06:52.219
This statement is going to be false.
