00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.600
- Here at Pine Hill Middle,
we have a diverse group

00:00:06.199 --> 00:00:09.310
- Raise your hand if you have
at least three lessons passed.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:10.143
Good job.

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:13.660
- When it comes to Ms.
Grubbs, she is so creative.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.760
One of the resources she has used

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.730
is Khan Academy with the LearnStorm.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.210
- This class mainly focuses on students

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.370
with learning needs so we have

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.740
to come up with alternative strategies

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.941
to kind of try to help those students.

00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:34.941
LearnStorm is an excellent
resource for differentiation.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.360
Differentiation, it's one of the most

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.480
difficult things to accomplish.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.320
They expect you to have one person

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.940
to service thirty people individually.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.047
Is everybody ready?

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:48.891
- [Whole Class] Yes, ma'am.

00:00:48.891 --> 00:00:51.520
- Alright, he got three over here.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.240
I don't necessarily grade
accuracy, I grade progress.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.040
So, LearnStorm is a good
way to differentiate

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.400
and as well as motivate and
with the growth mindset pieces

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.810
you can also educate them about
why it's important to learn,

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.030
how they learn, how their
body is set up to learn,

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.350
which strategies help them learn.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.330
It's amazing, it's amazing and it's free.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.700
It's free!

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.650
- The best part of doing LearnStorm,

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.020
it built up my confidence to do more.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.740
To do better for myself.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.540
Be a better person.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.740
- I think one of the most
inspirational stories

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.390
was one of my students.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.080
He was the first one to
complete all 60 assignments

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.600
and after he completed
those 60 assignments,

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.160
he asked for more.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.030
- I did over 300 lessons in one week.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.400
LearnStorm is good.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.473
I felt proud of myself
getting all these good grades.

00:01:48.473 --> 00:01:51.056
(upbeat music)

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.640
- End of each week, I assess my students.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.440
Every single one of 'em
shows significant progress

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.710
and their energy improved significantly

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.890
because they believe they can do it now.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.870
So, they're very, very, very happy

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.770
and pleased with themselves.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.770
I would encourage any
teacher to utilize LearnStorm

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.220
as a motivational tool for
students to get started.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.070
Kinda get that jump started
at the beginning of the year.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.260
I mean, you want students to
get excited about learning.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.942
What better way than the LearnStorm

00:02:27.942 --> 00:02:30.027
to get them excited about learning.

00:02:30.027 --> 00:02:34.277
- [Whole Class] LearnStorm,
LearnStorm, LearnStorm!
