00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:16.950
The Battle of Normandy, also known as D-Day,
started on June 6, 1944 and was the beginning

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.100
of the major invasion of German-occupied Western
Europe during World War II.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.620
But why was it called “D-Day”?

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:29.410
You might at first be inclined to think the
abbreviation is similar to V-Day (Victory

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.410
Day).

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.440
Indeed, one commonly touted explanation given
for the meaning of the “D” in D-Day is

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.050
that it stands for “designated day.”

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.890
Others claim it stands for “decision day”,
“debarkation”, or even “deliverance

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:43.890
day.”

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.410
Even General Dwight Eisenhower, or at the
least his assistant, weighed in when Eisenhower

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.410
received a letter asking for an explanation
of the meaning of D-Day.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.820
His executive assistant wrote back stating
D-Day was a shortened version of “departed

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.820
day”.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.350
Given Eisenhower helped plan it, that should
mean cased closed right?

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.290
It turns out, most historians think not.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.030
And, indeed, the evidence at hand doesn’t
seem to support Eisenhower’s (or perhaps

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.049
just his assistant’s) claim.

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.950
Hints of the true meaning can be found long
before WWII in a U.S. Army Field Order dated

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.170
September 7, 1918.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.080
The order stated that “The First Army will
attack at H hour on D day with the object

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.760
of forcing the evacuation of the St. Mihiel
Salient.”

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.850
In that context, and with numerous combat
operations that followed over the years, D-day

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.740
referred to the “day” on which a combat
attack would occur with H-hour likewise referring

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.960
to the “hour” when an attack is scheduled
to happen.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.229
Thus, the “D” is just a placeholder or
variable for the actual date, and probably

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.850
originally was meant to stand for “date”
or “day” (if anything), if the associated

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.490
“H-hour” is any indication.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.350
The use of D-day allows military personnel
to easily plan for a combat mission ahead

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.010
of time without knowing the exact date that
it will occur.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.000
Given that planning for the most famous of
all D-day’s in June of 1944 started way

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.750
back in 1943, and that, due to factors like
optimal tides, only a few days in a given

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.879
month were suitable for the launch of the
invasion, trying to fix a firm date in the

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:23.829
planning process was pointless, even close
to the time of the attack.

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:29.329
(In fact, the original set date was June 5,
but bad weather at the last minute forced

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:30.329
a day delay.)

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:35.090
By simply assigning the attack to occur on
“D-day”, it solved this issue, and had

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.150
the side benefit of keeping the date of the
attack a secret as long as possible, just

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.329
one of the many methods of deception the military
employed to try to confuse the German brass

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.779
with regards to the pending invasion.

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:52.760
As for handling the pre-D-day preparations
and the plan for after, adding a plus or minus

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.660
sign and a number after the “D” was used.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.629
For example, D-1 would indicate the day before
the operation occurring while D+3 would mean

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:03.909
three days after the operation.

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:08.699
In this way, the plans could be easily overlaid
onto a calendar when the military leadership

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:11.480
decided on the day of the attack.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.779
If the day needed to be switched at the last
minute, it was then also easy enough to calibrate

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:18.650
the plan to the new date.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.099
As alluded to, the D-Day that occurred on
June 6, 1944 was not the only D-day during

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.629
World War II and it certainly was not the
last, as this method of planning for military

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:31.360
operations continues to this day.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.400
Of course, because the D-day at the Battle
of Normandy was, and continues to be, the

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.799
most famous of all given that designation,
it seems unlikely in the foreseeable future

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.769
that it will be usurped in people’s minds
when someone mentions “D-Day”, despite

00:03:45.769 --> 00:04:01.400
the military continuing to occasionally use
this designation.
