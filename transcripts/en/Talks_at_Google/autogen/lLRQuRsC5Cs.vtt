00:00:00.024 --> 00:00:00.940
SPEAKER: Hi, everyone.

00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.800
Thanks for joining.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.530
Today, as you know, we have the
fantastic and amazing Julieta

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:07.710
Venegas with us.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.416
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.800
Just to get us
started, I would like

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.830
to talk to you a little
bit about your experience

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.750
being born and
raised in Tijuana,

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.970
then growing up,
becoming this fantastic

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.159
international artist-- Grammy
winner, known all around

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:33.010
the world.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.440
Can you tell us a little
bit about that experience

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.700
and what are the key milestones
around that big journey?

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.420
JULIETA VENEGAS: OK,
first, hi, everyone.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.960
It's great to be here.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.230
And thank you for
this whole event.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.650
Well, I was born in
Long Beach, actually.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.350
I wasn't born in Tijuana.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.750
I never lived in Long Beach.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.510
Actually, my parents were
moving around California.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.940
And they're both
Mexican, but they both

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.820
had their immigration papers.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.440
But they finally
settled in Tijuana.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.580
They grew up there and--
well, practically, yeah.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.930
And they decided that that
was the best place to be.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.770
And I kind of grew up very
much a border life, you know?

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.980
I mean, every time one
of my brothers or sisters

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.430
were going to be
born, we'd cross.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.150
They'd have their kid
and go back to Tijuana.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.666
And [SPANISH], you know?

00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:33.522
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:38.216 --> 00:01:39.590
So I actually grew
up in Tijuana.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.340
But it's very much a border
life, very much bilingual.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.470
I grew up watching
American television.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.980
That's how I learned English.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.120
I never studied in the US.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.330
I did do like a
junior college when

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.050
I finished high school
because I wanted

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.460
to study a career in music.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.620
But in Tijuana, the music
school wasn't really

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.260
that developed yet.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:06.309
So I decided to try to start
getting my-- what is it called?

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:08.281
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:02:08.281 --> 00:02:09.800
SPEAKER: Oh, like the classes?

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.100
JULIETA VENEGAS: Yeah, like
the points to get to SDSU.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.390
SPEAKER: The credits.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.848
JULIETA VENEGAS:
Yeah, the credits.

00:02:13.848 --> 00:02:16.390
And I was in the middle of
that when I went to Mexico City

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.180
to visit.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.690
And I just kind of fell
in love with the city.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.980
I was like, I don't want
to leave this place.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.660
It just completely--
it blew my mind.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.720
I mean, I'd been in
big cities-- not really

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.020
that kind of big cities.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:36.290
I'd been in-- I don't know, like
Los Angeles or San Francisco.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.220
But when I got to Mexico
City, it's like part of me

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.140
completed itself.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.080
I was always in Tijuana
thinking about Mexico.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.561
My dad was so much about Mexico.

00:02:44.561 --> 00:02:46.060
We were always
talking about Mexico.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.560
But Tijuana was
not-- it was a mix.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.230
It wasn't exactly Mexican.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.010
It wasn't exactly US.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.239
So when I saw Mexico City, I
decided I had to live there.

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.030
SPEAKER: Of course.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.139
JULIETA VENEGAS: And so
I went back to Tijuana,

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:03.930
picked up my stuff.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.340
And I've been there 20 years.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.430
That's the personal side.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.700
Musically, I started
studying classical piano

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.200
when I was eight.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.700
My parents thought
it would be good

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.340
for us to not watch too much TV.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.530
So they had us studying
piano and all kinds

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.585
of lessons-- ballet, painting,
whatever came to their minds.

00:03:25.585 --> 00:03:26.960
And I was terrible
at everything.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.810
And for some reason, I came
out being really good at music.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:41.215
So I studied classical,
like-- [SPANISH].

00:03:41.215 --> 00:03:42.590
SPEAKER: Just
individual lessons?

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.089
JULIETA VENEGAS:
Particular classes,

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:46.040
yeah, for like eight years.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.509
And then I started
playing in bands.

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:50.300
When I was in high
school, a friend of mine

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.290
invited me to a band
as a keyboard player.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.630
And I discovered
improvisation, and singing,

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.110
and just kind of-- it was a
completely different path.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.860
And the important
thing for me there

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.430
was that I discovered
songwriting.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:11.900
And that was basically what made
me shift my path completely.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.340
And I started doing
songwriting after that.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.970
And also, at the
same time I started

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.510
doing music for theater.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.530
So it was instrumental
and it was also songs.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.250
And so I kept on
developing that.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.310
And then by the time
I was, what, like 22,

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.041
that's when I went
to Mexico City.

00:04:32.041 --> 00:04:34.040
I was still kind of
searching for what I wanted.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.840
I kept on putting bands
together because I always

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.220
thought I had to be in a band.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.770
And it never worked out.

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.380
I always did a lot of writing
with a few different people.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.071
And when I got to Mexico City,
I actually put like posters up

00:04:47.071 --> 00:04:48.320
trying to get a band together.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.600
That's the way we did
it before like internet.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.360
You modern people
wouldn't know about that.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.430
But I did like posters in record
stores and stuff like that.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.887
And I put a band together.

00:04:59.887 --> 00:05:00.970
It didn't work out either.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.605
But in one of those shows,
I met three of the guys

00:05:04.605 --> 00:05:06.730
from [INAUDIBLE], which
was really important for me

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.270
because I started going
out with one of them.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.980
SPEAKER: Oh, yeah.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:11.640
[LAUGHS]

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.230
JULIETA VENEGAS:
And no, but also, it

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.350
was very important
for me because he's

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.350
someone who really
influenced me in saying like,

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.060
why do you want to keep
putting bands together?

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.080
Just do your thing.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.526
You have these great
songs in your drawer,

00:05:24.526 --> 00:05:26.900
but you keep putting bands
together and making our songs.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.150
And it's just like--

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.160
And I always dreamt of
getting an accordion.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.330
It was always like my dream.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.504
And he pushed me
into like, just get

00:05:33.504 --> 00:05:35.920
your accordion, and your drum
machine, and leave me alone.

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.410
So I started doing
shows by myself

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.280
with just piano, accordion,
and a drum machine.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.340
And I started opening for a
bunch of bands in Mexico City.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.320
And I actually did
like an eight track

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.570
demo, which was a big deal.

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:56.107
And a lot of people started
giving it to friends.

00:05:56.107 --> 00:05:58.440
And it kind of became like a
[? "Waka Waka." ?] Like oh,

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.130
there's this girl.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.130
And she plays accordion.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.580
And she sings.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.010
And that way, I started playing
with a few musician friends.

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:10.150
And in those shows,
I don't know.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.250
Things started happening really
quickly, all of a sudden.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.150
Nothing happened for
ages, for a long time.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.210
But then all of a sudden, people
started showing up to my shows.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.994
And record labels
started showing up

00:06:19.994 --> 00:06:21.660
to my shows-- people
from record labels.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.210
Like three different record
labels were interested.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.580
They'd heard the demo.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.440
And one thing led to
another, and here we are.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.366
No, I'm kidding.

00:06:31.366 --> 00:06:32.157
SPEAKER: Fantastic.

00:06:32.157 --> 00:06:35.540
JULIETA VENEGAS:
So I got signed.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:36.760
And that was a long time ago.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.720
That was almost, what,
like-- long time ago.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.530
It must have been like in--
I got signed in, I think,

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.360
in '95, '96 or something.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.510
And then after that,
it's been like-- I mean,

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.510
I put two albums that
were not so well known

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:55.060
outside of Mexico, which were
"Aqui" and "Bueninvento."

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.400
But I was touring a lot anyway.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.840
But I really wanted
to tour more.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.600
I feel like I was just kind
of touring around Mexico

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.070
but it was really
hard for me to leave.

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:07.570
And also, I had this sort of
revelation between my second

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:08.400
and my third album.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.410
I had like a year where I
had this sort of crisis.

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:13.920
Like what kind of songwriter
do I really want to be?

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.320
Do I really want to be
this very experimental sort

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.990
of songwriter?

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.470
Or do I want to express and
communicate more with people?

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:26.590
And that was like a year
of thinking, and writing,

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.530
and having this super
crisis, and what do I want.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:33.415
Because my second album had
been really critically acclaimed

00:07:33.415 --> 00:07:36.530
but very difficult
album in every sense.

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:39.510
Recording it was difficult.
Touring with it was difficult.

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:41.090
It was just like really--

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:46.520
And I was like, maybe I'm
taking the wrong sort of path.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.610
Maybe I want something
else as a songwriter.

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:53.700
I wanted to do songs that
connected differently

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.820
with people, not
like-- one day, I

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.560
remember being on
the stage and sort

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.931
of playing my super complicated
and wonderful songs.

00:08:01.931 --> 00:08:04.430
And I just felt like people
were just kind of staring at me.

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:08.020
Like, who is this Martian?

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.840
And I just kind of wanted--
you know, I want to connect.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.810
That's what music is,
about communication.

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:14.880
And that's what I wanted.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.480
So that took a lot
of self-analyzing.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.200
And I never believed
in analysis.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.490
So I did my own self-analysis.

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:24.810
And that's how-- you
know, I started writing

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:26.400
"Si," which was my third album.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.900
And that was kind
of a breakthrough.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.420
I think that was the
first time that I actually

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.600
went into the radio,
that I started actually

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.260
sounding on the
radio, that people

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:39.280
were like-- a lot of people
think that's my first album.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.039
But that's my third album.

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:44.150
So after that, a lot of
things have happened.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:45.870
But that was
already a while ago.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:47.700
That was in 2003.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.770
So it's been while.

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:50.590
SPEAKER: Perfect.

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:52.310
And I think you're
doing a fantastic job,

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:54.630
just connecting with
people with your music.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:58.000
You can really feel it
when you hear your songs.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.860
And one of the themes that
I'm hearing in your career

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:05.530
is this sense of just
being persistent, right?

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:09.110
Like even if things were not
happening at the beginning,

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:15.140
even if there was a
try, fail, try again.

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.570
And then in the end,
it actually happened.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:21.120
And it became a very
big success for you.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.370
Can you tell us a
little bit about how

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:26.130
you were thinking about
this process of, I need

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.300
to get up, try again,
try something different,

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:31.670
redefine myself, going to
even self-analysis, which

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:32.740
[INAUDIBLE].

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.910
JULIETA VENEGAS: Well,
what happens, I think,

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.450
is that I really enjoy
the process of things.

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:42.600
I don't believe in, this is
what I have to be by this time.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:47.130
This is what I-- I really love
the process of how you become

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:49.060
who you are, in every sense.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.970
Even now that I've already put
out like seven or eight albums,

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.110
that I've been
touring forever, I

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:58.920
enjoy what I do also because I
enjoy every bit of what I do,

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.980
every different part, what
it means to do what I do,

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.990
which is every time
I finish a tour,

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:06.330
I dedicate myself like four
months to just writing.

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.095
I don't do anything else.

00:10:08.095 --> 00:10:09.470
And then when I'm
touring, I just

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:11.270
really enjoy the tour itself.

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:12.230
I enjoy the shows.

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:16.491
I enjoy that
connection with people.

00:10:16.491 --> 00:10:17.990
I think the important
thing is that.

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:20.690
It's not only to
think about how you

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:23.000
get to where you want
to get to, but it's just

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.226
like the whole
learning experience

00:10:26.226 --> 00:10:28.100
and the whole learning
process, which I think

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.070
is really a constant thing.

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:31.866
It's not something
that starts and ends

00:10:31.866 --> 00:10:32.990
when you get what you want.

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:35.129
You're always sort of
learning from what--

00:10:35.129 --> 00:10:37.420
even when you get what you
want, it's through learning.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.900
You still wonder if that
was the right thing.

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.650
You keep going.

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:44.460
And I think what I
really like to do

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:47.680
is to ask questions all the
time about what I really want.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.910
And I'm very curious
about songwriting.

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:54.770
And I'm still curious about it,
about getting into the studio

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:55.790
and see what happens.

00:10:55.790 --> 00:11:00.590
And it's not just, oh now, it's
sort of like a routine thing.

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:06.720
I still feel the same
nerves, the same intensity

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:10.560
of trying a new song and
just putting it together,

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.340
and then arranging it, and
then going to the studio

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:16.450
and producing it.

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:19.630
It's still sort of
new in a way for me.

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:21.090
When I start
actually doing it, I

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:23.260
don't feel like
I know the steps.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:24.750
And I really prefer it that way.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:25.950
Because I-- I don't know.

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:29.120
I always think that it's
better to forget what you learn

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.120
and keep learning, even
if you have to relearn.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.870
It's actually better.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:34.930
It's a better feeling.

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:40.320
And I've always let myself
be guided by my intuition

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.080
more than what I know, more
than what I've learned.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.050
It's more like,
what is my instinct

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:48.100
telling me to do at this moment?

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.610
And that's something I
ask myself all the time.

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:51.850
SPEAKER: That sounds great.

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:53.370
And I think it's great advice.

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:56.770
And that's part of all this
just redefining yourself.

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:58.170
Just keep asking questions.

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:00.200
It sounds like
along the way, there

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.370
were also some opportunities
and some challenges

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:06.240
that you might have faced,
being Mexican American

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:10.029
and then just trying to break
into an international market.

00:12:10.029 --> 00:12:11.570
Can you tell us how
you were thinking

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:15.470
about that process of,
oh, wait, maybe this

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:16.760
is becoming something big.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.320
Or do I want to go that way?

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.350
Do I want to consolidate?

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:23.930
How do I wanted to think
about myself in the future

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:26.820
if there is not a lot
of-- I'm in point A,

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.700
and I want to get to
point B. It's more

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.740
self-reflection along the way.

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:33.480
How did this process
happen to you?

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.250
JULIETA VENEGAS:
Well, when I think

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:44.400
about my career in the sense
of maybe when I found myself,

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.842
people ask me a
lot of why I don't

00:12:45.842 --> 00:12:47.050
sing in English, for example.

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:49.346
I think the language has
been something that's

00:12:49.346 --> 00:12:50.470
been very important for me.

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:53.860
Because even though I
grew up in a border city,

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:57.300
even if I'm bilingual,
writing in Spanish to me

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:58.864
is much more natural.

00:12:58.864 --> 00:13:01.030
I mean, I've never tried
writing in English, really.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:02.530
And it's not something
that-- I know

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:05.380
that now, I see a lot of artists
who find it more natural.

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.080
And I think it's
great, especially

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.380
when you live in the US.

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:09.170
You speak Spanish.

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:10.460
You speak English.

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:13.580
But my mom always spoke to
me in Spanish, you know--

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:16.490
and my boyfriend.

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:21.740
My emotional life has been
constructed in [SPANISH].

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:24.585
So for me, writing has to
do with my own language.

00:13:24.585 --> 00:13:26.710
So at one point, yeah, they
started asking me like,

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:28.650
aren't you going to
do like a crossover?

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:30.840
And I'm like, I
would like people

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.550
to cross over to my side.

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:35.180
This is my language.

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:37.460
This is what I celebrate
when I write a song.

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:40.680
And I think part of
the search for me--

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.280
because I'm influenced by
a lot of books in English,

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.510
and obviously,
musicians in English.

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:49.830
And the English language is very
present in my life, at least.

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:51.690
But when I sit
down to write, it's

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:53.640
more connected with my emotions.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.470
Spanish is much more
connected to my emotions.

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:57.870
So I find it a lot more natural.

00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:59.328
I think that's the
only place where

00:13:59.328 --> 00:14:04.050
I found-- like at one
point when I put out

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:07.630
my fourth album, "Limon y Sal,"
it started getting super big.

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:10.910
And yeah, it's
starting to grow a lot.

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:12.280
We want to do more of Europe.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.670
We want to go to Germany.

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:15.010
We want to go to Italy.

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:17.950
It started just kind
of growing a lot.

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:21.614
And at one point, things
started coming up.

00:14:21.614 --> 00:14:24.030
Like, oh you know to sell in
Germany, you have to do this.

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.550
You have to have somebody else
do an arrangement for the song.

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:27.590
And you have to do this.

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:29.440
If you want to
sound in Portugal,

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.120
you have to do a duet with this
artist you've never even met

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.120
who you don't even know.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.240
And you have to do it.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.660
I was like, you know what?

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.470
Let's just let it flow.

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:38.830
Let it be natural.

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.420
If it's not going to happen,
it's not going to happen.

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:43.750
Maybe I needed an
extra bit of ambition

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.260
that I didn't really
have, because I kind of

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.310
enjoyed what I was doing.

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:49.351
And I was like if people
want to listen to what I

00:14:49.351 --> 00:14:51.200
do the way I do it, it's great.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.820
But I don't want to
sort of invent something

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:58.450
that I'm not to [INAUDIBLE]
in radio and somewhere else.

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:01.630
We eventually did go to Germany
to do a tour, and it was great.

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:04.360
And we are eventually
did go to Italy.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.270
You know, eventually,
things happened.

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:08.517
But it didn't
happen at the point

00:15:08.517 --> 00:15:10.100
where everybody
wanted them to happen.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.430
Like yes, now is
the moment where

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:14.740
Europe is going to be
taken, that kind of thing.

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:16.190
I was like, I don't know.

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:17.940
I mean, let's just
kind of let it flow.

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:19.880
And let's-- I don't know.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:23.150
I just don't think that
I really needed that.

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.015
And I don't call myself
non-ambitious because I am.

00:15:26.015 --> 00:15:28.390
The fact that I'm doing music
and that I'm still doing it

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:29.950
now means that I guess I do.

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:32.820
And I think we all need
a little bit of ambition

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.320
in our lives to do
anything, anything at all.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.650
It's like you wake
up in the morning

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:39.460
and you say, I want
to get up and do

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:42.370
something, that requires
some sort of ambition,

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:44.950
and sort of growing, and
learning, and all that.

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:49.520
But at one point, you wonder
how far you want to take things.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.250
And I was like, this
is all that I am.

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:53.650
I can't be more than I am.

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:55.220
I can't invent
somebody that I'm not.

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:57.560
So this as far as I'll go.

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:58.940
And then we'll see what happens.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:15:59.820
SPEAKER: Of course.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.510
And I think the organic
growth that you're

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:05.700
mentioning without making a
lot of sacrifices actually

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:08.680
makes your music
and you as an artist

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.780
very authentic, very original.

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.290
And just taking a quick
look around the group here,

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:16.520
I know the majority of
us here are Latinos.

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:17.940
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:21.590
But I even see, for
instance, people from Germany

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:23.540
here in the auditorium
with us, which

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:26.820
is really, really fantastic.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:30.160
And that's part of all
this cultural interaction.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.470
Yeah, it's funny that
you mentioned Germany.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:37.640
As part of this multicultural
interaction of understanding

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.560
what's specific to
every market, what

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:44.390
needs to be adjusted so
that you can be successful.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:48.200
As Latinos, many of us
know the big challenges

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.560
that we see-- just
going international,

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:54.310
being successful, sometimes
the stereotypes and all that.

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:57.790
And I think we're all
very conscious about that.

00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:00.360
So rather than asking you
about those challenges,

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.910
I'd like to ask you
about the opportunities.

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:05.819
What do you see as an
opportunity for being Latino?

00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:08.160
For instance, I
see in your career,

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.060
there were a lot of partnerships
along the way-- people

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.510
who, also being Latinos,
they help you along the way.

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:17.589
Maybe they taught you,
hey, we should do this,

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:20.980
or we should, I don't know, form
a band, something like that.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.790
Can you talk a little bit
more about that positive side

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:26.690
that you see as something
very special and unique

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:28.164
of the Latino culture?

00:17:28.164 --> 00:17:29.580
JULIETA VENEGAS:
Yeah, definitely.

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:35.690
I think that Latin America has--
we're all connected, not only

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:37.050
through our language.

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:41.240
But also culturally,
we're all have this--

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.780
we're all very
complex countries.

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:45.170
We've had very
complex histories.

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:50.652
And we're racially very
diverse in a different sense

00:17:50.652 --> 00:17:52.360
than how it is here
in the United States.

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.496
I mean, in Mexico, [SPANISH].

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:01.190
Most countries in Latin America
are very much mixed cultures.

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:04.570
And we grew up with
a sort of richness

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:10.750
and also with all this great
history and terrible history

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:11.980
of conquest.

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:14.350
But also, that is what
made us who we are, right.

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:15.141
SPEAKER: Of course.

00:18:15.141 --> 00:18:18.730
JULIETA VENEGAS: So I do think
that we have that in common.

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:21.240
And culturally,
that makes us very--

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:24.880
I think each one has their
own identity and very

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.140
proud identities.

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:29.210
And I mean, for
example in Mexico,

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:32.460
I think that we are-- I
mean I think Mexico is just

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:36.470
like a brilliant and amazing
and surprising country, even

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:37.610
with all our problems.

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:39.160
And I speak of
Mexico in particular

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.260
because I don't like to
speak just so generally.

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:43.820
At the same time,
we're very corrupt,

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:45.070
and we have a lot of problems.

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:46.870
And that's why a
lot of people just

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:51.540
have the need to leave and
try to make things happen

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.490
for them in a different place.

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:58.000
Because there's also a lot of
poverty, a lot of violence.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:05.930
There's many things that make
our country a very mixed place.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:08.037
It's beautiful.

00:19:08.037 --> 00:19:10.370
I haven't been able to leave,
and I don't want to leave.

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:11.953
The other day,
somebody was asking me,

00:19:11.953 --> 00:19:14.710
why don't you come
here, like to the US?

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:16.550
Because I have two
nationalities, right?

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:18.390
So it's like [SPANISH].

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:20.262
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:23.530
But I'm in love with that city.

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:25.620
I want to educate my
daughter in that country.

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:30.690
And I want her to be
proud of her country.

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:32.605
And it's a beautiful place.

00:19:32.605 --> 00:19:33.230
It's beautiful.

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:35.880
And it's also
heartbreaking sometimes

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.831
to see a lot of things
that are happening.

00:19:37.831 --> 00:19:40.080
And I've written a lot about
that in some of my songs.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.250
And it's always
present because it's

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:44.990
sort of like a different
pain that you feel maybe

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:49.150
and a different love that
also you feel for that place,

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:50.830
for the people that we are.

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:53.059
And I think that's something
a lot of people share

00:19:53.059 --> 00:19:55.350
in different countries in
Latin America-- that you have

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:59.940
this sort of love and fear,
and at the same time, hope

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:04.082
of the things coming together
and working out for everybody.

00:20:04.082 --> 00:20:05.300
SPEAKER: Of course.

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:08.360
And being from Mexico City,
I might be slightly biased,

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.420
but I agree with you.

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:11.080
It's a fantastic
city to live in.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.530
And everybody
should go and visit.

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:18.060
But also, there's one
thing that you touched on

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:22.370
that I think it's very specific
to Mexico in your example,

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:27.130
but it could happen in other
Latin American countries.

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:32.510
There is this city,
this country's

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:33.930
certainly not perfect.

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:36.320
It's far from it.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.160
We know there are huge
problems that there

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:43.470
are in society, in
government, in every aspect

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:45.020
of everyday life.

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:47.900
However, that doesn't mean
you don't love the country.

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:50.335
That doesn't mean you don't
absolutely love the city,

00:20:50.335 --> 00:20:53.020
and like returning there,
and like establishing

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:54.570
your entire life there.

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:57.220
And I think that's what
sets many Latin American

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:58.310
cultures apart.

00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:59.170
There's this love.

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:03.840
There's this familiar
feeling of everywhere we go.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:09.640
Could you say this has
modified, or in a way, shaped

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:13.440
the way you do music, the way
you think about your career

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:18.070
and everything, as compared to
any other international artist

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:20.470
you might know?

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:21.720
JULIETA VENEGAS: I'm not sure.

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.790
I mean, I can't really compare
myself with other artists.

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:26.222
I can say, oh, I
did it like this

00:21:26.222 --> 00:21:28.500
when they did it like that.

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:34.510
I think everybody's music has
to do with their identity in one

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:35.420
way or another.

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:37.695
No matter what style
you make, it's personal.

00:21:37.695 --> 00:21:38.570
It's always personal.

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:40.550
So it's always
about who you are,

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:43.760
where you're from, what's
your history like, what

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:47.780
you like to look at in your own
country or in other countries.

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:50.030
For me, making music
has to do with my root.

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:53.570
And that's not only
in the obvious sense,

00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:56.260
which is like folklore
Mexican [SPANISH].

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:59.644
It's also, in every sense,
culturally-- the way

00:21:59.644 --> 00:22:02.060
that I think has to do with
the fact that I'm from Tijuana

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:02.970
but I went to Mexico.

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:05.750
All my decisions have been based
on the fact that I am who I am.

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:07.416
And I think that music
is made that way.

00:22:07.416 --> 00:22:10.010
Everything-- art
is made that way.

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:10.740
It's personal.

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:14.020
So you're kind of telling
your own story in your music.

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:17.170
And I can use-- for
example in a song,

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:19.360
I'll put it this super
Norteno accordion,

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.700
but I also like to
put in something

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:26.640
like a super synthesizer
and mix it up.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.140
Because that's the
person that I am.

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:29.889
Maybe it sounds kind
of schizophrenic when

00:22:29.889 --> 00:22:32.860
you talk about it conceptually.

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:34.280
But for me, it works.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:38.180
I don't find it to be--
in the song, it works.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:41.430
And I think that has to do with
the fact that I'm from Tijuana,

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:42.930
and I grew up
listening to-- I mean,

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:46.680
my mom would sing [INAUDIBLE]
on her way to school

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:47.826
every morning.

00:22:47.826 --> 00:22:49.284
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:22:50.256 --> 00:22:52.196
That's kind of funny.

00:22:52.196 --> 00:22:53.320
But she did, every morning.

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.132
She'd do [? "Kri Kri" ?]
or [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:03.303
So you know, it's not so
far away from my [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:03.303 --> 00:23:08.540
that I mix that-- a Norteno
accordion in a really

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:10.270
melodic sort of idea.

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:13.790
And I find the festivity
of the accordion

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:16.920
has to do with my
character, and also,

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:20.945
the seriousness of a piano
or the seriousness of--

00:23:20.945 --> 00:23:23.530
And I think that we're all
telling our own stories.

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:25.560
I'm kind of telling my
stories in my songs.

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.680
And every story that
I tell in my lyrics,

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:32.350
or also musically-- the way that
I decide to dress up the song

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:33.450
has to do with who I am.

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:39.250
So yes, I think that definitely
Mexico, and also US, and also

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:42.519
Tijuana, and also my
family, and whatever

00:23:42.519 --> 00:23:44.060
it is that I'm
feeling at that moment

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:46.712
has to do with what I'm
doing when I'm writing.

00:23:46.712 --> 00:23:47.653
SPEAKER: Of course.

00:23:47.653 --> 00:23:50.880
Is the accordion your
favorite instrument?

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:53.980
JULIETA VENEGAS: Well actually,
we'll keep this a secret.

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:58.480
But my favorite
instrument as a piano.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:02.617
I would say that
I'm a [SPANISH].

00:24:04.952 --> 00:24:07.460
I'm a pianist dressed up
as an accordion player.

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.150
Because I'm actually a pianist.

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:11.212
I write on the piano.

00:24:11.212 --> 00:24:12.670
Actually when I
write songs now-- I

00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:15.130
used to do it differently,
but it's always been changing.

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:20.790
But now, I sit down with a
piano with nothing but my phone.

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:22.300
And I write songs in piano.

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:23.890
And maybe I'll use
a drum machine,

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:25.190
but it's mostly just piano.

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:28.970
And after that, I'll start
building the song up.

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:30.650
And sometimes, I'll
use the accordion.

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:31.610
Sometimes I won't.

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:33.700
It's more like for arranging.

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:34.600
I love arranging.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:38.294
And also, I love to play it on
the stage because it's so fun.

00:24:38.294 --> 00:24:39.460
You bring out the accordion.

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:39.980
It's like, yeah.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.021
It's like bringing out
like a lasso or something.

00:24:42.021 --> 00:24:44.320
It's like woohoo.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:45.190
It's really fun.

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:49.280
And I think that's what
the shows are about.

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:51.410
It's about fun and also
just kind of making it

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:54.159
like all different
kinds of feelings.

00:24:54.159 --> 00:24:55.700
And I think definitely,
the accordion

00:24:55.700 --> 00:25:00.170
brings sort of like a festive
and sort of a [SPANISH],

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:02.534
a joyous feeling for me.

00:25:02.534 --> 00:25:03.274
SPEAKER: Perfect.

00:25:03.274 --> 00:25:03.940
And don't worry.

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:04.982
We'll keep this a secret.

00:25:04.982 --> 00:25:06.148
JULIETA VENEGAS: OK, thanks.

00:25:06.148 --> 00:25:07.820
SPEAKER: Disregarding
the fact that this

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:10.600
is going to be posted in
Talks At Google on the YouTube

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.540
channel.

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:14.020
Other than that, It's a
secret between you and me.

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:16.940
JULIETA VENEGAS: OK.

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:19.900
SPEAKER: With this duality
that you're talking about--

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:24.200
and I think it reflects on a
lot of the music that you do.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.430
It's the seriousness
of the piano,

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:28.930
but then bringing
out the accordion.

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:31.430
And as you mentioned,
it's like bringing a lasso

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:34.730
to somebody who plays the
seriousness of classic piano

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:37.350
music.

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:41.010
Is that how you
always see things?

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:43.760
Do you try to mix all
these different elements,

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:47.077
see what works better
in every single case

00:25:47.077 --> 00:25:47.910
and then just do it?

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:49.300
Is that a conscious process?

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:51.780
Or is it just however
it's coming for you

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:53.580
and you feel in the moment?

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:55.990
JULIETA VENEGAS: Well,
we come back to the idea

00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:57.030
that I said before.

00:25:57.030 --> 00:25:58.560
It's intuition.

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:02.890
I keep letting intuition
sort of guide me.

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:04.530
I'm not conceptual
in that sense.

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:07.920
It's not like I started
writing a song and think,

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.350
this has to be
this sort of song.

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:11.300
And it has to finish
sounding like this.

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:12.850
I never really know.

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:14.460
It's very organic.

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:16.680
I always say it's like knitting.

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.750
Writing a song, you
put the verse in.

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:20.630
You kind of bring it
on to something else.

00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:23.976
And it's sort of
like a live process.

00:26:23.976 --> 00:26:25.850
You don't really know
what's going to happen.

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:27.745
And it happens when
I'm writing a song.

00:26:27.745 --> 00:26:29.700
And it also happens
when I'm arranging it.

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:33.320
It's sort of a live thing.

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.945
And I think that's
the magic of it.

00:26:34.945 --> 00:26:36.320
And that's why I
keep on doing it

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:40.980
because, it's so-- you
don't know what's going

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:43.030
to happen-- unpredictable.

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:46.730
So I think that's what
I really like about it.

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:48.580
I don't think that after--

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:50.180
I mean, now I know
that I can write.

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:51.513
I can sit down and write a song.

00:26:51.513 --> 00:26:53.341
Because I used to be
like very doubtful.

00:26:53.341 --> 00:26:55.090
I've always been a
skeptic in every sense.

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:58.490
So it took me years
to figure out why

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:00.660
people are going to my shows.

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:02.430
It took me years
to say yeah, OK.

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:03.850
Yeah, I put some albums out.

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:08.080
And I never really
believed the whole thing.

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.120
It's always like,
yeah, this is who I am,

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:13.560
but it doesn't mean that
nothing is going to happen.

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.772
And I would always say
like, well, I'm not sure

00:27:15.772 --> 00:27:18.230
when I sit down, I'm going to
actually come up with a song.

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:20.702
But now, after this
time, I know that I am

00:27:20.702 --> 00:27:21.910
going to come up with a song.

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:24.560
Because I like it, and I'm
going to sit there until I do.

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:28.090
And I'm very like-- and also
that I'm very disciplined.

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:33.860
When I sit down to write, I
do the 9:00 to 5:00, actually.

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:34.710
That's what I do.

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:38.220
I stop the tour.

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:40.702
I don't like trying to
write when I'm traveling.

00:27:40.702 --> 00:27:42.160
When I'm traveling,
I like to read.

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.910
I read all the time.

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:48.510
But when I'm writing, it's
like 9:00 to 5:00 thing.

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:49.440
I stop for lunch.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:51.014
But I-- and also
having a daughter

00:27:51.014 --> 00:27:52.680
makes me more disciplined
in that sense.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.470
Because it used to be when I
was going to write an album,

00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:59.379
I could take like the
day and sort of just read

00:27:59.379 --> 00:28:00.420
and then go to the piano.

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:02.503
But now I know that I have
those hours in for her.

00:28:02.503 --> 00:28:05.710
It's also easier to say, OK,
you're done at this time,

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:07.550
and we can just hang out.

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:09.980
And for me, it's like I
can disconnect and just

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.350
be where I am.

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:12.340
SPEAKER: Of course.

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:13.750
It's funny you mentioned that.

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:16.600
Because at least for me, from
an external point of view--

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.990
I'm not a musician,
not a songwriter,

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:21.710
not an artist certainly,
even though I play piano,

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:23.990
but that's about it.

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:28.320
For a lot of people outside
this artist environment,

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.530
it sounds like it's a
matter of inspiration.

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:32.880
Like you're basically
walking down life.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:34.370
And then inspiration comes.

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:37.060
And you're like, [GASP]
I need a piece of paper

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:38.914
and then start writing down.

00:28:38.914 --> 00:28:40.830
But it turns out that's
not the case with you,

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:45.570
that you do the formal I sit
down and then at some point,

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:47.120
ideas are going to come.

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.540
Is that typical for
everybody who writes songs?

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:53.564
Is that specific to Julieta?

00:28:53.564 --> 00:28:55.730
JULIETA VENEGAS: I think
everybody's different, too.

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:59.120
I don't know how other
people write songs.

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:03.030
I've never had that
miracle, that idea

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:04.620
that will just come to my head.

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:06.120
And [GASP] I have
a song in my head.

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.328
Let me sit down and write it.

00:29:07.328 --> 00:29:09.930
No, I have to kind
of search for it.

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:13.550
And I like it that way
because at first, you're

00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:14.930
kind of fearful
when you sit down

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:16.320
and you see the blank notebook.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:19.170
Because also, I don't even
have lyrics when I sit down.

00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:21.020
I write everything together.

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:23.170
Maybe I'll have like
one line or something,

00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:24.710
and I'll start
working with that.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:28.410
But usually, it
all comes together.

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:33.250
I mean, I'll just kind of
like-- I start with one line.

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:37.500
And that'll bring me
onto the rest of it.

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:41.702
And so I think other
people will-- I mean,

00:29:41.702 --> 00:29:43.160
I'm sure there are
people who write

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:47.720
on tour and people who like
to wait for the songs to come.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:53.120
But I like the fact that I can
sit down and find something.

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.649
Because also, if
nothing comes up,

00:29:54.649 --> 00:29:56.940
I'll just keep on playing
the piano, which is something

00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:57.773
that I really enjoy.

00:29:57.773 --> 00:29:59.280
It's a different thing.

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.520
And also, I don't
like to feel like I'm

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:02.600
searching for the song.

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.266
I'm just like, I'm
going to play and let

00:30:04.266 --> 00:30:07.630
it come, and that kind of thing.

00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:10.906
But yeah, It's just that I've
always been very much in love

00:30:10.906 --> 00:30:11.530
with the piano.

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:14.210
And playing the piano is also
kind of therapeutic for me.

00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:17.700
I mean, I just kind of sit down
and improvise all the time.

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:18.990
I do read notes.

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:22.500
And I do some exercises
to warm my hands

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:27.854
and kind of like-- but I also
just kind of like to improvise.

00:30:27.854 --> 00:30:28.796
SPEAKER: Perfect.

00:30:28.796 --> 00:30:30.420
And I want to be
conscious of the time.

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:31.960
I think we have time.

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.099
We might open the
floor to a couple

00:30:34.099 --> 00:30:35.390
of questions from the audience.

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:36.200
JULIETA VENEGAS: Oh, great.

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.470
SPEAKER: That's fine with you?

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:39.220
Just a quick question
before that-- what's

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:41.230
your favorite Julieta song?

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:44.790
JULIETA VENEGAS: [LAUGHS] I
don't have a favorite Julieta

00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:45.290
song.

00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:46.630
It's crazy.

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:50.570
When I finish my
album-- I'm serious.

00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:51.880
You look at me like, oh my god.

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:52.400
She's crazy.

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:52.900
No--

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:55.020
SPEAKER: No, I'm curious.

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:55.997
That's what's going on.

00:30:55.997 --> 00:30:57.400
JULIETA VENEGAS: OK.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:00.950
Whenever I finish an album that
I-- I mean, when I'm writing,

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:03.380
maybe I'll have a favorite
like for a day or two.

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:06.270
And then I come up with another
one which is my favorite.

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:08.030
And then that--

00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:10.420
But when I finish an
album, I actually--

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.300
when I'm done with the
whole writing process

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:14.820
and producing it, I'll
listen to it obsessively.

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:17.070
I'll be all day like wondering
if that's the right way

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:19.350
to structure it, if that's
the right way to do it,

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:20.440
and blah, blah, blah.

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:23.000
And when I'm done with it,
it's like, OK, I'm done.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:23.500
That's it.

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:25.250
I never listen to it again.

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:29.670
I might listen to a song when
I'm trying to bring it back

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:34.720
for a show or-- but
I'm very, very lazy

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:36.130
about listening to my own songs.

00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:38.310
It's like-- no, I'm serious.

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:39.800
It's like looking into a mirror.

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:42.006
You look into a mirror,
and yeah, you're

00:31:42.006 --> 00:31:43.130
wearing makeup or whatever.

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:44.300
You comb your hair.

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:45.280
You shave or whatever.

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:46.610
And then that's it.

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:47.920
There's no surprises there.

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:50.304
And for me, listening
to music has to do with,

00:31:50.304 --> 00:31:51.720
wow, how do you
come up with that?

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:56.520
Or, oh-- you know, just
being moved by somebody,

00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:58.870
by their story, by
what's happening

00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:59.980
to you at that moment.

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:02.160
And that happens to me
with other people's music,

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:03.850
not with mine.

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:05.170
SPEAKER: That's really funny.

00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:06.160
OK, perfect.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:09.378
Let's open it up for
audience questions.

00:32:09.378 --> 00:32:10.842
AUDIENCE: Hola, Julieta.

00:32:10.842 --> 00:32:13.290
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:32:14.386 --> 00:32:15.844
JULIETA VENEGAS:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:19.620
AUDIENCE: I always say
before being a Mexican,

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:21.260
I am from Tijuana.

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:22.940
And I am the same as you.

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:26.160
I was born in the US
but I grew up in Mexico.

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:30.240
And my comment or question
is related to that.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:36.120
I have the feeling
that for people

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:37.920
that come from Latin
American countries,

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:40.447
people focus on
the negative part.

00:32:40.447 --> 00:32:41.030
And it's true.

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:43.000
We are not blind
to what's going on.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.600
But there's so many things
positive about every place

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:49.490
in this planet that I always
find it a little bit sad.

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:51.010
I don't get offended
because I know.

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:56.180
But can you share with us
something that you really

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:57.290
like from Tijuana?

00:32:57.290 --> 00:33:01.110
Like I can tell you that nothing
beats a concert in Tijuana.

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:04.785
Broken Espanol in Tijuana is
the best thing in the world.

00:33:04.785 --> 00:33:07.650
JULIETA VENEGAS: No, definitely.

00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:10.590
I think Tijuana is
a very unique place.

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:12.610
That's what it has--
and you don't realize it

00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:14.610
when you're growing up
there-- but how different

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:17.170
it is from any other city,
either in the US or in Mexico.

00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:20.660
It has nothing to do with-- and
not even with any other border

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:21.160
city.

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.210
I love border cities.

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:24.751
And that's something that I--
whenever I'm in a boarder city,

00:33:24.751 --> 00:33:27.520
I feel like I can understand
the idea of living

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:30.427
between two countries always.

00:33:30.427 --> 00:33:32.760
But I think definitely, Tijuana
is a very special border

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.676
because it's bordered
with California, people.

00:33:34.676 --> 00:33:36.490
I mean, come on.

00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:39.970
And you know, the coast is
beautiful, and the food.

00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:42.720
The food is definitely amazing.

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:46.790
So yeah, I really love
having grown up there.

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:49.830
I don't think I could possibly
choose any other city.

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:51.620
Because also when I
got to Mexico City,

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:54.170
people found me to be a bit
of a Martian being Norteno.

00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:57.100
Because Norteno-- people in
the north of the country,

00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:58.350
we're very direct.

00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:00.970
We're just like, this
is what I'm thinking.

00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:02.360
And it comes out like that.

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:06.630
And in Mexico City, I had a hard
time getting adapted to the way

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:07.330
that people are.

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:09.330
They're very [SPANISH].

00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:11.357
So they go around,
and they don't

00:34:11.357 --> 00:34:12.550
say what they're thinking.

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:16.429
And Nortenos are like,
yeah, just say it.

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:18.410
So yeah definitely,
I think-- yeah,

00:34:18.410 --> 00:34:20.929
and I think that the
public in Tijuana

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:22.949
are just like crazy and great.

00:34:22.949 --> 00:34:25.410
And I always like--

00:34:25.410 --> 00:34:26.909
And my family lives
there, actually.

00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:28.825
They still live between
Tijuana and San Diego.

00:34:28.825 --> 00:34:30.739
Part of them live in San Diego.

00:34:30.739 --> 00:34:33.456
Some of them go to school in
Tijuana and live in Tijuana.

00:34:33.456 --> 00:34:35.330
Others work in San Diego
and live in Tijuana.

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:39.650
It's kind of like both sides.

00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:41.270
Actually, this is
the way that I would

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:43.440
like to end that comment,
which is a friend of mine

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:45.692
came with me to Tijuana
one day to visit.

00:34:45.692 --> 00:34:46.900
She hadn't been there before.

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:48.733
And I was like, you
haven't been to Tijuana.

00:34:48.733 --> 00:34:49.469
You have to come.

00:34:49.469 --> 00:34:51.469
And she came, and she
didn't bring her passport.

00:34:51.469 --> 00:34:53.719
I'm like, you came
without your passport?

00:34:53.719 --> 00:34:54.386
I mean, what?

00:34:54.386 --> 00:34:56.469
She was like, I thought
we were coming to Tijuana.

00:34:56.469 --> 00:34:57.969
I'm like, yeah, but
going to Tijuana

00:34:57.969 --> 00:34:59.880
is crossing to San Diego.

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:04.045
So I'm like, you're going to get
to know like half the city now.

00:35:04.045 --> 00:35:06.170
It's sort of like the whole
experience kind of goes

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:08.743
together with [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:08.743 --> 00:35:11.741
So yeah, she was kind of mad.

00:35:11.741 --> 00:35:13.365
But I was like sorry,
I didn't explain.

00:35:13.365 --> 00:35:14.156
I thought you knew.

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:21.530
AUDIENCE: I also am a big fan.

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:24.950
And I'm not from the Tijuana,
but I live in Esenada.

00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:26.240
And I'm from Mexico City.

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:30.080
So I relate to many of
the things that you said.

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:31.270
I have two questions.

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:34.890
One is that you said before
that you want to educate

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:38.070
your child in Mexico City.

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:39.810
I would like to know why.

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:45.180
And also, if you can share
some of your favorite music,

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:49.840
if not favorite Julieta
song, some of your favorites

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:51.510
for other artists.

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:53.840
JULIETA VENEGAS: Well,
I think the education

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:58.220
part is because I love her
growing up in Mexico City.

00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:02.460
I think it's just a
city that has so much.

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:05.380
We live in Coyoacan, which is
a part of the city that I love.

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:11.250
And sometimes she
asks me why we don't

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:14.120
live in the beach, which is
kind of a really big conflict.

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.910
And she's only five.

00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:17.546
And I kind of look
at her like, what?

00:36:17.546 --> 00:36:18.670
But we live in Mexico City.

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:20.086
There's no place
better than this.

00:36:20.086 --> 00:36:23.280
And she's like, no,
there's no dolphins here.

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.402
Hello?

00:36:24.402 --> 00:36:26.200
So we do have a bit
of-- I'm sure it's

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.920
going to come up again.

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:31.310
But I like the school
where she's at.

00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:33.600
Actually, she's studying
in a bilingual school,

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:35.780
which I kind of like that
because I'm bilingual.

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:40.530
And I can relate to
her being bilingual,

00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:42.360
although right now,
she's [SPANISH].

00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:48.472
I'll talk to her in English,
being all like, hey,

00:36:48.472 --> 00:36:49.430
let's practice English.

00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:51.110
And she'll be like, si, mamma.

00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:53.150
OK.

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:54.359
But I don't know.

00:36:54.359 --> 00:36:55.650
I don't know how to explain it.

00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:57.960
It's just this feeling
that I love Mexico City.

00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:00.230
And I love Mexican
culture in every sense.

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:02.130
And I like her being bilingual.

00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:04.506
And eventually, I think we'll
probably come to San Diego.

00:37:04.506 --> 00:37:06.796
And we spend a lot of time
in San Diego with my parents

00:37:06.796 --> 00:37:07.950
because they live there.

00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:12.700
But I just like Mexico City.

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:14.581
I like her growing
up in a big city,

00:37:14.581 --> 00:37:16.330
but that's just because
I love big cities.

00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:18.500
Maybe when she grows
up, she'll be like,

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:20.440
I want to go to Ensenada.

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:24.710
And I don't know why I grew
up in Mexico City, like you.

00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:25.810
Yeah.

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:27.758
Yeah, and what was
the other question?

00:37:27.758 --> 00:37:29.019
AUDIENCE: It's, what's your--

00:37:29.019 --> 00:37:30.602
AUDIENCE: Some of
your favorite music,

00:37:30.602 --> 00:37:32.442
and if you can share
your favorite books.

00:37:32.442 --> 00:37:35.030
I think that you
like a lot of books.

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:36.530
JULIETA VENEGAS:
Oh yeah, of course.

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:39.060
Oof, don't get me started.

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:41.270
OK, no, music, I've
been listening a lot

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:44.230
to-- there's a band from
Argentina who's called

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:46.470
Francisca &amp; Los Exploradores.

00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:47.790
It's very beautiful.

00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:52.150
He's actually a guy, not a
girl, but he's Francisca.

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:54.020
And it's pretty beautiful.

00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:56.180
He's pretty amazing.

00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:59.970
There's also-- I don't know
if you know Javiera Mena.

00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:02.457
She's from Chile, and
she's beautiful also.

00:38:02.457 --> 00:38:06.460
[INAUDIBLE] also from Chile.

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:08.830
From Mexico, I'm
sure everybody knows

00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:11.460
Carla Morrison but I love her
and I love her new album, "Amor

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:11.960
Supremo."

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:13.840
She's beautiful and talented.

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:17.540
Who else?

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:19.930
Oh, there's a band from
Mexico called [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:22.104
They're not new new, but
I know a lot of people

00:38:22.104 --> 00:38:22.770
don't know them.

00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:24.990
And I really recommend them.

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:26.540
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:38:27.063 --> 00:38:27.813
It's pretty great.

00:38:27.813 --> 00:38:30.530
So those are some bands.

00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:33.640
Books, it's just
that recently, I've

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.710
been pretty much into the
Second World War, which

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:37.640
is kind of not so, you know.

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:40.370
But there is one-- I mean,
if anybody's into it.

00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:42.990
And if not, I really think
you should read this book.

00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:47.640
It's not actually new, but I
just barely read it this year.

00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:48.960
And I'm pretty amazed by it.

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:51.280
It's called "Life and
Fate" by Vasily Grossman.

00:38:55.810 --> 00:39:01.280
He was in the-- it's all
about the [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:04.630
between the Russians
and the Germans.

00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:07.130
And he was there the whole time.

00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:11.180
So he's sort of does
this panoramic view

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:14.490
of every single
different situation that

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:16.690
was affected by people
during the war, which

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:18.119
is pretty amazing.

00:39:18.119 --> 00:39:18.910
And it's beautiful.

00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:21.190
And I'm serious.

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:22.620
That was probably
one of the books

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:24.255
that I've read lately
that kind of-- it

00:39:24.255 --> 00:39:26.950
took me awhile to get over--
like when I was done with it,

00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:32.180
I just had this feeling of
loss of being done with it.

00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:32.680
It was--

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:33.596
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:33.596 --> 00:39:34.720
JULIETA VENEGAS: No, fate.

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:35.470
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:39:37.422 --> 00:39:38.695
Pretty great.

00:39:38.695 --> 00:39:42.560
SPEAKER: We have time for-- OK.

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:44.160
I think we're out of time.

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:46.110
Julieta's on a very
tight schedule today

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:48.527
because we're going
to do a tour--

00:39:48.527 --> 00:39:49.860
AUDIENCE: One more question or--

00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:54.810
AUDIENCE: Hello, Julieta.

00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:56.294
JULIETA VENEGAS: Hello.

00:39:56.294 --> 00:39:57.460
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm from Peru.

00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:59.682
I'm very excited to be here.

00:39:59.682 --> 00:40:01.265
I have been at Google
for three weeks.

00:40:01.265 --> 00:40:04.960
So when I [INAUDIBLE] I was, I'm
going to see Julieta Venegas.

00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:12.100
You mentioned that
you have studied music

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:13.140
since you were little.

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:16.820
But how was the process for
you to decide that music

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:18.540
was going to be your career?

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:22.820
Like for a lot of us, we
have [INAUDIBLE] like majors.

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:25.340
And music is a
really hard industry

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:27.010
in terms of successful rate.

00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:32.600
Before you became
famous, how did you

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:35.630
decide if you didn't
know if you would

00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:39.650
be able to support yourself
in the next month, you know?

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:41.150
JULIETA VENEGAS:
Well actually, when

00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:44.260
I decided that I was
going to make music,

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:45.520
it was totally impractical.

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:48.640
I was actually
like 12 years old.

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:51.860
And I decided that
that was my vocation.

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:53.007
That's what I wanted to do.

00:40:53.007 --> 00:40:53.590
I had no idea.

00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:56.280
At that moment, I thought I
wanted to go to conservatory

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:57.400
and study classical music.

00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:00.170
And I wanted to be an
orchestra director.

00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:02.470
And later, it
changed completely.

00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:05.380
But that's when I decided.

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:08.839
That I was totally
like-- I had no idea

00:41:08.839 --> 00:41:10.380
what was going to
happen with my life

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:12.810
and what way it was
going to go or anything.

00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:14.600
I just kind of-- I knew.

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:16.820
It wasn't something
like a decision.

00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:18.400
It was just sort
of like something

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.150
that came from my body.

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:22.820
You know, like
this is what I am.

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:26.020
And that was sort of like a
realization about who I was,

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:29.690
about my identity and
as a personal thing.

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:30.290
I'm a twin.

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:32.880
So it was very important
for me to realize that.

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.560
Because being a
twin, you're always

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:36.240
trying to find your
identity and who

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:38.260
you are and your individuality.

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:42.170
And I think music helped me
being who I am, in every sense.

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:44.226
And I think also that,
just kind of-- my sister's

00:41:44.226 --> 00:41:45.850
a photographer, which
is kind of funny.

00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:48.850
She's like visual and
I'm like musical, which

00:41:48.850 --> 00:41:50.960
is we both found who we were.

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:53.467
And that's helped our
relationship a lot.

00:41:53.467 --> 00:41:54.800
And what was the other question?

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:55.961
Sorry.

00:41:55.961 --> 00:41:57.850
AUDIENCE: No, like
how did you decide

00:41:57.850 --> 00:42:00.059
this to be your major
in terms of your career?

00:42:00.059 --> 00:42:01.600
JULIETA VENEGAS:
Oh, my career major.

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:06.589
Well also, that was
funny, because I had

00:42:06.589 --> 00:42:07.880
no idea what I was going to do.

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:10.810
I mean, my idea of
going to university,

00:42:10.810 --> 00:42:14.540
I wanted to study
ethomusicology, which is not

00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:15.950
at all what I'm doing now.

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:18.970
So I guess it was just like the
idea of going to the university

00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:21.364
to study music, that
was an idea that I had.

00:42:21.364 --> 00:42:23.030
Then I went to Mexico
City and I started

00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:25.560
teaching English when I
had never studied grammar.

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:26.440
It's kind of funny.

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:28.630
But it's not so funny.

00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:30.010
Never do that.

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:35.540
But I needed a job, and
I my accent was pretty,

00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:40.430
you know-- oh, you're
practically Californian, yeah.

00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:42.900
So yeah, I just kind
of taught English.

00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:44.970
And that's what I did
for the first year.

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:50.790
And then my first musical job
was to do music for a play.

00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:54.040
And so that was my first job.

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.330
But yeah, it was
hard in the beginning

00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:58.542
because my parents were
pretty much like, oh, you're

00:42:58.542 --> 00:42:59.500
leaving to Mexico City.

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:00.080
Great.

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:01.163
I'm not going to help you.

00:43:01.163 --> 00:43:04.157
And I was like, OK,
OK, OK, I'll do this.

00:43:04.157 --> 00:43:04.740
I can do this.

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:05.260
I got this.

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:07.750
And yeah, the first
year was pretty tough.

00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:11.850
But yeah-- and you know, I had
no idea it was going to happen.

00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:15.052
I mean, maybe eventually
I could have given up.

00:43:15.052 --> 00:43:16.010
And I could have said--

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:20.250
And actually at one point,
I was about to give up.

00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:22.454
All my family pitched
in for a ticket for me

00:43:22.454 --> 00:43:24.120
to come spend Christmas
with them, which

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:26.680
was kind of sweet--
except my dad, of course.

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:29.360
He was still mad.

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:31.286
But I had this
conversation with my mom.

00:43:31.286 --> 00:43:33.160
And I said, mom, I don't
think I can do this.

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:34.368
I mean, I'm going to go back.

00:43:34.368 --> 00:43:36.210
I don't know how I'm
going to pay the rent.

00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:38.320
This is like a struggle.

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:38.940
I'm alone.

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:40.106
I don't really know anybody.

00:43:40.106 --> 00:43:41.570
This is too much for me.

00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:44.070
And my mom was like,
don't come back.

00:43:44.070 --> 00:43:46.420
I mean, you have--
every time I say this,

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:47.570
I kind of want to cry.

00:43:47.570 --> 00:43:50.390
She's like [SPANISH].

00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:51.280
Don't come back.

00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:54.890
I mean, I've never told you
this, but my dream in life

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:56.720
was to be a singer,
and I never did it.

00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:58.520
And you're doing it.

00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:00.860
I'm like-- I mean, I
hadn't done anything.

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:03.262
But for me, that
was the best push

00:44:03.262 --> 00:44:04.470
that she could have given me.

00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:08.040
And then they pitched in to help
me pay the rent that month--

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:09.938
pretty cool. [LAUGHS]

00:44:10.438 --> 00:44:13.394
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:21.930 --> 00:44:24.250
SPEAKER: Once again, thank
you very much for this.

00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:27.870
This was fantastic-- very
honest, very original, very

00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:28.370
you.

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:30.500
Thank you very
much for this chat.

00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:32.830
And let's give one more
round of applause to Julieta.

00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:33.670
JULIETA VENEGAS:
Thank you, everybody.

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:34.270
Thank you.

00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:37.620
[APPLAUSE]
