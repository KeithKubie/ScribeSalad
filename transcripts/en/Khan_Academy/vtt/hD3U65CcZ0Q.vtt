00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:03.950
I've been requested to do a
ladder rate of change problem.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.860
And I figure I would do one,
because it really is the

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.050
classic rate of change problem.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.020
And it's part of any complete
calculus education.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.200
So what is the ladder
rate of change problem?

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.530
So let's say I have the ground.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.460
And I will do the
ground in brown.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.900
Let me see.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.350
Where am I going
to draw my wall?

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.680
This is the ground.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.840
That's too thin.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.040
Let's say this is the ground.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.680
A thicker ground.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:37.900
That's the ground, and then
I have a yellow wall.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.520
This is my yellow wall.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.000
And then leaning against
that yellow wall and the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.125
ground, I have a ladder.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.980
This is the ladder.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.300
I'm looking at it
from the side.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.530
I'm just going to give a
side view of the ladder.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.250
This is the wall, this is
the ground, that's a ladder

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.820
leaning against the wall.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.260
And let's say that my
ladder is 10 meters long.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.480
And let's say that for whatever
reason I've kind of greased up

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.440
this wall and the floor here.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.140
And so a normal ladder would
just kind of stay where it is,

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.790
but especially because this
floor is all greased up,

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.900
the bottom of this ladder
is moving to the left.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.210
So let me draw that.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.900
Let me draw an arrow.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.290
So the bottom of this ladder
is moving to the left.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.160
And let's say it's
moving to the left at

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.575
4 meters per second.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.820
So let's think about a couple
of things; what's happening.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.140
When this point right here is
moving to the left at 4 meters

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.740
per second, as long as we have
some height here-- you know, at

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.460
some point this whole thing
is going to fall down.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.380
The ladder, for whatever
arbitrary reason, will just

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.820
be sliding along the ground.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.860
Maybe someone's pulling
it or whatever.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.500
But before the latter
completely falls to the ground,

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.490
while this is being pulled out
this way, this point right here

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.100
is going to be coming down.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.760
Right?

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.480
Think about it.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.270
In fact, that's probably
what's causing it to

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.040
slide to the left.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.770
And actually it'll do it
at an accelerating rate.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.880
And we're not going to
worry all about that.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.560
We're just going to do the
classic ladder problem.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.610
But I just want to give you the
intuition that if you were to

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.920
put a roller here and put a
roller there, that that's

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.860
what a ladder would do.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.540
It would slide down.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.690
And when it slides down, this
point would go to the base

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.220
of the floor right here.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.510
Right?

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.480
This point would go down.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.990
And this point would go out to
the left, until the ladder is

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.840
in something like
this position.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.140
Until it is flat on the ground.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.420
I'm just doing it
right below the line.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.180
Right?

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.440
At that point it would either
stop, but if someone's pulling

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.550
it then it could continue to
go at 4 meters per second.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.750
Whatever.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.830
So hopefully you're
satisfied with that.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.470
So my question to you is, what
is the rate of change of this

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.950
point-- of the kind of top of
the ladder-- what is its rate

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.730
of change downwards when the
left point of the ladder right

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.610
here is going to the left at 4
meters per second, and this

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.980
distance right here-- let me
do it in a different

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:16.810
color-- is 8 meters?

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.830
Actually, let me do the mirror
image of that, just because I

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.190
don't want to use negative
numbers and all of that.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.770
I just realized that.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.340
So let me just draw it really
messy real quick on this side.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.355
So that's the ground,
that's the wall.

00:03:29.355 --> 00:03:32.470
I'll do the ladder in a
different color still.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.050
That's the ladder.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.760
It's 10 meters.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.090
This point right here is
moving to the right at

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.120
4 meters per second.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.020
Actually, I'm going to do the
horizontal component as x, and

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.860
I wanted this to be a positive
x-value instead of a

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:45.480
negative x-value.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.650
So that's why I did that.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.990
We're 8 meters away,
so it's positive x.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.090
Right?

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.800
If we take this 0, 0.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.670
And what I want to figure out
is the rate of change of this

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.020
point of the ladder, the
top point of the ladder.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.440
How fast is that moving down?

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.390
Right?

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.820
So how do we think about this?

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:11.230
Well let's call this distance
right here x, because it is.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.830
It's kind of the
horizontal displacement.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.710
And let's call this
distance up here y.

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:18.900
Right?

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.430
So at any given point in time,
how does x, y and 10 relate?

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.270
Well, this is a right
angle, so we can use the

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.930
Pythagorean theorem.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:34.370
So we know that x squared plus
y squared is equal to what?

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.850
It's equal to the
hypotenuse squared.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.920
It's equal to 10 squared,
which is equal to 100.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.460
So this right here describes,
if you've watched the video on

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.660
implicit functions or implicit
differentiation, this

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.780
is kind of an implicit
function of x and y.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:50.580
Right?

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.440
Or an implicit function
of x, really.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.710
So what can we do now?

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.200
Well, we're dealing with rates
of change with respect to time.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.490
Right?

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:59.910
This is 4 meters per second.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.990
This is the rate of change,
or this 4 meters per second.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.500
This is the rate of change
at which x is changing

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.440
with respect to time.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.320
Right?

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.250
That's dx/dt.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.360
How much does x move in a
very small amount of time?

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.420
And what are we looking for?

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.620
We're looking for how fast is
this y-value moving downward.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.240
Right?

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.250
So we're looking for dy/dt.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.980
That's essentially what the
question is asking for.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.640
How fast is y changing as a
function of time when x is

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.120
changing at a function of
time at 4 meters per second,

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.990
and the value of x is
equal to 8 meters.

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.960
So I know that seems very
complicated, but essentially

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.430
all we do is we take the
derivative of both sides of

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.540
this equation with
respect to time.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.560
So let's do that.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.960
So let's take the derivative
with respect to time of x

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.160
squared plus y squared.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.450
Equals-- and we have to do it
to both sides of this equation.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.010
100.

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.840
So what's the derivative with
respect to time of x squared?

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.150
Well, it's the chain rule.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.360
It's the derivative with
respect to x of this

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.860
entire expression.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.710
So that's 2x times the
derivative of x with

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:16.760
respect to time.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.040
That's just the chain rule.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.480
Plus the derivative of this
expression with respect to y.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.600
So that's 2y.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.880
Times the derivative of
y with respect to time.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.940
And if you found this to be a
little confusing you might

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.680
want to watch the video that
we actually just did on

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.600
implicit differentiation.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.430
It gives a little bit more
intuition why this really

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.450
just is the chain rule.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.920
But hopefully you get
this a little bit.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.100
And then how much does 100
change with respect to time?

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.700
Well, this 100 value is never
going to change, because,

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.270
frankly, the length of
the ladder is never

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.860
going to change.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:50.470
Right?

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:51.580
That's where that
100 comes from.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.850
It's 10 squared.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.070
So the rate of 100 with respect
to time, well it never

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:59.610
changes so it's equal to 0.

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:00.950
Well what do we know?

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:02.760
We know x.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.090
Right?

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.530
We know x is what?

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.810
x is, at this point
in time, 8 meters.

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.020
We know the change of x
with respect to time is

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.050
4 meters per second.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.330
Do we know y?

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:15.140
Well, I think we do.

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.500
When x is 8, what is y?

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.630
Well, we could just use
this formula right here.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:24.850
We have 8 squared plus y
squared is equal to 100.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:29.340
So 64 plus y squared
is equal to 100.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:33.040
Or y squared is equal to 36.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.340
So y is plus or minus 6, but we
know that we're only dealing

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.790
with positive values-- at least
in this example right here.

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:42.070
So y is equal to 6.

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:45.030
So we know x, we know the rate
of change of x versus time.

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:47.270
That was given in the problem--
4 meters per second.

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:48.290
We know y.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:50.360
So then we can solve for
the rate of change of y

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.590
with respect to time.

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:52.280
So let's do that.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.930
Let's just substitute
the values.

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:55.690
So what's x?

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.730
We're saying, well what is the
rate of change of y with

00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:59.090
respect to time when x is 8?

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:03.990
So we get 2 times 8-- that's x.

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:08.240
Times the change
in-- so this is 8.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.990
What's the change in x
with respect to time at

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.840
this moment in time?

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.510
It's 4 meters per second.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:13.240
That's 4.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.300
So 2 times 8 times 4.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.500
Plus 2y.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:20.170
We just figured
out that y is 6.

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:24.290
So plus 2 times 6.

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:27.740
Times-- and this is what
we're solving for.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:32.800
dy/dt is equal to 0.

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:33.430
So what is this?

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.603
2 times 8 is 16.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:40.350
Times 4 is 64.

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:41.150
Right?

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:45.240
So 64 plus 12 dy/dt.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.910
And let me erase some stuff.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:53.370
I tend to try to crowd too
much into one window,

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:54.870
making things confusing.

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:56.920
Actually, we've actually
already drawn that.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:01.770
So let me erase my-- woops.

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:03.890
I think that is good enough.

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:04.280
OK.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.880
So then we can
simplify up here.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.880
That equals 0.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:16.950
Subtract 64 from both
sides, we get 12 dy/dt

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:19.920
is equal to minus 64.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:24.830
And then you get the change
in y with respect to time is

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:28.730
equal to minus 64 over 12.

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:30.500
And what's the greatest
common factor?

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:31.320
I think it's a 4.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:37.720
So that equals minus 16 over 3.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.360
Right?

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.620
Or you could say that's
5 and 1/3, or 5.3.

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:42.850
And it's going to be
meters per second.

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:45.220
That's the units.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.670
Let me write it that way.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:52.220
Is equal to minus 5.33-- I
mean, you could whatever--

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.320
meters per second.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.140
And there we have it.

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.010
And then you might say, hey,
why is there that minus there?

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:01.720
Well it makes sense, because
while the x-value, it's rate

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.360
of change with respect to
time, it's going in the

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.300
positive direction.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:05.570
Right?

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:07.280
At least the way
I drew it here.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.550
The x is going to the right,
so it's change is positive.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:13.330
But what's happening
to the y-value?

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:18.200
The y-value, you could say
its velocity is downward.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.260
So that's where that negative
value comes from, because

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.590
it has a negative velocity.

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:25.080
I mean really this is kind of
just the x and y velocities

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.090
of those different points.

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:30.240
And you know, you can think
about it a little bit that at

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:34.470
least at that point in time
while the x-value is increasing

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:38.820
at 4 meters per second, the
y-value is moving even

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:39.860
faster downward.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:40.770
So that's something
to think about.

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:43.020
But you might want to
experiment with it at different

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:46.370
points in time, because it's
going to be dependent on where

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:50.990
we are and kind of what does
the right triangle look like.

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:54.560
But anyway, that is the classic
rate of change problem--

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.680
the ladder problem.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.250
I will see you in
the next video.
