00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:02.603
Here we are on problem
number 8.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.600
The total daily profit, p in
dollars, from producing and

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.070
selling x units of a certain
product is given by the

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.240
function p of x.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:24.170
So the profit as a function of
x is equal to 17x minus 10x

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.880
plus b where b is a constant.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.370
If 300 units were produced and
sold yesterday for a profit of

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.620
$1,900, what is the
value of b?

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.470
So we know that p of 300-- 300
units-- the profit when we did

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.710
300 units is $1,900.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.580
And we want to figure out b.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.260
So what is p of 300?

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.520
So let's put 300 in here.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.320
We know it also equals 1,900
but let's put it here.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:03.200
So it's 17 times 300 minus
10 times 300 plus b.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.290
I just put 300 in for x.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.170
So we're trying to find the
profit for 300 and we know

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.610
already that equals 1,900.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.480
So what's 17 times 300?

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.160
17 times 3 is 51.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.320
Let's add those two 0s.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:27.800
Minus-- and what's 10 times 300,
that's 3,000-- 3,000 plus

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.940
b is equal to 1,900.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.620
And then we get 5,100
minus 3,000 minus

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.670
b is equal to 1,900.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.140
What's 5,100 minus 3,000?

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.440
2,100.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.350
And 2,100 minus b is
equal to 1,900.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.170
Minus b is equal to, subtract
2,100 from both sides, and you

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.060
get minus 200.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.510
b is equal to 200.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.760
And that is choice E.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.780
Next problem.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.780
Problem number 9.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.080
I will switch colors.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.009
The number that results when
an integer is multiplied by

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.280
itself cannot end in which
of the following digits?

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.160
Interesting.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.650
Well, what's a number when it's
multiplied by itself?

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.880
That's like squaring a number.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.840
So let's kind of study
what all the perfect

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.580
squares look like.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.640
So when I square 1, I get 1.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.680
When I square 2 I get 4.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.760
When I square 3 I get 9.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.710
Square 4 I get 16.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.060
5 is 25.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.900
6 is 36.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.460
7 is 49.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.930
8 is 64.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.130
So let's look at the numbers
that it can be.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.520
OK, we could go 9 is 81.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.060
Looks like it can be a 1, a
4, a 9-- and we could keep

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:55.980
going-- 1, 4, 9, a 6, a 5, and
actually if we went to, 8 is

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.840
64 so it's a 4.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.250
9 is-- oh we already
did that-- and

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.480
then 10 is a 0, right?

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.660
It can also end in a 0.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.460
The choices, A, sure a
number can end in 1.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.430
We just figured that out.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.010
Choice B, sure a number
can end in 4.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.470
Choice C, sure a number
can end in 5.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.550
Thus 25 as an example.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.470
Choice D, a number
can end in 6.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.560
Choice E, well none of
the numbers we looked

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.170
at end in an 8.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.970
And it seems like there's a bit
of a pattern here, that it

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.760
tends to be just a set-- a
subset-- of these numbers.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.880
And also we know that the other
choices-- choices A

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.280
through D-- we can figure out
perfect squares that end in

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.960
those numbers.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.640
So we know that the
answer is E.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.890
Next problem.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.540
Problem number 10.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.190
A bag contains only red marbles,
blue marbles, and

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.310
yellow marbles.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.620
The probability of randomly
selecting a red marble from

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.380
this bag is 1/4.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.630
So I can say the probability
of red is equal to 1/4.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:58.750
The probability of randomly
selecting a

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.000
blue marble is 1/6.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.970
Which of the following could be
the total number of marbles

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.000
in the bag?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.820
Fascinating.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.090
So what we need to do is we need
to essentially figure out

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.140
the ratio of red to blue
to yellow marbles.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.600
So first of all, what's the
probability of getting a

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.440
yellow marble?

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.580
The probability of getting a
yellow marble is going to be 1

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.670
minus these, right?

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.410
So probability of yellow
is going to be 1

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.750
minus 1/6 minus 1/4.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.670
Let's see, we could put
all of that over 12.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:45.120
12 minus 2/6 minus 3/12--
3/12 is 1/4.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.240
So that equals-- what's
12 minus 10?

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.220
That equals 7/12.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:57.580
So the probability I get a
yellow marble is 7/12.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.510
So that means for every 7
marbles-- so let's write it

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:03.900
all is a denominator of 12.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.120
That makes it actually
a lot easier.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.330
1/6 is the same thing as 2/12.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.345
And 1/4 is the same
thing as 3/12.

00:05:10.345 --> 00:05:13.210
And they all add up to 12/12.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:19.580
So for every 3 red marbles,
there are 2 blue marbles and

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.350
there are 7 yellow marbles.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:28.606
The ratio of red to blue to
yellow is equal to 3:2:7.

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.970
And we know we can only get
this type of a ratio when

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.480
there's a total of 12
marbles, right?

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.000
There has to be at least 12
marbles or any multiple of 12

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.930
marbles, right?

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:50.100
If there's exactly 2 blue
marbles, then there'll be 3

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.870
red and 7 yellow.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.910
And there has to be at least
2 of the blue marbles.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.410
So any multiple of 12 marbles
will work for

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.130
this type of ratio.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.590
So if we look at the choices,
which of the following could

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.770
be the total number of
marbles in the bag?

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.305
So out of all those choices,
which of them are

00:06:10.305 --> 00:06:11.960
a multiple of 12?

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.360
Well, choice A isn't.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.430
10 isn't a multiple of 12.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.460
Choice C isn't.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:16.720
18, 20, 30.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.530
Well 12 is a multiple of 12,
so choice B is our answer.

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:21.490
And we just figured out.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:26.800
If there were 3 red, 2 blue and
7 yellow, then we get the

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.160
correct probabilities.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.630
The key is just to try to
figure out what the

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.680
probability of getting a yellow
is and then realizing

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.900
the ratios between the two.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.800
Next problem.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.000
Problem 11.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.420
When the sum of a list of
prices is divided by the

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.060
average of the prices
the result is k.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.120
What does k represent?

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.510
So if I take the sum divided
by the average.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:01.160
So let's say I'm taking the
sum of three numbers.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:08.230
So let's say, n1 plus
n2 plus n3.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:11.940
I could do it n times, but
just for simplicity.

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:16.220
And I'm dividing that
by the average.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.040
What's the average?

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:24.720
It's n1 plus n2 plus n3
divided by 3, right?

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.840
And if you divide by a fraction,
that's the same

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.170
thing as multiplying
by the reciprocal.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:34.970
So that's n1 plus n2 plus
n3 times 3 over n1

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.580
plus n2 plus n3.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.700
So this cancels out, and all
we're left with is 3, which is

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:44.460
the number of numbers we had.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.790
And you could have done this
with 16 or 20 or whatever.

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:50.790
I mean you could have
said n1 plus n2 plus

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:53.280
da, da, da, da, da.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:57.830
Where I have, let's say, n
sub-- let's say I have m

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:03.250
digits-- and then divide that by
n1 plus n2 plus blah, blah,

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:03.880
blah, blah.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.080
n over m.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.050
Sub m digits.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:09.700
And say, well I'm
dividing by m.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.205
This would have also simplified
to m digits.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.600
When you do what they said in
the problem, the result is

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.840
just the number of prices
that you are summing.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.290
So that is choice D, the
number of prices.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:28.810
And it works out because
this sum and this

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:31.190
sum will cancel out.

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:32.340
Next problem.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:36.829
Let's see how fast-- if
I can fit this one in.

00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:38.220
So I have a drawing.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.020
It looks like this.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:44.220
Let's see, triangle, triangle,
triangle, triangle, and then

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:47.940
dotted lines, dotted lines,
dotted lines, dotted lines.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.770
It says, if the area of the
square in the figure above is

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:54.120
81-- so they're saying this is
a square, and if the area is

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.480
81-- then we know that this side
is 9 and this side is 9.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.150
Right?

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.930
This is 9 times 9.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:07.480
And the perimeter of each of
the four triangles is 30.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.500
So the perimeter is 30
of each of those.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.920
What is the perimeter of
the figure outlined

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.170
by the solid line?

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:17.670
Well think about it.

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:19.880
The perimeter of the solid
line, that would be this.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.080
That's what we want
to figure out.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.690
Well wouldn't that just be
the perimeter of the four

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:33.110
triangles, and then we want to
subtract out this side, this

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:36.200
side, this side and
this side, right?

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:40.190
The perimeter of the red part
is the perimeter of each of

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:43.840
the triangles-- added up, all
four of them-- minus the

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.260
perimeter of the
square inside.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:51.230
So the perimeter of the four
triangles is 30 times 4, minus

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:54.090
the perimeter of this,
