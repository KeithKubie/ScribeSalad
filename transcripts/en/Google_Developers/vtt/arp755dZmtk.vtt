TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Hello, and welcome

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:09.449
to "The Developer Show."

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:11.510
This is your TLDR.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.810
Learn to use the Google
Play Developer Console

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.280
to understand how players
are progressing, spending,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.400
and churning with
this new sample game.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.790
Produced with the help
from Auxbrain, developer

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.420
of Zombie Highway 2, it uses
randomized and anonymized data

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.440
from a real game.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.610
If you use Google+ features
with your Play Games Permission,

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.010
check out this blog post for
changes that could impact you.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.490
We're taking steps
to reduce sign

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.310
in friction and unnecessary
permission requests

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.760
by moving the game's
APIs to a new model.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.900
Android Marshmallow
introduced several changes

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.600
that were designed to help
your app look after user data.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.340
To help you make use
of those changes,

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.310
this post highlights the key
considerations for user trust

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.900
when it comes to run time
permissions and hardware

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.040
identifiers.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.490
Check it out.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.410
Now if you're a student
who loves to code

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.310
or has a great idea
for a mobile app,

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.970
the AdMob student challenge is
your chance to build an app,

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.000
learn how to make money from it,
and win awesome prizes, which

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.440
include a week long trip to
San Francisco and a visit

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.940
to the Googleplex.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.020
App Invites is an out
of the box solution

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.360
for conducting app referrals
and encouraging sharing.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.210
Here's some details on how two
apps, Fabulous and Yummly used

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.430
App Invites to grow
their user base.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.910
Also in the case study category,
it turns out design matters.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.680
Check out this new
video with Wego

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.960
and learn how they increased
monthly user retention by 300%,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.456
and reduced uninstall rates by
up to 25% with Material Design.

00:01:40.456 --> 00:01:41.830
Now this is a
really cool article

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.500
from Google Research on
mastering the ancient game

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.890
of Go with machine learning.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.950
Using a single machine,
AlphaGo one all but

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.320
one of its 500 games against
several top Go programs.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.150
So you know, they went ahead and
challenged the reigning three

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.290
time European Go champion,
an elite professional player

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.550
who has devoted his life
to Go since the age of 12.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.660
Check out the article to see
how that match turned out.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.600
Cloud9 is a development
environment in the cloud.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.910
And you can now easily
create a new Cloud9 workspace

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.090
connected with a Google
Cloud Platform project.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.270
It comes preinstalled with the
Cloud SDK and G Cloud command

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.510
line tool, and allows
you to build and deploy

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.680
your app to Google App Engine
directly within the IDE.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.720
The Chrome 48 beta includes
a new security panel

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.990
and dev tools that makes
deploying HTTPS easier.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.210
The security panel displays
connection information

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.150
for every network request,
demystifying the connection

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.440
errors that keep you away
from the green lock that

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.240
represents a secure connection.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.960
Oh, and if you
didn't know already,

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.300
Android Studio is faster.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.040
Here's Reto Meier
to tell you more.

00:02:58.746 --> 00:03:00.464
RETO MEIER: Hey,
get back to work.

00:03:00.464 --> 00:03:02.005
MALE SPEAKER: Building
and deploying.

00:03:02.005 --> 00:03:02.629
RETO MEIER: Oh.

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:04.670
Well, then download
Android Studio 2.0,

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.742
and your incremental
builds will be instant.

00:03:06.742 --> 00:03:08.200
MALE SPEAKER: Who's
doing what now?

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.080
RETO MEIER: Don't let
this happen to you.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.514
I'm Reto Meier, and this
is "Who's Doing What Now?"

00:03:15.514 --> 00:03:17.430
As developers, we all
know that the number one

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.280
excuse for legitimately
slacking off

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.280
is building and
deploying your app.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.460
Until now, hitting build
and run was an opportunity

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.185
to take a break, grab some
coffee, catch up on the news,

00:03:26.185 --> 00:03:27.790
or look at some cats.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.580
Now thanks to the
Android Studio team,

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.660
those glory days are over.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.160
Android Studio 2.0 has
arrived with a new incremental

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.410
build feature, which
makes your builds now take

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.240
seconds instead of minutes.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.510
When you first run your
app, the normal compile,

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.620
dx, package, deploy,
install, and run

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.940
steps all happen as
normal, though much faster

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.510
thanks to significant
improvements

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.190
to dx, ProGuard,
shrinker, and adb.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.800
From then on,
pressing Instant Run

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.370
will deploy your changes
directly into the running app.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.790
And Android Studio will
update your application logic

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:58.910
and resources.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.090
So you can see the changes
appear near instantly.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.740
This feature is
designed to be magical.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.960
So you stay in the flow
while coding, building,

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.290
and running your app.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.690
No more breaks in
concentration, waiting around,

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:10.950
or switching contexts.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.190
It works with the
emulator, physical devices,

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.207
and it works all the
way back to API 15.

00:04:16.207 --> 00:04:18.290
Developers reducing their
average build and deploy

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.070
cycles, staying in the zone,
and increasing productivity--

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.346
that's "Who's Doing What Now."

00:04:25.346 --> 00:04:28.249
Get back to work.

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:29.790
MALE SPEAKER: Running
the test suite.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.175
RETO MEIER: Oh, carry on.

00:04:32.175 --> 00:04:34.800
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And that's your
