00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:04.889
 
all I have to say is I hope there is

00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:04.899
all I have to say is I hope there is
 

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:06.990
all I have to say is I hope there is
such a thing as clean coal and the

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:07.000
such a thing as clean coal and the
 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.120
such a thing as clean coal and the
reason I say that and of course that

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:09.130
reason I say that and of course that
 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.299
reason I say that and of course that
means that we can burn coal and

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309
means that we can burn coal and
 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.999
means that we can burn coal and
completely capture the co2 and then

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:15.009
completely capture the co2 and then
 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:17.670
completely capture the co2 and then
sequester it and it's certainly not an

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.680
sequester it and it's certainly not an
 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.190
sequester it and it's certainly not an
easy thing to do but what I keep

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:20.200
easy thing to do but what I keep
 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.200
easy thing to do but what I keep
reminding people is a coal is the

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210
reminding people is a coal is the
 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.510
reminding people is a coal is the
world's most abundant energy resources

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:24.520
world's most abundant energy resources
 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.520
world's most abundant energy resources
now you can argue whether it's as

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:26.530
now you can argue whether it's as
 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.310
now you can argue whether it's as
abundant as solar or wind but certainly

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320
abundant as solar or wind but certainly
 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.290
abundant as solar or wind but certainly
in terms of conventional resources and

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300
in terms of conventional resources and
 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.080
in terms of conventional resources and
what people forget is that coal employs

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090
what people forget is that coal employs
 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.020
what people forget is that coal employs
literally tens of thousands of people

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030
literally tens of thousands of people
 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.520
literally tens of thousands of people
around the world not only in our own

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530
around the world not only in our own
 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.220
around the world not only in our own
country but in places like India and

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230
country but in places like India and
 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.130
country but in places like India and
China it is cheap and so it's very

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140
China it is cheap and so it's very
 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.139
China it is cheap and so it's very
difficult for emerging market countries

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149
difficult for emerging market countries
 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:49.649
difficult for emerging market countries
that are trying to electrify - to grow

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:49.659
that are trying to electrify - to grow
 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:52.649
that are trying to electrify - to grow
their economies economically it's very

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:52.659
their economies economically it's very
 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:54.329
their economies economically it's very
difficult for them to simply say well

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339
difficult for them to simply say well
 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:55.739
difficult for them to simply say well
we're going to stop using coal because

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:55.749
we're going to stop using coal because
 

00:00:55.749 --> 00:00:58.290
we're going to stop using coal because
of concerns about climate change because

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300
of concerns about climate change because
 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.059
of concerns about climate change because
not only will they throw thousands of

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:00.069
not only will they throw thousands of
 

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:01.889
not only will they throw thousands of
people out of work but they will not

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899
people out of work but they will not
 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:03.840
people out of work but they will not
then and probably in the near term have

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850
then and probably in the near term have
 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.539
then and probably in the near term have
a readily available alternative to

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549
a readily available alternative to
 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:08.580
a readily available alternative to
replace the coal generated electricity

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590
replace the coal generated electricity
 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.010
replace the coal generated electricity
that's leading to these explosive levels

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020
that's leading to these explosive levels
 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.670
that's leading to these explosive levels
of economic growth so I hope that we put

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680
of economic growth so I hope that we put
 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.520
of economic growth so I hope that we put
a lot of research and development there

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530
a lot of research and development there
 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.209
a lot of research and development there
essentially three major ways that we

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:21.219
essentially three major ways that we
 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:23.850
essentially three major ways that we
think about right now to do it

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860
think about right now to do it
 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.550
think about right now to do it
potentially have clean coal one involves

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560
potentially have clean coal one involves
 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.340
potentially have clean coal one involves
taking the co2 out before combustion and

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350
taking the co2 out before combustion and
 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.459
taking the co2 out before combustion and
to capturing it after combustion but I

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469
to capturing it after combustion but I
 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:34.620
to capturing it after combustion but I
would like to see us cooperate with the

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630
would like to see us cooperate with the
 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.230
would like to see us cooperate with the
other big coal users in Indonesia and

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240
other big coal users in Indonesia and
 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.810
other big coal users in Indonesia and
China India and may be jointly embarked

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820
China India and may be jointly embarked
 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.520
China India and may be jointly embarked
on and some more research and

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530
on and some more research and
 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.380
on and some more research and
development projects using these three

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390
development projects using these three
 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.349
development projects using these three
technologies and not see it as a

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:46.359
technologies and not see it as a
 

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:48.240
technologies and not see it as a
commercial gain of one country's going

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250
commercial gain of one country's going
 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.160
commercial gain of one country's going

to learn how to do it not other but

good that we all do it together and then

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100
good that we all do it together and then
 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.960
good that we all do it together and then
to share the benefits accordingly
