00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
Hey everyone!  So, I wanted to announce the MacAir winner first of all.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.100
Congratulations!

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.320
If this isn't you, don't worry.  I'll be giving away another MacAir and announcing the winner on September 13th.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.200
Now, I have been a serial monogamous since I was 15.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.200
Right?  I'm all about that long term relationship.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.800
And I've said this a million times but I wanted to say it again.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.020
I don't believe in playing games when it comes to dating.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.660
Ok, so if you want him to like you, you have to be six feet away from him at all times.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.660
If he texts you, calculate the amount of time between all of his texts on average and then add 2, divided by 14, plus 3

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.920
that's how much time you have to wait before actually messaging him.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:44.300
And when the sun is equidistant from the equator on the line of Polaris, make sure that you absolutely wear short-shorts.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.420
Personally, I like to be as direct as possible.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.140
I like you.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.820
And not everybody likes that--and that's fine!

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.680
You could just move on!  Trust me.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.280
Somebody who only wants you because they can't have you is always going to be looking for the next best thing.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.720
Babe, you've been on your phone this entire dinner.  What are you doing?

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.760
Playing a game.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.760
Babe, can you not play games while we're on a date?

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.160
Just give me like 2 more minutes.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.240
*sigh*

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.980
Yeah...

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:19.280
Plus, playing hard to get always feels like you're something to begotten.  Right?  Like you're something to be shopped for.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.900
We have an array of girlfriend models available, this is our best seller called "The Parents Pleaser."

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:34.400
Made of organic wifey material and comes with the most upgraded cooking software.  If you're looking for something a little more on the wild side...

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:41.520
She has 2,500 spontaneous evenings downloaded into her as well as potentially dangerous adventures

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.880
and appensioned for aggressive bed play.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.240
What about that one?

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.120
Apologies sir, that one is unfortunately sold out.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.120
Well can't I just take the display model?

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.920
Well, I suppose you could.  Would you like to know what she comes with?

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.120
No, I don't care.  Take my money.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.960
Dating is hard enough as it is.  You're two people who come with your own set of baggage

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.960
trying to come together in this lasting emotionally supportive relationship where you still maintain a physical attraction and regular intercourse with each other

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.340
like why would you add to that already complicated system by faking your feelings up front?

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.100
I'd like to take you to dinner on either the 8th or the 9th at 7pm.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.100
Hm, I've got classes those evenings how does Thursday the 11th work for you?

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.540
Brunch, followed by the Museum of Modern Arts?

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.520
Done and done.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.000
I love a man who can keep up a schedule.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.760
I love a woman who can plan.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.960
Pencil me in.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.920
I write in pen.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.100
*click*

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.280
It worked with my boyfriend.  I mean I met him through mutual friends and I thought he was very cute.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.400
And so--you guy remember that Facebook feature where you had to "ask" a person's relationship status?

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.240
I'm pretty sure I'm the only person whose ever used that frikken button.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.940
But I asked it, he was single, and I said "Hey, you're cute! I'd like to take you out to dinner and it's my birthday so you can't say no."

00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:01.340
And he didn't say no!  And that was 2 years ago.  So I encourage you, just for the realm of possible love in your life

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.200
to just throw away the games and give you heart.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.420
I'm Anna Akana.  Stay awesome Gotham.
