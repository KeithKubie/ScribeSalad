00:00:00.261 --> 00:00:01.294
- [Voiceover] What I want to do in this video

00:00:01.294 --> 00:00:04.893
is go over some techniques for doing mental addition.

00:00:04.893 --> 00:00:08.318
Now, if I saw something like 355 plus 480,

00:00:08.318 --> 00:00:10.152
if you have some paper around, you could

00:00:10.153 --> 00:00:13.612
write these numbers down and do your traditional addition,

00:00:13.612 --> 00:00:15.551
but you might want to be able to do these in your head,

00:00:15.551 --> 00:00:17.386
so how do you do it?

00:00:17.386 --> 00:00:18.953
Well, the way to think about it is,

00:00:18.953 --> 00:00:21.855
can we add or subtract from these numbers

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:23.574
so that one of these numbers might become

00:00:23.574 --> 00:00:26.230
a little bit simpler?

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.626
So for example, I have 480 here.

00:00:27.626 --> 00:00:29.727
What would I have to do to 480

00:00:29.727 --> 00:00:31.120
to, say, get it to 500?

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.560
It's almost 500.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.200
Well, I could add 20 to 480, but I can't just add 20.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.510
I would would also have to take away 20,

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.200
so what happens if I take away 20 from 355 and add it

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.251
to 480?

00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:45.806
So what am I talking about?

00:00:45.807 --> 00:00:47.455
So this is going to be the same thing as,

00:00:47.455 --> 00:00:50.416
so let me take away 20 from this.

00:00:50.416 --> 00:00:55.130
So that's going to be 335

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.920
and let me add 20 to this,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.157
so 480 plus 20 is 500,

00:01:00.157 --> 00:01:03.930
and the whole reason why I took away 20 and I added 20

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:04.718
is I said, well what do I have to add to 480

00:01:04.718 --> 00:01:06.217
to get to 500?

00:01:06.217 --> 00:01:07.227
And I could have done that in my head.

00:01:07.227 --> 00:01:08.493
Okay, I need to add 20.

00:01:08.493 --> 00:01:11.384
355 minus 20 is 335.

00:01:11.384 --> 00:01:14.623
But now this problem is much, much simpler to compute.

00:01:14.623 --> 00:01:17.386
335 plus 500,

00:01:17.386 --> 00:01:20.253
well, it's going to be three hundreds plus five hundreds,

00:01:20.254 --> 00:01:22.785
it's going to be equal to

00:01:22.785 --> 00:01:27.487
800 and then we have 35.

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:29.588
835.

00:01:29.588 --> 00:01:32.140
Now, to make it a little bit clearer what we did,

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.186
remember, we wanted to take 20 from here

00:01:34.186 --> 00:01:35.718
and put it over here,

00:01:35.718 --> 00:01:38.690
so we could break up 355,

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.221
we could say that it's going to be equal to,

00:01:41.221 --> 00:01:42.382
it's going to be equal to,

00:01:42.382 --> 00:01:46.411
let's break it up into 335

00:01:46.411 --> 00:01:48.118
and 20, and remember,

00:01:48.118 --> 00:01:49.789
the whole reason why I picked 20 is because

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.251
I'm going to want to add that to 480,

00:01:52.251 --> 00:01:54.561
but I'm just doing it step-by-step here,

00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:59.124
so plus 480,

00:01:59.124 --> 00:02:02.827
and now I can just change the order with which I add,

00:02:02.827 --> 00:02:05.660
so I could say, this is going to be equal to

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.223
335

00:02:09.223 --> 00:02:10.953
plus 20

00:02:10.954 --> 00:02:15.510
plus 480,

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.125
and instead of adding the 335 and 20 first,

00:02:17.126 --> 00:02:19.506
I could add the 20 and 480 first,

00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:24.570
so I could add these two characters first,

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.983
and so then I'm going to be left with,

00:02:25.984 --> 00:02:28.921
this is going to be equal to 335

00:02:28.921 --> 00:02:31.661
plus, what's 20 plus 480?

00:02:31.661 --> 00:02:32.486
Well, that was the whole point.

00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:34.587
I picked 20 so that I can get to 500.

00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:38.406
20 plus 480 is going to be 500

00:02:38.407 --> 00:02:40.555
and then, now, you can add them.

00:02:40.555 --> 00:02:43.887
This is going to be 835.

00:02:43.887 --> 00:02:47.288
So this is just a longer way of saying what I did here.

00:02:47.288 --> 00:02:49.518
I took 20 from 355,

00:02:49.518 --> 00:02:52.316
so I can make the 480 into a 500.

00:02:52.316 --> 00:02:54.858
Let's do a couple more examples of this,

00:02:54.858 --> 00:02:56.658
and remember, the key is just thinking about

00:02:56.658 --> 00:02:59.989
how could I add or take away from one of the numbers

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.395
to make them simpler?

00:03:01.395 --> 00:03:04.123
So over here, I have 18 plus 704.

00:03:04.123 --> 00:03:05.992
So there's a couple ways we could tackle this.

00:03:05.992 --> 00:03:08.987
One way, we could try to get the 704 to be equal

00:03:08.987 --> 00:03:10.984
to 700.

00:03:10.984 --> 00:03:14.990
So, we could say that this is the same thing as

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.625
18 plus,

00:03:17.625 --> 00:03:21.515
I could write 700 plus 4,

00:03:21.515 --> 00:03:23.452
or I could write it as 4

00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:26.553
plus 700, like that,

00:03:26.553 --> 00:03:30.489
and then I could put the parentheses around this first,

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.206
and then I could just switch the order in which I add,

00:03:33.206 --> 00:03:36.480
so this is the same thing as 18

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.155
plus 4

00:03:40.155 --> 00:03:42.855
plus 700,

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:45.994
and now I could add the 18 and the 4 first.

00:03:45.995 --> 00:03:47.852
Now what's 18 plus 4?

00:03:47.852 --> 00:03:52.392
It's 22, and then I have plus 700,

00:03:52.392 --> 00:03:56.595
and now this is pretty easy to compute,

00:03:56.595 --> 00:03:58.487
and all of these are going to be equal to each other,

00:03:58.487 --> 00:03:59.892
so let me just write it like that.

00:03:59.892 --> 00:04:01.959
22 plus 700, I could do that in my head.

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.455
That's going to be 722.

00:04:04.455 --> 00:04:05.360
Now, I know what you're thinking.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.253
Hey, this is supposed to be a technique for doing something

00:04:07.253 --> 00:04:07.971
in my head?

00:04:07.972 --> 00:04:10.260
I can't write all this stuff down in my head.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.792
The reason why I'm writing this down this way

00:04:11.792 --> 00:04:14.161
is that you see what's really going on.

00:04:14.161 --> 00:04:15.658
But you could do it a lot quicker.

00:04:15.658 --> 00:04:18.421
You could just say, hey, let me take 4 from the,

00:04:18.421 --> 00:04:21.394
I'm closing my eyes right now as I'm talking,

00:04:21.394 --> 00:04:23.483
just so I can pretend like I'm doing it in my head.

00:04:23.483 --> 00:04:26.920
Okay, let me add 4 to 18 and take away 4 from 700,

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.892
well that's going to be the same thing if I add 4 to 18,

00:04:29.892 --> 00:04:31.761
this is going to be 22,

00:04:31.761 --> 00:04:34.600
and if I take away 4 from 704,

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.951
that's going to be plus 700.

00:04:36.951 --> 00:04:40.620
22 plus 700 is 722.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.580
Now, there's another way that you could tackle it.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.927
You could say, well, let me actually,

00:04:44.927 --> 00:04:47.354
instead of taking away 4, let me add some number,

00:04:47.354 --> 00:04:48.654
some value here, so I get to,

00:04:48.654 --> 00:04:50.361
I don't know, say 710.

00:04:50.361 --> 00:04:52.288
That seems a little less ideal for me,

00:04:52.288 --> 00:04:53.228
but you could do it.

00:04:53.228 --> 00:04:55.620
Well, let's see, if I added 6 to 704,

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.222
I'll get to 710.

00:04:57.222 --> 00:04:59.183
So how about I break off 6 from the 18

00:04:59.184 --> 00:05:01.251
and add it to the 704?

00:05:01.251 --> 00:05:02.423
So I could write it like this.

00:05:02.423 --> 00:05:06.951
I could say that 18 is 12 plus 6

00:05:06.951 --> 00:05:11.405
and then plus 704

00:05:11.405 --> 00:05:16.590
which is the same thing as 12 plus 6

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.727
plus 704,

00:05:20.727 --> 00:05:22.816
and then I could add these first,

00:05:22.817 --> 00:05:27.925
and I could have 12 plus 710

00:05:27.925 --> 00:05:30.317
and I might be able to say,

00:05:30.317 --> 00:05:32.360
Okay, that's going to be 722,

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.951
but this method right over here doesn't seem

00:05:33.951 --> 00:05:36.818
anywhere near as intuitive as doing this,

00:05:36.818 --> 00:05:41.183
as trying to get the 704 to 700

00:05:41.184 --> 00:05:43.854
by taking 4 from here and adding it

00:05:43.854 --> 00:05:45.455
over here.

00:05:45.456 --> 00:05:48.986
Let's do one more example of this.

00:05:48.986 --> 00:05:52.353
So, 275 plus 595.

00:05:52.353 --> 00:05:53.815
Well, my gut reaction is,

00:05:53.815 --> 00:05:57.461
can we get this 595 to be equal to 600?

00:05:57.461 --> 00:05:58.320
So this is going to be equal to,

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.918
so if I add 5 to 595, I get 600.

00:06:02.918 --> 00:06:04.694
Let me do that in the same color.

00:06:04.694 --> 00:06:07.724
So I'm going to add 5 to it to get 600.

00:06:07.724 --> 00:06:10.522
I have trouble switching colors.

00:06:10.522 --> 00:06:12.589
So, 600,

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:13.610
but I can't just add 5,

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.352
I also have to take 5 away from here,

00:06:15.352 --> 00:06:19.659
so taking 5 from there, that would be 270,

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:22.620
so this becomes 270 plus 600,

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.559
and this is easier for me to compute in my head.

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:27.647
This would be two hundreds plus six hundreds

00:06:27.647 --> 00:06:30.120
is equal to eight hundreds.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.186
I have seven 10's plus zero 10's,

00:06:32.186 --> 00:06:33.823
so 800, and then I have no one's.

00:06:33.823 --> 00:06:35.587
870.

00:06:35.588 --> 00:06:37.492
Now, another way that you could have tried to tackle it

00:06:37.492 --> 00:06:41.560
is like, let's try to get this 275 to,

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.752
let's try to get it to 300.

00:06:42.752 --> 00:06:46.490
So, we could say this is the same thing as 300.

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.321
We could say this is the same thing as 300.

00:06:50.321 --> 00:06:53.840
And to get there, I just added 25,

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.230
but if I add 25 from this number, I'm going to have to

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.519
take 25 from this number.

00:06:57.519 --> 00:07:01.490
So I could subtract 25 from here,

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.554
and then I would get 300 plus 95 minus 25

00:07:05.554 --> 00:07:06.621
is going to be 70,

00:07:06.622 --> 00:07:08.723
so it's going to be 570.

00:07:08.723 --> 00:07:12.218
570, and this is also easy to compute.

00:07:12.218 --> 00:07:15.794
300 plus 570 is 870.

00:07:15.794 --> 00:07:17.325
And there's other ways that you can tackle this

00:07:17.326 --> 00:07:19.439
including the traditional way of writing it down on paper

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:20.472
and whatnot.

00:07:20.472 --> 00:07:22.794
But hopefully this gives you a little bit of a toolkit

00:07:22.794 --> 00:07:26.376
for being able to solve these things maybe in your head.
