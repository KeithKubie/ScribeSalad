00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.300
Providing shoppers with a chance to buy and
transport goods across international boundaries

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.430
without paying local and national taxes, duty-free
shops are found in airports and other ports

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.700
and stations around the world.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.369
A creation of the 20th century, duty-free
shops mark a sharp departure from more than

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.660
2,000 years of nations generating revenue
by taxing the trade in commodities and other

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:39.660
goods.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.410
The practice of imposing such taxes traces
its origins to at least the ancient Greeks

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.930
and Romans where duties were levied on a wide
variety of imports and exports.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.860
As leaders through the ages recognized that
this was an easy and efficient way to collect

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.920
revenue, the custom remained popular even
among the so-called barbarians who conquered

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.719
the great early civilizations.

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:03.479
By the Middle Ages, feudal lords were still
imposing taxes on the goods that passed in

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:08.380
and out of (and by) their lands, and out of
this tradition arose both toll gates and customs

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.380
houses.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.670
In fact, by the 1300s, the word costom and
custume had taken the meaning of a rent, tribute

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.480
or tax paid to a feudal lord or other local
authority (such as a king’s representative).

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.810
The word duty, meaning something due or owed,
dates to the end of the 13th century, while

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.119
the denotation of duty as a tax was first
recorded in the late 15th century.

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.869
Duty-free, as an adjective, dates back to
the late 1600s, where it referred to a taxing

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.689
authority agreeing to forego taking its usual
fee.

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.369
The idea of exempting certain goods from import/export
taxes as a matter of routine, however, is

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.439
a relatively recent invention.

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.200
Born out of the recognition that the dramatic
increase in international, civilian travel

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.869
(and in particular air travel) after World
War II could produce significant revenue,

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.960
specifically from tourism, one innovative
Irishman conceived of the idea of placing

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.540
tax-free shops in international airports.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.930
In 1947, Brendan O’Regan convinced the Irish
government to pass a law that made the transit

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.980
area of Shannon Airport (where he served as
Catering Comptroller) as technically not a

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.440
part of Ireland, and, therefore, any purchases
made there wouldn’t be subject to tax.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.819
Passed on March 18, 1947, the Customs-Free
Airport Act made Shannon Airport the first

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.960
duty-free port in the world.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.790
Although initially Shannon Airport’s sales
were limited to Irish linen and other locally-produced

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.250
goods, Regan and company quickly realized
that if they stocked other international goods

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.920
and sold those duty-free as well, they would
fly off of the shelves.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.970
Prominent brand names early-on included Dior,
Chanel, Hummel, Minox and Waterford.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.900
So popular was the practice that within a
decade, duty-free had also begun to be used

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.410
as a noun to denote the goods purchased in
the shop.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.080
Other duty-free shops followed, including
those established by the American company,

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:01.210
Duty Free Shoppers (DFS) in Hong Kong in 1960
and in Hawaii in 1962 (the first duty-free

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.870
shop in the United States).

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.040
Note that duties are not only imposed by an
exporting country, but may be levied when

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.500
you enter a country, as well.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.620
The United States imposes duties on a wide
variety of purchases, although there are exemptions,

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.060
depending on where you purchased or received
the item, how long you were there, your residency

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.910
status and the value of the goods.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.630
For example, a US resident who has spent at
least 48 hours abroad is usually able to bring

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.570
back $800 worth of goods without tax, with
the next $1,000 worth of goods taxed at a

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:37.590
3% rate, and anything more than that taxed
according to a tariff schedule; if the US

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.430
resident did not spend at least 48 hours in
the foreign country, the base exemption amount

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.200
reduces to only $200.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.510
On the other hand, for US residents, the exemption
doubles for imports from US insular possessions

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.870
(e.g., Guam).

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.710
Note that the rules and exemption amounts
are a bit different for non-residents visiting

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.730
the US who bring goods with them.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.340
Of course, there are exceptions to the exemption,
and certain goods, like alcohol and tobacco,

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.440
are treated differently, depending on the
product and the country where it was purchased.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.160
For example, US residents returning from Europe
with one liter or less of alcohol may bring

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.160
that in duty-free.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.260
It is important to remember that duty-free
only applies to goods purchased for personal

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.009
use, not for resale, and the taxes imposed
on the latter (and any exemptions) will be

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:25.090
governed by other laws, regulations and trade
agreements such as the Generalize System of

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:44.000
Preferences (GSP) and the North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
