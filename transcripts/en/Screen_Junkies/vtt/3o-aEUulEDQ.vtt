00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.280
It's that time of the year!

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.660
When LA's pretty narcissists use their awards to take shots at D.C's ugly narcissists.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.060
As these nine films compete for Hollywood's highest honor.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.620
Because back when it was just five the academy couldn't trick you into rooting for something you actually saw.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.760
This year's Honest nominees for Best Picture are:

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.040
From Denice Ville-new-ve (intentional mispronunciation)

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.460
Comes Amy Adams' second movie this year about trying to relate to an alien no one gets along with

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.900
that will have audiences trying to wrap their mind around what they just saw.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.040
Because they're pretty sure the part about the Chinese guy makes absolutely no sense.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.800
"Squid Words."

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.100
From first time director Garth Davis

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.080
Comes the film about the kid who goes to India with Nicole Kidman, I think

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.540
and finds a lion or something?

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.540
Oh, right, it's the one with Dev Patel

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.860
I hear it's really good, but honestly I've only seen the trailer.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.520
They've got to stop releasing all the Oscar movies at the same time!

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.120
"If You Say You've Seen this, You're Probably Lyin'"

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.880
Return to West Texas for that one grizzled cowboy voice Jeff Bridges does.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.500
(You'll get the hang of this yet.)

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.880
(We suspect that you might be dead.)

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:25.120
For a film that's so entertaining, straight forward, and unpretentious it has no chance of actually winning Best Picture.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.360
"Hell it's a High Honor Just to be Nominated"

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.080
Witness the incredible untold story of the hidden contributions Black women made to the space program.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.900
Whose brilliance was no match for the stubborn prejudice of the times,

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.260
but don't worry, it won't make white people feel too bad about themselves.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.980
See? Kevin Costner is one of the good ones!

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
"Diary of a Math Black Woman."

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.980
From the writer of "The Adventures of Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle."

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:49.920
Wait, really?

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.500
Comes the exact opposite of that.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.260
(I swear to god, I'm gonna knock your f*cking block off.)

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.380
As you take a nonstop grief train to Sadsville.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.220
Led by a hard drinking irritable Boston man living in the shadow of his more successful older brother

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.620
Gee, I wonder how Casey Affleck managed to get into character.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.820
"Manchesta by the Feckin' Sea"

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:14.500
Follow along on the poetic unfolding of a life beautifully directed by Berry Jenkins.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:21.280
As this young (ding), black (ding), gay man (ding) struggles to escape from poverty (ding)

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.000
And drug addiction (ding)

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.900
Told across three decades (ding)

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.980
based on a play (ding)

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.460
based on the life story of its author (ding)

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.080
So yeah, I'd say it's nominated for an Oscar.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.020
"All of the Oscar Things"

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.460
Watch what's clearly a stage play Denzel Washington decided to film

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.580
because aside from a garbage truck at the beginning

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.960
they're just talking in a house the entire time.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.400
As these actors bravely explore how much acting you can fit into one movie.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.490
Featuring loud acting

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.700
(You best be making sure they're doing right by you!)

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.000
Nuance acting

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.960
(Decided seventeen years ago that boy wasn't gon' get involved in no sports.)

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.200
And snot acting

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.140
(Don't you think I ever wanted other things? Don't you think I had dreams and hopes? What about my life? What about me?)

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.400
"Actors"

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.380
Enjoy the brief window of time before Mel Gibson burns his bridge to Hollywood again.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.660
As he follows up the Jesus movie he filled with blood and gore

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.860
with another story about a historical pacifist

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.920
filled with tons of blood and gore!

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.720
Was that necessary? *gags*

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.880
I think I'm gonna puke.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.800
"War and Pieces"

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.240
Experience a gorgeous ode to the musicals of cinema's past

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.280
that earn nominations for best picture, best actor, best actress, best director (nice)

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.460
best cinematography (sure)

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.080
best screenplay, really?

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.320
best song, oh okay, I get that one,

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.640
best sound mixing, *scoffs* fine,

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.220
best song, again? Come on.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.920
Did nobody watch "Sing Street"?

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.900
Best costume design? What the-? they're just wearing clothes!

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.200
Man, the Academy just can't resist a movie about how special the movies are, can they?

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.120
"Hollywood Hand Job"

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.280
Those are your nominees for Best Picture

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.900
and since we bet there will be a million speeches about Trump at the Oscars

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.260
we thought we'd give him equal time to respond

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.900
via... twitter, in our "Starring" section

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.760

Potential terrorist

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.300
Immigrants

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.300
A 6 at best

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.820
Eh, 7.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.080

That's Spider-Man, I know that one. We're both from Queens. Smart Kid.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.300
OJ Simpson, great guy. Great golfer

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.300
Alternative Facts

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.080

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.180
Low energy.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.100
Wow. Amy Adams got snubbed this year and she's 0 for five when she is nominated.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.100
What's an actor gotta do to finally win an Oscar?

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.000
Oh, right, never mind.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.780
