00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.000
Hi, I’m John Green, and this is Crash Course
World History.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.530
Let’s begin today with a question.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.760
Why am I alive? Also, why don’t I have any
eyes? Ah, That’s better.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.040
The way we answer that question ends up organizing
all kinds of other thoughts, like what we

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.580
should value, and how we should behave, and
if we should eat meat, and whether we should

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.850
dump that boy who is very nice, but insanely
clingy, in a way that he cannot possibly think

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.830
is attractive. All of which adds up-

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.020
Uh, Mr. Green, Mr. Green, uh, are you talking
about me?

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.400
Yes, I’m talking about you, me from the
past. I’m telling you that one of the reasons

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.739
we study history is so that you can be a less
terrible boyfriend, but more on that momentarily.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:43.380
[theme music]

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.420
Today we’re going to talk about civilizations,
but in order to do that, we have to talk about

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.280
talking about civilizations, because it’s
a problematic word. So problematic, in fact,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.520
that I have to turn to camera 2 to discuss
it.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.320
Certain Conglomerations of humans are seen
as civilizations, whereas, say, nomadic cultures

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.000
generally aren’t, unless, you are -- say it
with me --

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.260
the mongols

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.200
By calling some groups civilizations, you
imply that all other social orders are uncivilized,

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.620
which is basically just another way of saying
that they’re savages or barbarians.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.580
side note: originally Greek, the word Barbarian
denoted anyone who did not speak ancient Greek,

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.320
because to the Greeks, all other languages
sounded like bar bar bar bar bar bar.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.740
So, that is to say that we are all essentially
barbarians, except for the classics majors,

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.660
which is worth remembering when we’re discussing
civilizations.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.800
Civilizations are like most of the things
we like to study, they’re intellectual constructs.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.860
No one woke up in the city of Thebe’s in
Egypt one morning and said, “what a beautiful

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.840
morning, I sure am living at the height of
Egyptian civilization.” Still, they’re

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.670
useful constructs, particularly when you’re
comparing one civilization to another. They’re

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.070
less useful when you’re comparing a civilization
to a non-civilization type social order, which

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.640
is why we will try to avoid that.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.619
And yes, I am getting to the good boyfriend
stuff. Patience, grasshopper.

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.090
So what is a civilization? Well, diagnosing
a civilization is a little like like diagnosing

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.909
an illness. If you have four or more of the
following symptoms, you might be a civilization.

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.130
Surplus production. Once one person can make
enough food to feed several people, it becomes

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.310
possible to build a city, another symptom
of civilization.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.830
It also leads to the specialization of labor,
which in turn leads to trade. Like, if everybody

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.180
picks berries for a living, there’s no reason
to trade, because I have berries, and you

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.440
have berries, &nbsp;but if I pick berries for a living and
you make hammers, suddenly, we have cause to trade.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.640
Civilizations are also usually associated
with social stratification, centralized government,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.390
shared values, generally in the form of religion,
and writing. And at least in the early days,

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.340
they were almost always associated with rivers.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.200
These days you can just bisect a segment of
land horizontally and vertically, and boom,

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.680
build a city. But 5000 years ago, civilizations
were almost always associated with rivers. Whether

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.200
that’s the Tigris and Euphrates, the Yellow River,
The Nile, the Amazon Basin, the Coatzacoalcos -

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.860
Gaaah! I was doing so good until I got to
Coatzacoalcos!

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.750
(computer says: Coatzacoalcos) Coatzacoalcos.
Maybe.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.480
Why river valleys? They’re flat, they’re well watered,
and when they flood, they deposit nutrient-rich silt.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.180
We’ll have more to say about most of these
civilizations later, but let’s talk about

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.349
this guy, the Indus Valley Civilization, ‘cause
it’s my all time favorite.

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.640
The Indus Valley Civilization was located
in the flood plain of the Indus and Sarawati

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.269
rivers, and it was about the best place in
the world to have an ancient civilization

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.540
because the rivers flooded very reliably twice
a year, which meant that it had the most available

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.800
calories per acre of pretty much anywhere
on the planet.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.819
We know the Indus Valley Civilization flourished
a long time ago. Probably around 3000 BCE.

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.459
Why is that question literally hanging over
my head?

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.960
But people of the Indus valley were trading
with Mesopotamians as early as 3500 BCE. We also

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:37.240
know that it was the largest of the ancient civilizations.
Archaeologists have discovered more than 1500 sites.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.159
So what do we know about this civilization?
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:43.610
Everything we know about the Indus Valley
Civilization comes from archaeology, because

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.629
while they did use written language, we don’t
know how to read it, and no Rosetta Stone

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:49.780
has thus appeared to help us learn it.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.160
I meant the other Rosetta Stone, Thought Bubble, yeah.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.460
Although, come to think of it, either would be acceptable.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.439
So here’s what we know, they had amazing
cities. Harappa and Mohenjo Daro are the best

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:04.739
known, with dense, multi-story homes constructed
out of uniformly sized bricks along perpendicular

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.680
streets. I mean this wasn’t some ancient
world version of Houston, more like Chicago.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.010
This means they must have had some form of
government and zoning, but we don’t know

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.670
what gave this government its authority.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.579
Cities were oriented to catch the wind and
provide a natural form of air conditioning.

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.550
And they were clean. Most homes were connected
to a centralized drainage system that used

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.400
gravity to carry waste and water out of the
city in big sewer ditches that ran under the

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.200
main avenues, a plumbing system that would
have been the envy of many 18th century European cities.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.880
Also, in Mohenjo Daro, the largest public
building was not a temple or a palace, but

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.520
a public bath, which historians call the Great
Bath. We don’t know what the great bath

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.180
was used for, but since later Indian culture
placed a huge emphasis on ritual purity, which

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.100
is the basis for the caste system, some
historians have speculated that the bath might

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.240
have been like a giant baptismal pool.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.760
Also, they traded. One of the coolest things
that the Indus Valley Civilization produced

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.260
were seals used as identification markers on goods
and clay tablets. These seals contained the writing

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.580
that we still can’t decipher, and a number of fantastic
designs, many featuring animals and monsters.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.110
One of the most famous and frightening is
of a man with what looks like water buffalo

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.720
horns on his head, sitting cross-legged between
a tiger and a bull. We don’t know what’s

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.090
really going on here, but it’s safe to say
that this was a powerful dude, because he

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.160
seems to be able to control the tiger.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.199
How do these seals let us know that they traded?
Well, because we found them in Mesopotamia,

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:28.949
not the indus valley. Plus, archaeologists
have found stuff like bronze in the indus

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:33.539
valley that is not native to the region. So
what did they trade? Cotton cloth. Still such

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:37.190
a fascinating export, incidentally that it
will be the subject of the 40th and final

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.440
video in this very series.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.480
But here’s the most amazing thing about the
Indus Valley people. They were peaceful. Despite

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:51.600
archaeologists finding 1500 sites, they have found
very little evidence of warfare, almost no weapons.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.520
Thanks Thought Bubble. OK, before we talk
about the fascinating demise of the Indus

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.100
Valley Civilization. It’s time for the open
letter.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.660
Magic!

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:06.419
I wonder what the secret compartment has for
me today? Oh! Fancy clothes.

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:10.979
I guess the secret compartment didn’t think
I was dressed up enough for the occasion.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:17.520
An open letter to Historians. Dear historians,
the Great Bath? Really? THE GREAT BATH? I’m

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.910
trying to make history fascinating, and you
give me a term that evokes scented candles,

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.410
bath salts and Frederic Fekkai hair products?

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.050
I know sometimes the crushingly boring names
of history aren’t your fault. You didn’t

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:33.210
name the federalist papers or the Austro-Hungarian
Empire or Adam Smith. But when you do get

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:39.350
a chance to name something, you go with THE
GREAT BATH? Not the Epic Bath of Mohenjo Daro,

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:44.960
or the Bath to End All Baths, or the Pool
That Ruled, or the Moist Mystery of Mohenjo

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:51.960
Daro or the Wet Wonder? The Great Bath? Really?
You can do better. best wishes, John Green.

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:55.580
So what happened to these people? Well, here’s
what didn’t happen to them. They didn’t

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.509
morph into the current residents of that area
of the world, Hindu Indians or Muslim Pakistanis.

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:02.990
Those people probably came from the Caucasus.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:07.919
Instead, sometime around 1750 BCE, the Indus
Valley Civilization declined until it faded

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:11.499
into obscurity. Why? Historians have three
theories.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:16.600
One: Conquest! Turns out to be a terrible military
strategy not to have any weapons, and it’s possible

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.410
people from the Indus Valley were completely
overrun by people from the Caucasus.

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:25.710
Two: Environmental Disaster! It’s possible they brought
about their own end by destroying their environment.

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:29.890
Three: Earthquake! The most interesting theory
is that a massive earthquake changed the

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.290
course of the rivers so much that
a lot of the tributaries dried up.

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.340
Without adequate water supplies for irrigation,
the cities couldn’t sustain themselves,

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.979
so people literally picked up and headed for
greener pastures.

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:44.009
Well, probably not pastures, it’s unlikely
they became nomads. They probably just moved

00:07:44.009 --> 00:07:48.319
to a different plain an continued their agricultural
ways. I am already boring you and I haven’t

00:07:48.319 --> 00:07:52.159
even told you yet how to be a better boyfriend
and/or girlfriend. I’m going to do that now.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:56.280
So we don’t know why the Indus Valley Civilization
ended, but we also don’t really know why

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:02.259
it started. Why did these people build cities, and dig
swimming pools, and make unnecessarily ornate seals?

00:08:02.259 --> 00:08:06.860
Were they motivated by hunger, fear, a desire
for companionship, the need to be near their

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:11.949
sacred spaces, or a general feeling that city
life was just more awesome than foraging?

00:08:11.949 --> 00:08:15.740
Thinking about what motivated them to structure
their life as they did helps us to think about

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:20.419
how we structure our own lives. In short,
you’re clingy because you’re motivated

00:08:20.419 --> 00:08:22.940
by fear and a need for companionship,

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.330
and she finds it annoying because it’s enough
work having to be responsible for herself

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.639
without having to also be responsible for
you.

00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:32.849
Also, you’re not really helping her by clinging,
and from the Indus Valley in the bronze age,

00:08:32.849 --> 00:08:36.479
to school life today, human life is all about
collaboration.

00:08:36.479 --> 00:08:40.279
Trading cloth for bronze, building cities
together, and collaborating to make sure that

00:08:40.279 --> 00:08:42.909
human lives are tilted to catch the wind.

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:47.540
Next week we will travel here to discuss the
Hot Mess o’ Potamia, but in the meantime,

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:52.519
if you have any questions, leave them in comments,
and our team of semi-trained semi-professionals

00:08:52.519 --> 00:08:54.160
will do their best to answer them.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:58.149
Also, you’ll find some suggested resources
in the video info below, he said, pointing

00:08:58.149 --> 00:09:05.149
at his pants. Thanks for watching, and we’ll
see you next week!
