00:00:06.097 --> 00:00:10.260
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: Good morning,
and welcome to Playtime 2018.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.860
Thank you for joining us today.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.750
Who recognizes this?

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:17.980
Ha-ha.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:24.460
Couple days ago, I heard
that Android market

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.870
was launched almost to
the date 10 years ago.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.130
I saw some show of hands.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.850
How many people had an
app on Android market?

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.390
Wow, that's awesome.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.170
I joined four years later
when Play just got launched.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.570
It was a simpler time, but one
with lots of uncertainties.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.140
I remember having conversations
with lots of you in this room

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.700
and wondering, will people
ever pay for apps and games

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.230
on Android?

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.620
Remember those conversations?

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.630
And Playtime was a
small group of us

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.920
in a conference room at
Google Mountain View.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.030
Look how far we have come.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.030
Today, together we have built a
thriving, multi-billion-dollar

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.410
industry.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.330
You have identified needs we
did not even think existed

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.220
and created new markets
for self-driving--

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.000
sorry, ride sharing,
not self-driving yet,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.460
right, for ride sharing,
hunting Pokemons,

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.150
for finding customized
fitness, et cetera.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.140
And we have spent a lot
of time actively listening

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.560
to you to understand
how to build products

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.780
and programs to meet your need.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.440
I was really pleased
that you feel heard.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.260
In a recent developer
satisfaction study,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.190
you told us that you
recognize your input

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.060
in the products and programs
we have built. I loved it.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.060
So we're really grateful
for the active dialogue

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.780
that we've been having together
and want to continue that

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.710
so that we can build more
amazing apps and games

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.760
and thriving businesses.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.190
So today, I want to start
with a focus on the user.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.870
Users care about
three key things--

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.130
and I think we need to
partner on all of them--

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.490
app quality, safety and
trust, and digital well-being.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.670
So let's start with app quality.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:44.930
In this room, you represent the
highest quality apps and games.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.110
So thank you for
your investment.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.670
You also realize that your
investments have returns.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.800
Your users spend
more time and money

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.910
but also recommend your
apps to other people.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:04.960
We know that ensuring high
quality for everybody is hard.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.490
And users sometimes
are unforgiving.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.440
We see a 52% increase
in 1-star rating

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.070
when a user experiences a crash.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.880
Therefore, we've been investing
in a set of tools called

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.470
Android Vitals to help you
measure quality in the field

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.750
and address them.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.710
But you've told us it's
one thing to give me data.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.430
Make it actionable.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.470
I want to stand here and
say, we have heard you.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.210
Today, we're going to
link the pre-launch report

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.280
to Android Vitals
to make sure you

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.650
get more actionable insights.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.260
More will be said
about this in classroom

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.140
sessions and other
quality-related sessions.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.260
So please attend those.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.350
I'm also pleased to
let you know that we

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.760
are going to use quality
and long-term engagement

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.270
signals in our search
and discovery algorithms.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.720
So thank you for your
investment in quality.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.589
We also do a ton of
work behind the scenes.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:22.990
Every app goes through an
extensive security review.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:30.160
And 99% of the apps that have
any abusive content is never

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.950
seen by the user,
is taken out even

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.580
before the very first install.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.660
After an app has been
installed, Google Play Protect

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.230
continues to monitor
the app and to make sure

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.750
that it behaves well.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.240
If it finds that
the app isn't, it

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.170
will either notify you
or take the app away

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.750
to ensure that your
device is safe.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.540
We scan 50 billion apps a day.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.700
50 billion apps a day.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.430
So it's not surprising that
a user who installs an app

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:16.300
exclusively from Play is nine
times less likely to come

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.250
across a harmful app than
somebody who doesn't.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.230
But we can't do this alone.

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.200
We really can't.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.600
We need you to partner with us
on this very, very important

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.230
area of user safety and trust.

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.310
Our goal is to make
sure that users

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.940
understand how
their data is used

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.090
and that access is reasonable.

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:53.510
Last week, we announced that
we are going to change access

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.240
to estimates and call log APIs.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.750
I'm sure you've heard it.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.580
We wanted to make sure that
the apps that use these APIs

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.920
absolutely need them.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.380
We could not have
done it without you.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.130
We spoke to lot of you
and took your feedback

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.050
before we made the changes.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:20.600
Your input allows us to
strike that right balance

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:26.180
between meeting user needs and
enabling you to have and build

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.300
unique experiences.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.700
I want to stand
here and assure you

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.190
that we will have more
such conversations

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.345
but also give you sufficient
notice to make these changes.

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.460
You know that as of November 1--

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:49.200
hopefully, everybody does--
that all new apps and updates

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.590
should target API 26.

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.880
Everybody's aware?

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.150
Yes?

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.680
OK.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.990
It's a few days away.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.630
All right.

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:05.110
So this is important because
it makes the user safer,

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:09.660
but also improves battery
life for all your apps.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:14.450
Now, we announced
this 10 months ago.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:18.110
And we gave very clear
guidance on how to comply.

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.350
That is how we will
continue to engage with you.

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:24.230
So please work with us.

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:29.490
My one request is for you
to keep on top of this.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:34.730
How many of you know whether the
contact information on our Play

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.650
Console is up to date?

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.940
I see.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.430
I would expect everybody
to put their hands up.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:49.090
If you don't, please do.

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:52.390
Also, look up our newsletters.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:58.420
And please engage with us
when we ask for feedback.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.520
I want to thank
everybody who responded

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.430
to our recent developer
satisfaction study

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:07.315
and hope to have continue
this dialogue going forward.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:14.480
So stay in touch, and
please update your contacts.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:22.000
We know that safety,
security, quality,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.850
have always been
important to our users.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:28.930
But recently, people
have been thinking a lot

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:32.559
about striking that right
balance between using

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:35.140
technology and disconnecting.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.820
This is me.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:41.539
For me, it's about spending time
with family, being outside--

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:43.690
I love to travel--

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.160
and being in nature.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:51.860
At Google, we've spent
a lot of time thinking

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.470
about digital well-being.

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:55.760
And at I/O, we
launched something

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.540
called a digital
well-being initiative.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.270
We have incorporated a
bunch of capabilities

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:04.760
directly into Android Key.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.460
And we're giving a
dashboard to users

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:13.340
to understand their digital
usage and also set controls.

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.050
They can set time limits.

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:19.640
They can set time to wind
down, charge, et cetera.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:24.170
As businesses, you and
I have a responsibility

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:29.770
to respect our developers',
our users' time.

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:35.230
We frequently see that apps
that respect users' time have

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:38.650
higher long-term engagement.

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:42.010
Today, we want to invite
you into the dialogue

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:45.280
because many of you have been
thinking about this deeply

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.320
for a very long time.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.830
This evening, I'll be
hosting a fireside chat

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:55.270
with Arianna Huffington
to start this dialogue

00:09:55.270 --> 00:10:00.160
on this topic of long-term,
sustainable engagement

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:04.450
and our responsibility
as businesses.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:07.240
She'll also share
some personal tips

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:14.800
on how we can work together for
our own sustained performance

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:15.670
and well-being.

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.410
Your own-- most of
you are leaders--

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:21.490
your own sustained
performance and well-being.

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:25.090
So I hope that all
of you will continue

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:30.080
to engage on these three very
important topics of quality,

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.100
safety and trust, and
digital well-being.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:36.160
Now to talk about the
many other features

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.520
that we have been working
on based on your feedback,

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:44.715
I'm inviting on
stage Matt Henderson.

00:10:44.715 --> 00:10:45.215
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:45.215 --> 00:10:49.191
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:49.191 --> 00:10:50.800
MATT HENDERSON: Thanks, Purnima.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.120
And hi, everybody.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:55.360
So my team and I build
Play developer products

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.860
like the Play Console.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:00.970
And today, I'd like to talk
more about some play tools that

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:04.630
can help fuel your growth.

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.790
Today, you'll hear about
the tremendous potential

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:10.600
of our new smarter model
for app distribution.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.100
We'll be talking
about features that

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.760
help you attract
new users and also

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:19.320
tools that help you to monetize
and grow your business.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:26.800
So average app size
has grown dramatically.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.980
It's up three times in
the last four years.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:34.590
But that size growth
carries a cost.

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:36.990
It reduces in-store conversion.

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:40.230
And it increases
uninstall rates.

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:43.770
So this is why we built
the Android app bundle.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:48.090
We announced it earlier
this year at I/O. Using it,

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:51.930
we're able to serve only
the code and resources

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:55.140
that a specific device needs.

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:59.170
And this enables you to
reduce the size of your app.

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:01.800
Well, since we launched
it just a short time ago,

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:06.090
thousands of Android app
bundles have reached production

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:07.740
all over the world.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.290
We're really excited with
how it's progressing.

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:15.300
And although the size savings
varies from app to app,

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.840
on average, we're
seeing a 35% reduction

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.430
in the size, which is terrific.

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:24.720
We're really excited for
the potential of this.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.420
You're going to hear
more about the bundle

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:28.980
and the other
benefits of smaller

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:33.120
apps and the possibilities with
modular apps at the session

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.330
right after this one.

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:39.740
So in addition to bundling
and distributing apps,

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:42.230
we've also introduced
new features

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:45.030
to help you attract
and engage users.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:47.360
And one of these is
pre-registration.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:52.370
So we've had pre-registration
and testing for some time now.

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:56.270
And it lets you gather
interest from users

00:12:56.270 --> 00:13:01.550
before your app or game is
released in order to produce

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:04.620
higher day one installs.

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:08.090
It gathers up the demand
for that initial launch.

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:10.580
And since we started
testing it, we've

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:14.250
had more than 250 million
pre-registrations,

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:15.150
which is awesome.

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:16.490
And we're just getting started.

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:20.540
And today, I'm excited to
announce that pre-registration

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:24.620
is available to all of
our app and game partners.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:27.476
And it's fully self-service
in the Play Console

00:13:27.476 --> 00:13:32.080
So developers, also now
with pre-registration,

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:37.120
they have the ability to provide
a promotion that rewards people

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:41.060
for signing up their
interest early.

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:44.290
And we think that's got
great potential as well.

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:48.640
And additionally, we've
integrated the Google Play

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.450
Instant experience.

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:56.110
So this can let a user get
a taste of your app or game

00:13:56.110 --> 00:14:01.030
prior to it actually being
ready and available to install.

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:02.860
And you can see
an example of this

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:06.060
here with the Looney
Tunes World of Mayhem.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.650
It's the one on the left.

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:12.160
So we really think that
it's going to help provide

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.500
enough of a taste that
more and more people will

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.870
get into this pre-launch
interest mode.

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:21.040
So Google Play Instant,
it also now supports

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:24.070
premium apps and as an
example, on the right,

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:26.005
the Umiro by Devolver Digital.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.680
With Instant, we've
also made it easier

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:34.760
to build with integrations
into Cocos Creator.

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:38.420
And a Unity plugin is
now available also.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:41.900
Google Play Instant drives
incremental installs

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:44.180
because people get
enough of a taste of it

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:45.330
that they want more.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.340
And they want to install it.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:50.420
We also have another
new launch that

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:53.360
helps to increase in-store
conversion from the Detail

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.810
page.

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.830
So one of the top
requests from developers

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:00.410
has been the ability
to modify store listing

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:04.880
pages based on user
country not just language.

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.800
Well, now you can.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.900
Let's walk through an example.

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:13.190
In this example, so Halloween
in the US and Diwali in India,

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:17.060
they're about a week apart,
very different events.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:20.870
And users in both countries
tend to have their devices set

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:22.850
to US English.

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:26.960
So now with the country
store listing targeting,

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.090
you can change the
store listing content

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:31.680
based on the user's country.

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:37.310
So here, for two users that have
their device set to US English,

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:39.590
not only are the
icons and photos

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:42.660
different for this recipe
app in this example,

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:46.130
but also the description talks
about different festivals

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:50.500
and different features that may
be important in each country.

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.420
We think this has
great potential.

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:54.340
And now we've
covered features that

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:57.520
are going to help bring users
into your app, let's talk

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:01.620
about helping you
grow your business.

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:04.610
So our commerce platform
makes it easy for people

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:09.470
to safely purchase on Play in
over 150 markets via credit

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:14.240
card, direct carrier billing,
PayPal, and gift cards.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:18.080
And the gift cards are now
available in more than 800,000

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:21.010
locations worldwide.

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:24.580
It also supports various
models like premium apps,

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.190
in-app purchasing,
and subscriptions.

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:31.390
And subscriptions, our
features continue to expand.

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:33.680
We're testing the
ability, for example,

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:36.940
for a user to subscribe
directly from your store listing

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:40.930
page from the same button
as they choose to install.

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:45.250
We're also testing the ability
to let users temporarily

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:49.910
pause a subscription
instead of canceling it.

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:51.740
And we're now making
it easier for you

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:55.640
to roll out a price change
to your existing subscribers.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.250
You may recall at
I/O, we announced

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:01.520
we were starting to
test with early access

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:05.359
the ability for a price
change to be notified out

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:06.940
to existing suppliers.

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:10.579
Well, now we're extending
that to general availability.

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:12.619
You can learn more
about these features

00:17:12.619 --> 00:17:15.290
and how they help your
subscriptions business

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:18.369
in a session later today.

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:20.740
Along with strong growth
and subscriptions,

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:23.950
we're seeing more developers
use a hybrid approach

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:25.760
to monetization.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:30.730
So one trend has been to reward
users for specific action

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:32.710
like watching a video.

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:36.880
And the reward can be in-game
currency or other benefits.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:40.660
Today, we're excited to
announce a new monetization

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:43.750
type called rewarded products.

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:46.750
Users can elect to
watch a short video.

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:49.720
And upon completion,
they're rewarded

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:54.130
by the developer in virtual
goods or in-game currency.

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:57.850
This offering is powered
by Google Ads technology.

00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:02.170
And the implementation
uses the same API calls

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:06.700
that are used for in-app
purchases on Google.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:09.890
No third party SDK
is required for this.

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:12.700
So we're currently testing
this in closed beta.

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:16.920
But we'll share more
details in the coming weeks.

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.580
We've covered quite a bit.

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:20.310
But as you know,
there's many more--

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:24.280
a huge range of features
that are available in Play.

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:27.210
And it can be tricky
for you and your teams

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:28.850
to understand them all.

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:31.410
So to help you take
advantage of all the tools

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:33.030
and features that
we offer, we're

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:36.240
launching the Academy
for App Success.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.960
Today, there are 10 courses
that have information

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:44.400
ranging from managing the app's
release to granting refunds.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.075
Going forward, we'll
support more languages.

00:18:47.075 --> 00:18:48.450
And we're going
to be adding more

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:51.480
content to help
you and your teams

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.520
to take advantage of
all of the features

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.893
that Play has to offer.

00:18:54.893 --> 00:18:56.560
So we really hope
that you check it out.

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:02.320
We've talked about some new
tools for growth on mobile.

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:06.700
But I wanted to also touch on
the broader device landscape.

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.850
So as you know, we continue
to push your apps out

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:15.880
to more devices with Wear
OS, Android TV, Android Auto,

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:19.240
and across all surfaces
with the Assistant.

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:22.480
Today I'd like to
focus on Chrome OS.

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.760
Hopefully, you heard
last week we launched

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.080
an exciting new device--

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.420
the Google Pixel Slate.

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:31.660
It's a great example of our
investment in the Chrome OS

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:33.630
ecosystem.

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:35.700
And I'd like to explain
how that growing

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:40.560
ecosystem is an exciting
opportunity for developers.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:45.210
In just a few years, Chromebooks
has gone from a fun experiment

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:48.000
to being available
throughout the world.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.170
They range from traditional
laptops to convertibles.

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:55.770
And they're created in
partnership with top OEMs

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:59.430
like Samsung, HP,
Dell, and others.

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:03.450
They're now available in more
than 10,000 retail locations

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:04.290
around the world.

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:05.445
And we continue to expand.

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:11.190
The made by Google
Pixel Slate is

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:14.520
designed to bring
games and apps to life

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:18.340
with brilliant entertainment
and portable performance.

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:20.460
Let's take a closer
look at a couple

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:24.300
of great app experiences
optimized for Chromebooks

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:25.480
and the Pixel Slate.

00:20:28.679 --> 00:20:33.580
So Gameloft wanted Asphalt
8 Airborne to give users

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:35.740
more speed and control.

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:39.250
And since the Chrome OS
treats its physical keyboard

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:42.040
like an external keyboard
on an Android phone,

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:46.120
Asphalt 8 was able to support
keyboard controls using APIs

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:48.940
from Android SDK 26.

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:52.100
As a result, for
users on Chrome OS,

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:54.520
Asphalt 8 saw a
whopping six times

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:58.690
increase in daily active users
and a nine times increase

00:20:58.690 --> 00:20:59.860
in revenue.

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:03.490
The Gameloft team was excited
about the strong results.

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:05.890
And so optimizing
for larger screens

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:07.810
has become standard practice.

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:09.370
And they've just
finished optimizing

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:12.475
the latest edition in their
series, Asphalt 9 Legends.

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:17.960
So Evernote is
another great example

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.760
of Chrome OS integration.

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:24.920
The Evernote team was excited to
use the low latency stylus API

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:28.040
to quickly implement
touchscreen handwriting

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:31.700
and enhance layouts
for wider screens.

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:35.210
Now without the
latency, their users

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:37.800
feel like they're actually
just drawing on paper,

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.360
which is an awesome experience.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.930
And as a result, the
average Evernote user

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:46.730
now spends three times more
on larger screen devices

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:48.830
and four times more
time when they're

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:52.290
using the Google Pixelbook.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:54.630
So another great
app for creators

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:57.240
is Adobe Premiere Rush.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:01.530
It's a new video platform that
will allow people to create,

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:04.500
to edit, and share
videos on the go.

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:05.430
And the best part--

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:09.370
it's coming soon to Chromebooks.

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:13.610
So these developers went
beyond a mobile-only strategy.

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:16.760
They adapted their
products to serve users

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.750
on a variety of devices.

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:21.590
And as a result, they
got increased engagement

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:22.700
from users.

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:25.670
The same may be true for you.

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:29.090
Android apps are now
available on Chrome OS.

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:32.240
So you can take your app, and
with just a few adjustments,

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:35.000
optimize it for larger screens.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.580
And if you want to get
your hands on a Slate,

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:40.017
look for the Chrome
booth outside.

00:22:40.017 --> 00:22:41.600
There's a rumor going
around that they

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.558
have a bunch of Slates.

00:22:42.558 --> 00:22:44.890
So check them out.

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:46.570
So that's it for me today.

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:48.910
There's lots of
awesome stuff to come.

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:49.760
Thanks very much.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:51.610
