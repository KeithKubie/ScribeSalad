00:00:01.267 --> 00:00:02.769
You've tried slap chef.

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:04.871
But that just left you hungry
and with a searing headache.

00:00:04.938 --> 00:00:06.773
And those other
weight-loss programs

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.207
are exhausting.

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:10.010
Can't I just do nothing?

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:12.645
What if I told you you could
with Sleep Gym?

00:00:12.711 --> 00:00:13.746
( Amy )
I'd say sign me up.

00:00:13.812 --> 00:00:15.281
But what's Sleep Gym?

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:18.050
Sleep Gym is a workout program
where we do all the work.

00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:19.152
Huh?

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:21.787
Are you from Sleep Gym?

00:00:21.854 --> 00:00:25.457
After we induce you into a coma,
it's off to the gym.

00:00:25.524 --> 00:00:26.993
As the Sleep Gym trainers

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.094
take your body through
strenuous workouts,

00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:30.296
the increased blood flow

00:00:30.362 --> 00:00:32.464
painlessly burns
the calories away.

00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:35.868
You'll never have to feel
yourself doing annoying things

00:00:35.935 --> 00:00:37.203
like hiking,

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.738
kickboxing,

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:41.807
the official bootcamp of the
United States Navy Seals.

00:00:41.874 --> 00:00:43.276
( whistle blowing )

00:00:43.342 --> 00:00:46.312
Move it, you sleepy
piece of ( bleep )!

00:00:46.378 --> 00:00:47.780
All right,
see you later, Mom!

00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:49.315
( woman )
Where are you going?

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:50.750
The gym.
