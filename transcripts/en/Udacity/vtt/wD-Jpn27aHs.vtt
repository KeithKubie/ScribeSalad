00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So congratulations, you have now mastered a

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
basic survival course for NP-completeness.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
You have learned about advanced algorithmic techniques

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
such as intelligent search trees, pre-processing,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and other advanced techniques such as fixed-parameter tractability

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
that will help you solve and P-complete problems in practice.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now this material is very deep.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Not many people, at least in my experience,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
even understand with NP-completeness means,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
but even fewer people know about these tools and techniques

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
that you can use to poke holes or find loopholes

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
in the laws of NP-completeness.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So knowing these techniques and possibly learning more about them

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
can really make you stand out

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
whenever NP-complete problems need to be solved.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Of course, even though these techniques are very powerful,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
sometimes it's just not possible in practice to solve an NP-complete problem.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
As I hope you're expecting by now,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
we still won't give up.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Rather, in the next unit,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
we will see if it helps us when we relax a little bit,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and instead of looking for the best possible solution,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
are content with solutions that are not quite optimal.

00:01:04.000 --> 99:59:59.000
In other words, next time we'll get sloppy.
