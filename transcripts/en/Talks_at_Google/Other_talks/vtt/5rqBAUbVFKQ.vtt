00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:01.650
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hello.

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.050
I am delighted to have Laura
Heck here with us today.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.240
Laura is a licensed
marriage and family

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.260
therapist in private practice.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.950
She recently served in a
leadership role at the Gottman

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.210
Institute as the Director
of Professional Development.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.420
Together with the Gottman
Institute clinical director,

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.260
Laura co-developed the Gottman
Seven Principles Program

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.110
and is also the author of the
"Seven Principles Companion

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.130
Workbook," a tool for
couples to use in conjunction

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.700
with the "Seven Principles
for Making Marriage Work"

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.190
book by Dr. John Gottman.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.410
Laura is a master trainer
for the program which

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.370
has trained thousands of people
to offer the Seven Principles

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.890
Program in their communities
across six continents.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.580
Laura resides in Salt
Lake City with her beloved

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.330
and very patient husband.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.400
And they have a
one-year-old son.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.330
Welcome, Laura.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.246
LAURA HECK: Thank you.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.530
So what Alison didn't
say is that I'm also

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.980
the godmother to her child.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.459
So we know each other very well.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:06.804
She is my BFF.

00:01:06.804 --> 00:01:08.820
So I'm here.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.830
I've given, sort
of, about an hour.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.380
And what I'd really like to
do is just share with you

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.460
the CliffNotes version
of the "Seven Principles

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.370
for Making Marriage Work."

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.250
I'm just curious, by kind
of a show of hands or a nod

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.880
or a wink, how many
of you have either

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.080
heard of Dr. John Gottman or
are familiar with the "Seven

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.650
Principles" book?

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:30.640
OK.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.100
How many of you have
actually seen him live,

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.700
seen him present live?

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.200
OK.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.390
I am not going to be
as charismatic or funny

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.920
or brilliant as John
Gottman, but I will certainly

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.210
try to give you as much
information in as short

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.190
a period of time as possible.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.610
So as Alison had
mentioned, the reason

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.790
why I'm here and speaking
on the Seven Principles

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.850
is that I have had the pleasure
of co-developing the Seven

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.430
Principles Program, which
is really a training

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.270
program for training
professionals

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.620
all around the world to
work with couples using this

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.550
as their main criteria,
their main curriculum.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.000
And so I know the Seven
Principles inside and out.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.110
And I just taught
the class yesterday

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.500
here in Seattle, Washington.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.900
And I think the next
place I go is Chicago.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.920
And then it just kind of
continues on from there.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.256
As far as questions,
I think maybe

00:02:23.256 --> 00:02:25.880
what would be helpful is if you
have a question about something

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.390
that we're covering, if I
notice, just as far as time

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.710
goes, that I have some time
to take some questions,

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.950
I'll ask for you to
come up to the mic.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.660
And I might be
able to take a few.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.961
And if I don't get to it,
hold on to your questions.

00:02:37.961 --> 00:02:39.210
Hopefully you can remember it.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.870
And then I'm hoping that
we can cover all of them.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.030
OK?

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.320
OK.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:51.580
So this book has actually
been in print since 1999.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.640
And it just recently rolled
over the $1 million mark.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.650
Not million dollars, but
1 million copies sold.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.120
And there was a rewrite that was
done on this just one year ago.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.550
And it has been translated
into 20 different languages.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.760
The reason why this
book is so important

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.810
is that Dr. Gottman has been
studying couples for 40 years.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.740
He's studied over 3,000 couples.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.740
And over those 40
years, he has been

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.270
able to distill down
as much information

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.610
as possible into seven
principles which I'm hoping

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.090
I'm able to get through
all seven for you

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.460
so that you can go home in
whatever relationship you have,

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.960
and you can begin to apply
some of these principles

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.660
for making relationships work.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.710
The nice part about Dr.
Gottman's principles

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.270
is that it's not just about
intimate relationships,

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.580
although those are the
ones that he was studying.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.690
You can directly apply a
lot of these principles

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.750
to coworker relationships,
to the relationships

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.930
with your children,
to the relationships

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.160
with your parents.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.600
Any relationship that you have.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.440
Because it's really about
how to communicate in a way

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.250
that is truly
hearing your partner.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.280
It's about being able to
work through problem-solving

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.850
and how to have a meaningful
connection with another person.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.090
OK.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.220
So what I'd like to
start out by doing

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.440
is to just give you
a brief synopsis

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.260
as far as Dr. Gottman's
research and how

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.660
he came to come about
all of this information.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.940
So Dr. Gottman
originally started out

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.800
as a mathematics major at MIT.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.170
And he was actually
young when he started.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.220
But he had a roommate.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.990
And this roommate was
studying psychology.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.570
And I don't know how many
of you enjoy psychology,

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.769
but John was looking
at his math books

00:04:35.769 --> 00:04:38.060
and had decided that whatever
his roommate was studying

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.280
was more fun than what he was
studying, which I don't blame.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.750
So he promptly finished
up his mathematics degree

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.790
and then went in to
become a psychologist.

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.980
So not only does he have this
firm foundation in numbers,

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.900
he became a
researcher, but he also

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.910
has this firm foundation
in psychology.

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.520
So we have this amazing
combination in this math wizard

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.430
that was interested
in relationships

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.140
but could also study
really, really well

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.460
and definitively defining
what it is that relationships,

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.280
makes them work.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.120
So Dr. Gottman went from
MIT, and then he went over

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.850
to the University of Indiana.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.510
And he started working with
his best friend, Bob Levinson.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.070
So Dr. Gottman says at the time
that his relationships were not

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.320
going so hot at the time.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.990
And Bob Levinson and
him were interested in

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.910
good relationships with women.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.600
But at the time, Bob
said, we can either

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.900
research good relationships
or we can have them.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.630
And right now,
we're researchers.

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.250
So the two of them set
out to discover in,

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.220
I think he would say somewhat of
a selfish way, what is it that

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.660
makes good relationships work.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.380
And they wanted to
study relationships

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.390
in a way that had
never been done before.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:52.880
It's very difficult to predict
behavior in one person.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.040
But Dr. Gottman wanted
to predict behavior

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.790
with two people.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.650
So they would bring couples
in to a laboratory setting

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.830
and within eight hours of
the couple being apart,

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.190
he would have the two of
them sit side by side.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.670
And they would hook
them up to monitors

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.580
that would study how
fast their hearts were

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.920
beating at the time.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.520
They would see how much they
were sweating by testing

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.170
the palms of their hands.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.016
They had monitors underneath
the chairs that would measure

00:06:22.016 --> 00:06:23.140
how much they would fidget.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.810
They were called jiggle-ometers.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.900
And then he would just
ask for these couples,

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.100
I simply want for
you to just catch up.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.020
Tell me about your day.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.270
What have you been doing?

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:34.775
So couples would
turn to one another

00:06:34.775 --> 00:06:36.400
and they would start
talking about sort

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.710
of the mundane things
about their day.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.450
Meanwhile, researchers
were coding

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.160
their facial expressions.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.800
They had cameras that
were recording them.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.610
And back in the
day, in the '70s,

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.500
how large was the computer
back in the '70s, right?

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.000
Size of a refrigerator.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.820
All that computer
was intended to do

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.540
was to take the
physiological data that

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.140
was going on with these
couples and timecode it.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.800
And then he would ask for
couples to switch over.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.740
I want you to just
choose a topic.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.500
Something that the
two of you haven't

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:05.650
been able to agree upon.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.900
And I just want you to
try to solve the problem.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.775
Have this conflict conversation
while we are watching you.

00:07:11.775 --> 00:07:13.614
So couples start
to pick a problem.

00:07:13.614 --> 00:07:15.530
Maybe they're talking
about the mother-in-law,

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.180
maybe they're talking
about laundry.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.580
What are things that get
underneath your skin?

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.520
And they recorded the data.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.980
So they had these
two snippets of time.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.340
Happy conversation, not
so happy conversation.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.130
Then they sent the couples away.

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.140
All they were looking
for were patterns.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.660
They really didn't
have a hypothesis

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.570
at the time of what
they were looking for,

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:36.954
but they were looking
for patterns a lot

00:07:36.954 --> 00:07:39.370
like early day astronomers
that were looking at the stars.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:42.740
Simply looking for something
to stick out to them.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.440
That was about 35 years ago.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.380
25 years ago, he goes from
the University of Indiana,

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.770
now he's at the
University of Washington.

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:52.970
And he opens up what
he calls the Love Lab.

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:56.520
The BBC had sort of
called it the Love Lab.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.340
But what he wanted
to do was he wanted

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.760
to see if couples were in a
natural environment for 24

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.290
hours, what would I see.

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:04.210
What would stick out?

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:05.840
What patterns would arise?

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.750
So he made this one bedroom
studio apartment as comfortable

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.840
as possible on the University
of Washington's campus.

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.070
It overlooked the
Montlake Cut, so you could

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:17.430
see the boats floating by.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:19.080
It was a beautiful setting.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.710
And he would say from Sunday
at 8 o'clock in the morning

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.110
until Monday morning at
8 o'clock in the morning,

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:26.180
I want you to just
come and hang out.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:27.680
We will not prompt you.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.890
We're not going to give
you anything to do.

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:32.700
We just simply want to
watch and observe you.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.867
But we want this to be, like,
really comfortable for you.

00:08:35.867 --> 00:08:38.200
We want you to feel as if
you're in a bed and breakfast.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.820
We want this to be as
natural as possible.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.880
So couples would bring
their creature comforts.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.172
They would bring groceries,
they would bring newspapers,

00:08:46.172 --> 00:08:48.380
they would bring
puzzles and games.

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.340
Anything they could
do for 24 hours.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.040
So in this bed and
breakfast-like setting,

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.064
couples would hang out.

00:08:55.064 --> 00:08:56.480
Again, they're
wearing the monitor

00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:02.030
so that they could see how
fast their heart was beating.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:05.686
Any time that they urinated,
they would take urine samples.

00:09:05.686 --> 00:09:07.880
They had a one-way
mirror where researchers

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.330
would be back behind coding
their facial expressions.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:12.946
And when everything
was said and done,

00:09:12.946 --> 00:09:14.570
they would go right
next door, and they

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:15.780
would have their blood drawn.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.690
But Dr. Gottman assures us
that it was very relaxing

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:24.512
for couples and it was a lot
like a bed and breakfast.

00:09:24.512 --> 00:09:26.660
So then he would send
these couples home.

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.690
But it was a longitudinal study.

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:31.470
So meanwhile, he's
collecting all of this data,

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.209
and he's starting to
look for patterns.

00:09:33.209 --> 00:09:35.000
The only way that you
can look for patterns

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.910
is if you have this
longitudinal data.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.390
Where do these couples end up?

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:40.890
What do we know
about these couples?

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:44.350
So he had 147 newlywed couples.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.690
And then he checked back in
with those newlywed couples.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:51.620
Of those newlywed couples, 17
of them ended up divorcing.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:53.310
What were the patterns?

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:56.570
How do we know what is distinct
and different about the 130

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.590
couples that stayed
together and what

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:00.940
is distinct and different
about the 17 couples that

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.320
ended up divorcing?

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.830
So remember when I said that
he was very interested in being

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:08.050
able to predict behavior.

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:10.610
So it's hard to predict
behavior for two people.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.380
Even more difficult
than one person.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.750
He was able to predict 15
out of 17 of those couples.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:19.720
So he said those, those, those,
those, those, those, those.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.360
And when he checked back in
with the couples, 15 out of 17.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:26.000
So with 90% and above
accuracy, that those couples

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.520
would end up divorcing.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.530
And he repeated this
study seven times

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:32.550
and still was able to
predict with 90% accuracy.

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.710
So we know with
pretty good certainty

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:36.360
what those behaviors are.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.480
Are you interested
in knowing what it is

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.022
that those couples were doing?

00:10:40.022 --> 00:10:42.480
Either the ones that weren't
doing so hot and the ones that

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.620
were doing well?

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:44.580
OK.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.610
So that is the
foundation of this book.

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:49.450
And John jokes that he's
really just a researcher,

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:52.210
he wasn't very interested
in helping couples.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:54.830
He was making a fine living
at watching these couples'

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:56.710
relationships deteriorate.

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:58.370
It wasn't without
the bleeding heart

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:01.310
of his beautiful, wonderful
wife, Dr. Julie Schwartz

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:04.260
Gottman, that really got him
interested in taking this data

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.890
and turning it into
something that real couples

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:08.460
could hold onto.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.130
So that is how the "Seven
Principles" book came to be,

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:13.160
is they started
working with couples

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.850
and applying the concepts
that he had learned.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:18.910
And says, don't do
this, but do this.

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:21.180
And that's how the "Seven
Principles" book came to be.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:26.857
So without further ado, I'm
really not good at slideshows.

00:11:26.857 --> 00:11:28.440
This is really just
because my husband

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.520
told me to do a slideshow.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.220
I listen.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:32.790
I listen.

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:35.110
I took his, took his advice.

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:37.610
So what is it that we
learned about these couples?

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:39.380
Well, Dr. Gottman
was able to notice

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:42.130
that the couples who'd
ended up divorcing, there

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:45.880
were four patterns that were
specifically and incredibly

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.280
destructive to relationships.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:49.890
So if you'll take
a look up here,

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:52.840
you notice that criticism
is the first one.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.780
Criticism is incredibly
common in relationships.

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:56.780
It's incredibly common.

00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:58.690
I'm sure you're probably
thinking, oh yeah,

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:01.130
I know what
criticism feels like.

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:03.390
I definitely have somebody
that criticizes me.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:07.590
It's my mom, it's my wife,
I criticize my partner,

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:09.030
whatever it might be.

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:13.490
But criticism comes up in
relationships all the time.

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:17.080
It looks like when you have
a complaint about something,

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.080
whatever it might be, the thing
that I complain most about

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.770
are the clothes that are
left next to the bed.

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:26.760
So my husband has this habit
of undressing before bed,

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:27.960
and then there's this pile.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.960
And at the end of the week,
the pile is as tall as the bed.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.750
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:35.785
So I could either
criticize my partner

00:12:35.785 --> 00:12:37.910
and I could say something
like, you're such a slob,

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:39.950
you treat this home
like a frat house.

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:42.610
Or I could be gentle.

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:44.310
So the antidotes
are in the blue.

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:47.700
And I could complain
rather than criticize.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:53.500
Criticism looks like a
globalizing criticism

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.480
of your partner's deficiencies.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.200
So you may say to your
partner, you're a slob.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.250
That's criticism.

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:02.230
But if you really want to do
what the masters are doing,

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:04.370
you would complain
without blaming.

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:08.070
You would say, you know, I'm not
so hot on all of these clothes

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:09.141
next to the bed.

00:13:09.141 --> 00:13:11.640
I would really appreciate it
if you were to take the clothes

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:12.930
and put them in the hamper.

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:15.145
So that's what the
masters are doing.

00:13:15.145 --> 00:13:17.520
I'm not telling you not to
complain in your relationship,

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.240
I'm just asking that
you don't criticize.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.750
OK?

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.450
Second one is defensiveness.

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:25.950
So criticism and
defensiveness go hand in hand.

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:28.970
Defensiveness is warding
off a perceived attack.

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:31.670
So if your partner is
a master criticizer,

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:34.080
you are going to become
a master defender.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:38.440
And criticism can look
like, well, I don't do that,

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.490
but did you see this over here?

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:42.620
And you're sort of,
like, counterattacking.

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:46.400
Defensiveness can also
look like whining.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.550
Oh, why do you
always pick on me?

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:53.290
So the masters, instead
of defending themselves,

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:56.160
they're noticing what it is that
their partner is criticizing

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.400
or complaining about.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:00.360
And instead, they're taking
a small piece of that

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:01.980
and taking responsibility.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.500
So my husband, if I'm going
to criticize him and say,

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.030
you're such a
slob, he might say,

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:09.960
yeah, you know what, those
clothes have been there

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.920
for a week and I
haven't picked them up.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.740
He's taking some small
responsibility of it.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:17.460
You do not have
to take the blame.

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:19.350
But if you can find
a piece of that

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:24.140
to take responsibility for, it
easily diffuses the situation.

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:24.880
Contempt.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:29.340
Contempt is what Dr. Gottman
refers to as sulfuric acid

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.260
on the relationship.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.990
It is the most potent of
all four of the Horsemen.

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:37.090
Contempt is something that comes
later on in the relationship.

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:40.992
We see it happening much
later as well as stonewalling.

00:14:40.992 --> 00:14:44.460
But contempt is when you
believe, you truly believe,

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.530
that you are better
than your partner.

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:47.990
It looks like this.

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:51.300
I'm smarter, I'm
cleaner, I'm wiser,

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:54.190
I'm better looking
than my partner.

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:57.725
And it comes across
in statements that

00:14:57.725 --> 00:14:59.600
are really, really hurtful.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.080
In fact, Dr. Gottman
found that if I'm

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:05.950
contemptuous to my partner,
in the next four years,

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:09.190
he is more likely to have
communicable diseases.

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:11.640
It takes an effect on
your immune system.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:16.361
It actually starts to work and
chip away at the immune system.

00:15:16.361 --> 00:15:17.860
So if you want to
hurt your partner,

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.490
if you want them to
be out sick a lot,

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:21.980
then just be contemptuous.

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:25.100
What are the masters doing
rather than being contemptuous?

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.630
The masters are scanning
their environment

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:30.880
for what it is that their
partner is doing right.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.530
If you find that
you are starting

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:35.530
to slip into contempt, if you
find that you are starting

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:37.740
to think of your partner
in contemptuous ways,

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:40.210
you can change your
brain by starting

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:44.060
to recognize what is it that
I truly love and appreciate

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:44.930
about my partner.

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:47.900
My partner may not
be the smartest,

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.770
but my partner is an
incredibly hard worker.

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:53.990
My partner may not
be the sexiest,

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:56.850
but my partner is an
incredible father.

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:59.080
So you can start
to train your brain

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.400
to be looking at your
partner in fond ways

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.000
and thinking of
what are the things

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.980
that I really
appreciate about them.

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:06.500
Stonewalling.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:07.730
This is an interesting one.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:11.110
So Dr. Gottman found that
something was happening.

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:13.090
So let's go back
to the Love Lab.

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.020
He's looking at
husband and wife.

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:17.510
And he notices husband
is starting to escalate,

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:19.360
he's heart rate's
starting to go up.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.740
And then all of a
sudden, he disengages

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:22.730
from the conversation.

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:26.150
His eyes are cast to the floor,
and he's no longer paying

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:28.500
attention to his partner.

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.470
Then he went back and
he asked these guys,

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:32.250
he said, hey, what's going on.

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:33.440
What are you doing?

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.270
I noticed that in this
part of the conversation,

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:38.170
your heart rate
started to go up.

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:39.660
What was going on?

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:42.060
He found that
people were starting

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:43.810
to psychologically soothe.

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:45.460
And in order to
psychologically soothe

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.085
when they were starting
to feel flooded

00:16:47.085 --> 00:16:49.130
in these contemptuous
conversations, these really

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:52.380
tough conversations, they
would completely disengage.

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.070
They're physically
still present,

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:56.500
but they're
emotionally disengaged

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.930
and they are
cognitively disengaging

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:00.630
from the conversation.

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:02.690
80% of the time it's
happening with men.

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:04.800
Doesn't mean that
women don't stonewall,

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:08.030
it just simply means that
it's more common for men.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:09.720
So what is it that
the masters are

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:13.170
doing instead of disengaging
from that conversation?

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:15.240
They're doing psychological
self-soothing.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:17.619
This would mean that
they might indicate, hey,

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:21.890
you know what, I can't have
this conversation right now.

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:23.190
I need to take a break.

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:24.839
Or they start to breathe.

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:26.810
Whatever it might be,
they're taking a break

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:28.349
and they're not
allowing themselves

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:30.160
to disengage from
the conversation

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.780
because that will only
escalate the partner further.

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:34.400
OK.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.740
Before I go on, I
just want to ask,

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.132
does anybody have questions
about the Four Horsemen?

00:17:39.132 --> 00:17:41.090
These are the four
behaviors that have come up.

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:42.007
Yes?

00:17:42.007 --> 00:17:44.340
AUDIENCE: I'm confused in
that you describe stonewalling

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:48.465
as disengaging as
psychological self-soothing,

00:17:48.465 --> 00:17:51.315
but then what you should
do is also disengage

00:17:51.315 --> 00:17:52.720
in psychological self-soothing?

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.470
LAURA HECK: Right.

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:54.540
Exactly.

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.640
So, mic?

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.120
Oh, repeat the question, OK.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:01.890
So she's confused about the
psychological self-soothing.

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:04.320
So what's happening
is that there's

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.660
this feeling of feeling
emotionally flooded

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:09.070
that comes up when
you are in an argument

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:12.190
or you're having a
conflict conversation.

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.846
And so as you start to
feel emotionally flooded,

00:18:14.846 --> 00:18:16.720
we know that that's
happening physiologically

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.680
because the heart is
starting to beat faster.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:22.300
When it reaches up and
over 100 beats per minute,

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:25.295
and for people who are
incredibly fit, like Alison,

00:18:25.295 --> 00:18:27.940
it may be more like 95, right?

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:32.000
So once it reaches up and
over 100 beats per minute,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.880
your body is starting
to release chemicals

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:35.570
that tell you fight or flight.

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:39.900
And in order to do that, people
shut down and they curl down

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:42.940
and they become disengaged
from the conversation.

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:45.080
What the masters
are doing instead,

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.050
when they start to feel
the flooding come up,

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:48.591
is they're taking
a break and they're

00:18:48.591 --> 00:18:49.910
stopping that conversation.

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:54.490
Because what stonewalling
looks like is this.

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:56.360
And what a partner
sees is you don't

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.210
care enough to have a
conversation with me right now.

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:00.280
They escalate.

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.840
So the conversation continues
to go round and round.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.939
The more I raise my voice,
the more you shut down.

00:19:05.939 --> 00:19:07.480
If you're not paying
attention to me,

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:11.440
now I'm going to really start
to throw some fireballs at you.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.930
Verbal fireballs.

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:15.911
Any other questions?

00:19:15.911 --> 00:19:16.410
Yeah.

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:19.344
AUDIENCE: The reflex
is physiological.

00:19:19.344 --> 00:19:21.010
LAURA HECK: Physiological
self-soothing,

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:23.670
to start to take a break.

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:26.220
So what we teach couples is if
you feel like you're starting

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:28.510
to feel flooded,
emotionally flooded,

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:30.750
then let's take a
20 minute break.

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:33.180
We'll take about 20 minutes
for women, about 25 minutes

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:34.080
for men.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:35.520
Go for a walk.

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.910
Maybe clean.

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:39.270
That would be what I would do.

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:42.320
Take a bath, pet the dog,
whatever it might be.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.530
And then you start to decrease.

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:46.095
OK.

00:19:46.095 --> 00:19:48.420
So now I want to start
talking about, we've

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.650
talked about the four
destructive patterns

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:52.000
that Dr. Gottman discovered.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.350
What is it that the disasters
of relationships are doing?

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:59.270
What will cause, if
left unattended to,

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:00.330
what will cause divorce?

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:02.090
What will cause
relationship demise?

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:04.150
I do want to say
that you probably,

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:07.130
if you were like a med student
and you're going through all

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:09.630
of the diseases and you're
starting to recognize symptoms

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:11.390
of these diseases
in yourself, it's

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:13.220
a lot like the Four Horsemen.

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:15.560
You can still have a
healthy relationship

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.610
with the Four Horsemen.

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:21.890
But you also have to look at
some of the ways in which you

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:23.870
can change and transform those.

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:27.440
So if those are what are the
difficulties that couples

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.910
are having, what are the
things that Dr. Gottman found

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:32.210
will increase and make
your relationship better?

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:33.880
So we'll go through
the principles.

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:36.990
So principle number one
has to do with having

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:39.830
a strong marital foundation.

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:41.460
It's called the friendship.

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.370
I know it sounds kind
of funny that if you're

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:44.745
married to this
person, of course

00:20:44.745 --> 00:20:45.990
you're going to be friends.

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:48.640
But imagine being with
somebody for 40 years.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.690
I know with my own personal
life, sometimes I would ask,

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:53.740
are my grandparents
even friends.

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.280
Doesn't even seem like they
like each other anymore.

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:57.820
So Dr. Gottman
found that in order

00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.480
to have a strong
relationship, it

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:02.520
has to be a foundation
of friendship.

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.150
In order to increase
your friendship,

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:08.880
you have to know your partner's
inner world in and out.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.370
You have to know
everything about them.

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:13.260
When you start a
relationship, when

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:14.980
you start to fall in
love with someone,

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:17.410
you're trying to decide,
is this my forever.

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:19.880
So you might ask questions
like, well, what is

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:21.640
your grandmother's maiden name?

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.179
And what kind of is
your favorite animal?

00:21:24.179 --> 00:21:26.720
What's your favorite color, and
what's your favorite holiday?

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.230
What do you want to
be when you grow up?

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:30.360
You ask all of these
questions to get to know them.

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.800
And soon enough
you decide, OK, I'm

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.130
going to settle in with you.

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:35.650
You are my forever.

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:37.580
But then 25 years goes by.

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:41.680
This person has changed, but you
haven't asked those questions.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.870
You have no idea who this
person is any longer.

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:48.170
Love Maps is this
metaphorical idea

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:52.180
that you have a map of your
partner's internal world.

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:55.710
The goal is to make this map
as detailed and up to date

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:56.820
as possible.

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:58.090
How do you do that?

00:21:58.090 --> 00:21:59.790
So I'm going to be giving tips.

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:02.520
You can start to use this
every day in your life.

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.556
You ask your partner
open-ended questions.

00:22:04.556 --> 00:22:05.930
These are not
questions that they

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:09.010
can answer with a simple yes
or no or one word answer.

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:10.840
You're asking your
partner questions

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:15.170
that really starts to chip
away at who this person is.

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:18.684
Maybe you ask them about
their hopes and dreams.

00:22:18.684 --> 00:22:20.600
What do you want to do
in the next five years?

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.370
What is one thing that you
have, a goal that you have yet

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:24.190
to realize?

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:28.890
Or how do you feel about this
Republican Party right now?

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:31.450
I mean, what do you think?

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:35.140
Or it might be a question
like, you really,

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:37.780
really wanted to be a mother,
and we haven't had children.

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:40.780
How do you feel about not
having children right now?

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.310
These are open-ended questions.

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:47.110
So for those of you
who have an iPhone,

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:49.940
you can actually
download an app.

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:52.030
It's $1.99 and if you
shake it, it gives you

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:53.470
a new open-ended question.

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:57.290
So no matter where you
are, you will always

00:22:57.290 --> 00:22:59.330
have an open-ended question.

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:02.806
You don't have to come
up with them yourself.

00:23:02.806 --> 00:23:06.310
OK, so we're still talking about
that foundation of friendship.

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:09.920
Number two is nurturing the
fondness and admiration.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:13.830
Simply put, is that you are
choosing on a daily basis

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:17.290
to scan your environment for the
positives of what your partner

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:19.090
is doing versus the negatives.

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:19.590
OK?

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:21.780
So we're going back to the bed.

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:25.550
I wake up in the morning,
I look over at my husband,

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:28.200
he has drool coming
out of his mouth.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.666
He has, like, retainer
in so that he's not

00:23:30.666 --> 00:23:32.290
chewing on his tongue
or doing whatever

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:35.946
people do with retainers in.

00:23:35.946 --> 00:23:38.840
I look, I see, I notice that
the clothes are on the floor.

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.270
I have to step over the clothes.

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:42.550
So instantly I'm starting
to think and create

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:44.230
this world in which
my husband has

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:46.810
done all of these wrong things.

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:50.290
Or I can wake up in the
morning and I can look over

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:56.220
at my husband and I think, well,
he sure looks sexy over there.

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:59.360
He's been working out, I
see some biceps coming in.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:01.932
And maybe I look
a little bit more

00:24:01.932 --> 00:24:04.140
and I notice that he's curled
around our one-year-old

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:06.340
that he pulled into bed in
the middle of the night,

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:08.230
and I didn't even notice.

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:10.430
Like wow, what a great dad.

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:13.920
Thank you, I enjoyed eight
hours of uninterrupted sleep.

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.450
So I step over that
pile of clothes.

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:16.990
I don't even notice
them this time

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:20.050
because I'm scanning my
environment for the positives.

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:21.780
What is it that my
husband is doing right

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:24.090
versus what he's doing wrong?

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:26.960
You can use this with
your children as well.

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.630
If you are waiting
to correct your child

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:32.560
for every wrong
thing that they do,

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:36.280
do you really think that they're
going to be looking for you

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:39.490
when they achieve something
wonderful and great?

00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:42.200
Or are you going to wait
to applaud your child when

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.130
they're doing something
right and really

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:46.020
make that a big point?

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:46.850
That is awesome.

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:50.850
Thank you so much for putting
that back, that is fantastic.

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:52.647
Also, with your
relationships with,

00:24:52.647 --> 00:24:54.230
maybe the people
that you're managing.

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:57.240
If you are rewarding people
and scanning for the things

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.710
that they're doing
right, they're

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:02.590
more able to do those
things correctly.

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:04.470
So fondness and
admiration is really

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:07.460
about thinking about your
partner on a daily basis,

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:09.870
about the things that
they are doing correctly

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:11.770
and that you really
love about them.

00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:14.140
It's about training your brain.

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:16.160
One thing that you
can do is make it

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.990
a habit every single day.

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:20.160
And if you can't
remember, do this.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:23.970
Set an alarm on your phone to
send a text to your partner.

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:29.200
And I want you every single day
to say thank you so much for,

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:33.930
I really appreciated it when
you did this, you're so sexy,

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:35.780
I saw you walk
out the door today

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:38.910
and that skirt looked amazing
on you, whatever it might be.

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:41.106
But even though
you have an alarm

00:25:41.106 --> 00:25:42.480
on your phone and
your partner is

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.438
like, why does this always
come in at 2 o'clock

00:25:44.438 --> 00:25:45.560
in the afternoon.

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:48.380
It doesn't matter
because they're

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:51.030
going to appreciate that
you're sending it at all.

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:55.600
So if you're going to
do that, do that now.

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.960
Little pro tip.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.940
So we're still talking
about friendship

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:02.560
and nurturing this
friendship foundation.

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.170
The third principle
is turning toward.

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:07.800
The motto is small things often.

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.710
With everything that
Dr. Gottman does,

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:11.750
it is a motto of
small things often.

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:15.762
You can change the trajectory
of your relationship

00:26:15.762 --> 00:26:19.620
simply by doing small things
every day consistently.

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:22.830
You do not, I will tell you
this, Valentine's Day gentleman

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:24.970
and ladies, you
do not have to buy

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:29.280
that $5,000 ring
or that $50,000 car

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:32.340
or take them on that
$10,000 vacation.

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:34.064
That means nothing.

00:26:34.064 --> 00:26:36.480
But if you're sending those
appreciations every single day

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:39.300
at 2 o'clock for 365 days?

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:40.530
Boom.

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:43.030
Free.

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:46.550
So we're looking for ways
to turn toward our partner.

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:47.740
So here's the deal.

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:51.360
Our partners, on a daily
basis, are turning towards us.

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.879
And the key is being able
to recognize when they're

00:26:53.879 --> 00:26:55.920
turning toward because
what turning toward really

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:58.890
is, is it's a small, subtle
way of saying I have a want,

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:02.070
a need, a desire,
are you there for me.

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:04.320
So here's what turning
toward looks like.

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.370
Maybe I'm standing at
the sink doing dishes

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:10.520
and I notice that it's
starting to snow, which it did

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:12.110
in Salt Lake City yesterday.

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:15.440
It's 80 degrees here, Salt
Lake City, it's snowing.

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:19.810
And I say, are you kidding me?

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:21.020
Is that snow?

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:23.420
And my husband's
in the other room.

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:25.200
How is he going to
turn towards me?

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.852
He's going to go, yup.

00:27:27.852 --> 00:27:28.352
That's it.

00:27:28.352 --> 00:27:30.290
That's all you have to do.

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:32.100
Because why am I
talking out loud?

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.440
You're going to say you're
just talking to yourself.

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:36.420
Your partner's not
talking to themselves,

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:38.070
they're talking to you.

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:39.710
They want you to respond.

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:42.210
And you don't have to
make it a grand response.

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:44.720
All you have to do is go uh-huh.

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.970
Just recognizing that
they're speaking to you.

00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:49.370
Bids can be overt and
they can be covert,

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:51.520
so that would be a bit
of a covert bid, right?

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.450
Overt bid would be that you
sit next to your partner

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:56.676
on the couch and
you pull him over

00:27:56.676 --> 00:27:58.300
and you put your arm
around him and you

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:02.900
go-- that right there is a bid.

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:04.359
Now how does the person respond?

00:28:04.359 --> 00:28:06.150
You have three choices
to respond to a bid.

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:09.690
You can turn toward them, which
would be like saying uh-huh.

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:11.130
Or you go, oh yeah?

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:12.670
Let's go upstairs.

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:15.690
Or you can turn away
from your partner,

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:19.310
which would mean missing their
bid or ignoring their bid.

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:20.957
How do we ignore bids?

00:28:20.957 --> 00:28:21.540
I'll tell you.

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:22.840
Digital distraction.

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.480
That's the number
one way right now

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.970
that people are ignoring bids.

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:28.840
Whether you recognize it
or not, if you are face

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:32.280
down on a computer or
a game, or your phone,

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:35.324
you're going to miss
bids from your partner.

00:28:35.324 --> 00:28:38.930
So you can also turn
against your partner.

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:41.090
If my husband's
rushing out the door

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:45.390
and as he's rushing out the
door I say, oh, before you go,

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:46.910
I'm going to go
grocery shopping,

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:49.500
is there anything special that
you'd like for dinner tonight?

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:52.110
That's really sweet
of me to ask, right?

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:53.360
He's going to turn against me.

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:54.860
Here's what he says.

00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:57.900
You know that Monday nights I
go out with the guys after work.

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.280
Why do you always manipulate
me into staying in

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:01.160
on these nights?

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.320
That's turning against.

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:03.820
OK?

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:06.620
So you always have
three options.

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:08.840
The nice part is that
with turning toward,

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:11.450
all you have to do is just
recognize when your partner is

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:13.880
making bids and
remember that you

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:17.550
can turn toward them in very
small ways every single day.

00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:19.900
If you imagine that
your relationship is

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:23.200
a lot like an emotional
bank account, every time you

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:25.810
turn toward your partner,
you're putting a deposit in.

00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:27.720
This is important
because when something

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:30.690
external to the
relationship really causes

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:32.800
some pain, when
something happens,

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:34.800
when you have a fight,
when the car breaks down,

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.480
when one of the kids is being
obnoxious, and the two of you

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.750
are super stressed
out, you have enough

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:42.586
of those emotional deposits in
that bank account to buffer.

00:29:42.586 --> 00:29:44.210
So that when you take
a withdrawal out,

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:45.460
you're not overdrawn.

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:47.000
Does that makes sense?

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:47.500
OK.

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:50.710
So here's the interesting part.

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:54.706
Remember that newlywed study
that was in the apartment lab?

00:29:54.706 --> 00:29:58.240
And that all those newlyweds,
of those 17 newlyweds that

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.020
ended up divorcing, they
went back and they said,

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:03.470
what do we know
about turning toward.

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:04.380
And they counted.

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:09.749
They figured out that 86% of
the time, the couples that

00:30:09.749 --> 00:30:11.290
are still together,
they were turning

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:12.550
toward each other's bids.

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:14.820
But those that
divorced missed them.

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:18.260
They were only turning
toward 33% of the time.

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:21.220
You can see how important it
is to recognize those bids

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:23.440
in your relationship, the
times when your partner is

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.040
trying to reach out to you.

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:27.959
Has a want, a need, a
desire, and how important

00:30:27.959 --> 00:30:29.750
it is that you're
recognizing it and you're

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:33.546
choosing to turn toward rather
than away or against them.

00:30:33.546 --> 00:30:34.920
So before I move
on, does anybody

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:38.190
have questions about maybe
the first three principles?

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:39.730
So we have the
Love Map principle,

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:44.830
we have fondness and admiration,
and we have the turning toward.

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:46.320
Yeah.

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.940
AUDIENCE: So I didn't
get the two positives.

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:50.440
So if somebody
makes a bid, you can

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:52.850
decline no, you can say yes,
and what's the third one?

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:54.550
I didn't get the
difference here.

00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:56.670
LAURA HECK: So the
difference is that you

00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:59.780
can turn toward your
partner, which is basically

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:03.340
any response that's positive
toward your partner's bid.

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:05.210
You can turn away
from them, which looks

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:06.830
a lot like ignoring a bid.

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:08.953
And you can turn against
him, which would mean

00:31:08.953 --> 00:31:11.931
kind of lashing back at them.

00:31:11.931 --> 00:31:14.350
Any other questions?

00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:15.622
Yeah.

00:31:15.622 --> 00:31:18.550
AUDIENCE: So in your
example of your husband

00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:20.200
kind of going
against, what would

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:23.092
be a better response
for him knowing that,

00:31:23.092 --> 00:31:25.550
if he still wants to hang out
with his buddies or whatever.

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:26.930
LAURA HECK: That's
a great question.

00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:28.320
So what would be
a better response?

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:29.920
If my husband was
rushing out the door

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:32.350
and I said, honey, what would
you like for dinner tonight,

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:33.910
I'm going to go to the store.

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:37.480
And rather than being
rude and lashing back,

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:40.550
he could turn around and
he could say, oh, well,

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:43.185
that is so nice of you to offer,
but actually Monday nights

00:31:43.185 --> 00:31:45.060
is the night that I'm
going out with the guys

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:46.560
so I won't be home tonight.

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:49.760
So it doesn't mean that he has
to change or say yes, dear,

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:53.220
or do what I want, but
responding back to me

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:57.340
with, if I could sum it
up, respect and honor.

00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:59.510
By responding back
with respect and honor,

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:02.690
then he could still
turn toward me.

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:03.650
OK.

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:05.920
I'm going to move on
to the next question.

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.984
Anybody else have a question?

00:32:08.984 --> 00:32:09.860
All right.

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:12.120
So principle number four.

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:16.606
This is moving away from
the friendship foundation.

00:32:16.606 --> 00:32:18.230
We've covered the
friendship foundation

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:21.280
and now we're starting to get
into what Dr. Gottman noticed

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:24.970
with couples, which is letting
your partner influence you.

00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:29.040
He noticed that there was
a vast majority of couples

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:31.600
where most of the time
they allow their partner

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:33.170
to influence them.

00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:36.920
I have taken this to heart.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:39.870
When it came time to buy
a vehicle, how many of you

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:42.530
have had like a struggle buying
vehicles in your relationship?

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:45.740
Because one of you wants,
like, the smart car or whatever

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:47.890
it might be, and you
want like the big Yukon,

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:51.130
and you have to find something
in between that fits both.

00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:54.470
So this has been an exercise in
my own relationship of letting

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:56.020
my partner influence me.

00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:59.870
And really what it comes down
to is when your partner says,

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:04.100
I want this, your first
response is OK, yes,

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:05.360
let's make this happen.

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.860
If your partner
says, I have a dream

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:10.590
to go back to school, that
your first thought is whatever

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:13.910
you want, let's make it
happen, and let's find excuses

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:15.680
why it won't work later.

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:17.700
But oftentimes what
happens instead

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.660
is that you become a roadblock.

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:20.616
Whatever it might be.

00:33:20.616 --> 00:33:22.990
Have you ever noticed that
sometimes there's couples that

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:25.573
there might be that one person
that it's like no matter what I

00:33:25.573 --> 00:33:30.165
want, if I want to buy
this orange juice for $3.50

00:33:30.165 --> 00:33:31.560
at the grocery store.

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:33.870
You don't want that,
you want to buy

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:36.362
the orange juice that's $2.99.

00:33:36.362 --> 00:33:40.430
That that extra $0.51 is going
to be an argument right now.

00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:43.600
So letting your
partner influence you,

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:45.000
being able to negotiate.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.330
Being able to say, why is this
so important, tell me more.

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:50.450
Rather than
immediately saying no.

00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:52.899
That's a big deal.

00:33:52.899 --> 00:33:54.690
So you can see there's
a statistic up here.

00:33:54.690 --> 00:34:00.550
81% divorce rate when men are
not willing to share power.

00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:02.030
Eventually what
ended up happening

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:03.730
is that Dr. Gottman
found that when

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:06.240
men were saying no,
when they weren't even

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:09.050
willing to entertain
negotiation with their partner,

00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:12.949
when it was a power
struggle, 81% of those times

00:34:12.949 --> 00:34:14.840
they ended up divorcing.

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:15.889
It's powerful.

00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:18.340
Being able to say why is
this important to you,

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:20.250
let's just have a conversation.

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:22.230
It's not yes, dear.

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:23.670
I have to say that part.

00:34:23.670 --> 00:34:25.500
It's not yes, husband.

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:27.440
It's why is this important.

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.139
If it's important to
you, let's at least

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:32.278
entertain the idea
and let's talk.

00:34:32.278 --> 00:34:33.290
Any questions?

00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:34.530
Yeah.

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:36.780
AUDIENCE: Which year
was the study made?

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:40.382
Because like I read pretty
much the reverse statistics.

00:34:40.382 --> 00:34:41.840
LAURA HECK: The
reverse statistics?

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:42.590
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:44.870
LAURA HECK: So what would
the reverse statistic be?

00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:47.670
AUDIENCE: No, I mean, I read
about the Gen X, for instance.

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:52.770
About the men vs women and the
way in the US in particular.

00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:56.120
Because of the high divorce
rate and the kids staying

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:59.520
with their moms, what
happens is the Gen Xers,

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:04.290
now that they're growing,
the male actually

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:08.351
are insecure and searching all
their life, or the other way

00:35:08.351 --> 00:35:09.100
around, the women.

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:12.265
And I'm not Gen X, I'm Gen
Y. I'm not grown up here,

00:35:12.265 --> 00:35:13.890
my parents aren't
divorced or anything.

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:16.390
So I was wondering
if this is coming

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:18.940
from the '80s, from
the '90s, et cetera.

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:20.260
LAURA HECK: So it is.

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:23.280
Most of Dr. Gottman's
research, especially

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:26.710
with the research
lab, is coming from I

00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:29.430
think the '90s, actually.

00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:31.750
But I would be interested
to know what it is.

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:34.380
Are you saying that
the inverse of it

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:36.547
is that women are
unwilling to yield power?

00:35:36.547 --> 00:35:37.880
AUDIENCE: No, nothing like that.

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:44.700
What I'm saying is that this
strong kind of macho culture

00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:46.717
has gone away for the years.

00:35:46.717 --> 00:35:49.050
LAURA HECK: OK, now I know
where you're going with that.

00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:50.310
Yeah.

00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:52.310
So yes, to answer your
question, the research

00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:54.000
does go back quite
a bit because he

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.690
did the majority of his
research over the last 40 years.

00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:59.430
So a lot of it is
not going to cite

00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:02.580
things that are happening
now and moving forward.

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:04.030
Yeah.

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:09.254
Any other questions about
yielding power, saying yes?

00:36:09.254 --> 00:36:11.090
OK.

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:14.610
So of the complaints that
come in, so I had mentioned

00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:16.400
I'm a couples therapist.

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:17.380
The number one thing.

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:21.440
Couples come in, they say we're
having trouble communicating,

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.300
we have conflict all the time.

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:26.130
Dr. Gottman really
wanted to figure out

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:28.870
what is it that the masters are
doing to solve their conflict.

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:30.930
So what I will start
talking about now

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:35.050
is what is it that they're
doing when it comes to conflict.

00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:37.900
You can have two
types of conflict.

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:41.110
It's either solvable
or it's perpetual.

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:44.010
Fundamental difference
between solvable problems

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:46.690
and perpetual problems.

00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:48.160
What percentage,
I'm just curious,

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.287
what percentage do you
think of happy couples

00:36:50.287 --> 00:36:52.620
do you think they would be
able to solve their problems?

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:55.920
Happy, masters of relationships.

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:58.910
What percentage are able
to solve their problems?

00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:01.160
Or what percentage of problems
are they able to solve?

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:03.060
That's probably a
better way to put it.

00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:05.610
What do you think?

00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:07.825
50%?

00:37:07.825 --> 00:37:08.325
80%?

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:11.640
Anybody else?

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:12.910
What's that?

00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:13.410
30%?

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:14.490
That's low.

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:16.720
Bar is low for you, huh?

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:21.060
OK, so truth be told,
Dr. Gottman found

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:24.350
that of all conflict with
couples that were thriving,

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:26.770
that were happy, they
were only able to solve

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:29.630
31% of those problems.

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:31.980
Yeah, so is that
encouraging for you?

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:33.984
Or is that discouraging?

00:37:33.984 --> 00:37:36.400
Like, that you're going to
have 69% of these problems that

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.870
are just going to stick around
for the rest of your life.

00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:40.900
There was one researcher,
and I like this,

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:42.790
that he said when you
stand up on that altar,

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:45.440
really what you're doing
is you are agreeing

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:48.140
to the 50 years of problems
that the two of you

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:48.890
are going to have.

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:53.490
For the next 50 years, we are
signing up for this conflict.

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:55.460
What Dr. Gottman found
is that he was doing

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:56.650
these longitudinal studies.

00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:58.240
He would have these
couples come in,

00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:00.600
he'd hook them up to their
little jiggle-ometers,

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:03.520
and he would say,
nice to see you again.

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:05.660
Your clothes have changed,
your hair has changed,

00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:07.740
it's nice to see you
after four years.

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:09.600
I want you guys to
just choose a conflict

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:10.850
and just kind of sort it out.

00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:13.280
Something that the two
of you can't agree on.

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:15.340
What happened?

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:18.360
He said that he could put the
tape of them rolling four years

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.120
prior to the tape of them now.

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:21.900
A few more gray
hairs, their clothes

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:24.420
are a little more in style,
maybe a few more pounds.

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:26.160
Same conflict.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.550
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:29.890
Same conflict.

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:33.010
So that means that these
couples, 69% of them,

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:34.510
they're perpetual problems.

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:36.210
Why are they perpetual?

00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:39.650
It's because we are unique,
wonderful human beings

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:45.680
and what makes me up, my value
system, my likes, my dislikes,

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:47.720
is different from my
partner's value system,

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:48.960
likes, and dislikes.

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:51.580
It's the fundamental things
that make me who I am.

00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:55.920
So if I'm an introvert,
which I am, believe me,

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:59.480
and my husband is an extrovert,
when Friday night comes around,

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:01.980
what do I want to do?

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:04.830
I want to watch Netflix,
I want to eat ice cream,

00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:07.630
I want to sit on the couch
and I just want to veg.

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:09.020
What does my husband want to do?

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:11.540
He wants to go out
every Friday night.

00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:12.550
Is this a conflict?

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:13.910
Absolutely.

00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:16.280
So other differences.

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:17.030
Am I neat?

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:18.080
Yes, I'm neat.

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:20.010
Is my husband not so neat?

00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:21.040
Absolutely.

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:23.610
These are things
about the two of us

00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:25.080
that are a little different.

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:27.880
And so these are the
perpetual problems.

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.520
The problem is
that when you don't

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.980
know the difference between
perpetual and solvable,

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:34.280
is that you end up
getting gridlocked

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:36.680
and you think there has
to be a way to solve this.

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:38.820
But unfortunately,
it's not about solving

00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:40.080
your perpetual problems.

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.890
It's about learning
how to communicate

00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:45.020
through those perpetual problems
in a different way that's

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:47.800
still honoring and
respecting your partner.

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:50.470
So how are the masters
talking through

00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:55.140
those solvable problems, the
31% of those solvable problems?

00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:56.910
What are the solvable problems?

00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:59.690
These are things like, how are
we going to use our tax refund?

00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:03.031
We're obviously going
to buy a hot tub, guys.

00:40:03.031 --> 00:40:05.140
Or whose house
are we going to go

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:08.970
to for Memorial Day, my
mom's house, your house?

00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:09.970
What are we going to do?

00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:11.219
How are we going to celebrate?

00:40:11.219 --> 00:40:12.430
These are solvable problems.

00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:17.226
They often tend to be
short-term in nature.

00:40:17.226 --> 00:40:20.370
So a solvable problem would
probably be something similar

00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:27.280
like if we can't figure out
what to do for childcare,

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:30.430
it goes away after
18 years, right?

00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:33.250
Eventually you don't have
that as a problem any longer.

00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:41.270
And then they bring
their munchkin,

00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:43.700
and then you're the
childcare for their munchkin.

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:47.550
So the masters are doing
some really amazing things.

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:49.290
When they have a
conflict conversation,

00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:52.490
if you can take these skills
home, this would be fantastic.

00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:55.060
Number one, the skill
that the masters are doing

00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:57.590
is that they're bringing up
a complaint, which is OK.

00:40:57.590 --> 00:40:59.600
To criticize is not OK.

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:01.830
They're bringing it up
in a really gentle way.

00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:04.770
They're incredibly skillful.

00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:08.150
Think of it as, like, putting
on the art of manipulation.

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:10.640
How can I bring
this complaint up

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.980
in a way in which my
partner is going to hear me

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:16.560
and is going to be willing
to work with me on this?

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:19.050
And if it's a sure
fire way to blow it,

00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:22.330
you can bring it up by saying,
you always or you never.

00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:23.100
Right?

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:26.470
How many times does you always
and you never end right?

00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:29.260
How many times do you actually
get your partner to say,

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:31.140
you know what, you're
absolutely right.

00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:32.980
I am always a slob.

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:35.894
I am always doing this.

00:41:35.894 --> 00:41:37.810
So if you want to blow
it, start it like that.

00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:39.790
But if you don't, you
bring your complaint

00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:42.070
up by using I
statements and you're

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:44.760
describing what's going on
in a non-judgmental way.

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:48.310
You know, honey, I notice that
there's clothes next to the bed

00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:49.080
again.

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:53.140
And I would really
appreciate it if you

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:57.390
could undress next to the hamper
rather than undressing next

00:41:57.390 --> 00:41:58.410
to the bed.

00:41:58.410 --> 00:42:00.654
Do you think maybe
you could do that?

00:42:00.654 --> 00:42:02.070
It's pretty gentle,
you think he'd

00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:05.300
be willing to give it a
shot at least that night?

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:06.520
Yeah?

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:10.870
Poor guy, he gets thrown
under the bus so much.

00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:14.090
What is something else
that the masters are doing?

00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:15.960
So here's an
interesting statistic.

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:18.730
Dr. Gottman can tell
how a conversation is

00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:20.580
going to end by how it starts.

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:22.410
So he watches the
first three minutes

00:42:22.410 --> 00:42:23.740
of a conflict conversation.

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:25.900
He says, oh yeah, I know
how that's going to end.

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:26.680
You know how?

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:29.830
96% of the time,
if it starts off

00:42:29.830 --> 00:42:32.360
gentle and kind, it will
end gentle and kind.

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:36.510
If you want to get what you
want, ask for it in a nice way.

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:38.980
I mean, that's kind of
a no brainer, right?

00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:42.230
But that's not
always what happens.

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:46.160
Here's another thing
about the first skill.

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:47.660
Who do you think
is most often going

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:49.640
to bring up conflict in
a relationship, the man

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:52.066
or the woman?

00:42:52.066 --> 00:42:53.290
It's the woman, yeah.

00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:55.606
You were like.

00:42:55.606 --> 00:42:57.240
Yes, it is the woman.

00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:59.930
Most of the time, the
female is going to complain.

00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:04.750
And that's absolutely true.

00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:08.170
Skill number two, people
who are starting a conflict

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:11.460
conversation, they are
making repairs all the time.

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:14.420
So you may start off with
a you always or you never,

00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:16.920
but that doesn't mean that
you have to be doomed.

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:20.190
You can make repair and you can
turn that conversation around.

00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:22.720
So if you imagine
being a truck driver,

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:24.220
have you ever seen
those ramps where

00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:25.900
the trucks when they
lose their brakes,

00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:27.570
they have to go up the ramp?

00:43:27.570 --> 00:43:29.670
That's sort of what
a repair attempt is.

00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:33.260
It's using that ramp to stop
the trajectory, and the speed,

00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:35.595
and the momentum of
the conversation.

00:43:35.595 --> 00:43:37.720
So you're using a repair
attempt and you're saying,

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:41.540
you know what, I really think
we're going off track here.

00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:43.380
I think I need to start over.

00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:45.350
Or you know what,
I'm really sorry, I

00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:48.520
used a blaming statement there,
I'd like to turn this around.

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:53.230
So there is an entire
sheet of repair attempts.

00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:55.330
And it feels a little
weird at first.

00:43:55.330 --> 00:43:56.830
And when I say
entire sheet, there's

00:43:56.830 --> 00:43:59.700
an entire page of
repair attempts in here

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:03.640
that you can use when you start
to notice that the conversation

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:04.910
is getting derailed.

00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:08.130
What makes the repair
attempts so powerful

00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:10.990
is whether or not you have
that foundation of friendship.

00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:13.690
So you can use a repair
attempt, but your partner

00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:16.280
won't hear that unless you
have a strong foundation

00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:19.090
of a friendship, which
is why Dr. Gottman said

00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:21.220
it's so important.

00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:22.760
So if you're using
a repair attempt,

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:26.628
I use this as an example.

00:44:26.628 --> 00:44:30.767
Two of my friends are driving
in a car, I'm in the backseat.

00:44:30.767 --> 00:44:33.100
They bicker back and forth,
they're going, going, going.

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:35.350
I'm not paying any attention,
I'm probably on Facebook

00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:36.220
on my phone.

00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:39.160
And all of a sudden,
the car gets silent.

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:43.000
And I look up and I notice that
the driver is staring straight

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.920
ahead, passenger is
staring out the window.

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:51.210
And me as a couples therapist,
I'm like, ooh, this is juicy.

00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:53.280
What's going to happen?

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:56.770
So about 30 seconds go by and
the tension is really high.

00:44:56.770 --> 00:44:59.350
And then all a sudden,
passenger turns around

00:44:59.350 --> 00:45:03.850
and licks the driver from
his jaw up to his ear.

00:45:03.850 --> 00:45:06.350
It's disgusting, right?

00:45:06.350 --> 00:45:08.130
But do you know what that was?

00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:09.810
It was a repair attempt.

00:45:09.810 --> 00:45:10.650
Believe it or not.

00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:13.280
So a repair attempt
is anything that you

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:15.400
do to take something
that's getting

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:20.230
derailed, a conversation, an
interaction, and change it.

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:23.190
Did he accept the
repair attempt?

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:24.040
Absolutely.

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:24.840
How could you not?

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:27.310
How could you ignore
a lick on the face?

00:45:27.310 --> 00:45:30.320
Anyway, I digress.

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:34.650
You can make repair attempts,
but what makes it most potent

00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:37.090
is whether or not you have
that friendship foundation

00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:41.125
and whether or not your
partner accepts your repair.

00:45:41.125 --> 00:45:43.680
OK, so we talked about flooding
a little bit when we were

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:45.000
talking about stonewalling.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.416
What ends up
happening when you're

00:45:46.416 --> 00:45:48.170
getting emotionally flooded?

00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:52.520
So being emotionally flooded
can feel a lot of different ways

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:53.900
for different people.

00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:55.554
You can get a tightness
in your chest.

00:45:55.554 --> 00:45:57.220
So imagine that you're
having a conflict

00:45:57.220 --> 00:46:01.160
conversation with your partner
and it's really, really

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:01.780
going bad.

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:04.890
In your head, you're thinking,
oh no, not this again.

00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:07.920
And maybe your
partner just thinks

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:11.680
if I just raise my voice, he'll
hear me eventually, right?

00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:14.390
Or maybe I should just
throw a few things

00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:15.530
to get his attention.

00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:19.020
So you might start to feel
physiologically aroused.

00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:22.860
So your heart starts beating,
your face might feel flushed,

00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:25.085
you might start sweating a lot.

00:46:25.085 --> 00:46:27.740
Or maybe you start
to get tunnel vision.

00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:30.440
Have you ever had road rage
so bad where you literally

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:33.176
didn't, I mean, it's Seattle,
so I'm sure all of us

00:46:33.176 --> 00:46:34.550
have had road rage
at some point.

00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:38.920
But where you almost feel
as if, like, you lose vision

00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:43.090
or you can't hear any longer or
your heart is just pounding out

00:46:43.090 --> 00:46:44.070
of your chest?

00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:46.170
That's what it feels
like to be flooded.

00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:49.350
But the masters are
recognizing before they

00:46:49.350 --> 00:46:53.510
get flooded that they need
to do some psychological and

00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:55.850
physiological self-soothing,
which means that they're

00:46:55.850 --> 00:46:58.243
stopping the conversation.

00:46:58.243 --> 00:47:00.275
Now this feels a little
weird for some people.

00:47:00.275 --> 00:47:01.650
Well, if we stop
the conversation

00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:03.240
we'll never get back to it.

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.660
The rule of thumb is if
we stop the conversation,

00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:08.170
we're coming back
to it in 20 minutes.

00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:10.980
So one of you indicates I'm
feeling, I'm feeling flooded,

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:12.380
we need to take a break.

00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:14.225
And they go their separate ways.

00:47:14.225 --> 00:47:16.630
In order to take a break
where your body is going

00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:19.960
to be able to self-soothe
and relax and come back down,

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:21.650
you have to leave
your partner's sight.

00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:24.640
So it's not the two of you
sitting in silence staring

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:25.990
at each other.

00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:29.790
You have to change the course
of where your mind is going.

00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:32.180
So you have to think about
something that's pleasing.

00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:36.166
This is not an opportunity
to formulate your rebuttal.

00:47:36.166 --> 00:47:37.540
So you're going
to start thinking

00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:42.160
about ponies and rainbows and
all those wonderful things.

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:43.920
So I'm just curious,
for you guys,

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:46.170
what do you do to calm down?

00:47:46.170 --> 00:47:48.320
What do you do to soothe?

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:51.632
You go for a walk?

00:47:51.632 --> 00:47:52.531
Walk the dog?

00:47:52.531 --> 00:47:53.031
Facebook?

00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:57.400
I know, I do it too.

00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:01.530
Clean, take a shower, work out.

00:48:01.530 --> 00:48:02.920
What's that?

00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:03.420
Cook?

00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:05.250
Awesome, come to my house.

00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:07.570
We'll all cook together.

00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:08.070
Yeah.

00:48:08.070 --> 00:48:09.670
So you're going to
do something that

00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:11.870
is soothing for 20
minutes, and then you're

00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:13.890
going to come back
to the conversation.

00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:16.270
And by that point, here's
the interesting part.

00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:17.860
Why is it that we're
taking a break?

00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:21.640
What is it about flooding
that you have to take a break?

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:24.250
It's because you're no longer
using your prefrontal cortex.

00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:26.570
You literally flip your lid.

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:29.810
Your body says I'm
in fight or flight,

00:48:29.810 --> 00:48:32.110
I can't use my
prefrontal cortex,

00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:33.980
I need to use my
reptilian brain now

00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:36.280
because this is
going to save me.

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:38.320
So now you're using
the back of your brain

00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:40.490
and you're not able to
have a conversation that

00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:42.310
is logical with your partner.

00:48:42.310 --> 00:48:43.890
What ends up happening
and why people

00:48:43.890 --> 00:48:46.420
get hurt so badly in
conversations where

00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:48.420
they are flooded
is that they keep

00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:51.260
trying to have the conversation,
but they're no longer

00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:52.585
using logic or reason.

00:48:52.585 --> 00:48:54.800
Has anybody seen
that YouTube clip,

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:58.140
it's these two one-year-old
babies, they're twin boys.

00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:00.390
They're in the kitchen,
they're both in diapers,

00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:03.680
and they're talking to
each other in baby babble.

00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:07.400
And one's going blah, blah, blah
and then the other one, blah,

00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:08.970
blah, blah, blah.

00:49:08.970 --> 00:49:12.150
That's what it looks like when
two adults are physiologically

00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:15.080
flooded, is there's
nothing going on up here.

00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:18.500
It's just babble at that point.

00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:24.290
So any questions about
self-soothing or flooding?

00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:26.630
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:32.570 --> 00:49:33.570
LAURA HECK: Yeah.

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:34.445
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:39.190
LAURA HECK: So what do
you do when you come back

00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:41.230
from your break and
your partner doesn't

00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:43.210
want to discuss it anymore?

00:49:43.210 --> 00:49:45.200
It has to be an agreement.

00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:47.085
There has to be an
agreement that if you're

00:49:47.085 --> 00:49:49.460
going to have this conversation
and one of you is feeling

00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:51.150
flooded and needs
to take a break,

00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:53.710
that it has to be an
agreement to come back to it.

00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:56.230
Because if it's a conflict,
if it's important to you

00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:59.255
to solve the problem, it's
important to both of you.

00:49:59.255 --> 00:50:00.870
So it needs to be
a conversation.

00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:03.650
But sometimes your partner
may say, I'm still flooded

00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:05.236
or I'm really hurt.

00:50:05.236 --> 00:50:06.610
And at that point,
maybe you need

00:50:06.610 --> 00:50:09.680
to do some repairing in order
to get back to the point

00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:12.770
where you want to have
that conversation again.

00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:14.730
I think one of the
common misconceptions

00:50:14.730 --> 00:50:17.230
is the idea don't
go to bed angry.

00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:19.110
This is actually really harmful.

00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:21.250
Because if you are so
worked up and you're

00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:23.880
trying to solve the problem
and you're no longer using

00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:26.500
your prefrontal cortex, now
you're in your reptilian brain,

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:28.625
but all you want to have
to do is solve the problem

00:50:28.625 --> 00:50:30.180
because we have
to go to bed, you

00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:32.029
end up exhausted the next day.

00:50:32.029 --> 00:50:33.320
You haven't solved the problem.

00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:35.310
And now you don't like
your partner anymore.

00:50:35.310 --> 00:50:36.390
So go to bed.

00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:37.790
Take a nap.

00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:40.740
Do what you need to do so
that you come back to it.

00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:44.490
Not all arguments or conflicts
will be solved in the moment.

00:50:44.490 --> 00:50:47.420
It might take a couple of days
to work through a conflict.

00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:49.830
But being able to respect
when your partner is flooded

00:50:49.830 --> 00:50:54.880
is number one, and recognize
that they need to self-soothe.

00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:57.280
OK.

00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:00.020
So what do you do if you
do have a solvable problem?

00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:02.300
31% of those solvable problems.

00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:05.380
How do you actually go
through to solve them?

00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:07.060
This is something
that we recommend

00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:09.840
is that you draw these
circles on a piece of paper

00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:13.880
and the circle in the inside
is your inflexible area.

00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:16.650
So let's just pick
a solvable problem.

00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:17.880
What are we going to solve?

00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:20.590
Car?

00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:23.380
So my husband wants
to get, what's that?

00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:25.062
What movie to see?

00:51:25.062 --> 00:51:26.770
I need something that's
a little juicier.

00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:32.500
I'm going to go with car
just because it sort of has

00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:34.460
some value systems around money.

00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:39.950
So let's say that my husband
wants to get the new Tesla that

00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:42.570
just came out.

00:51:42.570 --> 00:51:48.670
And I want to buy the
used minivan for $5,000.

00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:51.360
You're giggling,
but that happened.

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:58.440
So what's happening is the
two of us need a new vehicle

00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:00.410
and he wants to get the Tesla.

00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:02.050
I don't even know
how much Teslas run,

00:52:02.050 --> 00:52:04.100
but they're expensive, right?

00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:05.510
So he wants to
get the new Tesla,

00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:07.100
I want to get the minivan.

00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:09.664
It's all sort of
grounded in money.

00:52:09.664 --> 00:52:10.830
I kind of have money issues.

00:52:10.830 --> 00:52:12.770
I'm the saver, he's the spender.

00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:14.550
That's a perpetual
problem that comes up

00:52:14.550 --> 00:52:16.380
a lot in relationships.

00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:19.370
But we need to actually solve
it because we need a vehicle.

00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:21.850
So my areas of
inflexibility are going

00:52:21.850 --> 00:52:26.080
to be the areas that if I was
to compromise on these issues,

00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:27.800
it would feel as
if I was breaking

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:30.960
the bones of my own body because
it was so tied of my values

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:33.160
system, so tied to
my worldview, so tied

00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:37.020
to who I am as a human being
that if I was to compromise,

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:41.210
I would have the same argument
with him two months from now.

00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:42.960
So I'm going to write
in the center circle

00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:47.140
that I think it is incredibly
important that we only

00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:48.740
pay cash for cars.

00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:50.980
That's just a value system.

00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:52.490
Dave Ramsey taught me that.

00:52:52.490 --> 00:52:57.840
So he's going to put
in his inner circle

00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:03.660
that his core need, his
core desire is tied to,

00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:06.505
what would be my husband's
core need for this,

00:53:06.505 --> 00:53:11.300
I was going to say to look
cool, but maybe his core need

00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:14.900
is that he's worked really,
really hard to become a VP

00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:17.360
and now that he's there,
he needs a car that

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:19.780
also represents that he's a VP.

00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:24.080
So maybe that's his core need,
is like this feeling of status

00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:28.070
or this feeling of
needing to reward himself

00:53:28.070 --> 00:53:29.420
for his hard work.

00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:33.180
So now that we have our core
areas of inflexibility, now

00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:35.760
we're going to talk about what
the areas of flexibility are.

00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:39.780
So my area of flexibility
is I'm flexible on the color

00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:44.180
of the car, I'm flexible
on whether or not

00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:46.475
it's four wheel drive, I'm
flexible whether or not

00:53:46.475 --> 00:53:48.100
we don't get a minivan,
it doesn't have

00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:49.980
to do with the sliding door.

00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:53.260
But maybe my area
of inflexibility

00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:55.840
might be that I don't want to
spend any more than $30,000

00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:57.170
on a car.

00:53:57.170 --> 00:54:01.450
So then he's like, oh
boy, that Tesla's not

00:54:01.450 --> 00:54:04.240
happening any time soon.

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:06.600
So this is how you
find common ground.

00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:09.780
The most important piece
about this exercise

00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:12.760
is that the two of
you are putting down

00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:15.110
the pieces that are
most important to you

00:54:15.110 --> 00:54:17.080
and those are sort
of like, we're

00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:18.780
not willing to yield on these.

00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:20.940
Being willing to
yield is important,

00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:25.330
but the inner circle,
it's small for a reason.

00:54:25.330 --> 00:54:27.940
You don't want to have too
many areas of inflexibility.

00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:30.280
The goal is wanting to
compromise with your partner.

00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:33.200
But if you indicate
what areas it is

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:34.820
that if you were
to yield on it, it

00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:37.170
would feel as if you're
breaking your own bones,

00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:40.480
why would you want to compromise
your partner's values in order

00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:44.050
to get what you want?

00:54:44.050 --> 00:54:45.595
Any steps about this area?

00:54:48.306 --> 00:54:52.090
OK, so now we're
at principle six.

00:54:52.090 --> 00:54:56.310
We've gone through some of
the friendship foundation.

00:54:56.310 --> 00:55:01.070
We've talked a little bit
about yielding to your partner.

00:55:01.070 --> 00:55:03.180
Now we're overcoming gridlock.

00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:05.330
So there's perpetual
problems in the relationship

00:55:05.330 --> 00:55:08.350
and there are solvable
problems in the relationship.

00:55:08.350 --> 00:55:10.700
But sometimes you get
really gridlocked.

00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:13.420
You know that you're feeling
gridlocked on an issue

00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:16.360
because every time it
comes up, all of a sudden,

00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:18.550
you feel like oh,
not this again.

00:55:18.550 --> 00:55:21.710
Or you go from 0
to 60 within, like,

00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:23.840
two seconds of talking
about that topic.

00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:27.020
Or you feel even more
polarized, like you started off

00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:29.920
pretty close, you were
almost willing to negotiate,

00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:31.610
but now that you're
gridlocked, you guys

00:55:31.610 --> 00:55:34.000
are on total opposite ends.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.500
You lose your sense
of humor, you're

00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:38.460
no longer willing to
negotiate with your partner.

00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:40.100
What do you do?

00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:43.050
The masters figured
out that in order

00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:45.590
to overcome gridlock
in relationships,

00:55:45.590 --> 00:55:49.660
you have to suspend the
desire to solve that problem

00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:52.170
and see from your
partner's perspective.

00:55:52.170 --> 00:55:54.210
We call this empathy.

00:55:54.210 --> 00:55:56.400
So one of the things
that couples can do

00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:59.210
is that you can sit on
opposite sides of the couch

00:55:59.210 --> 00:56:01.110
and you can say, I
understand that we're

00:56:01.110 --> 00:56:03.970
pretty gridlocked on
this issue, and I'm

00:56:03.970 --> 00:56:05.850
willing to hear
your perspective.

00:56:05.850 --> 00:56:07.710
In every argument
and disagreement

00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:08.990
there are two perspectives.

00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:12.600
Both of them are correct,
both of them are right.

00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:15.670
You feel so strongly
about this side

00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:18.120
and he feels so
strongly about this side

00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:21.780
that you have to be willing
to understand what is it,

00:56:21.780 --> 00:56:25.670
why are you so, why are
you so focused on this?

00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:27.090
Why is this so important?

00:56:27.090 --> 00:56:29.030
And if you're willing
to hear your partner

00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:32.330
and they're willing to
hear you, suddenly you

00:56:32.330 --> 00:56:35.950
have much more respect for where
your partner's perspective is

00:56:35.950 --> 00:56:38.470
coming from.

00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:40.980
So what we ask for couples
to do is they take turns.

00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:42.830
One couple will
start off, and you'll

00:56:42.830 --> 00:56:45.720
ask questions like, tell me why
this is so important to you.

00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:50.280
Tell me why you are so
focused on this one thing.

00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:51.800
I'm really curious.

00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:54.650
You're suspending judgment,
you're suspending the desire

00:56:54.650 --> 00:56:57.870
to solve the problem, and all
you're doing is listening.

00:56:57.870 --> 00:57:00.450
It's incredible
when you see people

00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:04.460
who are fighting, if you
give them the opportunity

00:57:04.460 --> 00:57:08.710
to just state their perspective
in full without someone

00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:13.150
interjecting or poking
holes in them, how amazing

00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:15.810
that starts to
de-escalate everything.

00:57:15.810 --> 00:57:17.770
So one partner takes turns.

00:57:17.770 --> 00:57:19.040
Maybe it's 10 minutes.

00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:20.670
And all you do is just listen.

00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:21.920
Tell me your perspective.

00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:25.120
From your perspective,
why is this important?

00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:28.210
And when they're done, you
state back and you say,

00:57:28.210 --> 00:57:30.940
so this is what I think
is your perspective,

00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:33.530
this is what I hear you
saying, and then you swap.

00:57:33.530 --> 00:57:36.590
And the other person gets
to share their perspective.

00:57:36.590 --> 00:57:39.400
Did you solve the problem?

00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:40.100
Not at all.

00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:42.124
All you did was
had the opportunity

00:57:42.124 --> 00:57:43.790
to share why it was
so important to you.

00:57:47.485 --> 00:57:50.390
This is the last
and final principle,

00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:53.430
and then you all can
leave me for the day.

00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:56.720
So once you have
learned to master

00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:58.420
a friendship in
your relationship

00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:01.720
and you have learned to
master how to solve conflict

00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:05.080
in a healthy way,
the final way is

00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:07.430
to create meaning in
your relationship.

00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:12.430
So couples come in and they
say, is this all that there is.

00:58:12.430 --> 00:58:14.610
We just procreate,
we have babies,

00:58:14.610 --> 00:58:18.810
we see family and
friends on the weekends.

00:58:18.810 --> 00:58:20.680
And is this really all there is?

00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:21.930
I go to work, I come home.

00:58:21.930 --> 00:58:23.430
Like, it feels like
we're roommates.

00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:27.080
There's nothing really
substantial to our relationship

00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:28.300
that's creating meaning.

00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:32.290
And Dr. Gottman found that
for healthy, happy, thriving

00:58:32.290 --> 00:58:33.710
couples, they're
creating meaning

00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:35.260
in a lot of different ways.

00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:39.110
They're moving
from I or me to we.

00:58:39.110 --> 00:58:41.920
And the way that you create
we in your relationship

00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:44.050
is to look at
these four pillars.

00:58:44.050 --> 00:58:45.820
Number one is rituals.

00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:48.350
You can create rituals
in your relationship that

00:58:48.350 --> 00:58:51.250
create beautiful meaning,
but more importantly, it

00:58:51.250 --> 00:58:52.720
creates an
opportunity to connect

00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:55.300
on a really reliable
time and space.

00:58:55.300 --> 00:58:58.600
So a ritual in our
household is in the morning,

00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:01.610
when my baby wakes, up
husband hears the baby

00:59:01.610 --> 00:59:04.570
and me waking up, and he
brings me up a cup of coffee.

00:59:04.570 --> 00:59:07.450
And we play in the big
family bed for 10 minutes.

00:59:07.450 --> 00:59:08.290
It's wonderful.

00:59:08.290 --> 00:59:10.960
I look forward to it,
he looks forward to it.

00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:13.970
I feel cared for and we
have connected first thing

00:59:13.970 --> 00:59:15.390
in the morning.

00:59:15.390 --> 00:59:18.640
Another ritual that I
really like is one partner,

00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:23.140
I had a couple come to me and
they started every evening,

00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:26.710
once the kids went to bed,
he would put the tea kettle

00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:27.610
on the stove.

00:59:27.610 --> 00:59:30.130
And by the time it was
done and whistling,

00:59:30.130 --> 00:59:32.260
the wife would come
in and they would

00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:34.370
sit on opposite
sides of the couch

00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:36.630
and they would sip on
their tea, and they

00:59:36.630 --> 00:59:39.870
would massage each other's feet
and catch up about the day.

00:59:39.870 --> 00:59:40.370
Right?

00:59:40.370 --> 00:59:42.180
How many of you would like that?

00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:44.720
So that's a ritual that
they are looking forward to.

00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:47.860
It's something that's unique and
special to their relationship.

00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:50.750
But it's also something
that they have as a time

00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:53.463
that they can connect
every single day.

00:59:53.463 --> 00:59:54.230
Roles.

00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:56.900
How do you make roles
unique and special

00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:59.350
in the family within
this relationship?

00:59:59.350 --> 01:00:01.540
You can ask one another,
what do you want

01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:03.700
your role as husband to be?

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:05.790
Like, what did you
envision as a husband?

01:00:05.790 --> 01:00:09.430
Did you envision being
the emotional person

01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:11.210
in the relationship
or did you envision

01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:13.060
providing for the family?

01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:16.980
And if that's what you envision,
how can we make this happen?

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:21.420
Or a role in the family might
be that you're the caretaker.

01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:23.590
So every time somebody
gets sick, and this is true

01:00:23.590 --> 01:00:24.420
in my family.

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:27.050
I'm not the
caretaker, by the way.

01:00:27.050 --> 01:00:30.630
But I have a step-mom
and she's incredible.

01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:32.600
She is the caretaker
for the entire block.

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:35.430
That was something that is
unique and special for her.

01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:38.210
And everybody embraces that.

01:00:38.210 --> 01:00:39.800
So she takes care of everybody.

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:42.400
When somebody gets
sick, they are pampered.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:45.650
They have the special blankie,
they have the Neti pot,

01:00:45.650 --> 01:00:47.400
they have, like, feet warmers.

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:48.960
I mean, she goes
above and beyond.

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:52.120
But that's a role that is really
special to her that has created

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:54.970
meaning in their relationship.

01:00:54.970 --> 01:00:57.460
Common goals.

01:00:57.460 --> 01:01:00.276
You know where John and
Julie Gottman are right now?

01:01:00.276 --> 01:01:03.070
They're hiking, they're
actually backpacking.

01:01:03.070 --> 01:01:07.790
For those of you that don't
know, John is in his 70s now

01:01:07.790 --> 01:01:10.020
and Julie loves to hike.

01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:11.560
And that's something
that she does.

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:14.070
And John likes to say that
he's not willing to go anywhere

01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:17.130
unless there's room service.

01:01:17.130 --> 01:01:19.890
But John's hiking, which
is pretty incredible.

01:01:19.890 --> 01:01:22.260
So they have this common goal.

01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:26.980
And he's joining Julie on this
goal that she has of hiking.

01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:30.710
Even more is that when John
and Julie met each other,

01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:33.040
Julie had this
goal, I want to help

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:34.790
as many couples as possible.

01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:37.600
John had the research,
Julie had the know how.

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:40.250
They came together and
they created a special goal

01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:41.920
and meaning around
their relationship

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:43.670
that they are going
to touch as many lives

01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:47.022
possible, and look at them now.

01:01:47.022 --> 01:01:49.090
So the final pillar
is symbols, and this

01:01:49.090 --> 01:01:51.940
would be things that have shared
meaning in your relationship.

01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:55.750
It might be a cross, it
might be a family portrait,

01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:57.880
but it's a tangible
item that has

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:01.120
meaning of the we
within the relationship.

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:03.650
So Dr. Gottman says
that this is really

01:02:03.650 --> 01:02:06.040
like the top of the house,
that once you have built

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:09.290
this foundation and the
pillars of this relationship,

01:02:09.290 --> 01:02:10.960
creating shared
meaning is really

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:12.140
like the top of the house.

01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:14.320
And thus, there are
the seven principles

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:16.700
for making your marriage work.

01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:18.970
So I will entertain,
I recognize that we're

01:02:18.970 --> 01:02:21.740
four minutes over 1 o'clock.

01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:24.290
I have about 10 minutes
that I can answer questions

01:02:24.290 --> 01:02:27.770
if you have any questions
about the seven principles.

01:02:27.770 --> 01:02:29.735
And I'll stick around.

01:02:29.735 --> 01:02:31.880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] Googlers.

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:33.210
How can we help?

01:02:33.210 --> 01:02:36.910
I mean, what can a company like
Google with our technologies,

01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:40.361
with our power do
to help people?

01:02:40.361 --> 01:02:42.170
LAURA HECK: What can
you do at Google?

01:02:42.170 --> 01:02:48.221
How can your skill set
help touch people's lives?

01:02:48.221 --> 01:02:50.570
Well, you have a
very broad audience.

01:02:50.570 --> 01:02:54.130
And you have people who have
done incredible research

01:02:54.130 --> 01:02:56.190
and are really just
looking for that research

01:02:56.190 --> 01:02:58.730
to be sort of distilled
down, so as much as we

01:02:58.730 --> 01:03:00.350
can get that information out.

01:03:00.350 --> 01:03:02.970
So what we're finding is
that John and Julie Gottman,

01:03:02.970 --> 01:03:04.390
they hold these
couples workshops.

01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:06.490
And people fly in from
all around the world.

01:03:06.490 --> 01:03:09.270
And they have 250 couples
attend these workshops.

01:03:09.270 --> 01:03:11.240
And they're training
as many therapists

01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:14.070
as they can to get
this information out.

01:03:14.070 --> 01:03:16.600
But what's really going
to broaden the audience

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:19.180
is being able to use
technology to get it out there.

01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:21.420
Getting videos to
people, getting talks

01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:23.530
like this to the masses.

01:03:23.530 --> 01:03:24.600
That's what I would say.

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.390
AUDIENCE: So YouTube.

01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:29.455
LAURA HECK: Yeah, you bet.

01:03:29.455 --> 01:03:32.540
AUDIENCE: So perhaps except
for the licking part,

01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:35.590
are there any of those tips
or principles or guidelines

01:03:35.590 --> 01:03:38.434
not applicable to
workplace relationships?

01:03:38.434 --> 01:03:40.350
LAURA HECK: OK, so are
any of these principles

01:03:40.350 --> 01:03:42.810
not applicable to
workplace relationships?

01:03:49.415 --> 01:03:52.300
No, not a single one.

01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:53.890
They are all
directly applicable.

01:03:53.890 --> 01:03:56.050
Here's what I'll say about
workplace relationships,

01:03:56.050 --> 01:04:00.360
and I will say this specifically
between males and females,

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:02.360
that if you have
a partner at home,

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:05.000
you want to be comfortable or
careful about your boundaries.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.564
So the information that you're
sharing with your partner

01:04:07.564 --> 01:04:09.730
is going to be different
with the information you're

01:04:09.730 --> 01:04:11.570
sharing within a workplace.

01:04:11.570 --> 01:04:14.660
This is if you have, like,
male-female workplace

01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:15.410
coworkers.

01:04:15.410 --> 01:04:18.160
But all of these are
directly applicable,

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:22.350
so knowing your coworker, asking
them open-ended questions.

01:04:22.350 --> 01:04:24.940
It's really incredible
what can change

01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:27.910
with the dynamic of someone
that you're working with.

01:04:27.910 --> 01:04:30.250
Let's just say that you
only are coming together

01:04:30.250 --> 01:04:32.960
and all you have is
shop talk, just trying

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:36.500
to solve problems related
to your work description.

01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:38.680
But if you happen to know
that this person really

01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:41.750
enjoys golf on the weekends
and you ask him, like,

01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:43.730
hey, did you happen to
go golfing this weekend

01:04:43.730 --> 01:04:47.160
and how are the kids or I know
that your birthday's coming up.

01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:51.990
Knowing the inner pieces,
having a Love Map for the people

01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:53.990
that you work with is important.

01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:57.320
The other part is, have you
ever noticed this is the repair

01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:00.190
part, maybe you
said something that

01:05:00.190 --> 01:05:06.520
might have been misconstrued
or perhaps made your coworker

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:07.970
upset in some way.

01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:10.330
You can use a repair to
get you back on track.

01:05:10.330 --> 01:05:12.890
So all of these are
directly applicable.

01:05:12.890 --> 01:05:14.220
Yeah.

01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:16.300
There isn't research
that's been done

01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:19.260
yet by Dr. Gottman on
that relationship, only

01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:20.870
on intimate
relationships, but there

01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:23.740
is a program that's being
developed for coworkers

01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:25.910
in a professional setting.

01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:28.864
Any other questions?

01:05:28.864 --> 01:05:29.363
Yeah?

01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:34.680
AUDIENCE: Maybe you have advice.

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:38.150
How to complain without
criticism, I think,

01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:40.050
is the way you phrased it.

01:05:40.050 --> 01:05:44.340
How do you complain,
I see how it's better

01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:48.270
to describe how you're
feeling and what bothers you

01:05:48.270 --> 01:05:50.090
instead of just saying
you always do this.

01:05:50.090 --> 01:05:50.920
LAURA HECK: Right.

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:52.870
AUDIENCE: But even
that can sound

01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:54.470
passive aggressive and whiny.

01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:56.950
If you just use the
words the other way,

01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:59.270
it can still come
across as an attack.

01:05:59.270 --> 01:06:04.970
So how do you actually practice
communicating instead of just

01:06:04.970 --> 01:06:06.830
attacking passive aggressively?

01:06:06.830 --> 01:06:07.500
LAURA HECK: OK.

01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:10.070
So if you're using
like an I statement.

01:06:10.070 --> 01:06:12.960
So passive aggressive.

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:14.650
So part of the passive
aggressive piece

01:06:14.650 --> 01:06:17.110
is when people don't take
ownership for something,

01:06:17.110 --> 01:06:20.400
and what we're really asking
is that you're taking ownership

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:21.740
of what's bothering you.

01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:22.900
And that's OK.

01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:24.930
Because when things
store up, they sort of

01:06:24.930 --> 01:06:26.510
are like a volcano.

01:06:26.510 --> 01:06:27.810
They bubble to the surface.

01:06:27.810 --> 01:06:30.350
So we're asking that people
take some ownership of something

01:06:30.350 --> 01:06:32.550
that's bothering them
and use the I statements.

01:06:32.550 --> 01:06:37.610
So I'm upset about this, I'm
frustrated, I'm hurt, I'm sad,

01:06:37.610 --> 01:06:38.890
I'm lonely.

01:06:38.890 --> 01:06:41.820
And when you take
ownership of that,

01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:44.354
it loses the passive
aggressive piece

01:06:44.354 --> 01:06:46.020
because you're really
not doing passive.

01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:47.020
You're taking ownership.

01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:49.370
You're being more assertive
in your relationship.

01:06:49.370 --> 01:06:52.010
So I'm lonely.

01:06:52.010 --> 01:06:55.920
I haven't seen you for
the last three nights.

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:56.761
That's true, right?

01:06:56.761 --> 01:06:58.260
So you're describing
what's going on

01:06:58.260 --> 01:06:59.660
in a non-judgmental way.

01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:01.660
You're simply stating
what's going on.

01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:05.110
I haven't seen you for the
last three nights, I'm lonely.

01:07:05.110 --> 01:07:08.610
I'd really like it if we could
schedule a date night sometime

01:07:08.610 --> 01:07:10.920
this week so that
we can reconnect.

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:14.410
Or I was really hurt when
you didn't introduce me

01:07:14.410 --> 01:07:16.612
to your boss this afternoon.

01:07:16.612 --> 01:07:19.440
I really would love to get to
know the people in your life

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:21.240
that you're spending
most of your day with.

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:24.680
Do you mind if maybe we could
go out for dinner with him

01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:26.660
and his wife sometime next week?

01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:27.992
Whatever it might be.

01:07:27.992 --> 01:07:29.700
I don't know if I
answered your question,

01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:33.490
but part of the piece
about complaining

01:07:33.490 --> 01:07:37.560
is that I'm not saying that
it's not going to-- nobody

01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:39.137
likes to complain, right?

01:07:39.137 --> 01:07:41.720
You don't like to complain, you
don't like to hear complaints,

01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:44.840
but what we're trying
to do is that we're

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:48.100
trying to change the complaints
so that the criticism.

01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:50.650
So they're not criticizing
your partner in a global way.

01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:53.401
You're certainly going to
complain about this one thing

01:07:53.401 --> 01:07:55.650
right here and you're not
going to store it up, rather

01:07:55.650 --> 01:07:58.030
than globalizing it and
criticizing your partner

01:07:58.030 --> 01:08:00.210
altogether.

01:08:00.210 --> 01:08:03.400
Any other questions?

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:03.900
No?

01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:08.270
OK, I hope you guys enjoy
the rest of your work day.
