( intro music )

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.541
Caleb Harper:
<i>My talk is about how to solve</i>

00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:10.309
<i> the global food crisis</i>

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.278 line:0%
Technology and seed
is for an adverse world.

00:00:13.278 --> 00:00:15.315 line:0%
What if you had perfect world?

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:17.116
<i> Researching this for me</i>

00:00:17.116 --> 00:00:19.352
took me to a place of learning
about Mir Space Station.

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:22.087
You know, the most space
constrained environment

00:00:22.087 --> 00:00:23.355
<i>the least amount of resources.</i>

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:24.591
<i> You know it costs
 them a lot of money</i>

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:26.125
<i>to ship water into space.</i>

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:29.862
<i>So, they created something
on Mir called Aeroponics.</i>

00:00:29.862 --> 00:00:31.030
<i>That was inspirational to me</i>

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.533
where they create
a fog in a box.

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:36.202
And that fog is between five
and fifty microns dense

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:38.505
and all of those microns
of water contain also

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:41.141
all the nutrients and the
oxygen the plants need.

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:43.743
The thing that inspired
me is they reported

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:46.079
that they use 98
percent less water.

00:00:47.012 --> 00:00:49.148
And that they grew anywhere like

00:00:49.148 --> 00:00:50.516
a theoretical possibility of

00:00:50.516 --> 00:00:53.719
twenty times faster
plant production.

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:56.322
So, one square foot of soil

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:57.690
three heads of
broccoli in a year.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.259
That's if you have the water,
if you don't have pests

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:01.761
if you have the fertilizer

00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:04.497
if you... if, right?
The farmer "if".

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:07.466 line:0%
<i> Whereas in Aeroponics
 we're producing 18.</i>

00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:10.069 line:0%
<i> What if,
I just took one square foot of</i>

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:11.270 line:0%
<i> the tallest
 building in Boston</i>

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.005 line:0%
<i>just one on the whole facade</i>

00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:15.375 line:0%
<i> I get between three
 in the ground</i>

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:17.644 line:0%
<i> or 3,000 in that facade.</i>

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:19.478
So, we started by
hacking things from

00:01:19.478 --> 00:01:21.246
Home Depot, Bed Bath and Beyond

00:01:21.246 --> 00:01:23.282
you know, atomizers, nebulizers

00:01:23.282 --> 00:01:25.885
learning about the
technology of creating mist

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:27.353
making plants dance

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:29.121
killing a lot of
plants, unfortunately.

00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:31.657
You know, we were technologists,
a group of technologists

00:01:31.657 --> 00:01:35.095
falling backwards into
a very old world.

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:37.730
<i> So, then we went to the
 first 60 square feet.</i>

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.232
<i> Inside of this
 60 square feet</i>

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:41.267
<i> we're experimenting with
 all kinds of things</i>

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:42.402
<i>But I think most importantly</i>

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:45.204
<i>we fed about 300 people in
the Media Lab, once a month</i>

00:01:45.204 --> 00:01:47.039
<i> and we made a lot of
 local food donations.</i>

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:49.308
<i>But even better than that
 the bright green colors</i>

00:01:49.308 --> 00:01:51.510
<i> the bright white roots,
 the crispness</i>

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.580
<i>the quality of all of this food.</i>

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.315
<i> You know, is this a new
grocery store of the future?</i>

00:01:56.315 --> 00:01:57.617
<i>Is this is a new restaurant?</i>

00:01:57.617 --> 00:02:00.586
<i>Is this just a pick your own
 lettuce patch for dorks?</i>

00:02:00.586 --> 00:02:02.355
( audience laughter )

00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:05.324
<i>This was the first time that
many people in the Media Lab</i>

00:02:05.324 --> 00:02:07.293
<i> had ever ripped the
 roots off of anything.</i>

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:08.861
<i> You know,
 it's just a reality.</i>

00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:10.463
We get our salad in
bags, and that's

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:12.565
there's nothing wrong with
that, we live in the city but

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:15.734
you know, this created a spark
of inspiration that said

00:02:15.734 --> 00:02:17.903
"Well, maybe, you know, maybe

00:02:17.903 --> 00:02:20.005
image based processing
and machine learning

00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:21.240
has something to do with food."

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.042
You can log into this farm.

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:25.511
So, you log in, you
monitor the system.

00:02:25.511 --> 00:02:27.279
<i> You get a history.</i>

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:30.049
<i> That history becomes
 a digital recipe.</i>

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.252
<i>These are all the broccolis
 in my lab by IP address.</i>

00:02:33.252 --> 00:02:36.389
<i> Right. We have IP
 addressable broccolis.</i>

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.558
We create all this cool stuff,
now we got to email it.

00:02:39.558 --> 00:02:40.693
Why are we shipping things?

00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:42.929
Why are we shipping with planes,
trains and automobiles?

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:46.266
Why can't we email food
like we email information?

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:48.901
So, Willy Wonka style why
can't we particalize it

00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:50.803
and then send it over
to the other side

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:52.872
to be reconstituted
somewhere else?

00:02:52.872 --> 00:02:54.940
<i> If this seems crazy,
 we're already doing it.</i>

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.575
<i> These are labs that I am
sending all over the world</i>

00:02:56.575 --> 00:02:57.476
<i> in different places.</i>

00:02:57.576 --> 00:02:59.845
<i> So, this really becomes
 just a platform.</i>

00:02:59.845 --> 00:03:01.681
So, here's the tools.

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:04.484
First personal computer for food
we call it GRO-bot.

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:06.952
GRO-bot is a hacker platform
for kids.

00:03:06.952 --> 00:03:08.387
we're trying to get
this done super-cheap

00:03:08.387 --> 00:03:09.555
and send it all over the world

00:03:09.555 --> 00:03:10.623
<i> This is what I am doing.</i>

00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:13.860
<i> I am connecting school
 children that experiment</i>

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.762
<i> and want to know why
 does a plant grow tall</i>

00:03:16.762 --> 00:03:18.598
<i> why is it short,
 why does it taste funny.</i>

00:03:18.598 --> 00:03:20.365
Why does algae
grow in the water?

00:03:20.365 --> 00:03:21.867
But then we are recording that.

00:03:21.867 --> 00:03:23.168
And they can email that
to their friend

00:03:23.168 --> 00:03:26.872
but even more importantly, say
they express a novel protein

00:03:26.872 --> 00:03:29.542
and that novel protein is
incredibly important to humanity

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:31.477
we never knew it existed
because those climates that

00:03:31.477 --> 00:03:34.680
the kids created playing,
don't exist on Earth.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.949
So, if you can distribute all
of this across the world

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:38.918
you can make breakthroughs
so much faster.
