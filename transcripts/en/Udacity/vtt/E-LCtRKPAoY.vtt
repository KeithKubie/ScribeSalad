00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.137
Now let's switch gears and talk about drug therapy for schizophrenia. As I

00:00:04.137 --> 00:00:07.822
mentioned at the beginning of this lesson, the phenothiazines were discovered

00:00:07.822 --> 00:00:12.669
in the 1950s and they were found to be more effective than placebo. That is,

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:15.945
when patients were given a placebo their symptoms did not improve, but when

00:00:15.945 --> 00:00:21.348
they were given the phenothiazine their symptoms did improve. These drugs help

00:00:21.348 --> 00:00:24.996
reduce the hallucinations, delusions, agitation, and paranoia that these

00:00:24.996 --> 00:00:30.965
patients experienced. Therefore, these drugs became widely used. Now there are

00:00:30.965 --> 00:00:35.221
two major groups of antipsychotics. The conventional antipsychotics, which were

00:00:35.221 --> 00:00:38.686
made before the mid 1990s and the atypical antipsychotics, which have been

00:00:38.686 --> 00:00:41.780
developed in about the last ten years.
