00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.503
You know, we usually like
to start the show

00:00:02.536 --> 00:00:04.004
with something fun
and high-energy

00:00:04.037 --> 00:00:06.006
to make the audience go "Whoo!"

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:07.541
ALL:
Whoo!

00:00:07.574 --> 00:00:08.976
Not yet.

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.012
Today, I wanted to mix things up
and talk about a serious issue

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:13.647
relating to November's election.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.849
On the ballot this year,
Californians will participate

00:00:15.883 --> 00:00:20.287
in an historic vote to finally
legalize recreational marijuana.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.590
(cheers and applause)

00:00:33.934 --> 00:00:36.537
Why is it that people "whoo"
at the word "marijuana,"

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.172
but if I just gave you
marijuana,

00:00:38.205 --> 00:00:39.339
you'd be like, "Sweet."?

00:00:39.373 --> 00:00:41.074
-(laughter) -They're finally
making it easier

00:00:41.108 --> 00:00:43.777
to get pot in California
by cutting out that arduous step

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.146
of going to a fake doctor
in a strip mall

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.082
and lying about headaches.

00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:51.351
There's clearly a lot
of excitement about this.

00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:52.753
In fact,
Matthew McConaughey's been

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:55.689
sleeping outside
his polling place right there.

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:57.758
-(laughter)
-That's definitely him.

00:00:57.791 --> 00:01:01.695
Now, comedians,
I do not partake in the weed.

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:02.996
I'm a sober fellow,

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.365
but I don't hold it
against you if you enjoy it.

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:07.367
Let's attempt to pander
to the audience

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:09.603
in the opposite direction,
all right? What we need is

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:12.005
a slogan that anti-marijuana
lobbyists will use

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:14.675
in the upcoming election.
Let's take the other side.

00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:16.009
-Jim Jefferies, go.
-Vote!

00:01:16.043 --> 00:01:18.345
We dare you, because voting
requires you

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:20.113
to show up somewhere
at an exact date.

00:01:20.147 --> 00:01:21.682
HARDWICK:
Yes! All right, perfect.

00:01:21.715 --> 00:01:23.450
(cheers and applause)

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:26.486
Perfect.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.155
Nikki Glaser.

00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:30.691
Aren't the lines
at Taco Bell long enough?

00:01:30.724 --> 00:01:32.092
Yeah. Points.

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:34.661
-(applause and cheering)
-I'll see you down there.

00:01:34.695 --> 00:01:37.097
Brett Gellman.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.833
Why have a joint in your pocket

00:01:39.867 --> 00:01:39.933
when you can have a gun
in your hand?
