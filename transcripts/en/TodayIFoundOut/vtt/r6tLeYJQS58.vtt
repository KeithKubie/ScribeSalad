00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:03.679
Hello I’m Daven Hiskey and today we’ve
got something a little different for you.

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:08.170
We received a question from a TodayIFoundOut
subscriber on whether or not tapping a shaken

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.299
soda can actually results in less foam spewing
out, as is the widely held belief.

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:16.910
This seemed interesting enough to us, but
when we looked far and wide for a definitive

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.190
answer, we uncharacteristically came up empty.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:26.470
So we decided to run an experiment ourselves
to find out the answer.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.240
And just before we get into that, you should
know this episode is brought to you by iFixit,

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.590
Alright, now, to be clear, when looking at
answering the question of whether tapping

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.170
a shaken can of shaken soda actually does
anything, certainly there are many otherwise

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.900
reputable sources throwing out an opinion
on both sides of the argument.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.059
But outside of Snopes, nobody seems to have
bothered to experimentally test whether tapping

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.719
the can does anything.

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.620
And as for Snopes, while they technically
did do an experiment, this was a reported

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.900
sample-size of just three runs (although they
do allude to "a variety of experiments" not

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.900
reported).

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.950
It is possible one doesn't need a large sample
size here to get meaningful results, so perhaps

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.790
three runs is a perfectly sufficient sample.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.110
However, Snopes gives no hard quantitative
data (only anecdotal observations) on this

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.360
one, and did not necessarily shake each of
the cans the exact same way (though did time

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.810
it and presumably the shaking was approximately
the same if they had the same person shaking

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:32.920
each time).

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.781
But needless to say, while Snopes' conclusion
may end up being perfectly correct, we weren't

00:01:36.781 --> 00:01:41.090
really comfortable stating it as a definitive
answer here given the way the experiment was

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.280
conducted and lack of hard data.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.780
But if you're curious, their results indicated
that tapping the side of the can produced

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.710
slightly less foam than simply waiting to
open it, but otherwise from a practical standpoint

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.420
didn't really make a difference.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.820
As for expert opinions, these also were conflicting,
though perhaps the best such source in Cornell

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.750
University biochemist, and one of the world's
leading beverage foam experts (and, yes, that’s

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.610
a thing), Karl J. Siebert, rang in on the
side that at best tapping the can does nothing

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.219
in his opinion, and even potentially makes
the problem worse.

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:15.450
As Dr. Siebert states, by tapping the can,
"you risk creating more bubbles."

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.480
Despite this, many otherwise reputable sources
claim that tapping the can does actually help.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.480
Why?

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.250
As you're probably aware, when you shake the
can, the agitation causes some of the dissolved

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.609
carbon dioxide in the container to form bubbles
at various nucleation sites on the inner surface.

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:34.270
It's also further widely held that some of
the bubbles formed will stick to the inside

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.610
of the container at these various nucleation
sites, rather than rising to the top.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.459
When the can is opened and the high pressure
thus removed, these bubbles rapidly expand

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.160
and shoot to the top of the container, pushing
out some of the liquid with them.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.190
Thus, the hypothesis is that by tapping on
the can, you can dislodge these bubbles and

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.879
cause them to float to the top before opening
the container, so that when you do open the

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.799
can, the gas can expand and escape without
taking any liquid with it.

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.510
Seems reasonably enough, but does this actually
work?

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.310
To begin with in our little experiment, we
needed a device that could shake our soda

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.219
cans exactly the same every single time.

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:13.010
The Shakenator T-3000 we made to do this works
such that with each button press, it shakes

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.810
the can exactly 10 times with a stroke length
of 1.125 inches or 2.9 cm.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.590
Through a bit of experimentation, we ultimately
found that at our coldest measured temperatures

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.030
about 150 shakes (at about 8.8 complete shakes
per second) was around the point where we

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.680
started getting very good, measurable results
with Coke cans, so went with that for the

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.959
number of shakes.

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.439
Because temperature is a big factor in how
much foam is produced, the device also reports

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:43.180
the temperature after each run, along with
the number of shakes and the time it took

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.709
for the run to complete.

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.049
Now to the experiment.

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.360
There are a variety of ways we could have
done this, but as we're far more interested

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.549
in the amount of foam coming out, rather than
the amount of carbon dioxide, we're choosing

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.849
to measure the liquid that comes out of a
can, glass bottle, and plastic bottle when

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.919
the respective containers are: shaken and
then tapped on the side, shaken and then tapped

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:06.950
on the top, shaken but not tapped- simply
waiting the same time interval as if we tapped

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.840
it, and then shaken, and quickly opened upon
removal from the machine.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.799
This latter one is particularly of interest
as one alternate hypothesis often put forth

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.320
on why tapping the can does increase your
odds of avoiding a fizzy bath has nothing

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.660
to do with the tapping itself, but is because
people tapping the container wait a short

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.190
interval before opening it, giving some of
the carbon dioxide time to re-dissolve into

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.340
the liquid and any formed bubbles to rise
to the top where they won't push any liquid

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.340
out.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.000
Also, just because we were curious, we ran
an additional experiment shaking several cans

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.670
and then opening them at intervals to see
how long it would take for no more liquid

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:42.760
to be pushed out.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.170
Obviously the results here will vary for other
shaking scenarios based on a variety of factors,

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.720
but we were really just curious at about broad
ballpark numbers here.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:57.020
So what were our results?

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:05.480
Well, it turns out that the actual tapping
of the can does nothing.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.220
However, we were very surprised to note that
the seemingly insignificant time interval

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.970
here of 20 seconds from shaking to open actually
did make a huge difference in the amount of

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:16.970
foam produced.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.890
And, in fact, on the runs when we opened the
can as fast as possible after being shaken,

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.220
even just a change of a few seconds appears
to have made a big difference in foam output,

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.250
as you'll see from the results which show
that that portion, which was the only one

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.770
not precisely timed, is the only place we
really saw a large variance in resulting foam,

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.900
even though every open in that case was within
a few seconds of each other.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.320
As for the rest of the subtle variance in
other runs, it was interesting to observe

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.730
how even the tiniest change in the opening
speed of the containers, which results in

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:50.920
the pressure being released at different rates,
made a very measurable difference in the foam

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.420
produced to the point where I was eventually
able to roughly predict the foam output based

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.740
on how I judged my opening speed, despite
the fact that in all cases with the can and

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.930
glass bottles, it only took a fraction of
a second to open them completely.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.490
Specifically, using video footage of a dozen
openings on each, we measured an average of

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:14.230
0.07 seconds to fully open the glass bottles
and 0.22 seconds for the cans.

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:18.470
With the plastic bottles, this was likewise
very similarly timed each time, though took

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:24.000
on average about 1.91 seconds to fully twist
the cap off, with the slightly wider variance

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.270
there resulting in a bit larger range in output
foam.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.250
As for tapping in the air vs. on a hard surface,
it would seem this did not have a noticeable

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.740
effect either way.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.050
And because it actually takes quite a bit
of shaking to get a measurable amount of foam

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.560
spillage (using a gram as the smallest increment-
for reference here the containers in question

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.980
contained roughly 340 grams of liquid), we're
guessing in real world scenarios where people

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.660
are trying to reduce foam by tapping, nobody's
tapping the can vigorously enough to make

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.850
a noticeable difference in foam output.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:56.840
It's also noteworthy that whether tapping
30 times or 50 made no real difference here

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.950
in terms of the expected outcome.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:03.050
Another interesting point is that the plastic
bottles produced significantly more foam,

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.780
despite it taking much longer to fully open
them.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:10.140
As previously mentioned, based on our observations
with all container types, even a fraction

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:14.300
of a second change in opening speed made a
noticeable difference in foam output.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.430
And given it took roughly 13 times longer
to open the plastic containers fully compared

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:22.750
to the average of the glass and cans, one
might have initially expected the plastic

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:26.610
containers would produce much less foam as
a result, not more.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:31.730
Given how much carbon dioxide is added significantly
affects the taste of the beverage, we're presuming

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:36.360
Coca-Cola does not vary the initial carbonation
level added based on container type.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.950
If that's correct, we're guessing that the
plastic containers must contain a much greater

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:44.800
number of nucleation sites than glass or aluminum,
ultimately producing many more bubbles for

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.100
the same shakes.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.940
This brings us to how long we had to wait
until no foam was produced.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:53.760
We initially expected we'd have to go out
to intervals of maybe even as much as an hour

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:58.370
to see the foam completely disappear, but
we were woefully incorrect on this point.

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:02.930
In fact, our first experimental run of just
60 seconds of waiting ended up producing no

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:08.560
foam whatsoever despite the 150 vigorous shakes
and the small geyser produced at a few second

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.120
interval given those shakes.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.200
We then broke it down to 10 second intervals
and found at the colder temperature it took

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:19.970
just 50 seconds for foaming out of the container
to no longer occur and at 40 seconds, while

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:25.340
there was a slight overflow onto the lid area,
it was not even a gram's worth and certainly

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.470
didn't naturally spill off the container.

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:31.810
At the higher room temperature, the results
were surprisingly similar at 40 seconds producing

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:37.060
just slightly more foam than at the 40 second
mark in the colder temperature, measuring

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:40.789
in at 1 gram, 0 grams, and 3 grams in our
three runs.

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:44.370
Similarly, the 50 and 60 second marks at room
temperature mimicked the 40 and 50 second

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:47.410
marks respectively at the near refrigeration
temperature.

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:51.500
As to why there is so little foam being produced
after such a short interval, it would seem

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:55.790
to us there are two possibilities, both of
which may be coming into play.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:09:00.379
The first possibility is that the carbon dioxide
is rapidly being redissolved in the liquid.

00:09:00.379 --> 00:09:05.050
But as we didn't measure the actual escaped
C02 compared to an unshaken container, we

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:07.980
can't say for certain to what extent that
is happening.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.759
The second possibility is simply that all
the bubbles created from the shaking rise

00:09:11.759 --> 00:09:16.589
to the top in this time span and, with no
further shaking causing more bubbles to form

00:09:16.589 --> 00:09:21.680
at the nucleation sites, the undissolved carbon
dioxide is simply escaping when you open the

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.920
can without pushing out any liquid.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.649
Supporting the idea that this is the bigger
factor in this case is footage of the shaken

00:09:27.649 --> 00:09:32.459
glass and plastic bottles which show a dramatic
drop-off in created bobbles in a relatively

00:09:32.459 --> 00:09:37.520
short time span after shaking is stopped,
with those created all rising to the top relatively

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:42.029
quickly and no visible bubbles clinging to
the sides as is often stated happens when

00:09:42.029 --> 00:09:45.089
people talk about the benefits of tapping
the container.

00:09:45.089 --> 00:09:50.149
Further, while we didn't measure the carbon
dioxide output, for what it's worth, observationally

00:09:50.149 --> 00:09:55.260
even when no significant foam was produced,
there still sounded like a lot more gas escaping

00:09:55.260 --> 00:10:00.209
when opening these shaken cans compared to
opening cans that had just been sitting around,

00:10:00.209 --> 00:10:06.199
which we did several times just to compare
the sound back to back.

00:10:06.199 --> 00:10:11.740
Though, of course, further experimentation
measuring the actual carbon dioxide output

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.850
would need to be done to know for sure.

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:14.850
So there you have it.

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:18.939
We now know for certain that tapping a can
of soda does absolutely nothing to reduce

00:10:18.939 --> 00:10:24.089
foam and it is actually the short time interval
taken to tap the can that is reducing foaming

00:10:24.089 --> 00:10:26.410
vs. simply opening the can immediately.

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:30.230
It also very much appears that tapping the
container vigorously, which while potentially

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:35.240
could have produced more foam via further
agitation, did not produce any practical increase

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.399
in fizz.

00:10:36.399 --> 00:10:39.630
And while your results will vary based on
things like temperature, atmospheric pressure,

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:44.959
and how much a given can was shaken, it would
very much appear in all cases you really don't

00:10:44.959 --> 00:10:48.800
need to wait more than around a minute or
so for things to stabilize to the point where

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:53.930
you can safely open the soda container without
risk of a foam over, even if you open the

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:54.930
container quickly.

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:57.850

iFixit has over 25,000 such free repair guides
and videos showing you how to fix or take

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:21.930
apart and put back together all sorts of gadgets
from iPhones and Samsung Galaxy devices, to

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:23.449
Xbox’s, Pcs and more.

00:11:23.449 --> 00:11:27.120
Helpful in the process of tearing down devices
and putting them back together, or just building

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:31.990
can-shaking machines, is their Pro-Tech Tool
Kit designed for electronics repair, including

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:36.319
an electrostatic discharge safety strap and
tweezers, a swivel-top magnetic precision

00:11:36.319 --> 00:11:41.249
driver with 64 bits that are magnetically
held in place in the case, and a wide variety

00:11:41.249 --> 00:11:46.089
of plastic opening tools, spudgers, and picks
to safely pry with, along with a suction cup

00:11:46.089 --> 00:11:47.699
to pull screens up.

00:11:47.699 --> 00:11:51.640
But by far, in my opinion, the best and most
unique feature of this Pro-Tech Tool Kit are

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.980
those magnetically held 64 bits.

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.240
In most other such kits, bits are usually
held in place via hard plastic, which is a

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:03.019
major pain when things are inevitably too
tight and otherwise over time loosen so the

00:12:03.019 --> 00:12:04.079
bits fall out.

00:12:04.079 --> 00:12:08.040
With this kit, the bits are super easy to
take out and put in, and once in, stay their

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.360
very securely.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:13.100
The whole thing conveniently rolls up for
easy storage has a lifetime warranty, and

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.100
is only $59.99.

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:19.149
So if you want to tackle your next DIY project
or repair with the Pro Tech Toolkit, or perhaps

00:12:19.149 --> 00:12:24.369
want to purchase it as a Christmas present
for someone, please visit ifixit.com/brainfood

00:12:24.369 --> 00:12:28.779
to snag the fully-loaded Pro Tech Toolkit
for only $59.99.

00:12:28.779 --> 00:12:31.480
And thank you to iFixit for supporting this
channel.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.290
Bonus Fact:
• Just for fun, we also ran this experiment

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:38.019
on cans of Dr. Pepper to see if the results
changed at all.

00:12:38.019 --> 00:12:41.050
They did not in terms of the main points already
made.

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:45.070
However, what was interesting to note was
that the Dr. Pepper produced about half as

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:49.089
much foam on average as the Coca-Cola for
each of the scenarios.

00:12:49.089 --> 00:12:52.399
There are a variety of potential ingredients
that can cause a difference here.

00:12:52.399 --> 00:12:57.060
For instance, with many diet sodas that contain
aspartame, they end up producing more foam

00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:01.601
because aspartame lowers the surface tension
of the liquid much more than sugar or corn

00:13:01.601 --> 00:13:02.601
syrup will.

00:13:02.601 --> 00:13:06.899
It's possible Coca-Cola simply contains more
surfactants than Dr. Pepper.

00:13:06.899 --> 00:13:11.410
Or it's possible Dr. Pepper just contains
much less carbon dioxide than Coca-Cola; given

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:15.449
the amount of carbon dioxide dissolved in
the beverage greatly influences the taste

00:13:15.449 --> 00:13:19.949
and mouth feel, we're presuming there is a
reasonable variance from flavor to flavor.

00:13:19.949 --> 00:13:24.540
And, anecdotally, it does always seem like
Dr. Pepper goes flat much faster than a lot

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:26.160
of soft drinks....

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.720
But that's an experiment for another day.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:31.060
For now, whatever is the underlying cause,
we thought it was interesting to note how

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:35.939
much less foam an equally shaken can of Dr.
Pepper produces compared to a can of Coke.

00:13:35.939 --> 00:13:38.999
So thanks for watching this video, I know
this was a little different than our normal

00:13:38.999 --> 00:13:40.930
stuff, but I hope you enjoyed it anyway.

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:44.670
And if you did, please do give it a like below
and share it with anyone you think might find

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:45.670
it interesting.

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:48.949
We’d also like to again thank ifixit for
sponsoring this one as well as our patrons

00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:50.089
on patreon.

00:13:50.089 --> 00:13:54.320
As you might imagine, rather than the normal
24 or so hours most of our videos take to

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:59.100
produce, give or take a few hours on average,
this one took a lot longer, ringing in at

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:03.139
just over 100 hours; so given the expected
YouTube ad revenue on a video like this is

00:14:03.139 --> 00:14:07.601
woefully small given our average expected
views, without the support of ifixit and our

00:14:07.601 --> 00:14:11.360
patrons, we really wouldn’t have been able
to spend the time and money to research the

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:15.889
answer on a question like this where the answer
isn’t definitively known somewhere.

00:14:15.889 --> 00:14:19.490
So thanks again to ifixit and you patrons,
and thank you for watching.
