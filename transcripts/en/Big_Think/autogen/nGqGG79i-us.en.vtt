the things i like is is technology and

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119
the things i like is is technology and
 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.769
the things i like is is technology and
gadgets and I I love seeing the process

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779
gadgets and I I love seeing the process
 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.400
gadgets and I I love seeing the process
of solving problems and I worked in a

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410
of solving problems and I worked in a
 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.000
of solving problems and I worked in a
hardware store actually when I was 14

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010
hardware store actually when I was 14
 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.689
hardware store actually when I was 14
and I was able to work my way up to not

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699
and I was able to work my way up to not
 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:46.880
and I was able to work my way up to not
just being a stock person but actually

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890
just being a stock person but actually
 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.639

talking to customers what I loved best
 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.399
talking to customers what I loved best
is I would ask the customer to tell me

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:52.409
is I would ask the customer to tell me
 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:54.709
is I would ask the customer to tell me
what is it you're trying to do and then

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719
what is it you're trying to do and then
 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.169
what is it you're trying to do and then
working with that customer to try to

00:00:57.169 --> 00:00:57.179
working with that customer to try to
 

00:00:57.179 --> 00:00:59.389
working with that customer to try to
solve that problem and it was usually

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399
solve that problem and it was usually
 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.669
solve that problem and it was usually
not the way they were thinking of it

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:01.679
not the way they were thinking of it
 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:04.040
not the way they were thinking of it
going over to the island filing the

finding the product that just does it it
was combining several things that would

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640
was combining several things that would
 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.240
was combining several things that would
customize the solution for that problem

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250
customize the solution for that problem
 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.730
customize the solution for that problem
that they were thinking of and that was

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740
that they were thinking of and that was
 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.149
that they were thinking of and that was
really a lot of fun and rewarding not

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159
really a lot of fun and rewarding not
 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.980
really a lot of fun and rewarding not
only because of the you know solving the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990
only because of the you know solving the
 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.350
only because of the you know solving the
problem but these great relationships

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360
problem but these great relationships
 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.490
problem but these great relationships
you have with people

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.740
 
I think that being science and math

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750
I think that being science and math
 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.850
I think that being science and math
literate and technology literate is is a

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860
literate and technology literate is is a
 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.060

that capacity to understand I'm not
 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.370
that capacity to understand I'm not
saying you have to be a scientist or an

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380
saying you have to be a scientist or an
 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.340
saying you have to be a scientist or an
engineer I'm saying being science

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350
engineer I'm saying being science
 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.500
engineer I'm saying being science
literate so that you can understand and

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510
literate so that you can understand and
 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.780

movies and understanding plays and books
 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.230
movies and understanding plays and books
requires some science literacy and and

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240
requires some science literacy and and
 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.540

actually have to collaborate at
different times with your opponent and
