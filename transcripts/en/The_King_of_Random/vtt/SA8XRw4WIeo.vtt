00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
Hey, what's up guys it's Grant here I know, some of you have been wondering where I've gone

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.250
Well I've got an update video coming out in the next week or two that'll explain all the answers to your questions.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.340
I've got a big announcement to make so keep your eyes out for that video in the next week or two and i'll see you there.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.880
Hey guys, I'm Nate, welcome back to the workshop, not too long ago, we showed you how to build your very own bullwhip

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.200
Using parracord bb's, athletic tape, and some PVC piping

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.100
Well today we're gonna go over a couple of quick lessons on how to get your bullwhip to crack well, without hurting yourself.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:34.260
First is the cattleman's crack. To do the cattleman's crack you need to start out with the whip lying out straight behind you

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.180
What i'm going to do is bring

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.520
My arm up into the 12 o'clock position and the whole whip will flip up in the air around

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:48.689
And behind me. Once the whip is pointing behind me, not when it's above me, but when it's behind me, I'll then bring

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:52.620
My arm back down to the 6 o'clock position the whole whip will curl

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.900
Along, and then at the end when the fall straightens out that's where it cracks the other type of crack I was doing is called

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.340
the overhead crack

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.100
This, type of crack is actually a reversal of which direction, you're, swinging the whip

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.260
Above your head so to start out I swing counterclockwise

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.930
If you're, practicing this you, want to make sure that you can, easily swing it without it touching the ground anywhere around

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.459
you, and then when I get to about here and the whip is pointing straight behind me,

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.979
I will reverse direction in a clockwise way, and the whip, which will be swinging above my

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.879
Head will get that same curl in it that it does from the cattleman's crack and

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.920
Then this last one which again

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.799
I don't know if it has a name i just sort of figured it out it probably does have a name but i'm pretty

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.799
new at this sport

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.720
All i'm going to do is very quickly bring

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.749
My arm forward like i'm throwing a baseball sort of sidearm and then once i'm near the front i snap

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.589
My wrist to give it a little extra flick to it. Whip cracking 101!

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.469
There you have it that's three beginning, whip

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.930
cracks

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.349
There are ways that you can go in routines from one crack into another and there are probably a dozen different

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.090
Ways to crack the whip that i don't know yet

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.450
I'm just learning this myself, we also had one viewer who directed me to another video that suggested a faster way

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.360
The polish it uses some ball chain

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.840
Instead of bb's fit down inside the paracord so we're gonna try throwing one of those together and see how, well it works

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.020
*Saw cutting

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.000
Just like in the other video, my first piece of paracord is going to be long enough that it can

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.780
Stick out the back by about a foot

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.300
You'll go the length of the handle and then it will have eight feet of paracord in front of the handle

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.430
There's our eight-foot mark

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.149
Use some tape to mark, where the back of our long piece of paracord

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:52.949
Leaves the handle of our whip now, i need nine, more pieces of paracord, which will get progressively shorter as they go down

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:53.660
The length of the whip

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.400
We want our second piece of paracord to be 18 inches shorter than our longest piece and

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.760
After that every piece will shrink by, about eight inches

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.920
Images shorter cut the tape.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.240
"10"

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.069
There, we go we've got our 10 strands of paracord so let's add some ball chain for weight

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:29.169
Now the ball chain is clearly, not gonna have the same amount of weight per strand, as bb's inside of paracord so we're gonna try

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.720
doubling the amount of chains, that, we have

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.590
Maybe more I don't want to go as long as our?

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:42.610
Longest or even our second longest cord but i am gonna measure out our third longest piece of cord to make a. Chain, that length

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.089
Now, that piece of chain, is about six feet long and this roll of chain, comes with

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.940
30 feet on it i'm going to add another piece but to make sure

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.649
We keep the taper of the whip nice and natural i'm gonna shorten this one by about four inches

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.170
I'm just gonna keep going adding

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.420
Pieces of chain, shortening it by, about 4 inches every time i have two rolls of this metal chain

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.420
and you'll probably, use all of it

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.348
That's 10 strands i think that's gonna be a pretty good weight?

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.119
We now have 10 strands of paracord and 10 strands of our ball chain let's bundle them together

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.019
Tape them up attach them to our handle and see if this whip will work

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:40.499
Before i tape the paracord strands together i'm gonna tape all of the ball chain strands together, hopefully they'll

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.689
Make sort of one chord and i can kind of put that in the middle of the paracord we'll see if that works at all

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.129
Start by just laying, them all flat on a piece of tape

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:56.639
Sticking it down and roll that up

00:05:02.209 --> 00:05:05.919
Kind of gonna, do the same thing with the paracord strands because i think that might help

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.288
me wrap the ball chain up inside of it

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:10.389
Not really worrying

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:15.458
About what order these strands are it's not necessarily from longest to shortest it's all going to be a. Bundle in the end

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.070
might, be the trickiest part of the whole build it's getting, this little piece of paracord end

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.700
Through, the little hole that's been drilled

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.780
That wasn't so hard

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.199
All right, we have our many strands of paracord kind of surrounding the ball chain

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:06.109
Next step is to secure this end of everything to the handle with a, whole lot of electrical tape

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:19.109
As soon as i wrap this in athletic tape it'll be good to go but before i do that i like to go around

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.759
And use a little bit of electrical tape every foot and a half or so just to hold it all together

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.589
There, we have it our whip is all wrapped up it's nice and flexible which is what

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.530
We want we do still have the fall, which is exposed?

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.520
And that's the part that moves around really fast

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:53.070
So i think we're just about ready to test this out but there is one little addition we're gonna make

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.180
Youtube where calibur, whips

00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:00.840
Suggested that if we added a cracker to our whip instead of just having it end in a fall it would work 50 times better

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:01.530
i think

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.510
We were getting a pretty good whip crack when

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:08.010
We just had the fall without a cracker on it but i figure if we can get any improvement on it let's try it

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.100
Before i was leaving the end of the paracord unfused so that as it

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.549
Unraveled a little bit it would act as a cracker a little bit on its own

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.389
Now, because i'm going to add dedicated cracker to it i am gonna, fuse it shut as

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.130
The calibur, whips channel, suggests in their video showing, how

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:28.619
to
Add a cracker instead of tying one on i'm actually going to put a small hole in the end of the fall and loop

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:33.690
The cracker through that so it shouldn't be able to come off at all i'm using a, nail to poke a hole right

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:35.690
Through, the end of my fall here

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:41.220
And then so it doesn't close back up when i take the, nail out i'm just gonna hit it with the lighter, again

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.790
Got a nice little eye hole, we should be able to fit a cracker

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:45.630
through, there pretty

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:49.140
easily the cracker itself i'm going to make out of one of the inside

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:55.470
Strands from our paracord this piece is about 18 inches long and it's definitely more than i'll need but i'll trim off any excess when

00:07:55.470 --> 00:08:00.540
I'm finished to start let's just fold the piece of nylon string in half and we'll hold it by, that folded point

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:07.169
This, nylon string, is twisted together and you can see that if i twist it one direction it actually comes apart

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:09.960
A little bit so what i'm going to try and do is using

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.290
my, thumb, and one finger i'm going to roll the two strands apart, and

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:19.259
Then once they're nice and loose i'll hold, them close together, and twist them back together

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:25.829
You can, see that by twisting it apart first it makes it so that when they twist, back together, they hold

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.199
Themselves that way a little bit i'm now

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.270
Going to move my, grip up to where it's already twisted

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:33.900
And then i'm going to repeat that process for four or five inches down

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:39.480
This piece of thread if you've seen our video on how to make rope this is a fairly similar idea

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:44.999
We twist the individual strands so that they're under a little bit of tension, and then when they twist together

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.700
They, stay wound very nicely

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.420
Alright you can, now see that the two separate strands have

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:59.339
Become wound together for maybe five inches so now i'm just going to tie a figure eight knot

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.340
Right, where they're finished winding together as

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:07.109
I predicted i have a little bit of extra cord, so i'm just gonna slice that off

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:10.480
and now

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.709
What i want to do is sort of the opposite of when i was twisting up i want to?

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:19.499
Untwist these strands all the way, so they just kind of turned into individual fibers or fluff

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:23.880
There we go?

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.270
we have our cracker

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:31.499
So now let's take the end of our cracker and fit it through the eye hole in the bottom of our fall now

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:36.210
We want to unravel the loop in one end of the cracker so that we can, fit the other end of the cracker

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:38.210
through, the hole

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.640
Now, when we pull this tight?

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:47.460
Our cracker is tied in a knot around the end of our fall and should never be able to come off unless it breaks

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:50.040
There, we go we've got our ball and chain

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.819
Whip we've added a cracker onto it let's decorate the handle and then go test it out

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.640
Beautiful let's go test it out

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:13.970
Here we go we've got the ball chain, whip first impression, is that this definitely is lighter weight than the whip with

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:18.350
The, bb's in it but we're. Gonna see how. It works it does have the cracker on it maybe that'll make it easier to whip

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:23.060
Keep your eyes safe

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.230
whoa, there it goes

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:32.270
That is pretty easy?

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:38.750
It's a little bit quieter of a sound i think

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:44.209
alright let's try the other one as a comparison i

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.109
Don't know. They both crack pretty easily

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:59.750
With just a little bit of practice i think, we can, definitely say that the ball chain

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:05.239
Whip is working and i do feel that the cracker, is making it a little bit easier to crack i don't know

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:10.310
If it's the whole weight of the whip or just the difference in having the cracker but i think, we have a slightly

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:15.560
higher pitched sound with the cracker on this whip either way it cracks

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.800
I don't know if i can pull this off

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:28.339
That was both there you have it a few techniques on how to crack a

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:30.380
Whip and a way to build your bullwhip

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:36.349
A little bit faster than filling paracord with bee bees the bee bees in the paracord whip has a little bit more weight to it

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:39.920
Which i enjoy and it costs a little bit less to build the ball chain

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.880
Whip is definitely faster to put together because you don't have to fill any paracord with bee bees

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:48.529
Which can, be pretty time-consuming and of course if you, want to add a cracker onto the end of your whip it can

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:50.240
Make it work a little bit better i wouldn't necessarily

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:56.810
Say that it's a 50 times improvement over where i was before but i think it's probably, about 20 percent easier to crack with

00:11:56.810 --> 00:12:02.960
The cracker on it a big shout out to adam cwm, for the inspiration, we got from his 15 minute bulwark, tutorial he's a

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:06.829
Whip tracking professional and we've put a link in the description so you can go check him out and tell him

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:08.780
We sent you again if you're, gonna be making a

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:13.100
Bullwhip, make sure you, take safety precautions wearing, eyewear and long sleeves so that if something goes wrong

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:18.050
You, don't injure yourself other than that this is a really fun build, that doesn't take too long especially if you

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:21.140
Use the chain rather than the bee bees thanks for joining us for this project

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.149
Today, and we'll see you in the next one talk to you then?

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:30.439
This, video, like most of our videos is brought to you, by electrical tape, electrical tape it holds the world together

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:36.020
Quit grabbing, each other, my cracker is tied itself in a knot

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:38.600
around the fall

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:44.400
I Don't know if there was something i was supposed to do to avoid, that probably even with the cracker around it like that

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.250
yep

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:51.710
Hey, guys it's grant here i'm not in a position to be in these videos right, now but that's exactly, why

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:57.379
nate's here nate is the man he's got some incredible talent and i think he could pretty much build anything so let him know in

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.869
The comments, what you, want to see and he can probably make it happen
