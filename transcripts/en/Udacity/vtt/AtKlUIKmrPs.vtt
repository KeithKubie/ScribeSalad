00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.320
There are a few major steps
in a launch checklist.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.130
Creating your basic website,
or even just the landing page,

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.780
which you should have already done or
updated in lesson two.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.230
Creating you social media pages,
Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus,

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.910
LinkedIn, Instagram, or whatever makes
sense for your audience behavior.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.900
Getting some media attention,
whether you do it with a PR firm or

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.280
do it yourself.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.710
Creating a press kit that you'll
use to share with the press.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.090
And starting to build your user base.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.480
And you'll be doing that
by using promo offers, and

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.900
being active in the relevant groups and
events.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.330
So let's look at these more closely.
