success of the surge I think the US has

finally got to that point work can

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020
finally got to that point work can
 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.290
finally got to that point work can
actually think about the Taliban as a

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300
actually think about the Taliban as a
 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.670
actually think about the Taliban as a
negotiating partner where the Taliban

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680
negotiating partner where the Taliban
 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.510
negotiating partner where the Taliban
might actually want to to get to a peace

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520
might actually want to to get to a peace
 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.090
might actually want to to get to a peace
settlement the US needs and then the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100
settlement the US needs and then the
 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.400
settlement the US needs and then the
NATO allies need to basically back off a

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410
NATO allies need to basically back off a
 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.650
NATO allies need to basically back off a
little bit and allow the peace process

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660
little bit and allow the peace process
 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.320
little bit and allow the peace process
to go forward while insuring as much

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330
to go forward while insuring as much
 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.180
to go forward while insuring as much
security as that as they possibly can

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190
security as that as they possibly can
 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.600
security as that as they possibly can
use NATO to an Gaddafi's rule but then

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610
use NATO to an Gaddafi's rule but then
 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.630
use NATO to an Gaddafi's rule but then
to maybe bring in another party a true

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640
to maybe bring in another party a true
 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.130
to maybe bring in another party a true
third party that actually hasn't been

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140
third party that actually hasn't been
 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.490
third party that actually hasn't been
part of the the fighting and that party

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500
part of the the fighting and that party
 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.560
part of the the fighting and that party
I think will be more credible at the

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570
I think will be more credible at the
 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.600
I think will be more credible at the
bargaining table to actually allow the

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610
bargaining table to actually allow the
 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.360
bargaining table to actually allow the
Libyans to reach an agreement that's

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370
Libyans to reach an agreement that's
 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.260
Libyans to reach an agreement that's
going to last five ten twenty hopefully

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270
going to last five ten twenty hopefully
 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.240
going to last five ten twenty hopefully
however many years into the future

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250
however many years into the future
 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.710
however many years into the future
I think the key there is to maybe put

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720
I think the key there is to maybe put
 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.469
I think the key there is to maybe put
more leverage on the Palestinians to get

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479
more leverage on the Palestinians to get
 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.780
more leverage on the Palestinians to get
Hamas to renounce terrorism to renounce

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790
Hamas to renounce terrorism to renounce
 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:13.740
Hamas to renounce terrorism to renounce
violence

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750
violence
 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.990
violence
as well as to accept Israel's right to

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000
as well as to accept Israel's right to
 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.500
as well as to accept Israel's right to
exist then I think we get a stronger

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510
exist then I think we get a stronger
 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.240
exist then I think we get a stronger
unity government amongst the

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250
unity government amongst the
 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.980
unity government amongst the
Palestinians that can actually then sit

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990
Palestinians that can actually then sit
 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.480
Palestinians that can actually then sit
down at the negotiating table with

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490
down at the negotiating table with
 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.340
down at the negotiating table with
Israel and then we can start worrying

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350
Israel and then we can start worrying
 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.140
Israel and then we can start worrying
about what the future actually looks

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150
about what the future actually looks
 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.280
about what the future actually looks
like and what's going to happen with the
