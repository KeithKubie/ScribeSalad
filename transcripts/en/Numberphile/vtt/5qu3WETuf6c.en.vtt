00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.829
So today I want to talk about John Nash

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.670
and John Nash is slightly unusual as a mathematician

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:06.629
because he's a mathematician

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.269
that is better known

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.790
to the public in general ; mathematicians

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.070
don't tend to be known in the public eye.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.130
He was the subject of a film called

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.619
A Beautiful Mind,  the film had Russell Crowe

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.439
in it starring as John Nash.

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.630
There's also a book a beautiful mind

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.050
that it was based on by Sylvia Nasar.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.189
I enjoyed the book more than the film.

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.349
The film is a little bit fictionalized.

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.600
I have to confess I haven't seen the film yet,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.059
I know I'm such a big film fan

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.160
I'm such a massive film nerd.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.440
I imagine it's absolutely accurate

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.670
in all respects

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.920
because that's how Hollywood works.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.480
You may have heard of him because of his

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.340
work in economics he won a Nobel Prize

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.590
for economics and that was for game

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.260
theory so he analyzed what are called

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.750
non zero sum games and he's known as

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.190
like a father of game theory one of the

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.480
pioneers of game theory.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.900
For a pure mathematician that was quite a simple

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.739
application of those things but the

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.900
really big deal was that he brought

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.049
those mathematical ideas into economics.

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.070
But he's really well-known among

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.960
mathematicians as well for some

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.760
serious pure math work that he did in a

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.400
subject called "Differential geometry".

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.630
Mathematicians do think that

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.810
actually his better work is his work in

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.390
geometry and partial differential

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.630
equations and so it was that work which

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.420
was then finally recognized when he got

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.540
the Abel Prize in 2015.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.240
Well the mathematician Mikhail Gromov

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.460
said that he thought that Nash's work in

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.409
differential geometry and on elliptic

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.360
partial differential equations was

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.189
orders of magnitude more important than

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.229
his work in game theory but of course

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.840
that's the point of view of a pure mathematician.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.760
So I want to talk about

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.980
why he won the Abel prize for his work in geometry.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.880
So if we cut off a bit of

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.360
square brown paper - and this is something

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.160
that is possibly well-known to some of you -

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.180
but this square of brown

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.799
paper, another way of thinking about this

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.350
square, if we add some rules, it's called a

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.600
flat torus. What are the rules ?

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.180
The rules are : if I'm traveling along this

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.040
paper here and I go off the right-hand side like that

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.200
I then reappear on the

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.939
left-hand side. If instead I was

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:24.250
traveling up the paper here and go off

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.329
the top, then I will reappear at

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:30.310
the bottom of the square piece of paper

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.740
(Brady) - It's like a game of asteroids.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.600
It's exactly like that, it's like a game of asteroids. The old computer games

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:38.709
used to get, particularly the game of

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.359
asteroids, where you'd go off the edge of

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.540
the universe and come out the other side.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.040
So this is a flat torus it's called.

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:48.730
Now there's something you can do with this

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.950
you can embed this - they call this -

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.780
you can embed this in three dimensions.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.100
This is two dimensions, this is a two-dimensional flat surface

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.099
but we can embed it in three dimensions by doing this.

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.220
So if I go off the right hand side

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.739
and reappear on the left then the

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.379
right and the left is the same

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.360
- we're calling that the same -

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.720
so let's glue them together and we make a cylinder.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.909
Can you see me there ? So we make a tube.

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:18.780
In the same way if I go off the top of this torus

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.879
I reappear at the bottom so the

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.769
top and the bottom are the same we can

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.449
join them together which is going to be

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:27.040
difficult to do with this piece of paper.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.440
If we join them together they would make

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.349
a doughnut shape like a classic

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.680
Homer Simpson style doughnut. It is going to be

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.790
difficult to do with this piece of

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.879
paper to show you then I've got

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.520
something I can use.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.579
We have the torus shape and for my

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.709
next trick here's a poodle so there's

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.229
our torus shape and that's what the

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:00.609
shape you want to make so if you play in

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.919
the game of asteroids this is actually

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.019
the universe that you're living on

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.090
you're actually living on the surface of

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.300
this universe.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.340
If in my universe I travel

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.159
let's say from top to bottom like that

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:18.519
or I compare that with traveling from

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.110
left to right like that

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.920
then if I wrap this up...

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.120
That's not quite perfect there - so if I wrap this up

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.080
this is me going round my cylinder

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.169
universe and if I can join the ends

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.090
of this tube I would make my torus shape.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.750
And on the actual torus itself the green

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.669
line would be me traveling around like

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.360
this through the hole and then back out

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.530
here joining up like that the red line

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.110
however would be traveling around this

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.620
universe like this.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.620
The squeaks are extra.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.340
So what I've done is I've turned this flat two-dimensional

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.740
shape into sit in three dimensions.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.640
So this is occupying a three dimensional space.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.620
There is one problem with this.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.500
You see in my square torus

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.360
this red line and this green line

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.419
they're the same length, right, because

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:34.479
it's square they're the same length.

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:38.380
When I've stretched it into this shape the

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.210
green line and the red line are no

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.270
longer the same length so there's the

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.919
green line going around you see this red

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:46.990
line is much longer now so I had to

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.630
stretch it to stretch around the tube.

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.780
Is there a way to embed a square torus

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.060
like that into our 3-dimensional world

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.490
- maybe it will be a different shape, it

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.919
might not look like this but can we do it

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:02.070
in such a way so that we preserve

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.750
distances so these lengths don't get

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.930
stretched and they all get the same

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.300
distances ? That's the question and it

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.900
looked like you couldn't do that.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.780
And why can't you do that ? Because this is

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.639
flat and the curvature

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:21.070
- let's talk about curvature -  it's a flat

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.180
object, it has zero curvature.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.240
Something like this is a curved object, it has

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.070
"positive curvature" we call it.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.169
So it looks like it's impossible, like

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:33.780
we can't embed something because it

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.370
would have a positive curvature and we

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.430
want it to keep its flat curvature.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.060
Problem. John Nash found a way to do it.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.360
Maybe he's slightly breaking the rules,

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.760
but he found a way to do it.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:53.240
And the method he found was, he was able to embed

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.860
the object and deform the object in such

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.200
a way that some points curvature had no meaning.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.720
Here's an example of the sort of

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:05.140
thing I mean. So imagine you're traveling

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.260
along the motorway at 100 miles per hour

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.820
You deaccelerate and then you

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.640
continue your journey at 30 miles per hour.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.360
So, that might be something that could happen.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.220
So this is speed, this is your speed

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.400
against time.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.340
Imagine if I drew that graph in a slightly

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:27.210
different way, very similar graph but I'm

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:28.680
going to draw it slightly differently.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.479
I still want the speed up here,

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.160
This is me traveling at 100 miles per hour

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.520
and the end result is

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.960
I'm going to be ending on 30 miles per hour

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.630
and then I'm going to join up these.

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.410
So they're very similar graphs.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.900
There is a difference between them.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.680
If we look at our acceleration,

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.800
here there's zero acceleration

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:55.740
you're travelling at a constant

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.690
speed 100 miles per hour

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.300
there's zero acceleration or the

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.260
gradient of the graph is zero.

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:06.180
Here, the acceleration might be let's call it

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:09.210
minus 10 and then here it's it's zero again

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.620
You're at a constant speed.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:16.139
Now with that graph at this point here and

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:20.000
at this point here acceleration isn't defined,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.520
acceleration has no meaning here.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.349
What you've done - you've gone from zero

00:08:25.349 --> 00:08:29.280
acceleration suddenly, at an instant

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.580
to minus ten and then suddenly again to

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:33.080
zero

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.240
And at that point here and at

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.130
that point there there is no meaning to

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:38.870
what the acceleration is.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:42.110
You've gone from 0 to  -10 to 0.

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.960
Now speed is defined, we know what the speed is here

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.840
that's no problem, the speed is

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:49.010
100 miles per hour there and 30 miles

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:50.510
per hour there. No problem with the speed

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:53.660
but the acceleration isn't defined.

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.740
With this curve - very similar

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.740
that's not a problem here :

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:03.120
acceleration is defined for every point on this curve.

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.660
(Brady) - This one's the real world one isn't it ?

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.600
- Yeah exactly that's real world , I agree

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.900
And so this is maybe... you're taking some

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.100
more abstract look at what you're doing.

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:14.980
It works the same in geometry :

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:17.620
if you have something like this then

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:20.390
curvature is defined everywhere here.

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:22.460
If we instead made that sort of shape

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.740
like a hook, if you made that

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:29.290
shape with a straight edge followed by a

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:32.660
semicircle, like that, then here the

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.400
curvature is flat flat flat flat

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.460
suddenly here it's positive and at this

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:40.760
point where you join on, curvature has no meaning

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.100
There's no definition for curvature there.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:46.040
What Nash was able to do was :

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.620
he was able to find a way to embed

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:52.370
your square flat torus into the 3d world

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.190
and there are some points like that

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:57.360
where the curvature isn't defined.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.290
You can take your flat torus and then you

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:02.840
can embed it in the 3d world and you

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.400
embed it in such a way so maybe

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.230
something like that you can embed it in

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:09.080
such a way that the distances are a

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.870
bit short so that your map,

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.940
your deformation, your distances

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.250
have become a bit shortened.

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.400
All the distances have become a bit shortened.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.280
Then we're going to

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.840
lengthen a little bit, we're going to hit

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.740
this object with waves

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.300
this is going to ripple across the surface of

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.620
this object, waves, and those waves

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:33.460
will ripple across - they're called corrugations -

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.520
and they will lengthen all those

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:39.260
distances slightly. And you hit it with

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.780
another set of waves, those waves are a

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:43.770
bit smaller, so smaller ripples.

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:45.780
But then we're getting closer to the

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.550
lengths again we're getting a bit closer

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:50.480
to what the correct lengths are.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.100
And then you hit them with another set of waves

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.480
and we get a little bit closer again to

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.940
what the correct distances should be and

00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:00.690
you keep doing that and then you get an

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:03.120
object which is full of these

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.910
corrugations but all the lengths are the

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:08.580
correct lengths as they were in the

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.740
original flat torus.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.240
(Brady) - Are you saying by

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.700
making the surface bumpy this green line

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.070
has to travel further closer to what the

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:18.660
red line is traveling ?

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.000
- Yes a shortened distance like this green line

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
would get lengthened so it becomes

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.230
the same as this red line around the

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.690
outside of the torus so they become the

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.420
same length again like they where in the

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.030
original flat torus, like they should be.

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:38.160
What Nash was doing, he was studying

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.640
this kind of thing and he was actually

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.920
doing it more abstractly more general

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.210
terms and he was do it in higher

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:48.090
dimensions so much more abstract

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:50.100
mathematics but this would be an

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.180
application of what Nash was doing,

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:53.640
this work in geometry.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.300
When he was doing this work,

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.090
his solutions involved these

00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:59.880
things called partial differential equations.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.700
That's about the rate of change of things :

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.600
the rate of change of curvature

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.760
the rate of change of speed...

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.440
Using these equations... His methods for solving

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:15.450
these equations were so innovative that

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:18.260
not only are they useful in geometry

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.690
they turned out to be useful

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:25.440
in the topic of partial differential

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:29.820
equations itself as its own subject.

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:33.390
That is why Nash got the Abel Prize for

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.430
his work in geometry and partial

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:37.020
differential equations.

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.180
That's right of course his life story is

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:43.460
interesting to all of us because of his

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:47.090
of his mental illness and the fact the

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:48.770
remarkable fact that he recovered from it

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:50.780
to become an active mathematician again

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:53.240
but really his mathematics is

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.900
what's going to last.
