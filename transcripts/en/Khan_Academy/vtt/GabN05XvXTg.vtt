00:00:00.906 --> 00:00:02.675
- [Instructor] The graph of y is equal to

00:00:02.675 --> 00:00:07.124
the absolute value of x is
reflected across the x-axis

00:00:07.124 --> 00:00:11.291
and then compressed
vertically by a factor of 8/3.

00:00:12.281 --> 00:00:15.521
What is the equation of the new graph?

00:00:15.521 --> 00:00:18.769
All right, so let's think
about this step-by-step.

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:20.835
If I start, and I'm just going to draw

00:00:20.835 --> 00:00:24.109
some quick hand-drawn sketches here.

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:25.866
So that's my x-axis.

00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.366
That is my y-axis.

00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:31.606
If we're talking about the graph of

00:00:31.606 --> 00:00:34.077
y is equal to the absolute value of x,

00:00:34.077 --> 00:00:36.415
that looks like this.

00:00:36.415 --> 00:00:39.371
In the first quadrant,
it looks like y equals x,

00:00:39.371 --> 00:00:41.393
and in the second quadrant,

00:00:41.393 --> 00:00:44.668
it looks like y equals negative x,

00:00:44.668 --> 00:00:46.557
'cause the absolute value
of a negative number

00:00:46.557 --> 00:00:48.196
is its opposite.

00:00:48.196 --> 00:00:49.449
So let me make it look a little bit more

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.163
symmetric than that.

00:00:51.163 --> 00:00:53.289
So it looks something,

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:55.468
something like that.

00:00:55.468 --> 00:00:57.909
That's what the graph of y is equal to the

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:00.709
absolute value of x looks like.

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:03.326
Now, they're asking us
to do what amounts to

00:01:03.326 --> 00:01:05.852
two different transformations.

00:01:05.852 --> 00:01:09.269
The first one is they want to reflect it.

00:01:10.476 --> 00:01:13.863
They want to reflect across the x-axis,

00:01:13.863 --> 00:01:17.853
so they want us to flip it
across the x-axis like this.

00:01:17.853 --> 00:01:21.173
So instead, it looks like this.

00:01:21.173 --> 00:01:25.340
So that graph, that equation
that describes this graph,

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.955
well, this is going to be the opposite.

00:01:28.955 --> 00:01:30.934
Whatever y you were getting
on this orange graph,

00:01:30.934 --> 00:01:32.882
you're going to get the negative of that.

00:01:32.882 --> 00:01:35.141
You're going to get y
is equal to the negative

00:01:35.141 --> 00:01:37.555
of the absolute value of x.

00:01:37.555 --> 00:01:40.756
If this doesn't make intuitive
sense to you, try it out.

00:01:40.756 --> 00:01:44.923
In the orange graph, when x
is equal to, let's say, two,

00:01:46.647 --> 00:01:49.206
well the absolute value of two is two.

00:01:49.206 --> 00:01:52.343
The absolute value of negative two is two.

00:01:52.343 --> 00:01:54.974
Now, we want to take the absolute value

00:01:54.974 --> 00:01:56.533
but then take the negative of it.

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:59.501
This thing stays
non-positive the entire time,

00:01:59.501 --> 00:02:01.593
so the absolute value of two is two,

00:02:01.593 --> 00:02:03.566
but we want the opposite of that.

00:02:03.566 --> 00:02:04.914
We want negative two.

00:02:04.914 --> 00:02:07.111
Absolute value of negative two is two,

00:02:07.111 --> 00:02:10.085
but we want the opposite of that.

00:02:10.085 --> 00:02:13.326
They didn't ask us to just
reflect across the x-axis.

00:02:13.326 --> 00:02:16.647
They then want us to compress vertically

00:02:16.647 --> 00:02:18.993
by a factor of 8/3.

00:02:18.993 --> 00:02:20.706
So let's think about this a little bit.

00:02:20.706 --> 00:02:24.465
Compress vertically by a factor of 8/3.

00:02:24.465 --> 00:02:27.835
If they said stretch
vertically by a factor of 8/3,

00:02:27.835 --> 00:02:30.752
then I would just multiply this by 8/3.

00:02:30.752 --> 00:02:32.118
Sometimes it's helpful to think of this

00:02:32.118 --> 00:02:33.613
in terms of a mixed number.

00:02:33.613 --> 00:02:37.941
8/3 is the same thing as 2 2/3.

00:02:37.941 --> 00:02:42.108
If you were to stretch by 2
2/3, you would get taller.

00:02:45.002 --> 00:02:47.327
It would get something like this.

00:02:47.327 --> 00:02:49.181
If you are compressing,

00:02:49.181 --> 00:02:51.672
then it's going to look
something like this.

00:02:51.672 --> 00:02:53.140
If you're compressing vertically,

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.805
you can think about it as
being stretched horizontally.

00:02:56.805 --> 00:02:59.671
If you're compressing by a factor,

00:02:59.671 --> 00:03:02.492
you should multiply by the
reciprocal of that factor.

00:03:02.492 --> 00:03:04.962
Think about it, if you
were compressing by three,

00:03:04.962 --> 00:03:07.994
you would multiply by one-third.

00:03:07.994 --> 00:03:11.433
If you were compressing vertically by 8/3,

00:03:11.433 --> 00:03:14.352
that means whatever y
you would have gotten,

00:03:14.352 --> 00:03:17.442
you multiply that times
a reciprocal of 8/3.

00:03:17.442 --> 00:03:18.848
Another way you could think about it,

00:03:18.848 --> 00:03:21.623
you could divide that by 8/3.

00:03:21.623 --> 00:03:25.373
If we want to get this
thing right over here,

00:03:26.812 --> 00:03:30.060
this is going to be y is equal to

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.873
the negative absolute value of x.

00:03:32.873 --> 00:03:35.033
Since we're compressing by 8/3,

00:03:35.033 --> 00:03:37.584
we would divide that by 8/3.

00:03:37.584 --> 00:03:39.206
Another way to think about it,

00:03:39.206 --> 00:03:40.591
dividing by 8/34 is the same thing

00:03:40.591 --> 00:03:42.413
as multiplying by the reciprocal.

00:03:42.413 --> 00:03:47.340
So negative 3/8 times
the absolute value of x.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.621
When we look at our
choices, we see that it is

00:03:51.621 --> 00:03:54.182
that choice right over there.

00:03:54.182 --> 00:03:55.508
I really want to stress this point,

00:03:55.508 --> 00:03:58.034
because I think it can get
a little bit confusing.

00:03:58.034 --> 00:04:01.261
The reason why I multiplied
that by the reciprocal,

00:04:01.261 --> 00:04:04.060
they were saying compressing vertically.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.343
If we said stretching vertically,

00:04:05.343 --> 00:04:07.222
we would just multiply by 8/3,

00:04:07.222 --> 00:04:08.433
but since we're compressing,

00:04:08.433 --> 00:04:12.600
we would divide by 8/3 or
multiply by its reciprocal.
