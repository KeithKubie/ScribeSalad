00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.500
So, today I'm going to tell you about
what's called Catalan's conjecture.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.700
So even though it's called a conjecture,
it's actually known,

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.420
so this was proved by a mathematician
about 15 years ago.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.320
And it's a question about,
or a statement about,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.600
perfect powers, okay?

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.740
So... What do I mean
by perfect powers, first of all?

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.360
I mean, take some whole number -
1, 2, 3, so on -

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.960
and raise it to a power which is larger than 1, okay,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.949
so squares, cubes and so on.

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:29.840
So if you start to write these things down, 1 is a perfect power, in fact a power of itself to any exponent,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.940
2 is not, 3 is not,

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.069
But then we get 4, which is 2 squared. Then we have to go up to I guess 8, which is 2 cubed, and

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.099
9 is 3 squared, and

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.920
16, 25

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.549
Am I gonna run into any cube soon? Let's see Oh 27 and

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.700
36 and

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.260
49 and so on

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.500
- so these are numbers that can be built by taking two integers and raising one to the power of another? -that's exactly right

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.829
Yeah, so of course all we've seen so far mostly squares and cubes

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.000
I guess 16 is also a fourth power

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.760
But you can take the exponent to be as large as you want, raise it as high of a power as you want, and you

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.169
Can take the number to be as large as you want to. I'm just trying to put them in order. -so do these numbers become

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.799
More common or less common as we go down the number line? -so they become less common and generally you think they're spread out right,

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.580
like just think about squares for example if you hand me a big number like a million and you want to know

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.920
"about how many squares are less than a million?" well,

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.979
It's about square root of a million right because that's how small the number has to be

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.979
To be less than a million after you square it. they're cool numbers

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.409
They're kind of spread out as you go along and get bigger and bigger

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.469
But notice that in the beginning here some of them are close together, so we've got actually a pair of consecutive

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.249
Powers, so separated only by one, I guess here

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.220
We have separated by two and three and four and so on so there's some separation here

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.829
But what Catalan conjectured and this is a question people have been interested in for hundreds of years actually is

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.009
this

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.519
particular pair of eight and nine so the fact that

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.849
Three squared minus two cubed is equal to one or  really that you have any two powers which differ by one

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.470
No other example of that was known and so what Catalan conjectured is that

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:20.109
this is the only time that this happens that you have two powers whose difference is exactly one

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.990
But it was unknown if like a gajillion and four

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.810
Yeah, that's exactly right

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.379
so we didn't know for a long time whether or not this conjecture was true so back a few decades ago

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.049
We did know that if it wasn't true there would be only finitely many exceptions

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.979
So this tends to be easier to show in general right that okay?

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.230
I know that there's a really large number of things happening or only finitely many times it happens

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.730
But to show that there's only one is what we didn't know until recently so it's known

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.599
Yes, so this is what was proved by this mathematician MihÄƒilescu. In fact,

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.909
These are the only consecutive perfect powers, okay, so this notion that okay?

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.249
They probably kind of spread out as time goes on is it least true if spreading out means bigger than one

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.010
I mean the proof of this is really advanced and so okay

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.879
We don't have time for I don't know the next couple of years to go through it

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.139
but I want to tell you at least about sort of a special case of this and

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.880
Something that's been known for a while

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.610
But it gives you an idea of kind of the type of manipulation you can do to understand this kind of problem. all right,

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.689
So solving this equation showing that there's only one solution and that's it

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.470
is pretty hard

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.029
But let me show you a special case: let's look at the case of x squared minus

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.830
Y cubed equals one so for example that has some solution

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.859
We know because we have these consecutive powers, so we're really just asking about a square differing from a cube by one okay

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.860
So why doesn't this have any other solutions?

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:53.320
Well, here's what you want to do: general rule adding and understanding factors at the same time is hard

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.570
That's why Fermat's Last Theorem is hard, that's why this kind of question is hard. So let's change it to a question about multiplication.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.930
All right, so how do we do that? Let's move things to the other side, so let's say instead

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.450
We're gonna solve this equation.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.799
Now why have I just made my life better? The reason why is because this thing breaks up into two factors

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:18.939
Any time you see a difference of squares like this, you can factorize it in this way, and so

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:22.929
this just changes from a very hard problem about addition and multiplication

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.859
interacting together to just multiplication. Okay, so now why is this better? Why do I find out whether or not this has solutions?

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:32.829
Here's the idea: the factors of Y.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:42.009
Any number that divides y has gotta divide one of these two things and so let's ignore two for the moment

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:44.739
Let's pretend that Y is odd, so two doesn't divide Y

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.620
So if Y is odd that means then that any factor of y has to divide one of these two things

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:57.190
But it can't divide both of them at once and the reason why is that whatever these two numbers are, they differ only by two

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.779
So for the same reason they can't have a common factor other than possibly two.

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:04.899
so if Y is odd all the factors of Y either

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.539
divide X minus one or a factor of Y divides X plus one, but not both at the same time

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:17.589
Which means that both of these numbers have to be cubes. So these are both cubes because any number which divides Y

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.810
We know there's at least three copies of

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:25.209
But all of those copies have to go to the same one of these two numbers, and so we've got two cubes

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.150
Which are only two apart.

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.569
Right so the difference between these two cubes is only two,

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.339
but that never happens with cubes, right, because we know what the cubes are 1 8

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.299
27 and so on and that for sure

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.440
spreads out as you go along and so you can't have any cubes which are separated by two

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.549
And so you can't have any solution to this equation (at least if Y is odd).  -What if Y is even?

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:52.749
Well then it's a little bit harder, but not that much -You haven't done the whole proof

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:03.069
No, so in general of course the proof is not via this plan although changing from addition to multiplication is the important part of

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:05.529
the proof actually. An important part of the proof.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:12.099
But this is just sort of the smallest tiniest piece the step in the right direction towards proving this kind of thing.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.630
Hi everyone thanks for watching this video, I'm just working on

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:25.419
Brilliant's problem of the week, which triangle has the greatest area. I can't decide if this is a trick question or

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:29.288
do they have the same area let me get 4c ah

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.379
It says it's okay. I got it wrong, but it says here

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:38.498
And this is true getting stumped is part of learning and now we get to continue and discuss the solutions

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:44.709
Yeah, see I probably should have done better working out like that person did, but you know we're recording here in a hurry now

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.879
Brilliant dog is a fantastic problem-solving website

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:53.769
It's also the sponsor of today's video in case you hadn't noticed and the thing I like about brilliant is

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:59.169
it's full of all sorts of quizzes and courses and curated lessons that doesn't just

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:04.628
Tell you stuff so that you'll know it it helps you understand that it helps you go deeper

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:09.938
And I think that's a really important thing you can watch loads of videos and learn lots of new things but to really

00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:15.819
Understand that sometimes you actually have to do the problems have someone hold your hand as you go through it

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:19.748
And that's what's great about brilliant. They obviously cover loads of mathematics

00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:25.179
They also cover science. They also cover computer science. There's physics. There's all sorts of things here

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:29.079
You really should have a look by the way if you enjoyed today's video with Holly

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:34.899
I'm told the open problems group here on brilliant could also be a great place for you to be hanging out

00:07:34.899 --> 00:07:36.159
So what are you going to have a look at that?

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:41.499
I'll include a link down in the video description now while I get back into these triangles and figure things out

00:07:41.689 --> 00:07:47.889
What you should do is go to brilliant org slash numberphile you can sign up to brilliant for free?

00:07:47.889 --> 00:07:51.278
But if you use the slash numberphile, I just mentioned and there'll be a link in the description

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:57.729
You'll also get 20% off a premium membership go and have a look and don't just get told stuff

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:00.469
understand stuff

00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:02.469
There is a difference
