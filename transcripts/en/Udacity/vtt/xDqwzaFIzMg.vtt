00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.990
You may have seen a picture of DNA before

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.620
shaped like this. That's called a chromosome, a mix

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.320
of DNA and protein. If you look closer, you'll

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.470
see that the protein serves as a scaffold for the

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.830
DNA to wrap around and fold into a superstructure.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.930
Although DNA is very long. It's so thin that we're

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.470
going to need more than one molecule if we want to be able to see it. If we get

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.110
enough starting material, we should be able to see the DNA even with our

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.400
crude home made extraction. So, let's go and see what we've got in the kitchen.
