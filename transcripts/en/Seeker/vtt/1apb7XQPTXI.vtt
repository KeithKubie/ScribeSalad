00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.210
YOU GUYS I HAD THE WEIRDEST DREAM LAST NIGHT...AND
YOU WERE THERE...AND YOU WERE THERE...WHAT'S

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.210
THAT?

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.000
YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
YOU SURE?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
CAUSE ...OKAY.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
HI GUYS THIS IS ANNIE FOR DNEWS.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
DO YOU HAVE ANY RECURRING DREAMS THAT YOU
SEEM TO HAVE ALL THE TIME?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.470
OR DREAMS THAT YOU WAKE UP FROM THINKING,
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT ABOUT?

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.330
I DREAM ABOUT MY TEETH A LOT, AND TURNS OUT
THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST COMMON ONES.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.670
SOME OTHERS ARE BEING NAKED IN PUBLIC...BEING
UNABLE TO SPEAK...BEING CHASED...BEING LATE

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:29.880
TO THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.750
MANY OF THESE ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ANXIETY
- THAT DREAM YOU HAVE ABOUT FAILING A TEST,

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.660
FOR EXAMPLE, THAT'S OFTEN INTERPRETED AS FEELING
UNPREPARED FOR SOMETHING, OR EXPOSED.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.380
BUT WHY ARE CERTAIN RECURRING DREAMS SO COMMON,
AND WHAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO INTERPRET THEM?

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.980
THAT'S A QUESTION THAT'S BEEN STUDIED FOR
AGES

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.710
IN GREECE, DREAMS WERE THOUGHT OF AS OMENS
THAT COULD PREDICT EVENTS.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.940
IN EGYPT, THEY WERE ALSO CONSIDERED LINKS
TO THE SUPERNATURAL WORLD.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.760
AND MANY MODERN THEORIES ORIGINATED WITH SIGMUND
FREUD, WHO SAW THEM AS WISH FULFILLMENT...THAT

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:05.220
HAVE A SYSTEM OF SYMBOLS THAT REPRESENT THE
SAME THINGS FOR ALMOST EVERYONE...APPLES....SNAKES....GUNS...ELEVATORS...THEY

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.220
ALL MEAN SEX.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.000
MORE RECENTLY, A THEORY CALLED ACTIVATION
SYNTHESIS CLAIMS THAT DREAMS DON'T REALLY

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.720
MEAN ANYTHING...THEY'RE JUST ELECTRICAL IMPULSES
THAT PULL RANDOM STUFF FROM OUR MEMORIES.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.600
DREAMS ARE TOUGH TO STUDY PARTLY BECAUSE WE
OFTEN DON'T REMEMBER THEM.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.580
BUT ONE TEAM FROM JAPAN TRIED TO RECORD DREAM
VISUALS BY WAKING PEOPLE UP DURING DREAM PHASES

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.500
AND ASKING THEM TO DESCRIBE THEIR DREAMS.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.470
OF THE 200 REPORTS THEY COLLECTED, THEY FOUND
THAT MOST OF THEM WERE ACTUALLY KIND OF BORING...ORDINARY

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.890
STUFF, WITH THE OCCASIONAL FORAY INTO THE
BIZARRE STUFF.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.210
THEN THEY CATEGORIZED THE VISUALS...MAN, WOMAN,
CAR, COMPUTER, STREET.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.119
AND WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT WHEN THEY SHOWED
THE DREAMERS IMAGES OF THOSE THINGS LATER,

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.010
THE BRAIN ACTIVITY WAS EXTREMELY SIMILAR TO
WHAT IT WAS IN THE DREAM STATE.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.439
MEANING WE "WATCH" OUR DREAMS THE SAME WAY
WE DO REAL LIFE EVENTS.

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.590
AND BASED ON THOSE BRAIN SCANS, THE SCIENTISTS
WERE ABLE TO PREDICT WHAT PEOPLE WERE VISUALIZING

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.920
DURING THEIR DREAMS WITH 75 - 80% ACCURACY.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.920
CRAZY RIGHT?

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.640
WE SPEND ABOUT 2 HOURS OF EVERY NIGHT DREAMING,
AND ALTHOUGH THEY'RE STILL NOT THAT WELL UNDERSTOOD

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.420
- WE DO KNOW THAT DREAMS ARE IMPORTANT FOR
MEMORY.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.470
MOST DREAMS HAPPEN DURING REM SLEEP, WHICH
IS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTION OF PROTEINS

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.840
AND THE RETENTION OF MENTAL SKILLS, AMONG
OTHER THINGS.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.709
SO AS FOR THOSE RECURRING DREAMS...MIGHT AS
WELL EMBRACE THEM, BECAUSE THEY'RE NORMAL,

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:13.709
AND PROBABLY GOOD FOR YOU.

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.840

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.239

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.500
DO YOU HAVE RECURRING DREAMS OR NIGHTMARES?

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.040
WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY MEAN FOR YOU?
