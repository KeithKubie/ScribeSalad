00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.390
The highest level of guarantee, also the one that's hardest to provide,

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.610
is called the quality of service guarantee.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.380
In these guarantees, non-functional requirements are addressed,

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.160
such as availability, mean time between failures,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.810
mean time to repair, throughput, latency, data integrity, and capacity.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.870
Such an example of such a guarantee would be that the component operates with

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:27.353
a throughput of some number of transactions given in a, in a given time period.
