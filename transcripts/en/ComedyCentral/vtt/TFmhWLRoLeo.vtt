00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:03.603
This Bitcoin look
is patent leather,

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:06.639
for my impending patent.
I am Bitcoin, baby. Yeah.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.210
Okay. Can I help you
with something?

00:00:11.677 --> 00:00:16.049
Try to keep up, Brad.
Meet phone wigs.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.054
We've got the Ross,
we've got the Rachel.

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:25.658
Going over here to the Lincoln,
classic Abbey, little Jaime,

00:00:26.592 --> 00:00:28.394
this time I shit myself,
don't ask,

00:00:28.427 --> 00:00:31.531
and Bernadette Peters, bitch.

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:33.299
These are phone cases?

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.636
Brad, I'm sorry.
I can't go any slower, okay?

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:39.705
Phone wigs are a 21st century
cultural phenomenon.

00:00:39.738 --> 00:00:42.675
In an age where technology
divides and isolates us,

00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:46.279
phone wigs give us the chance
to feel comforted;

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:48.181
to connect and humanize.

00:00:49.348 --> 00:00:54.788
And that ... Look at me.
That's the pieces of my wizness.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.625
Wizness.

00:00:59.658 --> 00:01:03.463
My wizness. Wizness!

00:01:27.753 --> 00:01:30.223
Hey, hey, we found
the sweatshirt.

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:31.691
Oh my gosh!

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:34.360
Someone saw it on the news
and brought it back.

00:01:34.393 --> 00:01:36.463
Thank you so much.

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:39.198
I'm so sorry
I've been telling everyone

00:01:39.231 --> 00:01:40.867
I pass by
to boycott this place.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.869
You did what?

00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:45.138
No, I'm kidding. Prank.

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:48.341
Please don't come back here.
You're a bad person.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.220
Hey, sir. You should have this.

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:03.222
What the (beep) is this?

00:02:03.255 --> 00:02:04.390
It's a sweatshirt.

00:02:04.423 --> 00:02:05.758
It's actually
a vintage sweatshirt

00:02:05.791 --> 00:02:08.294
with, like, the perfect amount
of wear, so ...

00:02:08.327 --> 00:02:12.665
MICA? I don't want this shit.
I went to RISD.

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:16.469
It's too hot out here.
I can't wear synthetics.

00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:20.540
Okay. I am sorry. Great.
I'm sorry.

00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:30.883
Okay.

00:02:30.916 --> 00:02:35.188
You found your Bitcoin number
on an old fruit by the foot.

00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:36.422
Yeah.

00:02:36.455 --> 00:02:37.723
... that you remember
that I gave you

00:02:37.756 --> 00:02:39.525
for a Waka Flocka
Flame ticket.

00:02:39.558 --> 00:02:40.693
Yeah.

00:02:40.726 --> 00:02:43.262
And you want to cash out
that money today

00:02:43.295 --> 00:02:45.865
to get a patent
for these phone wigs?

00:02:45.898 --> 00:02:49.936
Choo Gots! Finally.
It took long enough, my Brad.

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:51.904
Now, give me the loot.
Give me the loot.

00:02:51.937 --> 00:02:53.940
You could learn how
to communicate better.

00:02:53.973 --> 00:02:55.174
Rude.

00:02:55.208 --> 00:03:01.181
Anyway. $8265 dollars has been
transferred to your account.

00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:04.250
Yes! The internet
is my forking God.

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:07.754
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:12.491
Come on, now. Come on. Grow up.
What are you, 26 now?

00:03:12.524 --> 00:03:13.859
I'm 27.

00:03:13.892 --> 00:03:17.363
What are you, like a hot,
ripped, uncut 50 year old?

00:03:17.396 --> 00:03:18.531
47.

00:03:18.564 --> 00:03:21.334
Okay, fine. I just mean that
we had sex when I was 21.

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:22.936
That's gross.
You grow up, maybe.

00:03:23.902 --> 00:03:26.439
Okay. That's fair.

00:03:26.472 --> 00:03:28.541
But I was going through
a divorce then,

00:03:28.974 --> 00:03:32.545
and I was in a really insecure
place. And

00:03:32.578 --> 00:03:36.883
having sex with someone younger
boosted my self esteem a little.

00:03:37.616 --> 00:03:38.717
Oh.

00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:41.454
I mean, I'm in an age-
appropriate relationship now.

00:03:41.487 --> 00:03:43.756
That's really ... Good, good for
you.

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:47.026
Yeah. Her name's Marie and I
think you'd really like her.

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:49.028
Okay. That's cool. You're cool.

00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:51.497
You're good.
It was great to see you.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.932
Good.

00:03:52.965 --> 00:03:54.300
So long.

00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:55.701
Phone wigs.

00:03:55.734 --> 00:03:59.372
No more Bitcoin!
No more Bitcoin!

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:00.673
Jesus, it's hot out now.

00:04:00.706 --> 00:04:02.575
No more Bitcoin!
No more Bitcoin!

00:04:02.608 --> 00:04:03.776
Who this? Yes.

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:05.478
What are we
protesting today, huh?

00:04:05.511 --> 00:04:07.913
Bitcoin, because
it's killing the Earth.

00:04:07.946 --> 00:04:09.715
But what? It's paperless.

00:04:09.748 --> 00:04:10.849
Oh, you know.

00:04:10.883 --> 00:04:14.887
Bitcoin has to be mined
by thousands of computers 24/7.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.622
It's a huge waste of energy

00:04:16.655 --> 00:04:18.891
because of all
the servers it's using,

00:04:18.924 --> 00:04:20.960
and it's the pedophiles'
currency of choice.

00:04:20.993 --> 00:04:22.328
Oh, it is?

00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:24.297
Fueling the child sex trade
industry

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.565
and dominating
the illegal arms world.

00:04:26.598 --> 00:04:27.800
No more Bitcoin!
No more Bitcoin!

00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:29.001
Is it hot out to you?

00:04:29.034 --> 00:04:30.603
Well, you can thank Bitcoin
for that,

00:04:30.636 --> 00:04:32.438
because it's contributing
to climate change.

00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:36.376
So, you're feeling the effects.
Bitcoin is killing the earth!

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:40.646
Totally killing the earth!
Good luck with your protest.

00:04:40.679 --> 00:04:42.648
No more Bitcoin!

00:04:42.681 --> 00:04:44.417
Okay, so be honest.

00:04:45.117 --> 00:04:47.053
Do I have to donate
that eight thousand dollars?

00:04:47.086 --> 00:04:48.054
I know Bitcoin is evil,

00:04:48.087 --> 00:04:50.456
but it's like,
no more evil than paper money.

00:04:50.489 --> 00:04:52.591
It's like also, like,
what about eating meat?

00:04:52.624 --> 00:04:55.761
The meat industry is the biggest
contributor to climate change.

00:04:55.794 --> 00:04:56.962
I mean, way more than Bitcoin.

00:04:56.995 --> 00:04:58.564
Do you know that the fashion
industry

00:04:58.597 --> 00:05:00.366
burns the remainders
of its clothes

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:02.335
at the end of every season
to retain its value?

00:05:02.368 --> 00:05:04.403
Mountains of clothes on fire.

00:05:04.436 --> 00:05:07.373
Yeah, not to mention that it's
all made by little children.

00:05:07.873 --> 00:05:09.342
You know recycling
is a (bleep)ing hoax.

00:05:09.375 --> 00:05:11.377
Are you really scrubbing out
my udong containers

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.646
and peeling the labels off
and melting the plastic down

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:15.748
to reform them
into new udong containers?

00:05:15.781 --> 00:05:18.551
Oh, dude.
Garbage island is real.

00:05:18.584 --> 00:05:21.654
Mother earth is like
(screaming).

00:05:21.687 --> 00:05:23.756
And we're like, "No, bitch.
Die, bitch." It's awful.

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:24.957
Yeah.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.126
Why is the news not covering
this 24/7?

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:29.729
Don't even get me
started on the news.

00:05:29.762 --> 00:05:34.900
The news is like, like, the news
is like, "Hey guys, hey,

00:05:34.933 --> 00:05:37.670
maybe focus on, like, important
issues like recycling

00:05:37.703 --> 00:05:40.373
instead of latching
on to some stupid,

00:05:40.406 --> 00:05:43.109
but really understandable ...
layout issues on flyers?

00:05:43.142 --> 00:05:44.510
Like, what?"

00:05:44.543 --> 00:05:46.512
Yeah. What?

00:05:46.545 --> 00:05:50.750
Also, we are being listened
to all the time.

00:05:50.783 --> 00:05:53.152
Anything that we do
on social media for free,

00:05:53.185 --> 00:05:55.121
we pay for through
our experience.

00:05:55.154 --> 00:05:56.923
We are just data.

00:05:58.123 --> 00:06:00.426
Oh, I feel so much better.
Thank you so much.

00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:01.660
Yeah.

00:06:01.693 --> 00:06:02.628
Oh, my god.
