00:00:14.768 --> 00:00:17.152
Literary critic Northrop Frye once observed

00:00:17.152 --> 00:00:22.368
that in our primitive days, our literary heroes were -- well, nearly gods,

00:00:22.368 --> 00:00:26.519
and as civilization advanced, they came down the mountain of the gods, so to speak,

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.636
and became more human, more flawed, less heroic.

00:00:32.636 --> 00:00:35.101
From the divine heroes like Hercules,

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:40.120
down the mountain below the miraculous but mortal heroes such as Beowulf,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.487
the great leaders such as King Arthur,

00:00:42.487 --> 00:00:47.186
and the great but flawed heroes like Macbeth or Othello.

00:00:47.186 --> 00:00:51.987
Below even the unlikely but eventual heroes such as Harry Potter,

00:00:51.987 --> 00:00:54.919
Luke Skywalker, or Hiccup,

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:59.252
until we reach the bottom and meet the anti-hero.

00:00:59.252 --> 00:01:04.087
Contrary to the sound, the anti-hero is not the villain, not the antagonist.

00:01:04.087 --> 00:01:08.451
The anti-hero is actually the main character in some contemporary works of literature.

00:01:08.451 --> 00:01:13.470
Guy Montag in "Fahrenheit 451," Winston Smith in "1984,"

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.871
who unwittingly ends up challenging those in power -- that is,

00:01:16.917 --> 00:01:24.769
those who abuse their power to brainwash the populace to believe that the ills of society have been eliminated.

00:01:24.769 --> 00:01:30.501
Ideally, those who challenge the establishment should be wise, confident, brave,

00:01:30.501 --> 00:01:34.802
physically strong, with a type of charisma that inpires followers.

00:01:34.802 --> 00:01:40.018
The anti-hero, however, at best demonstrates a few underdeveloped traits,

00:01:40.018 --> 00:01:42.569
at worst, is totally inept.

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:48.552
The story of the anti-hero usually unfolds something like this.

00:01:48.552 --> 00:01:52.837
The anti-hero initially conforms, ignorantly accepting the established views,

00:01:52.837 --> 00:01:57.886
a typical, unquestioning, brainwashed member of society.

00:01:57.886 --> 00:02:01.786
The anti-hero struggles to conform, all the while starting to object,

00:02:01.786 --> 00:02:05.537
perhaps finding other outsiders with whom to voice his questions,

00:02:05.537 --> 00:02:12.651
and naÃ¯vely, unwisely, sharing those questions with an authority figure.

00:02:12.651 --> 00:02:15.069
The anti-hero openly challenges society,

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.269
and tries to fight against the lies and tactics used to oppress the populace.

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:26.102
This step, for the anti-hero, is seldom a matter of brave, wise and heroic opposition.

00:02:26.102 --> 00:02:30.653
Maybe the anti-hero fights and succeeds in destroying the oppressive government,

00:02:30.653 --> 00:02:33.386
with a lot of impossible luck.

00:02:33.386 --> 00:02:38.185
Perhaps he or she runs away, escapes to fight another day.

00:02:38.185 --> 00:02:43.319
All too often though, the anti-hero is killed, or brainwashed

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.969
to return to conformity with the masses.

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:52.451
No heroic triumph here, no brave individual standing up against impersonal institutions of a modern world,

00:02:52.451 --> 00:03:01.786
inspiring others to fight, or resourcefully outwitting and outgunning the massive army of the evil empire.

00:03:01.786 --> 00:03:05.552
Our storytelling ancestors calmed our fears of powerlessness

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:10.618
by giving us Hercules and other heroes strong enough to fight off the demons and monsters

00:03:10.618 --> 00:03:14.935
that we suspected haunted the night beyond our campfires.

00:03:14.935 --> 00:03:19.152
But eventually, we realized the monsters did not lie out there,

00:03:19.152 --> 00:03:22.685
they reside inside of us.

00:03:22.685 --> 00:03:25.951
Beowulf's greatest enemy was mortality.

00:03:25.951 --> 00:03:28.136
Othello's, jealousy.

00:03:28.136 --> 00:03:30.636
Hiccup, self-doubt.

00:03:30.636 --> 00:03:36.168
And in the tales of the ineffectual anti-hero, in the stories of Guy Montag and Winston Smith,

00:03:36.168 --> 00:03:41.518
lie the warnings of contemporary storytellers playing on very primitive fears:

00:03:41.518 --> 00:03:45.719
that we are not strong enough to defeat the monsters.

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:50.169
Only this time, not the monsters chased away by the campfire,

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:54.686
but the very monsters who built the campfire in the first place.
