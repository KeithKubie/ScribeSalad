first of all we are just doing money at

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740
first of all we are just doing money at
 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.820
first of all we are just doing money at
this at the problem we're throwing

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830
this at the problem we're throwing
 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.949
this at the problem we're throwing
resources at the problem it costs money

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:15.959
resources at the problem it costs money
 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:17.599
resources at the problem it costs money
but we don't just hand out cash to

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609
but we don't just hand out cash to
 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.630
but we don't just hand out cash to
people we're going in there doing

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640
people we're going in there doing
 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.960
people we're going in there doing
specific interventions one of them is to

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970
specific interventions one of them is to
 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.750
specific interventions one of them is to
improve the farming methods and the

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760
improve the farming methods and the
 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.120
improve the farming methods and the
agricultural techniques to increase the

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130
agricultural techniques to increase the
 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.260
agricultural techniques to increase the
yield of the farmers another is to

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270
yield of the farmers another is to
 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.080
yield of the farmers another is to
prevent malaria by using bed nets and to

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090
prevent malaria by using bed nets and to
 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.700
prevent malaria by using bed nets and to
fight malaria with a 80 sent cure that

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710
fight malaria with a 80 sent cure that
 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.710
fight malaria with a 80 sent cure that
anybody in the in the Western world

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720
anybody in the in the Western world
 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.860
anybody in the in the Western world
could afford but it doesn't get to a lot

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870
could afford but it doesn't get to a lot
 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.750
could afford but it doesn't get to a lot
of these folks in the developed

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760
of these folks in the developed
 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.520
of these folks in the developed
developing world and so we see that

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530
developing world and so we see that
 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.500
developing world and so we see that
millions of people are dying every year

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510
millions of people are dying every year
 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.500
millions of people are dying every year
due to malaria and we know that cripples

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510
due to malaria and we know that cripples
 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.569
due to malaria and we know that cripples
those communities and we know that if

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579
those communities and we know that if
 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.889
those communities and we know that if
you do a lot of other interventions is

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899
you do a lot of other interventions is
 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.810
you do a lot of other interventions is
not going to work if everyone's still

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820
not going to work if everyone's still
 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.340
not going to work if everyone's still
dying and people aren't healthy enough

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350
dying and people aren't healthy enough
 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.029
dying and people aren't healthy enough
to work and so we figured that providing

00:01:08.029 --> 00:01:08.039
to work and so we figured that providing
 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:09.560
to work and so we figured that providing
malaria prevention and cure for malaria

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570
malaria prevention and cure for malaria
 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.280
malaria prevention and cure for malaria
was important also providing ARVs for

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290
was important also providing ARVs for
 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.020
was important also providing ARVs for
AIDS sufferers to allow them to live a

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030
AIDS sufferers to allow them to live a
 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.289
AIDS sufferers to allow them to live a
meaningful life and live a longer life

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299
meaningful life and live a longer life
 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.580
meaningful life and live a longer life
that many people in the Western world

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590
that many people in the Western world
 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.760
that many people in the Western world
with HIV and AIDS are able to live we

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770
with HIV and AIDS are able to live we
 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.100
with HIV and AIDS are able to live we
figured that was important we also

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110
figured that was important we also
 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.859
figured that was important we also
believe that getting them access to

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869
believe that getting them access to
 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.649
believe that getting them access to
clean drinking water is important and

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659
clean drinking water is important and
 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.020
clean drinking water is important and
getting young people into schools and

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030
getting young people into schools and
 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.420
getting young people into schools and
getting them a meal during school is

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430
getting them a meal during school is
 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.160
getting them a meal during school is
important so we're not throwing money at

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170
important so we're not throwing money at
 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.320
important so we're not throwing money at
the problem we're throwing we're

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330
the problem we're throwing we're
 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.100
the problem we're throwing we're
spending money to bring solutions to the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110
spending money to bring solutions to the
 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.719
spending money to bring solutions to the
problems we're not just throwing cash at

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729
problems we're not just throwing cash at
 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.730
problems we're not just throwing cash at
it and I think that's important but I

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740
it and I think that's important but I
 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.740
it and I think that's important but I
also believe that what mr. Eunice is

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750
also believe that what mr. Eunice is
 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.179
also believe that what mr. Eunice is
doing is really important too and i

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189
doing is really important too and i
 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.499
doing is really important too and i
think is working as well and i don't

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509
think is working as well and i don't
 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.710
think is working as well and i don't
think there's any one cure all solution

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720
think there's any one cure all solution
 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.859
think there's any one cure all solution
to poverty but i think what their needs

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869
to poverty but i think what their needs
 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.139
to poverty but i think what their needs
to be as a commitment which I don't

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149
to be as a commitment which I don't
 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.330
to be as a commitment which I don't
think for instance our US government has

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340
think for instance our US government has
 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.600
think for instance our US government has
shown a commitment to it and then once

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610
shown a commitment to it and then once
 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.770
shown a commitment to it and then once
you have the commitment and you really

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780
you have the commitment and you really
 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.670
you have the commitment and you really
believe that it's important defining

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680
believe that it's important defining
 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.960
believe that it's important defining
defining problem

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970
defining problem
 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.070
defining problem
and a problem that is is one of the more

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080
and a problem that is is one of the more
 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.290
and a problem that is is one of the more
critical issues of our time once you

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300
critical issues of our time once you
 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.190
critical issues of our time once you
believe that then reasonable Minds can

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200
believe that then reasonable Minds can
 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.870
believe that then reasonable Minds can
try different techniques to solve the

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880
try different techniques to solve the
 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.310
try different techniques to solve the
problem but at least you have to admit

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320
problem but at least you have to admit
 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.050
problem but at least you have to admit
that it's a major problem and decide

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060
that it's a major problem and decide
 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.130
that it's a major problem and decide
that you have to throw a lot of

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140
that you have to throw a lot of
 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.440
that you have to throw a lot of
resources at it it's not going to just

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450
resources at it it's not going to just
 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.340
resources at it it's not going to just
go away and I believe that Jeffrey Sachs

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350
go away and I believe that Jeffrey Sachs
 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.810
go away and I believe that Jeffrey Sachs
believes that and that's why we're

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820
believes that and that's why we're
 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.300
believes that and that's why we're
working again
