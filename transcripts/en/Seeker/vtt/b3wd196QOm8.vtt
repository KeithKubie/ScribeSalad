00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.040
In 2017, three women went blind after paying
a so-called ‘stem cell clinic’ in Florida

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.279
thousands of dollars to treat their macular
degeneration.

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:12.009
Wait a second, a year ago Julian was talking
about all the new and exciting advances in

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:13.009
this field.

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.470
Why are these stem cell therapies dangerous,
and why aren’t real, safe, and effective

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.610
therapies on the market yet?

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:18.850
I know right?

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.950
Things like this keep happening across the
US, which recently made the FDA basically

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:23.950
say:

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:24.950
Hold up.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.071
These &lt;quote&gt; “unproven and unsafe products”
purport to address a serious disease, but

00:00:28.071 --> 00:00:31.540
instead could &lt;quote&gt; “put patients at significant
risk.”

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.519
We’ve talked about stem cells before on
this channel, going over what they are and

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:39.390
how they work, as well as some of the groundbreaking
stem cell treatments that are showing promise.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.310
But, the early flagship trial that hoped to
improve macular degeneration--a disease leading

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.760
to eventual blindness--was halted after just
ONE patient received treatment, due to concerns

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.379
if they posed any threat to the long-term
health of those participating in the trials.

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.679
That’s how cautious REAL clinical trials
are--they really try to minimize any risk

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:58.949
before they bring treatments to patients.

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.839
That early trial was suspended in 2014, and
there’s still only ONE stem cell therapy

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.680
officially approved by the FDA -- bone marrow
transplants to treat those with blood cancer.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.630
Because bone marrow is where our stem cells
live when we’re adults.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.250
There are a ton more FDA-vetted clinical trials
in the pipeline, but those are not fully-fledged

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.980
treatments yet--they’re just tests to see
how it works, if it’s effective, and what

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.820
the side effects are so that researchers can
go on to make a product or a procedure that

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.820
actually works.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.910
The flood of ‘stem cell clinics’ that
have been popping up all over the world, promising

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.500
to cure everything from blindness to joint
damage to neurodegenerative disease, all share

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.210
one telltale sign--they charge patients for
treatment.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.930
Vulnerable people seeking cures to health
ailments are paying companies large sums of

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.350
money to receive a treatment that’s not
even at clinical trial stage.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.750
In the FDA’s words, these are treatments
with a worrisome lack of evidence that they

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:47.750
work, at all.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.420
And they may actively be harmful.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.920
See, most legitimate clinical trials of treatments
like this will cover the costs of treatment

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.070
for the patient through the pharmaceutical
company or a foundation, precisely for the

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.160
reason that it may not work, it’s not yet
a fully developed treatment.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.210
So paying for a ‘clinical trial’ can be
warning flag number one.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.840
Profit-oriented companies scamming sick people
out of their money are taking advantage of

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.560
consumer confusion around this topic.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.819
Stem cell science is in the news a lot because
scientists are making incremental progress--but

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.440
this is happening in the lab, demonstrating
how stem cells MAY be used in the FUTURE to

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.440
treat patients .

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.730
It’s a highly reported on topic because
it’s an exciting one that could change the

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.379
future of medicine.

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:29.760
But science takes a long time.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.599
So let’s get it straight: Embryonic stem
cells are heavily regulated and hard to access,

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.959
but nothing is stopping faux treatment facilities
from taking cells from a patient’s body

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.040
and turning them into stem cells--these are
called induced pluripotent stem cells, or

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.040
IPSCs.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.620
The Florida ‘clinic’ that blinded three
women extracted the patients’ belly fat,

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.889
went through the process to turn that into
stem cells, and then injected it into their

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:52.889
eyes.

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:57.950
The problem is IPSCs from fully-formed, adult
tissue...can only turn into that tissue . Fat

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.550
stem cells can only turn into fat, so injecting
them into an eye?!

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.510
IPSCs still do hold huge promise for repairing
patients’ damaged tissue, and researchers

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.510
are always looking for ways to extract and
multiply the stem cells we have as adults

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.159
that CAN turn into anything, because that
would allow us to repair any damage on the

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:21.329
body --it’s just that there’s no legitimate
treatment out there yet.

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.129
Scientific research like this is exciting
and there’s a ton of it out there, and science

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:28.180
nerds like us are talking about it a lot because
it’s really cool...but, as we’ve seen,

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.999
we need to be careful in HOW we talk about
it.

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:35.549
The next time you see an ad online for a stem
cell clinic promising a miracle cure, maybe

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.010
dig a little deeper.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.499
There are some people who will take advantage
of the hype around that basic research for

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:44.760
their own gain, making people believe that
fully-fledged treatments are out there, even

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.799
though they’re really not.

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.170
Everyone, this is Maren!

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.419
Maren meet everyone.

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:52.400
Maren is new to the channel, she’s a science
communicator and she’s super good at environmental

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.540
science,animal behavior, and biology…

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.730
You’ll be seeing her more on the channel,
give her a warm welcome!

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.510
And check out this video about some recent
exciting stem cell research developments,

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.049
but take a minute to think about how experiments
like this are different from an actual treatment.

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:10.079
We think it’s just as important to talk
about the realities of science as it is to

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:13.060
geek out over the flashy stuff, so subscribe
if you think so too.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.060
I’m Maren!

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.629
I’m Trace, thanks for watching Seeker!
