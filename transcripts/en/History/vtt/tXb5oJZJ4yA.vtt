00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.120
Bladesmiths, welcome
to our strength test.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.290
What I'm gonna do is take
each of your weapons,

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.830
and I'm gonna beat
them repeatedly

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.540
and viciously into different
points of this shield.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:09.620
Ashe, you're up first.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:10.620
How you feeling?
- Good.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.540
Let's do it.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.210
All right.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.040
[music playing]

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.500
[grunting]

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.880
[chuckles]

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.580
Ashe, aside from
the obvious, you'd

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.620
have a very nice weapon here.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.880
The handle has got
a good grip to it.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.210
I was able to get some
really heavy duty, good,

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.460
penetrating strikes in there.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.880
But obviously, we
have a problem.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.120
It broke.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.790
When you put your
little spike in here,

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.620
these corners here are sharp.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.960
So even though it looks
like a very good heat treat,

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.380
you got a stress fracture
in there somewhere.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.120
All that strength and
pressure came down that blade

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.080
and snapped that off
right on that joint.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.380
[grunting]

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.620
Ashe, your blade has suffered
a catastrophic failure,

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.290
and cannot continue
with testing.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.710
But that doesn't mean that
you're out of this competition.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.920
Levi, your blade needs
to survive at least

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.960
nine strikes on this shield.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.670
Are you ready?

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.580
Indeed, sir.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.330
Ashe, are you ready?

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.330
Oh, yeah.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.620
Jay Nielsen, are you ready?

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.120
Oh, yeah.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.460
Let's do this, gents.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.120
Will tells me my blade has to
make it through nine strikes.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.500
I'm hoping and praying that
it's going to last longer.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.000
[grunting]

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.080
[clanking]

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.960
[groaning]

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.170
Bladesmiths, this sengese is
incredibly difficult to make.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.460
And both of you made
very deadly weapons.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.380
However, you both had
problems in our strength test.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.540
Ashe, your blade failed
after nine strikes.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.620
Levi, unfortunately,
your blade suffered

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.500
a catastrophic failure
on the first strike

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.960
against that shield.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.540
And for that reason,
I have to ask

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.210
you to please leave the forge.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.210
I definitely proved
what I came to prove.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.460
I wanted to be
able to push myself

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.880
beyond my regular limits.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.540
Good job, dude.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.710
Good job.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.710
My family at
home is definitely

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.170
gonna be proud of me.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.620
And I'm taking home skills
and knowledge that I

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.290
didn't have before I came here.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.670
And that's definitely
a win for me.
