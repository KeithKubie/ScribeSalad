00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:07.779
It’s normal to want to be a good guest;
an intense wish to please tends to guide us

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:13.240
when we accept a dinner invitation or spend
a weekend with friends. And we generally fulfil

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:20.350
this ambition by following a leading theory
of what satisfies other humans: we mimic our

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:27.199
hosts. We follow their lead in the conversation,
we discuss what they want to discuss, we eat

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:33.329
when they want to eat. We are malleable, we
adjust; we laugh at pretty much anything they

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.249
find funny. It sounds extremely generous and
deeply well-intentioned but there’s a strange

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:45.409
aspect to this theory: the mimetic person
is not, in practice, especially pleasing.

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:51.360
They may not be offensive, but nor are they
particularly memorable, interesting or even

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.010
likeable.  By
contrast there is another social type who

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.420
is a great deal more winning: the person who
expresses their own distinctive needs with

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.571
clarity while nevertheless remaining at all
times gracious and socially vigilant. This

00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:12.240
more richly characterful person will, over
dinner, remark with a smile that they happen

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.610
to find the politician everyone is meant to
hate oddly attractive, at least in fantasy.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.729
They tell us about an embarrassing thing that
happened to them recently at work – or about

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.550
a regret that haunts them in their emotional
lives. When they are our house guest, they

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.370
inform us in a rather precise, though always
highly polite, way when they like to go to

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.030
sleep, how much time they need on their own
and what their bathroom requirements are.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.039
They apologise for being a bit mad in a way
that suggests profound sanity. They add that

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:46.810
they’d deeply appreciate a boiled egg with
biscuits for lunch. They are, in the best

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.710
way, a bit peculiar. It isn’t that the mimetic
person harms us; they simply don’t reassure

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:00.259
or endear us. A key part of what we seek in
social contact is a feeling that our eccentricities

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.780
and less easily mentioned dimensions find
an echo in another person. And yet all we

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.340
see when we come to closer to the conformist
guest is our own reflection. What truly charms

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.370
is the person who manages to possess both
a character and politeness. The archetype

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.420
for this is the endearing four-and-a-half
year old child. They’ll tell a near stranger

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.569
their ideas about where squirrels go at night,
what they like to put in their sandwiches

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.849
and their nickname for their elderly grandfather.
We colloquially call this ‘cute’ but it’s

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:39.319
perhaps something more serious than this implies:
more pointedly, it’s a relief from the customary

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:46.439
pressure to standardise human nature and to
say nothing that will sound too odd or flavoured.

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:52.099
The small child is reminding us that the variegated
surface of every personality – theirs but

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:58.080
by implication ours as well – could be put
on display and, rather than hurt or offend,

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:06.159
simply charm and enliven. The good guest combines
the candour of the child with the social empathy

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:13.140
of the self-aware adult. They know how to
be that rare and much prized social phenomenon:

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:20.489
a loveable eccentric. There is a sad background
to the people pleasing adult who doesn’t

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:26.540
in the end even please so much. They are generally
the outcome of a style of parenting that didn’t

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.459
allow character or originality to show through.
They had to hide who they really were for

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:39.540
fear of upsetting an angry or vulnerable set
of caregivers. We cannot erase the past, but

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:46.219
we can cease waging an active war on our characters
in public. Our true selves may once have been

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:51.500
unwanted, but it’s only on the basis of
being able to show them now that proper friendships

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:58.810
can begin. Being merely polite is, in the
end, an overly low ambition. We have exaggerated

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:05.620
how much people like to be imitated and invariably
agreed with. It is easy to tolerate such types,

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:13.170
but very hard to love them. To truly please
people requires that we dare to show a little

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:19.520
more of the touching weirdness that lurks
within us all.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:32.000
