Now that we have seen semantic networks in action, we can

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.910
ask ourselves the important question. What makes a knowledge representation,

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:12.560
a good representation? Well, a good knowledge representation makes relationships

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.184
explicit. So in the two by one matrix problem, there were all these objects,

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:22.630
circles and triangles and dots. There were there this relationship between them,

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.450
left off and inside. And the semantic that worked made all of them explicit.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.160
It exposed the natural constraints of the problem. A good representation

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.350
works at the right level of abstraction. So that it captures everything that

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.240
needs to be captured, and yet. Removes all the details that are not needed.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.910
So representation, a good representation, is transparent, concise,

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.440
captures only what is needed, but complete, captures everything that is needed.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.710
It is fast, because it doesn't have all the details that are not needed. And it

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.440
is computable. It allows you to draw from the inferences that need to be drawn,

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.736
in order to address the problem at hand.
