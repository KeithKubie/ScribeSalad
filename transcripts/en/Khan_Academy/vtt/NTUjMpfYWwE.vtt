00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.690
Japan was not a major
actor in World War I,

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.780
but it did play a role.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.650
Right as war broke
out in August of 1914,

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.580
the Japanese were
interested in taking

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.480
control of German possessions.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.710
And they were already
allies with the British,

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.490
so they communicated
with the British,

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.760
and they came to an
agreement that if Japan

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.570
were to attack German
possessions in the Pacific

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.950
and in China, then Japan
could take control of them.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.480
And so Japan
proceeded to do this.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.490
In particular, it took a siege
of Tsingtao, which we already

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.130
talked about, was a
German possession.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.440
These are Japanese boats
landing there, Japanese troops.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.120
And this was actually of
technological significance.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.760
It was the first
time that you had

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.630
a naval-based aerial assault.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.310
This wasn't really using what
we would consider aircraft

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.470
carriers, although they
did carry the aircraft.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.230
But they would place
them into the water,

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.930
and then the aircraft would
take off from the water

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.170
as they tried to take the town
of Tsingtao, which they were

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.910
eventually able to do
by the end of 1914.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.860
On top of that, they
were able to take control

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.530
of many of Germany's
other possessions

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.750
in the Pacific, specifically
the Pacific Islands.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.140
And on top of that, Japan
did send some aspects,

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.660
or some parts of its navy, to
help protect Allied fleets as

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.430
far away as the Mediterranean.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.970
So Japan did play a role here.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.550
The other interesting
historical note,

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.980
because of Japan's
involvement in World War I,

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.890
is what came out of
the negotiations.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.770
First of all, by being
involved, it kind of

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.884
put Japan at the
seat of major powers.

00:01:32.884 --> 00:01:34.300
And as we'll see,
in World War II,

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.990
Japan ends up being one of the
major players in World War II,

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.670
and it's essentially going on
the other side by that point.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.780
But because of its
help of the Allies,

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.530
Japan does have a seat at
the table at the Paris Peace

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.304
Conference.

00:01:46.304 --> 00:01:48.470
And as they are negotiating
the Treaty of Versailles

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.270
and coming up with
the League of Nations,

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.660
Japan is eager to kind of
have an equal footing with all

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.400
of the other European powers.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.410
And so it attempts to place this
in the charter for the League

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.300
of Nations. "The equality of
nations being a basic principle

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.850
of the League of Nations, the
High Contracting Parties agree

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.940
to accord as soon as possible to
all alien nationals of states,

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.490
members of the League, equal
and just treatment in every

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.970
respect"-- let me
underline that--

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.490
"equal and just treatment
in every respect,

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.890
making no distinction
either in law or in fact,

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.399
on account of their
race or nationality."

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:28.940
Essentially the
Japanese were saying,

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.260
hey, look, you Europeans,
you guys have to view us

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.100
and-- based on the way this
is phrased-- other people

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.470
as equals.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.410
Just to get a sense of what
the world was like then,

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.525
this was not passed.

00:02:41.525 --> 00:02:42.900
Even though the
League of Nations

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.170
was the product of these
very idealistic thoughts

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.750
by Woodrow Wilson, it
did not get passed.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.400
Obviously the British, they
had subjugated many people

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.470
in their empires.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.366
Woodrow Wilson was
afraid that if this

00:02:55.366 --> 00:02:57.240
were to be included in
the League of Nations,

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.260
it would have trouble
passing-- getting

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.860
ratified in the
segregated South.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.820
We now know later that
the League of Nations

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.740
wasn't ratified anyway.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.690
And so this essentially
does not happen.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.407
And even the
Japanese themselves,

00:03:11.407 --> 00:03:13.240
they were eager for
equality for themselves.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.100
But as we'll see as we
enter into World War II,

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.140
they themselves had a
sense of racial superiority

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.330
and they subjugated
many of the other people

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.130
in Asia, especially the
Chinese and the Koreans.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.940
This is an interesting quote
from the Chinese delegation.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.820
"We are not too
proud to fight but we

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.230
are too proud to accept a
place of admitted inferiority

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.980
in dealing with one or more
of the associated nations.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.740
We want nothing but
simple justice."

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.620
So it tells you how
different the world was.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.480
This is not even 100 years ago.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.810
And the real relevance
of World War I for Japan

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.530
was it elevated it to becoming
one of the powers of the world.
