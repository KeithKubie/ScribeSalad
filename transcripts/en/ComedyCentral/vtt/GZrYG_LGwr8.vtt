00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.037
Now, there's a fight in Congress

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.339
going on right now
over funding the government.

00:00:06.372 --> 00:00:08.408
Republicans
are holding DACA hostage

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:09.976
until the Democrats agree to pay

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:12.512
for Trump's big, beautiful wall.

00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:14.847
It's a real
 Deal or No Deal situation,

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.182
which is not good.

00:00:16.215 --> 00:00:18.785
 The Apprentice 
was a way better show.

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:21.721
But if the stingy
"phlegm-ocrats" won't fund it,

00:00:21.754 --> 00:00:23.823
how are we going to finance
the wall?

00:00:23.856 --> 00:00:26.125
Oh, Jordan, it doesn't matter.

00:00:26.158 --> 00:00:28.227
Kobi Libii, everybody. Kobi.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.196
(cheering and applause)

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:33.132
Explain yourself.

00:00:33.165 --> 00:00:35.401
Jordan, we don't need
to worry ourselves

00:00:35.434 --> 00:00:38.104
over funding
an actual, physical wall

00:00:38.137 --> 00:00:40.540
because the wall is a metaphor.

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:42.241
I didn't see Dead Poets Society.

00:00:42.274 --> 00:00:45.912
(chuckles) Jordan,
a metaphor is a symbol,

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:47.980
and this symbol is very clear.

00:00:48.013 --> 00:00:51.117
It says immigrants are... ugh.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.953
And you can't quote me on that
in your mean think pieces

00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:57.023
because it's just a noise.

00:00:57.056 --> 00:00:59.926
So, it doesn't matter
who funds the actual wall

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:02.628
because this metaphorical wall
has already been built.

00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:05.498
Okay, Kobi, look, I don't care
about your literary devices.

00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:08.234
We need something solid
to keep the immigrants out.

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:09.435
Actually, we don't.

00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:11.137
Most illegal immigrants are here

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.438
because they overstayed
their visas,

00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:13.706
and the ones who cross

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:15.241
usually do so
at a border crossing.

00:01:15.274 --> 00:01:17.610
A big concrete slab
won't help with any of that,

00:01:17.643 --> 00:01:19.312
but a metaphorical wall will.

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:21.914
Oh, wrong!
Nothing is stronger than bricks,

00:01:21.947 --> 00:01:24.650
a lesson I learn every week
in karate class.

00:01:24.683 --> 00:01:27.954
But Jordan,
the metaphor is already

00:01:27.987 --> 00:01:29.922
a huge success
at keeping people out.

00:01:29.955 --> 00:01:33.326
We've created an environment
of animosity and unwelcomeness,

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:35.928
and we add another brick
to our metaphorical wall

00:01:35.961 --> 00:01:38.731
every time we talk
about building a physical wall.

00:01:38.764 --> 00:01:40.733
It gets higher
every time our president

00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:42.368
calls other nations "shitholes"

00:01:42.401 --> 00:01:45.938
and every time there's a story
about border patrol agents

00:01:45.971 --> 00:01:48.441
destroying water supplies
left for migrants

00:01:48.474 --> 00:01:50.143
so that they're stranded
in the desert

00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:51.944
and forced to migrate
somewhere else--

00:01:51.977 --> 00:01:54.680
heaven.

00:01:54.713 --> 00:01:56.382
Wow.

00:01:56.415 --> 00:01:59.685
Well, um, that-that's
a metaphor, right?

00:01:59.718 --> 00:02:01.420
No, they really have done that.

00:02:01.453 --> 00:02:03.823
But more importantly,

00:02:03.856 --> 00:02:06.292
the culture
that inspired these guards

00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:08.494
to deprive people
of life-giving water

00:02:08.527 --> 00:02:10.096
is what's really working.

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.465
Under Trump,
there's been a 24% drop

00:02:12.498 --> 00:02:15.001
in people caught illegally
crossing the U.S. border.

00:02:15.034 --> 00:02:17.170
They're not even trying
to come now.

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:20.106
Wait, Kobi, look,
I-I still want a real wall,

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:22.642
the biggest, most beautiful wall
that Trump promised me.

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:25.344
Well, Jordan, people can always
get around a physical wall.

00:02:25.377 --> 00:02:28.181
No, Trump's wall! No, not his!
No one can get past that.

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:31.184
Jordan, think about it.
Isn't there any way around it?

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:34.287
Okay. I guess you could maybe...

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.589
-build a really deep tunnel?
-And?

00:02:36.622 --> 00:02:40.092
Well, I guess
you could pole vault over it.

00:02:40.125 --> 00:02:43.029
Or dress up like a sexy lady

00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:44.564
and hide a ladder
under your skirt,

00:02:44.597 --> 00:02:45.898
seduce the border guard,

00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:47.800
and while he's falling in love
with you, climb over.

00:02:47.833 --> 00:02:50.937
Oh, yeah. Yeah, you could, uh...
you could get three guys,

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.105
stand on each other's shoulders,
the guy on top jumps over,

00:02:53.138 --> 00:02:54.874
grabs the other guy's hands,
swings him over.

00:02:54.907 --> 00:02:56.609
The third guy on the ground
probably doesn't get to go.

00:02:56.642 --> 00:02:59.078
-Exactly. Yeah. -Yeah. Yeah.
You could, uh... I don't know.

00:02:59.111 --> 00:03:01.147
You could tie a bunch
of balloons around your waist.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.282
You could you get jetpacks
or ramps!

00:03:03.315 --> 00:03:04.584
I forgot about ramps!

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:06.385
-What about ramps?
-Jordan, Jordan, it's fine.

00:03:06.418 --> 00:03:08.854
It's okay
if Mexicans know about ramps

00:03:08.887 --> 00:03:12.792
because America's true wall
is up here,

00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:15.995
and there's no ramp
that can get over... ugh.

00:03:16.028 --> 00:03:17.496
(shudders) Thank goodness.

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:18.929 line:92%
Kobi Libii, everyone.
