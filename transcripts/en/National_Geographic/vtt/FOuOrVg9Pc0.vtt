[music playing]

00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:09.100
(SINGING) God's gonna
trouble the water.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.500
"Water and Power--

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.367
A California Heist" is a
feature-length documentary

00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:16.934
about the politics of
water in California.

00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:20.300
California officials are
putting mandatory restrictions

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.000
on water use in place.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.567
MARK ARAX: Water
has become gold.

00:00:23.567 --> 00:00:25.834
In the midst of this
drought, agriculture

00:00:25.834 --> 00:00:27.967
has recorded record crops.

00:00:27.967 --> 00:00:31.734
So the question becomes
how they manage to do that.

00:00:31.734 --> 00:00:33.500
MARINA ZENOVICH: The
California aqueduct

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.333
was set up by Governor Pat
Brown, Jerry Brown's father.

00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:41.433
REPORTER: A river
700 miles long.

00:00:41.433 --> 00:00:44.000
The largest project
ever undertaken

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.734
by an American state.

00:00:45.734 --> 00:00:48.300
MARINA ZENOVICH: We have
an artificial river running

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.600
through this desert state.

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:58.633
There are so many different
layers in this world of water.

00:00:58.633 --> 00:01:02.133
There are a lot of
manipulations behind the scenes

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:04.333
that we know nothing about.

00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:07.433
And our film focuses
on a series of meetings

00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:11.233
where a water bank
ended up getting out

00:01:11.233 --> 00:01:13.233
of the hands of the
state of California

00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:16.300
and into the hands of
some private individuals.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.667
[cash register]

00:01:17.667 --> 00:01:20.200
There was nothing illegal
about what they did,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.033
because most of what
they do is legal

00:01:23.033 --> 00:01:25.467
because they write the rules.

00:01:25.467 --> 00:01:29.000
It's an expose of
greed, basically.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.500
So I hope people will just kind
of say, wow, this is happening

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.266
and we need to band together
and try to fix this.

00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:40.633
