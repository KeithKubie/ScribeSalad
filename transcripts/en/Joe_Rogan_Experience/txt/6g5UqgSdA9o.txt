Speaker 1:          00:00:04       Mm Edwards, the ever the contrarian shows up with an android phone, drinking tea against the sun. Second followed. No rules. Still Mag and pay me sorta. You had some French fries or dad brought that were made with clear the legend. Jamie, you were there. What did you say? You guys saw French dryer too. Yeah. Appeared in my life. Listen to the MGM steakhouse. Dan Cooking that fucking those French fries. If anything other than animal fat. Guaranteed the two delicious. I didn't see it. I didn't see it. Even at McDonald's, you get McDonald's fries. Apparently they cook them in some fucking disgusting fat. Well, that's what makes them taste so good. What does make McDonald's fries tastes good? They're pretty good, but they're not my favorite. I don't even know. I get confused when people say they're better than in and out. Fries. Oh, I like fries. It tastes like potatoes either in and now. Fries are far superior. I don't like fries. It tastes like potatoes. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:01:06       don't know fries better than McDonald's. I do personally feel that. You know who I hadn't beef with that about candy Alexander from a news radio. She was the first person to like, we went and got in and out like for the holes, the whole group of us. And um, uh, she got McDonald's fries. She went and got McDonald's. Why'd you get McDonald's fry? She was like, fuck those bullshit fries, those in and out fries. I'm like, what? I didn't understand. They can be okay, but they're so hit or miss that they can miss bad. To me, they're remarkably consistent. They always taste like, what are we discussing here? Fries or mocker. It's like a line. Remember mock. It's still a common Solak with five guys fries. Five guys with the King of fries. Yes. They have two options. They have k they're real, they have the fucking potatoes and bags sitting in their goddamn store just to let you know, bitch, we're using these potatoes and then they take that bag and shake it in there and cut it up. Um, they have Cajun fries so they, when you have another option, you got spicy fries that are God damn delicious. I have to stop by there. Then you don't have to crack packets to get your ketchup. They have a giant tub of the ketchup. He squirt that bitch in a nice Little Cup, a little paper cup. You can shower and have that catch up. McDonald's had that homeless people would be under it. Squirt mustard in their mouth.

Speaker 1:          00:02:33       I'll tell you what man, since um, Starbucks got in trouble for being racist. Um, there's a lot more homeless people at Starbucks. Like they understand that they could just go there. It's really, it's really odd. That's so funny. That's true. Get kicked out. They can get kicked out. He's afraid, dude. It's a, it's 100% different. 100% different in some spots. Which ones are you going to cause the ones in Hollywood, they know how to handle it for the most part because they got locks on everything. I went to a shifty one in downtown where a, they didn't even have a bathroom. Like how do you serve in coffee? You don't have a bathroom. Coffee makes you shit and Piss. Yeah, this is ridiculous. But I realized they didn't have a bathroom cause the homeless people, there was homeless people that had like this guy had a port and he was charging all of his devices.

Speaker 1:          00:03:14       He had everything. He had like a phone, a fucking iPad and long night ahead of him to get free electricity there and they always got like a bag of his stuff. Like he's got a little camp in the corner of the Starbucks. I'm like, wow. On one hand like, hey, how's the guys supposed to get some electricity but I want him to get back up on his feet. Maybe this is the way to do it. Maybe it's through that iPad. [inaudible]. On the other hand I'm like, Hey, don't get me a disease. You fucking, I got Instagram account yesterday, street people of Los Angeles, which has got some very interesting content. Does that a naked person? Yes, it is. Naked person just changing on the strange and on the street. That was actually in San Francisco I think I remember checking that post but wow, this has got some interesting stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:03:53       These guys were like cooking underneath the tree on a lot with like a live grill right about somewhere. But there's a, Tommy's in Hollywood, sorry, go ahead. Thompson home and uh, there's always like a bunch of young homeless people cooking in front of it. Like there's a bus stop. They have a lit fire like caveman, like, like, like fear of the walking dead style campfire like outside of the Tommy's on Hollywood boulevard, like on a daily basis. How weird. It's just weird that, that's okay. Like if you just wanted to start a fire on the side of the road, would that be okay? No. But can you start a fire to cook apparently. Can you or did they just not get busted? Probably need a permit. Yeah. Would think you need something like a to be like a grill street vendor type permit if you want to sell. What if you just wanted to give food away? You can't do that. You can't, but you can eat it yourself.

Speaker 2:          00:04:51       Mm.

Speaker 1:          00:04:51       I don't know. Could you offer it to some, it seems like you could offer it to somebody like you know, if they allow you to cook and you and I were sitting there and were cooking and said, would you like some and you said, hey, that looks good. That should be okay. It's like a donation. You know some places they don't charge you to get in but they accept a donation. But if you plan in advance you say, hey, all of us meet on the corner of third and Santa Monica. I'm going to have a cookout because, oh no, no, no, no. House, Sun, solar. We just setting up right here on the concrete. Yeah, those do. People should just go to a park that has those grills. Like Griffith Park is not far. Right. Griffith Park is like people with homes cooked there. Yeah. You got free grills.

Speaker 1:          00:05:31       You could just do it up there. Anybody can cook there. Yeah. That is one of the nicest parts of la by the way. And if people don't know that is a fucking wildlife area, that's a legit wildlife area. There is a real Predator prey fucking law. The jungle thing going down right now in Griffith Park, it's mountain lions and deer. It is going down and coyotes day and coyotes, you are doing all your stuff. It's a really amazing place, right? Because here we are. We got past that Dina and Glendale and Burbank and La, you know, beautiful fucking BMWs driving by these cool people are jogging. They got earpods in the jogging and Griffith Park. The jogging right near a war zone is a war zone is rustling sometimes go around the corner and I'm like, fuck dude, like I'm, I'm on, I'm stay paying attention a hundred percent we got a giant framed picture and headed to the studio of this mountain lion that was photographed by a camera trap.

Speaker 1:          00:06:33       You know what a camera trap is? They set them up to monitor the numbers of wildlife and to just try to get an accurate assessment of what's in the area. So what it is is like a camera. That's the photo. It's a camera that operates on a motion detection. So as this cat, this probably hundred and 50 pound, super muscular grown ass mountain lion with a fucking collar on his neck. His name is p 22 that's what it says. Just say up there just between 219 pounds as of May. So it's not quite that big. So it's still big enough to kill everyone in this room. It's in the room with us. We're fucked. But look how muscular it is. I mean, that is a look at the size of its goddamn forearms. Those are Franco Colombo, forearms. That is a scattershot animal and that animal lives around where all these people are jogging.

Speaker 1:          00:07:25       It's really strange situation. I'm never going to Griffith park again. Fuck would peep till I saw a p one to five. I'm out. Stay at my house, Bro. Look at the Hollywood sign behind it though. It's so perfect. That's almost like a fake picture that is so close to me. Yes. So close to you. I went to the park. I'm like a block and a half away from that joint. Do I run with a knife? Oh yeah, I do. I run with the this fucking half face blades knife. It's called the s h p o s subhuman piece of shit. That's what the name of the knife is. Same, same easy cry. So they caught him here with look at that. He's got blood and bones. He's eating something that must be like a deer leg. Fucking a that is madness. And he's digging a hole in the ground and stuff it in there to save it.

Speaker 1:          00:08:20       Fuck man. Because you know what? The deer around there are really comfortable. Yeah. But that could be a kid man. Right? 100% could be a kid. But I know why he's there because the deer in that neighborhood, like they walk around in the daytime like their tourist too, cause there's no hunting around here. So they're like all comfortable and shit. I said okay. You'll probably feed them too. Yeah. So then now the line that's like, oh, let me track these motherfuckers over to this area and I'll just have a feast. It's a buffet night. Look at this shit. I'm all in drive. This is an automobile haul and drive. There's a grown ass mountain lion with a collar on that's got a giant deer on the ground. A buck, not giant. It's probably a hundred pound deer on the ground. Dead on the, on the side, on the side of the city street.

Speaker 1:          00:09:08       It's a similar situation. Yeah. Civilization. And this is a cat that's killing deer with its face where we live. And not only that, we know where it is, we have a collar on it. We're playing this game. You don't fuck with us and we won't fuck with you. And they won't fuck with you. For the most part, the problem comes when they get old and when they get old, they get real dangerous cause they get desperate. They can't catch a deer anymore. So they go for the easy, cool. Go for people. People are easy, right? Yeah man, your kids are easy. I'm gonna go hiking with somebody slow that's move. Go hiking with a small, slow person. Someone who just doesn't look like a challenge at all. Hey Man, survival of the fittest. Go smoking with someone who's smoking, you're smoking the meat. It makes it more attractive.

Speaker 1:          00:09:51       So they're like, what we eat affects how we taste. It's got it. Right. So maybe, maybe like people who are in really in the junk food, they'd be more attractive than a sweet taste to them. Yeah, I bet. Right? If you just eat candy all day, I bet you taste delicious. The human skittle attack the human skittle over here. Leave me alone. That fucking cat is so big, man. Imagine just seeing the 115 pound cat in the room with you. You'd be like, oh Jesus Christ. Like my dog is probably maybe 75 80 pounds somewhere in that range. He's not marshal. Yeah. And if he wanted to kill me, he probably could. Right. I mean, he's a golden retriever. They don't kill anything other than squirrels. But if he wanted to, I mean, I don't know if he had that mentality really was like crazy. Like, like 28 days later he got that rage virus in and he just went after me.

Speaker 1:          00:10:51       He's got giant ass fucking teeth. Right? I mean, I assume that I would kick his ass because he listens to me because I'm his daddy. You know what I mean? Like there's no, he's never, I've had pit bulls that grouch you a little bit and you gotta Kinda like, hey mother Fucker, I'm the one who gives you your food, cut the shit and then they'll give you their Paul and then they're sorry you played a little game with them. A little dominance game. Especially when they're teenagers and they're like one and a half, two years old. They'll test you just to check cause it's natural for them. It's natural for dogs. Golden's don't ever do that. He don't grow out anybody. They're just obedient, worst guard dog of all time. You come over everybody. He loves everybody. He loves you. I love it. He loves people like he's never like, not, not like he's never met them, but like he can't believe he hasn't seen them in so long.

Speaker 1:          00:11:36       It's like a long lost friends. The long lost friends. Everyone's a long lost friend. Hilarious. Everyone. Everyone is a long lost friends. What it's like with him, he's such a love sponge. I would, I would be jealous if I, if that's my dog, I'm like, so I'm not special. Just that motherfucker don't tell dog jar really friendly dogs. Every new person is another opportunity for a new person to love them too. And so they, they get so excited to meet people. Smart do when people come over to the house, he is so hilarious. Everyone, he loves everybody. Like

Speaker 3:          00:12:08       I believe it's, you know, like whenever you met your daughter, it's like a few years and he just starts whining and run around and start

Speaker 1:          00:12:17       goals. It's hilarious. But if you want it to you probably kill me. I mean, if a rat was that big, I would fucking put my money on the rat on the right. Right. And dogs, dogs kill rats all the time. Even those little dogs like Jack Russells, those little tiny dogs, those are designed to kill rats. Hilarious. My ex had a dog, right? And I was holding the dog and she got into a car right across the street and moved it and then got out the car and Wa and the dog acted like he didn't just see a jump in the car. He acted like she went away for two days. It was a

Speaker 3:          00:12:55       [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:12:55       I was like, she just went to, she just moved the car across you and we watched her do it. Do you remember when we had a, uh, Mr. Foster Aaron Foster on the podcast and he was talking about being able to kill a wolf. We had to fight one. We had to correct him. We had to go press stop this. Don't, I know you're a beast, but come on man. Where people were made out of like smush. Yeah. Everything's smushy also song. Yeah. Something that wants a bite. Your tit like of a wolf. Decide to bite your tit. The amount of pain you'd be in, be unbearable. I know you feel like one of those buns that they give you at the steak house. That's what your flesh feels like. Exactly. Like a steak house. Been bred fucking Aaron Foster spent four hours on Twitter explaining why he'd beat a wolf one on one.

Speaker 1:          00:13:44       He's hilarious. Isn't he doing a podcast now? Yeah, he's got his own podcast. He started doing music, which is really good. You just release some music under, I think positive. He knows his name. He's a visionary. He's a running back. Yeah. He was running tired to hit a vegan running back. He retired young and he's fucking super smart man. Just except in control when it comes to someone when comes to walls, I think he's trolling a little bit. He's having a little fun. It's being smart. Yeah. There's like a wolf he could get. Not any wolf. Like there's one out there. You want it? Oh yeah. Yeah. He could fuck up an old one. A declawed one with no teeth or grandma Woolf old one that doesn't have any endurance anymore. It would be a battle though. Even then before we get too far off of this, I just, there's pictures on the Google images sent me down this, this is just north of the, uh, Los Angeles Zoo.

Speaker 1:          00:14:29       So there's a, I think this might even be that same chat we just saw. So this chap cougar has some food. It's eating. And then next picture, the bear show up to take it. And now wait a minute, they're eating the fucking food instead of the Cougar. Oh my God. So this is near us to this 30 miles away or probably even closer. So bare steel, deer from cougars. This is what happens. Liberals run a state. Listen folks, I'm liberal. I'm with you. I know a lot of you think I'm not. There's a lot of knuckleheads out there. That thing going part of the alt right or something. I vote left on fucking everything. But you, you gotta stop anthropomorphizing animals. We gotta be careful. We, I'm on team people. I don't want these animals to die, but I also don't want to go out to my fucking swimming pool and see a bear in there and they, they have that in Pasadena.

Speaker 1:          00:15:18       You've seen that shit in Pasadena. This family went outside and there's a fucking bear swimming around their pool or bears and Pasadena. Big Ones like 200 pound bear swimming in this motherfucker's pool. Do I live here? How do, how do I know this shit? Not only that you got to take over, man. If they decide that this is their spot, look at this shit. Look, there's a few of them. If you've got the whole family, my God, how many bears are in there? Oh my God, dude, these are, these things are no joke. The problem with bears is too, once they get a spot where they know they can get food or they can get water or they can get something, they're going to come back to that spot. They get habituated. That's why they have a real problem with them. With the people. Yellowstone used to feed them, you know, people would pull in and then I actually did that or was there when that happened when I was a little kid, I went to Yellowstone.

Speaker 1:          00:16:13       My parents took me when I was probably like seven or eight years old and I remember just thinking, this is so crazy. You're in your car and the bears are outside. They were right there. They don't do it the same way anymore though. Now they discourage human bear interaction. They just didn't understand it I think as well. Which is kinda crazy cause I were not that long ago. I was looking at the 1970s I just don't understand people's like for ferocious animals, like I don't want to kill him, but I never want to feed something that could kill me. Well, I think people have this really distorted idea of wildlife because of movies. If you thought about like what the lion king is, you would never want aligned to die, you know, lines noble. I mean, sure, there's a few bad ones, but overall, the lion king's the, he's the sweetheart.

Speaker 1:          00:17:04       He's amazing. You think about Yogi bear and you think about teddy bears. Kids have teddy bears. I mean, we have this weird thing. We take polar bears, which is the most vicious of all bears, and we have them be our friends selling us ice cream and Coca-Cola. They're selling Klondike bars. Yeah. We cartoon them and then people grow up watching these cartoons and think, oh, let me go pick this friendly thing that was drawn. But that's a, I wish. A ferocious beast. Yeah. I wish it didn't have a history if we just thought of it as a thing, like a wolverine. Right. Wolverines don't have any, there was no one. No one feels about a wolverine the same way they think about a bear. Cause there was no like cute wolverines. There's only the ones that see in like a, you know x men like Wolverine dudes.

Speaker 1:          00:17:53       This one. Yeah. Yeah. But he's like a person. His name's Wolverine. There's no like cute wolverines cause they're so fucking for Roche has such a monster of a little animal. One Wolverine will fuck up a big bear. Oh for real dude. They're fucking ruthless. They chase wolves off food. How big a wolverine. Not Big man. 40 pounds. 50 pounds. Jeez. They'll fuck up everything. They fuck up everything. Everything runs away from them. They're just ready to die all day, all day, ready to die. And they're super strong and durable for a little tiny thing you ever see. You know what a wolverine looks like and now I think I don't go up. A Wolverine bearing is fancy. It looks like a fake animal. So like a super jacked little giant rat bear thing with fangs. It's like a super, it's like a super badger. Badgers are similar.

Speaker 1:          00:18:42       I know they vicious. Fucking vicious. That's a wolverine. Jeez Bro. I mean, look at the teeth on that thing. Look at its face and that's it. Smiling. Yeah, that's a good day. Those motherfuckers are ready to go to war all day. Make weird noises. They're terrifying. Like if that thing wanted to kill you, you would be fucked. Look at this closed claws and the teeth. Now imagine that that thing is hyper aggressive and it's a Predator and fuck, that shit is built to survive. Fuck man. That is a crazy little animal. They are ferocious and they, they are ready to go at all times and they'll try to get the fuck away from you. The animal scientific meat name means the glutton. That's a pretty apt description. Four feet tall, weighing 22 pounds for females and 40 pounds for males. This fierce creatures are the largest members of the weasel family.

Speaker 1:          00:19:36       They're fucking weasels, bro. That's vicious weasel still. They're small compared to some of the animals that they compete with for food. But a wolverine has no problem standing up to wolves or a bear when a meal is on the line. And that crazy 40 pounds. The way bears are to us is the way we are the dogs. You know, like an 80 pound dog probably. Fuck you up if you're 150 pound person. That's how wolverines are. The bears. 40 pound wolverine might fuck up a 200 pound bear bears. Like, damn, this ain't worth it when I die. I want to come back as a wolverine. Yeah, that's a vicious animal. The Caribou, the hairs and rodents as well as larger animals like Caribou that are weak or ill, but we'll also scavenge from any car cause they can get their claws on. They also eat vegetables and berries.

Speaker 1:          00:20:21       Frozen meat isn't a deterrent there. Upper molar that sit sideways at 90 degrees, let's them rip into ice covered carcasses. Their teeth are so sharp and strong that they can even eat bones. Whoa. Damn. Once they got food, they often bury it to save for later mere hours after a meal. They'll go on the hunt again. Ferocious, ferocious little fucks. Ugliest Shit too. Yeah, so we don't have a cutie Po, one of those cutie. We'd be like to Wolverine. Hi, Mr Wolverton. I'm here to help you on targe with to the forest. Now they're here to eat your kids. I'm waiting for some woman to bring one on the plane as a support wolverine. Oh yeah, for sure. Yeah, some crazy. It's always a woman. Yeah. And always one that's like over 50 and on all kinds of medication. If you're a dude and you bring a wolverine out of playing the beat and beat your ass, um, has wolverine ever killed a person?

Speaker 1:          00:21:16       There's some women that'll get offended by that. Why does it have to always be in women? Is it you? It's not you. Right? Right. I'm not talking about you. Alright. Why getting personal? Why? Why do we hope to be gender specific? You know what I'm saying? Like if I'm saying, oh, it's probably a woman doesn't mean hey, no women, right. It means it's probably really a woman, right. Because being honest, the peacock person, that was a woman, that was a woman and then the the, but in the [inaudible], the defense of women, a guy got an emotional support alligator. Recently there was a guy and he's an idiot. But I hear about that. I'm wonder how many of those people, including the peacock lady, are doing it just for attention because they know that people will talk about it. I think people that have like, I'm saw this girl and see in San Diego, La Jolla, she came to the restaurant with her micro pig.

Speaker 1:          00:22:04       That's not real. You know, that's not real. They met, they made those, yeah, coming. She explained it to me. No, she adopted a pig and then kept it and then fed it and then drove some ungodly amount of time, like two days to Texas to drop it off at a pig sanctuary. That's how crazy for animals. Whitney Cummings. So through Whitney I learned that pigs are just pigs. There's no micro pig. It's just a pig that they don't feed. Oh. For Real. For Real. So they just starved it and it just says, keeps them on getting big by not giving it a lot of food in there. Cool. Pawn it off on a sucker pig. Exactly. Scotty eat. Exactly. It's greedy little pig. Yeah. I mean they're famous for getting fat. That's what they love to do. So they'll pawn it off on some person and then, cause they can't afford not to feed it.

Speaker 1:          00:22:51       Another person doesn't know any better. They think they're getting a micro pig. Oh, it's give me small and cute forever. Now you're going to have a thousand pound pig. If you give you feed it everything and wants to eat, it's going to keep growing. It's like, Damn I, how did my pig grow supposed cause the sole pig, there's no micro. It's like micro people. Like if you look at people from like the civil war day, they were always 125 pounds. Well why was that? Because they didn't have any fucking food, man. The same guy today probably be 200 pounds. Yeah. [inaudible] and all that stuff and everything in it. Oh yeah. Well even just eating regular food, just like real meat and potatoes and vegetables and shit. You're not gonna be 125 pounds. I was probably starving. They probably didn't have three meals a day back in the civil war era and snacks. I read this book by this, a pool hustler. It was a McGurty life of a billiard hustler. I think it was so really interesting

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       book because it was about a guy who survive by traveling around on trains, like a Hobo gambling, playing pool and billiards in the depression. But during the depression, he was talking about almost starving to death, like a people who would knock on people's door and beg for Food and you know, people would just come out with a plate of food and give it to them. Like everybody was like on the edge. People had to really rely on people. They didn't like rely on people for food. There was no fucking jobs. There's a lot of people back then, you know, we, we're looking at these homeless folks and like for the most part, my opinion is you're looking at, people probably have an undiagnosed or untreated mental illness. A lot of that. I think it's a lot. I don't know what the number is, but I would think it's a lot.

Speaker 4:          00:24:27       And then there's also people that make mistakes down the line and then people that you know had terrible childhoods, horrible abuse, sexual abuse, violence, the evil parents. You know, parents die, leave him alone, foster care, all that kind of shit. And like it's not their fault a lot of times. And then as as humans we should do something to, to take care of it. But on the other hand, and we just don't know who's who out there. Yeah, exactly. Who's mentally ill, who just needs help and dimensional people, man, they need help too. But like how do you force them to, you know, how do you force them in it?

Speaker 5:          00:25:04       Oh, how do you just get them real help so that because yeah, the way they do help people with pills and all that stuff. Some, some of it works and some of it doesn't work. [inaudible] you know what I mean? And some of it's just like creates a dependency on something. Yeah. So it's just like the, the system just from the beginning needs to be fixed and not just like pills and,

Speaker 4:          00:25:27       right. Have you ever been on any kind of psych medication? No. Have you ever taken an Adderall? No. Me Neither. I want on to though. You do. Jamie gave me a little bit of Adderall once allegedly. And uh, I didn't take it.

Speaker 5:          00:25:40       I looked at it and was like, I don't do it man. Go and gave it to you cause I haven't taken it either. I had it for a long time. I was like, I don't think I'm going to take it. You want it.

Speaker 4:          00:25:48       It's just I've, I've known so many people that do it and they get real weird. They get weird. And it is a, it's, it's an amphetamine and when you take amphetamines, especially if you don't take amphetamines responsibly, really strange things happen. And one of the things happen is people get really paranoid. They get really weird. They get, they start having delusions of grandeur. They start thinking that what they're doing is very important. That a lot of people are out to take them down. And uh, you see that with people that, that do too much Adderall, they don't follow the prescription. They just start chewing them all day. Whoa. Things can get real slippery, like slippery. It's like

Speaker 5:          00:26:30       a mess slipper. That's how the hurts because they, I guess they get immune to it. So they gotta take extra. Oh yeah, you did. And then then the more you take, the worse it gets. Yeah. Tolerance

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       is a real for everything. Yeah. I would assume. I mean, they even have tolerances for snake venom. You know, the, one of the things that snake handlers do, they'll give themselves a little bit of Adam every day. Oh mom sells immune to snake venom. Your body's an amazing adaptable thing, which is why vaccines work. Right? So why these crazy fucks? It don't want us to have vaccines like, listen, you know, we gotta be real careful with claiming expertise on this shit. We gotta be real careful with getting fucked over by pharmaceutical companies and big business. We gotta be real careful of that too. But we also gotta be real careful of not listening to these doctors and researchers that are struggling to find the ways to cure these horrible infectious diseases. Cause they've got a lot of them nailed through vaccines. It's so confusing out there.

Speaker 4:          00:27:29       You can make an argument for on any team chore, Anything You can cause. It's tough to figure out. I know a lot of logical, intelligent people that, that think that vaccines cause autism and I'm not a doctor so I don't know if you know that. Yeah, I think, I think none of Doctor Ah, um, puts, uh, I've heard logical, intelligent people argue that that vaccines can cause autism. I'm like, man, you're not a scientist. Like how could you say that? Cause you saw it in a documentary. I know it's interesting when you see something in the documentary that sounds good. You want to relate. It's fact. I'm as guilty as that as anyone. Probably more guilty than most. I'm guilty of doing that a lot, but just recognizing that over time I've gotten to this point where I'm like, maybe I should just shut the fuck up about something that I don't actually know about and try to figure out what it is instead of saying what it is, what they, what they do know is that vaccines have stopped the spread of a fucking bunch of awful disease.

Speaker 4:          00:28:32       Saved a bunch of plagues, small pox that Lindsay Fitz Harris woman who's been on the podcast, Jamie, she sent me some image of a, some people with smallpox, bunch of stuff about small smallpox is her riffing just horrific with how it kills you. Her riffing, they nip that shit in the bud with vaccines. Maybe. Maybe they've changed. Maybe, maybe some vaccines do get people autism. That's what that guy's back looks like. Can maybe some vaccines, vaccines do give some people autism, but overall, most of the time it helps everybody. Like there's going to be some things that affect people differently, but then that, but that means you can't stop taking it or giving it to everybody. That's no constellation happen. Right. It's no constellation if you get autism from it or if your child and talk to them from it. Yeah, but it's one of those things that's bad.

Speaker 4:          00:29:31       Everybody grows up without it. Right. You know, it's a messy thing about peanut person, right? Like this not is not like clean pro. Like are you pro abortion? Well, I'm pro abortion up to a point. Right? Right. When it gets to be like seven months, it's that seems to, you know, it gets longer in the pregnancy. That seems like if you're talking about like the first few days, right? Yeah. What do you, what is that like three cells, pro abortion. If I get the girl pregnant, you know, as far as it takes. As far as the text. Yeah. It's um, it's a weird, you know, with many, many, many subjects. There's like a weird, well, it's not exactly, well, it's this, you know, if there's a vaccine court for reason, vaccines have done damage to people. People gotten injured from vaccines where during the injection site something happened.

Speaker 4:          00:30:22       Peter Hotez was talking about that he's a doctor that's a specialist in infectious diseases and vaccines and he was explaining that there's five environmental factors that they think were five factors they think contribute to a child possibly getting autism. They've narrowed it down to these things with the most current research, but they're all during the womb. It's, it's contact with things during the womb or in the genetics of the mother. They think that it has something to do with the developmental process while the child is in vitro in the woman's body, not after birth. They don't think it occurs after birth, but I don't know that. I mean they could be wrong. Then it could be current and then they could change that opinion a year from now. They can find new evidence. That shit happens all the time. Yeah, exactly. It really does. It happens all the time, but what we have to do is make sure we have fucking people that are working on this shit, trying to figure out the way to stop diseases because otherwise some Spanish flu type shit comes rolling around all the bullshit and kill everybody.

Speaker 4:          00:31:20       That Spanish flu killed millions and millions of people. The 1920s sound lethal at all. It's just Spanish flu. It's just like, how did that kill people? Sounds like a drink. Yeah. To bring that full circle back to downtown la or that typhus outbreaks have happened. Just a couple of [inaudible]. Same thing as typhoid fever I think, but it's a very close to new one. It's a new one. It's a new typhoid that they don't have a fucking vaccine for. I was down there the other day just trying to buy donuts downtown. It's the allure of downtown has escaped me. Everybody. Everybody thinks it's amazing with Jamie and I talked and we've been talking about this forever, we wanted to get a loft in downtown, like up high and start filming podcasts up there because I think that would be the coolest backdrop like for Youtube, like you and me sitting here and behind us.

Speaker 4:          00:32:10       You just all building by sometimes square MTV shit, whites and shit like that would be an amazing backdrop for a podcast screen that now be safe. Yeah, can't do that. If I was going to green screen something, it would be like current events, Shit. It would be like Melania Trump slapping dog's hand away. I'd be like, did you see that shit? Like that would be what I would, I wouldn't pretend I'm in the savannas and a man like behind me is the Cheetah creeping up on me and everybody sees it like does he know? He know

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       I'll be sitting in Griffith Park. Behind me is a mountain lion munched on a leg. I was meditating in Griffith Park. Oh Dude. Like one morning and I hear rustling in the bushes and it was a coyote like just waking up. They bite you. Yeah. And I was like, I can't do that anymore. Close my eyes and Griffith Park. Yeah. You go camping out there, they'll bite you. They'll check that you might be dead. They'll take a bite if you just lie in there like damn. Maybe he just recently died. Yeah, they really well they really well their predators. That whole thing is so strange. He people are so strange how we just a, we think it's cool. It's cool to be around these bears and mountain lions and shit. And we have urban Cairo. These ones that like you'll see walking down the street at night. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:33:22       My neighbor had two little dogs and one of them was really old, so then she had to walk them one at a time because she saw a coyote one time coming up on him and she couldn't handle both of them. So she takes, or she used to take each dog out to a walk at night. One at a time. Take a gun. Shit. That fucking rotten dog right in the face. It's hot. That's what a coyote is. A dog. Not her dog. I was talking about the coyote, but actually that's a wolf. It's a small wolf. It's a small wolf. Yeah. Coyote is like a particularly durable and resilient form of Wolf. So shitty wolf. It's a really interesting wolf. There's a great book called Coyote America by uh, Dan Flores. Um, he, I learned about him through my friend Steve and now I think he was his professor and one of his, um, one of his courses.

Speaker 1:          00:34:12       Um, but he is a, a guy who spent an extreme amount of time studying the history and the science behind coyotes for really, really interesting book. But one of the things they found out is that when you kill a coyote, they just make more coyotes to them. Like they know they spread out. Yeah. They, when they yell out, they'd yell out. They communicate in a lot of different ways. The yell out when they kill something, sometimes they yell out when they're trying to figure out where each other's are. And they also yell at like a roll call. Like, cause you know, it's hard out there. So they're like, hey, what's up Jamie? Jamie, they do that. That's part of what they're doing. And when one is missing, they, the female, there's some sort of a chemical or biological reaction and her body makes more puppies.

Speaker 1:          00:35:00       Oh, she says like we're fucking tonight. Yeah, I didn't hear Jamie. We're fucking tonight. They make larger litters fam. So if a normal litter would be like four pups, if someone's missing, they'll make six or eight something along those lines. And now we can't kill them while they spread out to in the 17 hundreds and 18 hundreds you know when people's first started going through the west, their, you know, they were around. But then when we started killing them, they spread to the entire country. They all said they weren't single state. So they weren't like down this way. No, no, no. They weren't everywhere. They're a west animal. They were western animal. And then they went proud. They're in New York City.

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       Oh Shit. For Real. Yes. For Real. There's coyotes in New York City. They have little packs of them running around Times Square. Get outta here bro. For real dude. There's little coyotes that are wandering through central park.

Speaker 5:          00:35:55       Listen, I get that there's mountain lions in Griffith Park. I get that there's cause urban car, but New York City,

Speaker 4:          00:36:02       I might've made up the time square part. Brick best bananas. Definitely York. I'll check. I know they're in New York cause there was a, they probably came from upstate. They've seen them in buildings. [inaudible] coyotes and abandoned buildings where they've decided to make all the cup Nass and abandoned belt. They're all, they're all over downtown La Fam, central park, central park, Bam, coyote motherfucker. Damn Bro on the streets. Coyote. Okay. On the street. So I was telling the truth, they could go to times square easily everywhere. I've gotta look, I'm almost like a tour agitating coyote that has a small wolf. That's what that is. And there we've were infected with them. And here's the thing. This is what you have to be aware of. That's the gentleman that, uh, go back. What is his name? Justin Brown. Yeah. Justin Brown was on the podcast. He tracks coyotes all throughout downtown La. He's biology, a wildlife biologist that works for the state. Really interesting in downtown La. So instead of like being at a ranch outside of Bakersfield and attach a pea mountains, this guy is a look. There's a coyote. Same trap. Same camera trap. Got that? Yeah. Get a picture of that too young James, order that bitch up. Make a note. Yeah. Look why not. Right. We should have coyote picture too. We can't just have a mt line. That's rude. Let's show all the crazy shit that's wandering. See if they got a bear and the camera trap. Hopefully they got a,

Speaker 5:          00:37:19       coyotes are so used to being around that. The way they walk down the street is just like regular. Yeah. Like no trepidation whatsoever. Look at that. Just wandering. Yeah. Yeah. Whistle them. Walk.

Speaker 4:          00:37:32       I remember in 1994 the first, it might've been 93 first time I ever came to La and I was staying at the a Oakwood gardens or Oakwood apartments. Yeah, on Barnum there in Burbank. They're furnished departments where it's where you stay when you first come to la. You don't have a spot. You don't have enough money to get up and you don't know if the show you're on is ever going to last. So I stayed at these Oakwood's apartments and I was driving up the street to the apartment and I saw coyotes. I was like, what is this dog doing? Just wandered around and I was like, Oh shit, those are coyotes. I couldn't believe it. That's fine. I pulled over and I'm looking out the window. There's three little wolves.

Speaker 5:          00:38:10       Isn't it funny how that moment when something you never seen before, you see it and it takes you a second to realize what it is and then you, the word for what it is comes to your head right away. Like you knew it was a coyote even though you've never really seen a coyote before. I was in denial. He was in denial. Yeah. I was thinking it was a dog. Like it was three dogs.

Speaker 4:          00:38:33       Then I had to pull over and I'm like, I remember

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       people telling me they'd seen coyotes, but I thought it was like I saw a mountain lion. Like if some of these I saw a mountain and you're like Holy Shit you did. That's pretty rare, right? Have you ever seen one? No, I've seen to a live. Yeah. See two live ones like out there. Yeah. And what happened? One of them ain't my dog cause when I lived in Colorado, yeah. And you was right there. No, no, no. I was this mountain lion was case in the house I think. Right. And we saw it in the woods at one point in time. And then another one I saw in Santa Barbara in Montecito driving through a neighborhood and saw this animal run across the car in front of the lights and I saw its tail and I was like, Holy Shit, that's a cat. I take it back. I have seen some outlines really, you know, phase on love.

Speaker 1:          00:39:20       Yeah. He moves all over the place. But one time he lived in San Diego, me and Hugh more went to visit him and we is at his house hanging out. And then at night he was like, look out the window in his backyard. And there was like mountain lions in his fucking backyard. Yeah. There was like two or three of them and all I'm thinking is like, how the fuck are we going to get to the car? Oh, like, and he was so casual about it and I was like, wow. Yeah. Yeah. It's time to move son. Yeah. Um, Jamie, did you ever see that video from Colorado where a guy looked out his window? There was three mountain lions on his driveway. He's like super clear iPhone footage and this guy a or android phone, I don't know. I want to use, could be an android.

Speaker 1:          00:40:06       He was saying this weekend he takes more shit for using an android phone than for being a Vegan, for being a black Vegan and what else can media could be. Yeah, yeah. You get more grief forever than android phone. Yeah. It's a weird little battle. Right. It's like Republican, Democrat type Shit. Yeah, it is. It is like people with iPhone really ain't trying to have it, but it's not just that. It's like there's teams. It's like the fucking Orioles were playing the Yankees. You know, people get on a Goddamn team and the iPhones are the Yankees right now. It's weird. Band phone. The phone thing is a weird thing. It's weird that people are so, they're, they're really like so tribal. But their tribal with their phone. Yeah. They made a tribe out of phones. People could make a tribe out of anything. [inaudible] and what's really crazy is the biggest company, the ones that's the most desirable is a company that also makes computers and they, they make their own chip. They make their own hardware. Right? Like that's what's really strange about apple. Like they make everything, they make the software, they make the hardware. They the only, there's only one, you'll have different models, but there's only an iPhone. You get an iPhone or XR, whatever the fuck it is. X Excess Max. But it's only an iPhone. That's all you get. You don't get it. You don't get anything else. Whereas android you got

Speaker 5:          00:41:34       of brands. See the so much variety everybody. Yeah, but truth rough. Jamie's like that. But you gotta have, you gotta be able to deal with that green when the green light comes in and protects them. I was offended by the green bubble. I have friends that I go up on the little screen. Even smart people, I'm like, we've got them on. They fucking green. But maybe if they're smart and your bubble comes a green, it means something. It doesn't look green to them. That's a thing. Yeah. Mine and is pretty cool looking. Yeah. All my Texas, when they come in like they're all, what do they look like? Is there a show you see a prophecy? Well, I think mine minor. Oh, they're blue. Yeah. Blue. So here's come in blue anyway, so it looks blue. What? Do you have a note? Yeah, a galaxy note note nine.

Speaker 5:          00:42:25       Yeah. That's the Shit I have no, those, that's my other phone. Yeah, he told me. Yeah. That thing is bad ass. Yeah. It is a beast of a phone. That screen is amazing. Yeah. It's so big and you like you get the whole screen, there's no cutout. Yeah. And it goes down the side and shit. But I got it just in case like I'm on a flight and I want to watch something on it or just somewhere you want to watch something on it, you download it and you gotta have a full screen instead of having like a getting the iPad on top of that because people have just too much shit. Do you ever use the pen though? That pen is useless to me. Yeah. I would just like, like signed the document today. Like yeah, like Shaundra needed a w nine signed a w nine form from me.

Speaker 5:          00:43:06       I just like downloaded it, signed it and then emailed it back. Wow. Yeah. I've never used it. Yeah. Maybe it's just me. I draw dicks on people's head. That's a perfect use for it. But I also feel like a rebel when I use my android phone. I do. It's hilarious. I feel like a rebel fucking, I'm crazy man. Fucking trans out here. Woo. When do you use your android? Like, like, so you'll have your iPhone. So when do you need more? More often? I'm transition out of one phone number to another, which I have to do often. Oh, okay. Yeah. So you have two different numbers? Yeah. Okay. Getting used to it. Play. I played with it a lot. They got a new one that's coming out. There's a new ones coming out that looks amazing. Do you have 10? No. 10 yeah, it's coming out like in a couple of weeks.

Speaker 5:          00:43:54       Yeah. I try to hold on to it. I don't try to get every new phone. I try to hold onto it for a minute. So I feel like they didn't rip me off and then maybe three or two phones later, then I'll get the other one. But if I buy every phone, I feel like I want to be a rebel within the rebel, you know? He's saying I'll get some old shit. Yeah. I got some old shit. You're not gonna get me like in this loop. But just buying, buying by comparison. Yeah. That's in a weird thing. Like that phone, they could stop right there. That phone's perfect. Like it does everything. Yeah. What more do I need? They take some pictures, makes videos, get on the Internet, ask you questions,

Speaker 1:          00:44:31       gives me answers, send emails. What the fuck else do I need? Don't you don't you don't. It does everything unless they come up with some new shit. But if someone said, Hey Ian, I'll give you $1 million, but you gotta use that phone only for the rest of your life. What'd you say? Yes. This one? Yes. That's crazy, right? Yeah, the breaks. We'll replace it, but that's your phone forever. I know it. I know it will slow down. Well apple phones will slow down because they engineered them and that made me sick. That almost made me stop using apple stuff. I was like, I can't believe that you guys are attributing this to battery life that that's in disingenuine. Then they admitted it, right? Well they admitted it, but they said they did it so that it would give you more battery life cause your battery degrades over time.

Speaker 1:          00:45:24       So they engineered it. That is a convenient, they also must have understood that people were going to get frustrated with the fact that it's slowed down considerably and they would give them an incentive to buy a new phone to say that they didn't say that like, come on, you guys are so God damn smart. You make iPhones. They figured out everything. Yeah, but not that you didn't figure that out. You figured that out on purpose. You also are one of the most successful businesses of all time. Apple has billions of dollars cash just sitting there. They have so much money. Pablo Escobar buried money. They got so much money. Apple is something like how many billions of dollars is apple has 225 billion. Apple has so much cash cash that they could, they could probably wipe out half our debt. This is what they could buy right now and still have 25 billion leftover.

Speaker 1:          00:46:15       They could buy Nike, Ferrari, Twitter, the Manchester United Franchise and the Manchester United football team and still have a, how much left? 25 billion left. I say football for people like yourself that are fishing up. Thank you sir. I didn't say soccer. I appreciate that. Do they say soccer? Um, where are you from originally? Uh, in England? Yeah. No, not in England. And they know it's football. Yeah. Only in America they say soccer. But before that, like where did it, where did it become football? Was it always football in Europe? It was always football. Well why, why when it came over here, did it switch over? No idea. Why didn't they come up with another name for Pho? We ever kick a foot.

Speaker 5:          00:46:59       Paul, I think, I think they were playing football, like the soccer, football, and then somebody picked up the ball and started running with it and they started tackling each other. Like I heard some story like that. Huh? And then they kind of created football and it evolved from there. But then they never changed the name.

Speaker 1:          00:47:18       Isn't it weird that like football is called football when the only person who kicks it is a guy who can't even play the game, the least significant person on the team as far as getting pussy when there's a championship. Yes. It is weird. Yeah. And you're not allowed to hit him. Right, right. And you're not allowed to hit him. Yeah. That's crazy. You can hit him. It's not while he's in motion of his, a vulnerable person to try to be safe. Oh, so you can't hit them all once. Legs up in the area. Oh, that's so ridiculous. What a bitch house rule. If you blow off the ball, you have to block the ball and then you get hit him yet. But in the crazy that that's football. It's only one time it gets kicked. Right. How was that football? Why? Why? What a silly name.

Speaker 1:          00:48:00       Right. Does it make sense? But I'm not mad at it. You know, it's like fine. It's whatever. Imagine if they called, you know, baseball, what would they call it? Foul. If they called it foul. We're playing foul. It's something that happens every now and then. This game has nothing to do with running around the basis. It's about touchdowns. She'd call it touchdown play. Touchdown it. Cause it's just, you know, baseball. It's just like we're trying to get from base to base. Yeah. If they call it baseball touchdown. No, they call it football. Touchdown. Touchdown. The NTL national touchdown league. We're going to, we're going to play touchdown. That's the game. It's not football with your foot. Doesn't have shit to do with it or an explanation of why we call it soccer and it's more confusing than we care to go through. When you go back to England, if you're from England and you talking about it to people, do they resent the term soccer?

Speaker 1:          00:48:52       Like how does that work? Some people do. Like I used to present the term soccer. Really? Yeah. But I live here and it's like get over it. You know what I'm saying? As a person, I got to get over it cause it was my favorite sport growing up, so I just got over it. And then now I even call it soccer. My podcast is soccer. I don't even say football, but when I go to England I just, Oh, just when I'm around football, soccer people, I say football, I get it. Yeah. It's like if I, if I was talking to someone that they wanted to talk about pool but they wanted to call it bumper pool. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:27       The woman's World Cup, they won the World Cup and a United States did for soccer and, but it's not, you know, it's football to people like yourself World Cup. Like how can they call the world cup soccer to a piece to one country that gives the least amount of flux about the sport right now. Weird. That's weird. That's the power of America. That's crazy. If you really stop to think about it, we made them change the name of their thing, but we're like, ah, we're not going to get in there. We'll call it soccer. Okay. We're a card of it, but we're calling it this, they call it, did they call it football in like Argentina? Yeah. Okay. Everywhere. Futball you know, but it's football to start their pronunciation and spelling of it. But then Australia, they're the rebels. The rebels. Oh yeah. They have their own rules. They have structure and the rules flip all they changed the rules for more ruggedness.

Speaker 1:          00:50:16       Yeah. Cause they're too. You know what? It was over there. They were too used to rugby. Like those New Zealand savages. Yeah. Yeah. They're fucking savage. You can't play that bitch ass game when a helmet, these guys are running around biting each other in the Dick and the scrums. Right. That's the most rugged game. Anything to win. That's the game they should play in America. All the CTE problems they're having you. You'd have a little bit of that with, with anything. Contact Sports, you're going to get injuries [inaudible] but I think you'd have less with no gear. So both those things confuse me. I don't know the difference between rugby on Australian rules football and I think in Australia they play both. Yes. Yes. I'd be just confused like what is the difference? Well the ball's different, right? They both seem like, what's a rugby ball look like?

Speaker 1:          00:51:05       Literally look about the same. Is it? No different. Not Note at there is slight differences, but they look about the same. It's like a football with more rounded edges and it's a little more plump as far as I know. They could be playing with a round ball. I literally don't even know. Yeah, I have no idea what a rug now it's kind of like, it kind of looks like an American. That's it. That's a cross between a basketball and a football. It's like a fat football. Yeah. So that's an Australian use football though. It's similar to a rugby ball. Okay. So that's not a foot rugby ball, but it's close. So there's probably like football, Australian rules, football and then rugby ball. Right. What is the rules? What can they do? Yeah. What are they doing different? It's also sometimes referred to in the media as the round ballgame.

Speaker 1:          00:51:49       The world game and international football. Australian was football referred to as Australian football. Hmm. I think that's a little more like fluid. Like the game does stop as much as less stoppages to kind of just keep going. Okay. It says it's a little more fluid where players can pretty much run around where they choose. They still have a specific end side goal to score, but it's more open in between. Another main differences that the game is played in 20 minute quarters, not halves. Hmm. I was trying, I told you a couple while ago, they're adding three verse three basketball to the Olympics coming up and the way that that game is played is so different than traditional basketball. Like it's just a running clock. Once you score you just take it out, throw it background across the line, go score again, it's very fast paced.

Speaker 1:          00:52:32       So they bring in like pock ball to the Olympics? I think so. It apparently it's very popular in Europe. It's not like that big three basketball that sort of started here. It's not that same basketball, but it's popular I guess when will Harris was in here. Will Harris has this a show called anatomy of a fighter. He's a videographer and he went to Dagestan to watch Khabib. Norman Madoff, who's the UFC lightweight champion who's fucking animal man. He just, he's one of the rare undefeated top of the food chain fighters in MMA. They play a game of basketball in Dagestan where they don't dribble the ball at all. They just like wrestle each other to the ground. And even choke each other and get each other in armbars and shit so that they're just practicing Jujitsu. Yeah, there will look. They don't, they don't dribble it all.

Speaker 1:          00:53:18       They're basically playing like ball a football type, but they're shooting at the basketball hoop but they throw each other to the ground. And Khabib, we'll fucking hip toss dudes cause they, they have it right next to the wrestling mats. So part of what they filmed was he was in a wrestling match with this dude when they were trying to take a player out. So he's grabbed a hold of this dude and when he grabs a hold as dude, he drags him to the ground and get him it back, gets him in a harm bar, gets them in a rear naked choke. It's crazy. Macy guy tap and he doesn't let him up. Like here it goes, look, look. He grabs them like they're allowed to do this. The guy slips through, he gets them, they're grappling. First of all, they're grappling on the fucking hardwood floor, full blast glock grappling.

Speaker 1:          00:54:02       And then he takes him to the ground. Like this is serious. This isn't playing around. He takes the dudes back. Now they're on the floor again. They're on the hardwood floor and he's fucking choking them out. Just kind of McGregor them and then they keep going and as they keep going, he's getting the guy in an armbar later. This is, this is this, this is basketball for white dudes that can't dribble. That's all. This is just like how do we, but I don't know man. I think this is the most effective way to use wrestling with basketball.

Speaker 1:          00:54:33       I think they just wanted to make something that's like a really hard workout that's very competitive. I think I, I don't know if other people are doing this in Europe or if this is just something that Dagestan figured out, but look, these are some of the most savage fighters in the UFC. It does look fun. It looks fun. As far as, yeah, I assume I should get Khabib on your back. They just don't have access to a very good basketball and pump to keep it pumped up on the floor is probably not good to be dribbled on. So they just figured out a better game to play instead of dealing with that fucked up on court. That's a ridiculous way to think. Jamie. These are world class fighters. They travel over the world. They have all sorts of gym equipment, they have mats, they have weights, they have everything skin on it.

Speaker 1:          00:55:10       That's a shitty basketball played with lots of basketballs in my life. You would never even try to dribble that missing line to another like American football slash Jujitsu. Slash Ben. A lot of balls to like if you have a dead spot on a court, you almost don't want to play on it. But dude, they could get another ball. They all have brand new sneakers on and leggings and shit. I mean it's not like DAC stands in the middle of nowhere. I don't get goods there. They could, but they might just like this game better. They're just like, fuck it. We're playing this cause we're all better at this. That I think, I think it helps them. I'm saying that your leg made you go one on one with the basket. Maybe I did not understand the rules. They make them up. You said it was like I was swearing for no reason.

Speaker 1:          00:55:47       Oh, they're there. Like they're, they're talking out a dispute. Yeah. How would you argue with Cabebe? You can, that's the top dog as the beast of the fucking crew. Um, but yeah, which it's weird with what people that get really into, like cricket, cricket is one that the Europeans brought over to India, right. They brought it to the western days. They brought it to any country that they colonize and all those countries love it and they play it. Oh. So it's a colonization game and then nowadays you have like, almost like the equivalent of like world cups of cricket and all the countries. Australia is a big

Speaker 5:          00:56:24       cricket country because they in that, so it's a big thing of west in these and everything. Strange looking game too. Right? It's just boring. Takes, takes days to play sometimes days. Yeah. Days. Yeah. For a week I think sometimes. Yeah. Yeah. Well, one game. Yeah. How many hours a day? Long. Too many. Oh my God. It's too many, man. I, I, I used to kill me. It was fun to play in a backyard because it's, you can just get some sticks and stick them in the ground and then put one across the top as a wicked. This is a game I would have no idea. I couldn't even draw you a picture of what the stick looks like. Three sticks, three sticks, three sticks. And then you put like one on top across the, all of them send out when the, you're out when the guy who's pitching or Bolan and you swing in or if you don't swing and it hits the wicked and they knock over a comp, kinda like bowling sticks, then you're out. But yeah, and then you get points that you hit it. Trying to protect the wicked, protect the wicked and hit it so far that you can run from stick to stick. You and your partner who's batting at the other end, and then the most amount of runs you can get that just adds to the score. Can I see that? I want to see that. That sounds so weird. Pull up a video of dudes playing cricket like I've ever watched it go. Yeah, I think I've seen like highlights on television maybe.

Speaker 5:          00:57:53       You know it's funny that you never seen cricket. Not a fucking get no, no chance. I don't know. See I'm already stunned by their outfits. Yeah. Got An have nothing on. Some dudes are covered up in gear. Those that are that the guys with the helmets cause the ball is hot as fuck. I got hit by a cricket ball by the strongest kid in school on time. Oh. Then as I come down the way they throw it, this was so weird. Well I like the guys in the outfield don't have anything cause I just catch the ball bare handed, right? Yeah. Bare handed. Yeah. And I feel like they should have met. He throws it, he runs at you [inaudible] he runs and literally tries to hit you with the ball. That's crazy. And then does it have to hit the ground first? Is that the deal?

Speaker 5:          00:58:36       Yeah, I think, yeah it does. It does. From what I remember because it seems like it, but the dude like runs across the line. This is a bullshit game. Some 100% bullshit game. Like, I don't, I'm not a big fan of baseball. I used to be like, yeah, I think it's kind of boring. My wrestling coach used to say, it's not a sport, it's a skills game to skills game. It's not a sport. You ever see a baseball path so fucking tired. He had to push himself. I had to push coach Murphy wrestling coach in high school. Also the same guy tried to get me to play football when I weighed 135 pounds. Crazy ass all. Yeah, maybe saw some natural athlete Shit in, you know, I just thought it was mean. Oh yeah. That was mean. I'd been to be good. Those mean I don't know the wrestler because you put them in a great

Speaker 1:          00:59:21       safety. Probably just fucking people up. I would get crippled. That's what would have happened. The dude on our team, his name is Bob Baker, he weighed a good solid 300 pounds, so big. Maybe not, maybe I'm exaggerating, but he was two 50 he was our heavyweight and I was like, how? How is he and me? How are we going to play the same game where he could just run me over? What did he want you to play? I Dunno. We didn't even, just didn't get that far. I'm like, you're crazy. I was already fighting too. I was doing martial arts and wrestling at the same time like, look man, I can't, I don't know. I'm not doing that. I'm already doing shit. That freaks me out. Physical shit scares the shit out of me all the time. I don't want to get scared by even bigger people.

Speaker 1:          00:59:58       At least martial arts and wrestling was confined to your own weight class. You know if I had a wrestle some Badass dude, at least, uh, it was my own weight class, you know? Yeah. This is like the weight scale is all over the place on the football field. Yeah, man. It's all over the place and the athleticism is all over the place too. You know, you can get a guide like Hershel Walker and you know, if you're in high school and there's a Herschel Walker in high school and he's on some team that your opposing good luck, fuck face this, this people that are just superior, just superior. It's not a damn thing you can do about it. There are people like that in martial arts, like when you're all wrestling. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. There's things like that and outliers. You know, there's outliers in all sports and a lot of it has to do with what you did growing up.

Speaker 1:          01:00:49       Sometimes people do things grown up like a lot of wrestlers turns out like working on farms as a kid is a great way for wrestlers to be super strong. You know who's who make good restless cowboys. Oh yeah. Because they, they, they, you know, they stare at their, get the cow fucking cow to the ground. They do it all the time. They practice on them. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. We'll also, they're tough cause you're gonna get banged up a lot. And then a lot of it is like mental toughness, you know, but people who have to cat, like there's a dude, Matt Hughes, he was like one of the greatest Walter wards of all time and he was ungodly strong dude from Illinois on the farm on a farm wrestling animals. I was at a party one time, right? I was at a party one time and he was thrown by these rappers I used to write on this show.

Speaker 1:          01:01:36       There's this lounge. So one of the rappers, master fool dude from Brooklyn was friends with these cowboy. It's a great name, master fans. The fool, he was dope to me. He's like, he's like the flavor flavor of the, the up the rappers for that group. And he's just like, he's just talks to everybody. So he became friends with these cowboys. They came to visit La for a week and live in the house with the rappers and you know, they were real cowboys. They're like, have that last Sue's out on the set and shit like that. So then at the party, this black dude with dreads got into a argument with one of the cowboys and be like, we're not gonna fight in the house. So everybody walks around the corner to the street and in five seconds that cowboy had the black dude

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       with dreads tied up with his pants, just this tucked like twisty tied his body and had him on the ground bleeding Jesus. And then it was like, all right, let him up and let's start again. And he got up and he just did it to the black dude again. And I was like, I'll never fuck with a cowboy if, if a cowboy is a wrestler, like if he knows how to Russel too. Both of those things. Yes, wrestlers are so God damn strong. You don't realize until they grab you and then you realize how helpless you are. So weird feeling. And even if you, you can wrestle if you'd like. I wasn't a good wrestler in high score, but I made it to the states. And, uh, I remember when, uh, I was wrestling this kid who eventually became friends with, cause he's, he used to come to nautilus plus, which was a place where I was teaching taekwondo and we ran into each other when we were both like 20, like probably 20 or something like that.

Speaker 4:          01:03:14       It was really cool. It was a really nice guy. His name is Murphy too. I don't remember his first name. It might've been, that might've been his first name. A lot of Irish people named Murphy, like the most common name amongst Irish people probably. But uh, I was like doing pretty good in like regional shit. But this guy got ahold of me and I was like, fuck. She just made me realize like this is another level of wrestling. He had been wrestling all of his life. I'd only been doing it for a year. He just ragdoll on me around. I was like fuck. And he wasn't even like, like a champion. Yeah. I don't think he won the states. And then whoever did win the states didn't win the nationals. So it was like there's this like tears to evals. And then like a national high school champion Ain't shit compared to a division one NCAA Amir, all American college wrestler, those college wrestlers are off the chain and then they ain't shit compared to like Jordan burrows.

Speaker 4:          01:04:04       It's not that they're not shit. I shouldn't, I never say that about, I mean just saying that in comparison because I admire them almost more than any other athlete because there's no professional venue for what they do. One of the more amazing things about wrestling is the go into it knowing there's no professional sport. There's no perfect other than, you know, pro wrestling is different. It's, it's entertainment, but there's no professional, 135 pound wrestling, 180 pound rep, there's not an that. They just love it. They just love it and it's the toughest thing to do physically. They're fucking animals. But then when you get to the top of the top of the food chain, like a multiple time world champion like Jordan burrows, he had a wrestling match with Ben Aspirin and he just ran him over just over. And Ben is one of the best grapplers to ever compete in MMA.

Speaker 4:          01:04:48       And he was also a two time Olympian. The rest of them. Yes. And that guy, he ran him over and Ben asked her and runs most people over when he wrestles with them. Yeah. Levels, levels, levels. It's never ends with speaking Avastin. Is he awake? He's awake. We can talking. He's a, he handled it like a champion. Yeah. He a went on a Ariel Helwani show and talked about it and just said that, yeah, it sucks that the guy's a douchebag if you're feeling like sucks losing to him. Uh, you know, I don't like them. He said, uh, you know, he just, what can he do? He's like, he's not going to read the comments and he's a smart guy. He's a very smart guy. But uh, he took it like a man to be able to go and do an interview right after you get knocked out like that.

Speaker 4:          01:05:34       It's very admirable, but that's who he is. That's how you get to be a guy who says good or wrestlers. A guy like Ben Aspirin who can handle a loss like that. The what do you think of the, I forgot the, I can't, I can't pronounce the guy's name. Who beat him? Jorge Mossville Mazda doll. What he said after the fight, but he said he would smack him if he saw him at whole foods. I think, I think it's just a little too much. You want I, I can't, I don't know the history. The history is rough. Excuse me. It's like 10 years of them, uh, given him a hard time of if Ben asked her and given miles. But all according to Mossville lot of talking shit, which some people think is friendly in Moundsville street. Jesus doesn't fuck around. All right. You want to talk shit.

Speaker 4:          01:06:19       You want to talk shit just street Jesus. He will fucking make fun of you after we flat lines here. And that's what I did. He flatlined them in five seconds, made them the fastest Evekeo in UFC history and then mocked him afterwards and said he would smack him if he saw him in whole foods. But see, we're talking about it. So Mazda dollars smart. This is a, this is amazing marketing ploy, right? I mean, he's, he's become in one fight the most talked about fighter in the sport because he did something in the sport that's been around for a little bit that nobody's ever done before. Yeah. Ben Asker was undefeated, undefeated and Mazda doll comes out flat lines like that and talk some pretty vicious shit after the fact and even mimicked him laying on the floor, which looks scary the way he was out.

Speaker 4:          01:07:05       Yeah. Mazda doll. We'll say a calls out easy. Conor McGregor. I want to break his face. Yeah, that would be, that's a rough fight. That's a rough fight for Conor Moz Woodall was a big fellow too. I mean, he's, he really belongs at one 70 that's where he's fighting. He fought at one 55 but really tortured himself to make that weight. All right. He's a big guy. You're talking about a guy who knocked out cowboys Serone knocked out Darren tail, knocked out Ben Aspirin. I mean, he's knocking out big welterweights big Darren tills a big welterweight. He's big. He's not a guy coming up from 155 pounds. He's never making 0050505155 so yeah. So he's one way class a heavier and he's really running into like the last few fights. He's, he's coming into his own. These are really becoming something special. He had a real close uh, decision loss to Wonderboy.

Speaker 4:          01:08:05       Wish I could remember how that fight went down. I D I just think it was a decision, I don't know if it was a split decision or you now know this decision, but I think it was just wonderful outpointed them. I don't think there was any knockdowns or anything Mazda though. Yeah that was Mossville but Wonderboy is a particularly difficult guy to fight and especially for three rounds. Pedis recently knocked him out but a pet is just hit him with the perfect punch and that can happen to anybody. And Pedis timed it. And Pedis is a beast as wild. Yeah. He's a wild man. He's a fantastic fighter. Like losing to him it's like, yeah, you lost to one of the best fighters ever. And he also like, he's a guy who dropped Tony Ferguson. I mean pet is knocked out. Cowboys Serone pet is knocked out.

Speaker 4:          01:08:45       Joe Lozan with his crazy head chain. That is is a monster. This is like, he'll win one and then lose one. Yeah. Wow. It's, it's a crazy division man. It's filled with murderers. Just murder after murder. Both divisions 55 and 70 and I think pedis is probably going to do real good at 70 because he's healthier. You know? I think he went down to one 45 and it almost killed him. It was just too much. Man. He had nothing in the tank. And then Max Holloway beat him up. He lost two a, I think he lost the Charles only rera. I think so. I might be wrong. He might've caught Charles Olivera.

Speaker 4:          01:09:20       Hmm. I don't know. Pettis has the most legit crazy look in his eye pedis one right. Choked him. Banqueting choke him. That's right. That's right. I'm confused. He lost to someone else at one 45 who else did he lose it to at 45 Oh, Barboza was 55 Dustin. Boy, I don't think that was 55 and he lost a toe that was 45. He doesn't say what he lost the Tony, right? Yes. He lost the, Tony broke his hand and the fight and he hasn't stopped, but it was a great fight. Wound up dropping him. Oh, okay. So Charles Oliver, Edson Barboza and then Oliveira think that was thing that was 55. I think Max Holloway was 45. I don't know man. I'm not sure though. And then he went back up to 55 the other Dustin Pourri a fight that was, um, that was, he got injured and that was at 55 catch weight.

Speaker 4:          01:10:15       That fodder. He missed the weight. Oh, he missed a fight with Max. So he's trying to get down to 45. So featherweight debut was against Olivera. So he submissions Olivera submitted ovarian is featherweight debut. Okay. So he had two fights at that weight and that weight was torturous for him and he didn't make it for the Max Hallway fight. Um, and then Jim Miller's definitely a 55 pound fight and all the other ones were 55 until he got to Steven Thompson. And that was the last one. Um, wonder boy that was uh, that was at welterweight. Yeah. Yeah. That was an amazing fight. I mean, so I think sometimes these guys, it's just too much, man. It's just too much. He beat Michael Cassa says he beat Cassa and caste is another one. He was fighting at 55 and now he moved up to 70. Yeah. That ended up being a catch weight fight.

Speaker 4:          01:11:04       He's guessing missed these fucking guys, man. They're, they're killing themselves. That weight cutting. Imagine if that was the case with soccer, like before a soccer game, everybody had like, you had a certain amount of guaranteed weight on the field. Imagine like Ian, you know, you are whatever position it is, you have to cut down to 130 pounds. You'd be like, fuck the drain your body in a sauna. And then everybody weighs in that. Everybody rehydrates and then the next day you played as grueling ass game. That'd be ridiculous. Right? Fighting is the most tiring thing. It would totally compromise the game, wouldn't it? Some magic football players had to do that. Imagine football players only had like, okay guys, whatever the team is, it has to weigh 4,000 pounds. That's it. No more. And so you have to decide, hey, you know Bob can't cut lower than to 60 we checked his body fat Joe, you're going to have to get down to one 80 Jamie

Speaker 6:          01:11:54       when we were kids playing football we had to weigh in and that sort of happened. We were like yeah cause a, if you were a certain weight, like you had to have stripes on your helmet and it means you could only play like on the line. You couldn't be carrying the ball cause you'd be fucked. Nope. No kids could tackle you. Fuck them all up. So there was like definitely a limit. And I remember I did have to wear the trash bag and like cut five pounds or try to, I don't know fucking know how much I weighed, but it was so I could be a tight end and catch the ball. Cause I was a little, I was like on the border,

Speaker 4:          01:12:18       dude, that was such so bad for kids. I had a friend in high school, my friend Steve and he's all of his brothers like six one, six, two, he's like five, six. He never grew. And there was because all throughout high school and junior high school, he was cutting weight and wrestling. Dan, I guarantee you it had something to do with it. Everyone else's family is tall or is and he was always tired or his dad is not, he's real dad. Oh No, it was brothers looked just like, Huh, okay. He uh, he was always tired. He'd be walking around the hallways like this. Like uh, cause he didn't do wrestling camps. He would do the whole thing. So he's always wrestling who's always exhausted. Always. It's a terrible thing for kids. The fact they still have kids do that is fucking madness. It's madness.

Speaker 4:          01:13:02       People didn't know any better. My parents didn't even ask me when I got on the wrestling team, they didn't have that. You're not cutting weight, are you? They didn't even ask me. They had no idea. Did you just listen to the coach? Coach tells you to lose weight. You gotta lose weight. Fuck so bad for the body. It's so bad for your brain too, because dehydrates your brain and then you're in class. You're trying to listen in class and you're fucking, it's worse than being hung over. That's true because all they tell us to do now is drink water and stay hydrated, and then you're doing something that's, you can't put anything in your system. You're just trying to drain it out. It doesn't affect you mentally. Yeah. Yeah. When you get dehydrated, your brain works like shit. Right? Like they say, that's one of the things that happens to people in the desert when they start dying of thirst.

Speaker 4:          01:13:48       They can't think straight. Right. They don't, they don't make good decisions. Yeah. I've been fatigued like in soccer practice and you're just like, you'll be wearing an opposing player shirt and just from fatigue, I'll just pass it to you just to not have to have the responsibility of this ball. You know what I'm saying? For Real, like fuck it and I'm trying to make team at the time and I'm like making just blatant mistakes. I'm just so tired, man. Yeah. Fatigue makes cowards of men, Vince Lombardi's lawn. Hey did did that to me in college. Where are you falling out? I'm Greentree at all his stories at this point in the video. He said he hadn't had water for like 18 hours and he's still climbing up hill and needs to find it. Yeah. Great. That's insane. Well, he had to get rescued. I don't know if he broke his arm.

Speaker 4:          01:14:35       I haven't chatted with him, but he thinks he broke his arm too. It is a, if you go to my friend Adam Green trees, Instagram, Adam. Dot. Green Tree. He documented this con that he went in for a thing called the Himalayan tar that lives in New Zealand and it lives in these Alpine mountain areas. Oh, I don't know what's Alpine mountain dangerous slippery mountain areas. And uh, he got stuck out there and they had to get rescued and fell into the frozen glacier river and was freezing to death. Had a climate to his, a sleeping bag soaking wet. Yeah. Really dangerous. Fell thought he broke his arm. Yeah. Was worried that he might have broke his leg. Did he pull out his camera and film half of it too? Probably. I don't think he filmed much of it. He felt filmed some of it, but he was having a really hard time and then he had to get rescued and he had to go somewhere where the helicopter could land so they could winch him and carry him up and rescue him and take him to the hospital.

Speaker 4:          01:15:29       Fucking dangerous shit. There's a lot of these guys like Adam, who's a good friend of mine who loves to go on these like visionquest solo adventures. So he'll go to the mountains and camp out by himself for 28 days and he films and it puts it up on Instagram. Right. We're just talking to himself and true like hunting elk and he's like mountain areas. And last year that's his, uh, his campsite. Last year he had a one on one encounter with a grizzly bear and he had a pistol with him and he's documenting him, trying to hold off this mama grizzly was standing up in the background. She made several charges at him and he didn't even know that the pistol was jammed. The ammunition was the wrong size. So the lever like Ci, when you cock it, it couldn't, it couldn't fit another bullet in there.

Speaker 4:          01:16:15       So he had a big dummy gun. He's pointing a gun to Sunday, even read it man. So if you pull the trigger, nothing would have happened. So then he realized that that was a problem when he, I guess he had tried to fire it a to make sure it does work or something. So then he had to realize that he had to put, he could put one bullet in the chamber, but he couldn't reload. He could reload musket style. Yeah, so he had one bullet, essentially one bullet, he the wrong ammo for the pistol and you only get one shot with one of those charts. You don't even get one man. You know when they're running at you, you are shitting your pants and you can't believe it. You're going to miss half the bullets. If you have 10 bullets, if you hit it once, you're lucky.

Speaker 4:          01:16:54       It's madness because you're not going to shoot when it's 10 feet away from you. You're going to shoot as it's running towards you and you, you, I don't think you're going to be able to hold that position. It's too crazy. What is the bear doing when it's like making charges at him, but you're not coming at him trying to get you to get the fuck away from its babies. Almost always. Almost always get the fuck away from my babies. It's almost always a woman, female bear rather protecting their code that's there. They don't fuck around some asshole that might be a hunter. He might be hunting bear. You might want to shoot my baby. Oh yeah. They don't know. Yeah. You might just be, you know, they don't think of humans as a good thing. Humans are dangerous. Right. You know, it's not our are fucking weird.

Speaker 4:          01:17:34       They're predators. Yeah. I'm just, I'm surprised bears don't attack humans just more often based on that. Like how do they distinguish who's a hunter and who's not. They don't think of hunters as being something they should attack. They think that they should get the fuck out of there because when they see guns go off and then a bowl of bullet hits a bear right next to them, that bear kind of explodes and screams and agony and falls to the ground. They just want to get the fuck out of there and not have it happen to them. Right. So if they've seen that ever in their life, they've seen a bear gets shot, which if you're in a place where bears get hunted, it's very likely that they have seen that. They just run away. They smell people they run, they want to get the fuck out of their bears.

Speaker 4:          01:18:12       Look at humans like predators, only in places where people hunt parents. The problem is when people don't hunt bears, bears have zero fear of humans and then bears wind up killing people. This is what you see in Yellowstone because those bears are grizzly bears and the only place in America where you can hunt grizzly bears is in Alaska and in Alaska. They have a different attitude and they're starting to open up grizzly bear seasons. I think there was one that we're trying to do in Wyoming and there might've been one somewhere else where they were trying to do, they do it in Canada, but they recently banned it in British Columbia, and the reason why they banned it is not because the people that live near the grizzly bears, they're encouraging it because these, these things are fairs coming today and dangerous, right? It's the people that live in the cities are the most people like this, the biggest population center in British Columbia, in Vancouver, right?

Speaker 4:          01:19:05       It's all urban, so that's the giant mass of people. But the people that live like where my friend Mike Hockridge lives, those people don't have a say. And those are the ones who live with bears, right? They have wolves and bears all over the place up there and the black bears, which you can hunt, those are not even dangerous. I mean they're dangerous but not dangerous compared to grizzlies. Grizzlies are fucking dangerous in those cities making those decisions from that people, even conservative people that are animal lovers and just don't understand what a bear is. They're not kill. I mean the idea is that they want to stop trophy hunting cause you see like Cecil the lion, that kind of shit. It's disgusting. And it is. It is a lot in a lot of ways like wanting to go and just shoot these things just to stop them and put them on your walls.

Speaker 4:          01:19:50       There's a lot of weird shit to that that I, I totally understand your feelings on it. I get it. But the grizzly bear thing is a different thing. There was the people that were raised on the cartoon and they're like, stop killing these cartoons. Yeah. The cartoon version. Not The animal that they saw growing up today. I have no idea. Well, even in Africa, the exact area where Cecil the lion was killed, they had a recently killed 200 lions because they're lions. Yeah. Because so many lions had survived because there was no hunting because they came back, they came back up. It's a weird, it's not good. It's not ideal. The situation's not ideal cause it's so, so bizarre and twisted. The animals survive because people pay to kill them. That's what the African wildlife model in these encaged areas is. So they have like 10,000 acres or some shit like that.

Speaker 4:          01:20:44       They put it in fences. Right, right. And then inside those fences, you have zebras and giraffes and all these different animals and you can come over there and pay and you can go and hunt these animals. That's, that's a lot of the area. So at this guy who, that Cecil guy who shot that lion, he paid like $50,000 to go and hunt a lion. And there's probably one a day, two a day, three a day. So there's hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars of revenue coming in. This revenue comes in for these guys that want to kill lions, and what they do is they use it to raise more lions and they use it to pay professional hunting. These people called professional hunters are basically game wardens to keep out poachers and to make sure that these animals don't get like rhinos, don't get their horns chopped off and murdered just just for their horns, things, elephants for their tusks, things along those lines.

Speaker 4:          01:21:33       So they need to hire people to protect against poaching. Because look, in Africa, there's a lot of people that, and especially in these areas where they have these hunting areas, these vast rural areas, people are extremely poor and they want animals to just to eat, and they're going to call that poaching and they have to pee. So then it gets even squirrely there, right? It's not, it's not an ideal situation by any stretch of the imagination. But because no hunters were coming in now because of all the bad press after the Cecil the lion shit, they had to kill 200 lions because [inaudible] cause that many like got born and grew up in because they have a real unnatural situation over there where they're breeding these lions and then they put them in the like some, every place does it a different way. And some places are free range where there's no fence at all.

Speaker 4:          01:22:17       That is true. There's some places that are like that, but some places it's all fenced in. The whole thing's fenced in. It's like a zoo, like a fake wild fake. It's, they took the wild and they made it fake. Just put a fence around the wild and then they kept introducing food and then they have lions that they keep in very specific areas and they feed them and then they'll transport them to the middle and then they have the hunter comes that day and they tell them where the lion is and the guy goes out there, boom, shoots the lion. And poses with the lion. It's perverse. It's Kinda been a perverse. On the other hand, these animals that are in there, particularly at the antelopes and black bucks and not knitting now Neil guy and all these crazy wild fucking antlered creatures, they're in greater numbers than they've ever been. So it's so twisted. It's like the numbers are so high because people want to come in and pay to hunt them. Right? But then the numbers are high so people can hunt them. It's not like so that they can keep the whole wildlife ecology free in Rome. And look how vibrant Africa is now that we've stepped in with all these conservation dollars. Not really. No. It's fenced in and then people drive up to a spot, get out, boom, take a picture to weird. We fuck up everything.

Speaker 5:          01:23:31       Great job. It's weird. Great job people. Yeah, we're the best. I'm reading a, an explanation of a person that has gone to this park in Zimbabwe to go see the lions and they've done this in the past and they went back more recently and uh, this is hilarious. Read this thing here.

Speaker 4:          01:23:48       Then our hose gave us our safety orientation. He told us to speak to the lines in a calm voice, approached slowly and to pet them on their backs. Only then our hosts handed out skinny sticks to each of us. He explained that if a lion approached us in a threatening manner, we should switch the stick back and forth in the grass is tracked them

Speaker 7:          01:24:10       what?

Speaker 5:          01:24:11       What will I have to eat you? There's a Jesus Christ that says that they thought that they were going to go see like child baby cubs in a case. Definitely not. They're like 18 months old almost, you know, a little bit older. They're probably short of adolescent lions. Yeah, like this big, I saw this video like this a try bound or what part of Africa, but like if a cheetah or like a like a cat, like hunts down an animal and kills it like these, these, these people from this tribe, like they track the hunt and then once the animal or the cat kills the food, then they will scare off the the cat. I saw them take it and it, and they have these little sticks. Yeah. And then the fucking cheat is or whatever, runaway from them. And I'm like so

Speaker 4:          01:25:00       crazy. I saw that. I watched a video of that month. Someone's Instagram. Yeah. Well you gotta do what you gotta do when you're hungry. Yeah. You take a chance then. I mean, unless they have a really good weapon, it's hard to get an antelope. You got to get fucking close. Right. But a cheetah can just chase it down. If I'm a, you would think it's, it's just crazy that a human could take a Cheetah's food. Yeah, it is crazy. Yeah. They do it with lions too. Yeah, they do. With spears, they, they, they run up on lines with spears. I've seen that too. Like female lions, it's roaring at people where they drag away their food.

Speaker 5:          01:25:36       Robin a lion, lion, she goes back to her, to the, to the house and husband's like, where's the food? I got one

Speaker 4:          01:25:43       robbed. Well, what we do here in cities is so recent and so unnatural. It's not like anything that anybody else has ever done before. In terms of like a human beings up until about 10,000 years ago, there's never been shit like this. Supermarkets and stuff like that. Yeah. All of it. And no interaction at all with nature. You, our interaction with

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       nature is reserved to, you know, squirrels, fucking pigeons and shit. Birds having a dog. Even fucking pigeons are weird. They're brought over here as food now. They were. Yeah, and they're everywhere that you could see. You could eat pigeons. They're delicious. Apparently. I never had one. I don't think a lot of people like they look at, they just don't look at pigeons as food. No. Yeah. Most people, yeah. 99% of they have pigeon seasons. Actually. Maybe they don't have a season. Pigeons might be like wild pigs where they're like a, they're considered a invasive species. They're not supposed to be here. They're not from here. They brought them over here for squad. You ever heard like squad when people meet squad? Nah. The squad was like a fancy word for a young pigeon. It's like lamb. Lamb is a fancy word for a young sheep.

Speaker 1:          01:26:52       How does a pigeon taste you? Had it never had. Oh I never had it. No, I had squirrel. How's that? Um, is if someone told me it was chicken, I would believe him. Oh for real? Yeah. I taste a lot like that. Which is the most cliche shit to say ever. It tastes hot chicken. How do you know if you catch a squirrel? If it's rapid on that? If you cook it, you don't catch anything? That's a weird question. That's a good question. I don't know the answer to that. Maybe rabies would die at a certain temperature. Right? Squirrels are not a well ground squirrels. I was going to say squirrels are not um, omnivores. They're herbivores. But ground squirrels. I'm pretty sure eat meat cause I've seen videos of ground squirrels eating a mouse. Right? Oh Dan fucked up. It seems wrong. Anything either mouse is wrong.

Speaker 1:          01:27:41       Like when you feed a mouse to a snake or some shit like that? Well it's even more wrong cause it's holding in his hands. Dogs and cats that are currently vaccinated and kept under observation for 45 days. Oh, what if it, oh, can you get rabies from eating squirrel. Small mammals such as squirrels, rats, mice Hampshire's getting pigs, durables, chipmunks, rabbits and hares are almost never found to be infected with rabies and have not been known to cause rabies amongst humans in the United States. Okay, so rats can't give you rabies. That's interesting. Rat eating. It's about to go up.

Speaker 1:          01:28:15       I saw videos. You could y'all biting the head off of a rat. It's fucking nasty. What was biting the head of a rock guy? A Guy, man where an Asian man out in the whole fucking thing at like right off an episode of fear factor stuff. It was raw. It's funny. I think it was dead and he didn't see it move him before, but no, it's funny, you wouldn't have been able to do fear factor in certain countries there. It'd be like, where's the fear, right? Like where's the, what we eat that. I've got a lot of friends that are Filipinos. Especially back in when I was doing fear fights because I was playing a lot of pool. Some of the best pool players are Filipinos. It's huge. And Pool, um, with pool rather. But they were laughing at me because they serve Balut. They're like, we love Balut allude is this weird duck embryo.

Speaker 1:          01:29:00       It's like a delicacy. The sort of people on fear factor were terrified of it and these people are like, no, we pay for that. We like it. Yeah, it's great. I look at those people wasting the Balut or whatever it is. They eat a beacon. Everything. Man Balut is weird. It's an embryo. It's like a little, it's like a little baby duck. It's very strange. I wonder if you'd even be able to do fear factor today. I mean, I know ludicrous is still doing it, but they're doing a different kind of version of it. Right? Have you watched one of those episodes just to check it out now? No. That's like watching your ex girlfriend get banged. That's, you really want to see bang to badly. What'd you want us to watch her get banged badly. See I was better than, so it's weird to take over someone's Gig because if someone did it for so long and they had a certain style, how they did it, please pimp my, my fear factor. Ludicrous. Right. When like when, um, who was, who did pimp my ride there was a, what's his name? [inaudible]. Yeah. Whatever happened to that dude. I think he's still acting and doing stuff. Yeah. He was the pimp. My ride guy. That was a huge show. How the fuck did that show go away? I know what that feels like. Yeah. It feels like I could just keep going. Yeah. Yeah. That's like one of them of pawnshop shows they never have to end. Yeah. Just keep punting. Just, yeah. Do it in different countries. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Why? Why would they, and pip maybe exhibit was like done. I can't deal with these people in their cars.

Speaker 6:          01:30:32       Start making all those other shows. There's tons of car shows now and all those other channels. Pimping Shit. Yeah, but that's the best name. Oh yeah. Pimp my ride. That's the best name. When you say it's the best, most of those are undrivable like yeah, I've, there's been a lot of like reddit things where people were like asking for like a, have you ever been on pimp my ride? Look, tell us about your experience or whatever. And like they did so much shit to those cars that would be like, hey, by the way, when this is over, go ahead and take half of that shit out so you can legally drive it down the fucking freeway if you would have it every time. But some of the times they had to do that. If you has one five cars now from pimp my ride, it'd be huge. Collector's item should be like worth a lot of money if you still kept it. I think they started bringing it back. But yeah, let me see. I use an article. What really happened in the cars from pimp my ride?

Speaker 7:          01:31:18       Um,

Speaker 6:          01:31:20       I remember definitely remember a couple of the guys said that they had to stay in contact with a few of the like, uh, in house mechanics because they had to keep getting something fixed. I believe that like they had to constantly drive back to Hollywood or wherever the fuck it was. Right. That makes sense. I'm trying to find, well, a lot of

Speaker 1:          01:31:38       the shows like, um, my buddy bud, who's been on the podcast before, he used to have that show, uh, fuck, what was it called? What was that show where they would steal someone's car and rebuild it? It would make them think their, their car was stolen. I can't remember his fucking show. God it, it was chip Foose, chip Foose, uh, would redesign their car and they would get this fucking amazing car. What the fuck was the name of that show? But a bud Brotzmann he used to have the show rides. That was a show where they built my 1970 Barracuda and then overhauling overhauling. That's it. All right. That's it. Shout out to bud and Adrian, who is the host, um, they, uh, would take a car and they'd do it in like a really short amount of time. And then after it was over, they would have to like tighten it all up. And when they do a build a car, they have a shakedown period where like they drive it for a few hundred miles to make sure there's nothing goes wrong, everything's working right. It's like this period of time to make sure that everything's dialed in. They don't get a chance to do that in a week. Right. So that's probably what they're talking about.

Speaker 6:          01:32:47       Yeah. The sub pimp, my ride thing, I'm reading through it like some of the contestants said they had to dumb up like they had to completely just play the game of this as a TV show. Exaggerate. Let's dump a bunch of cigarette butts in your car to make it look shittier than it is. Hey, when we show it to you, please be fucking happy when you see this. We can have a good like reaction for TV kind of thing. That's disappointing. Yeah. God Damn it. Pimp my ride. How dare you. That's every show though. Yeah. That's every show. Any like, like Haitch GTV show.

Speaker 1:          01:33:15       Oh yeah. Well I just hoarders. Yeah. We're going to have to hoard your place up even more probably, right? Yeah. Like, like preppers. Those people prep. I make them extra crazy. I haven't seen purpose. Was that about people were prepping for the apocalypse? Oh yeah. Listen, we know you're crazy, but we're gonna make you look even crazier. Even down. Even crazier. Yeah. Oh Man. Or intervention. You know what's interesting to me, it's typically right wing people who uh, are in favor of like, if you think about, uh, anytime someone passes a law that's bad for the environment, right? If they want to drill in Alaska, if they want to do something overseas, it's usually, I mean it's might be generalizing, but usually thought to be a right wing thing, right? It's like more concerned for business than concern for the environment. Right. People that are on the left of the people that are always like the tree huggers, those are the environmental.

Speaker 1:          01:34:21       So the people that are like radical environmentalist, you would almost always think of as being people on the left, right? But the people that are prepping for shit going south are almost always on the right. The right wing people are the ones who are prepping. The world's going to come to an end. So those are the ones that carrying bullets and they fucking digging tunnels in their backyard. I know what you're doing. You know you're destroying the earth by digging for oil and all that shit. But it's not them. It's usually the big wigs, right? Right. The big, but they're voting and they're in favor of all those decisions that the big wigs, yes. Make inadvertently because the big wigs have themselves to Jesus.

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       That's what they did. That's what the wise thing they did to good fat, old fashioned family values. Jesus. They figured a way to connect it to a thing that everybody can argue against. The connected right wing ideology with God and left wing with a portion killing babies. Right. The line in the sand has been drawn, Ian,

Speaker 5:          01:35:21       if you're prepping for the end of the world, right. You got to secretly be hoping for the end of the world. Maybe a little bit of end because you try your shit. Yeah. Just to try your shit and to say I wasn't crazy. Right. And wasting my time. So you gotta kind of be rooting for the end of the world. Like you don't want to, you know, do all that shit in vain. Right. You know what I mean? So that's kind of a weird nest to those type of people. That's a good point. You know what I mean? Like you started doing comedy and there's people like you're never gonna make it. You want to make it to be like you are wrong and to just the relief of knowing you are right. Well, I think that's a problem with cops. I think cops won't shoot people. Sometimes they have a gun

Speaker 4:          01:36:07       and they almost want someone to do something fucked up so they could shoot him. Not every cop, not every, not every cop, right? But there are certain people that should not be cops. Right. Those people that become cops. And it does happen. And we all know, and, and I'm on 100% supporter of law enforcement, but even law enforcement, they know it. They don't want to be surrounded by some weak fuck. Who's, uh, who's also a cop, wants to shoot people. There's people out there that wanna shoot people and you give them a gun. If you give someone a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

Speaker 5:          01:36:34       That's amazing. Yeah. I remember the video and this was a white cop shooting a white guy,

Speaker 4:          01:36:40       the Arizona one, I think it was in a hotel on the hall. Yeah. And that guy, he's like, how did he become a cop? How does he not go to jail? Yes. They let him off the hook for that one. They always kind of let them off the hook. They'll give me a slap on the wrist and just get them out of there. And the instructions, he was given this guy, I was telling him to keep your hands away from your waist because his pants were falling down his pants. And the guy was saying that to him too. Yeah. And he's just crying and crawling towards them like, Hey, I was listening. The guy reaches because his pants fell down and grabs a hold of his pants to pull him up. Like I fills his backup with bullets. Him, shoots him in the back on the floor crawling because guys have no threat.

Speaker 5:          01:37:17       Was yelling, making the situation even more chaotic.

Speaker 4:          01:37:21       He's also telling the guy to do something. Why are you making a move? Just tell him to lie down. Put his hands behind his back. You handcuff him and then now he was ordering the guy to crawl towards him. Yeah. It doesn't even make sense. Did you see this video earlier this week? This was from July 1st yes. Yeah. The guys are crazy. This is crazy. This is what's called suicide by cop. This guy was coming towards this cop screaming with a knife and the cop was begging him to please stop. Please stop. This is after they already shot up Jamie, but meanwhile he wants up tackle in this fucking, this is what's

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       crazy. This guy's already been shot and he turns on this cop and tackles him right here. Tackles him. Look at this. The guys fill with bullets and the guy's reaching for his gun. He gets his back and he takes him down and then this does not get, in my opinion, he doesn't have the knife anymore, does he? Yeah. I don't know. I can't tell what if it's in his hand right there. It's hard to see. Did you see

Speaker 5:          01:38:14       video of the black cop walking towards the guy with the machete? Yes, I did see that and it just like walked right into it and just parried and flipped him over. Yeah, it was crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:38:26       That is crazy. I saw another one that Eddie Bravo sent me of a, was not a cop one, but two dudes were having a conversation. That's God's got his hand behind the back and he pulls a knife out of his pocket and the guy doesn't even see and he just in the middle of the conversation just sticks him in the stomach and the guy's standing there. He moves back and he's like holding his stomach. You can't believe it. Then the guy comes towards him again, follows him and the guy who got stabbed winds up knocking the dude out. The guy's coming towards him with the knife again saying, I'll stab you again. The guy hits him with a left hook and rocks him and then hits him with the right hand and knocks him out. And he's a regular dudes, regular dudes. It looks like regular dudes, but the dude who got stabbed knew how to fight. Luckily for him, but he still might die in the stomach. That is fucking very dangerous, man. Very dangerous. You know, what are we talking about? What are you doing? Kind of find the video like I getting stabbed. Let's not so much. There's just so much. There's so much to just freak you out.

Speaker 5:          01:39:27       Yeah. I don't, I don't even look at some of the bad stuff anymore. A lot of it. Yeah. Like, like I saw at the beginning of that video when it came out, like last week, I'm like, I ain't watching this. I was like, turn it off. Yeah. You can't watch that. Yeah. There's so many videos. You'll get convinced that that's happening everywhere in the world. 24 hours a day. It will fuck your head up. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah. God Damn it. It's easy to get freaked out. Yeah. I mean there's a lot of frequent bull shit out there. There is.

Speaker 1:          01:40:02       This is a good spot as I need to talk about this. Um, we, I want to make sure that I clarify something because there was some, there was an operation. This is a guy who was a billionaire diamond guy who uh, wound up getting a dick enlargement operation and he died because of the anesthesia and it was in another country and we pulled out, we, we, we were saying somehow or another it got connected to this company that does that in the United States. It had nothing phenomena for pneuma. Yeah. The article I had said like he was getting a similar surgery and that this one, the one only the [inaudible] only happens in the u s but he was getting something done in Europe. So it was like different, well, they reached out to me to explain, first of all, the guy died from anesthesia. You can get and you could die from anesthesia from any operation. Had nothing to do with the, the penis enlargement operation to use. The more correct

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       term, dick enlargement a, but he didn't die from that. And that's just as safe as a getting your nose fixed or getting your knee meniscus operated on. Right. It's just the [inaudible]. Any surgery where you have a anesthesia carries a certain amount of risk, but apparently this dick thing works. They actually can grow your Dick Beggar. Now you have a risk in your life. Well it'll work well. You're risking your life if you go to the dentist. Yeah. Once you wonder like anytime you get put under, right. If you, if you, if anything you're doing with anesthesia, there's a very small chance that something could go wrong. But I had nothing to do with this Dick Operation, so I just wanted to make sure that people know that if you look this up, I don't want anything, any, a incorrect assumptions to be out there and I carry no ill will towards this.

Speaker 4:          01:41:42       These people that make this and apparently it works. So I just want everybody to know that it's carry no ill will towards this company that makes Dick's bigger. Apparently. It actually, it's a weird thing, right? Like A, for a man to do that. There's certain taboos that are involved in even a admitting that you have an issue like a little dick as a weird thing, right? Because it's one of the rare things that's unfortunate that you can make fun of, right? Like you can't make fun of a little person, right? Like if you make fun of a person who is a, you know, you're not supposed to call the images, right? So let's call them little people. They make fun of a person who's a dwarf or a little person. You're a cruel person, right? But if you make fun of a guy with a little Dick,

Speaker 5:          01:42:26       like how he deserves it or some shit, that's a weird thing that women are allowed to do. Like you're allowed to make fun of dudes having little decks. We should, there should be something in the same vein. Yes. To protect little girls. What equal for them from cruelty, but because if you have a little pussy, that's fantastic. Yeah. Everybody's excited about that. It's not crazy weird situation, but a big Dick is a sign of a reality. All right? So we salute you per new ma. That's the name of the company. We salute you for helping men. I achieve larger decks and I almost died from anesthesia one time. I thought you were going to say from a different lifetime what happened when I was like a teenager. And here's the irony. I was going in for an operation that you're supposed to go in in the morning and leave in the afternoon.

Speaker 5:          01:43:17       Oh, it's just a quick thing. And then it was literally for a circumcision. I was like, you are getting a circumcision. Yeah. What were you doing? I just had sex with this girl. Like I was a kid like seven, like say 18 and uh, and somehow I'd pull the skin of my dick back. Ah, couldn't get it back to clean it and I couldn't get the skin back right over to then I spent like an entire night with like a roar boner with no skin covering it. So I went to the doctor Dan, he got it back over and he said you should get a circumcision. So one time operation is going and you don't have to worry about this shit happening again. But it only happened once, right? Yeah. But well you were furiously beaten off though, right? No, no, no. I just, I pulled the skin back to clean it.

Speaker 5:          01:44:20       Yeah. Yeah. Officer. I was cleaning that gun when it shot my neighbor. No, it's clean. It, it was, there was shit under there. Yeah. So then I went in and they gave me the anesthesia and then when I woke up there was like a hose down my throat and people are frantic around me and it was like nighttime. It was way past the time I was supposed to come back, come to and uh, the anesthesia gave me pneumonia. I ended up spending like two or one and a half to two weeks in the hospital and the first few days was in intensive care. Oh yeah. Wow. It was anesthesia. I did not like wake up. Holy Shit. Yeah. You almost died getting your Dick operated on. Yeah. Just, I was almost that guy then.

Speaker 4:          01:45:09       But for the most part, listen, you talking to someone who's had a bunch of surgeries? I've had my nose fixed. I've had my arm broken, my hands. I've had my knees operated on three times. I've had three knee surgeries. I've been put under quite a few times. It's mostly safe. It's really about the anesthesiologist. Hey Jamie, just somebody at the door, try it. Try and figure out, okay. Why is he doing that? Wandered rallies. He's got a plan. I have no idea. He's a chair. They must be hanging out up there today. People Weird man. He never know. You know when you'd get an Uber, do you know that they, how much background do they do on an Uber?

Speaker 1:          01:45:52       So I was trying to explain to when you're asking me the other day, I was like to get the like approval on your app to be like, yes, this car can drive. Uber is one thing. But once you have that, anybody you know can be behind that they don't like scan your face when you're in the car every time or anything like that. It's just, yeah, I got the Uber Bro. Use it. You know? So if you and I got an Uber, like I could drive around and pretend I'm you, you could get caught. Sure. But like people definitely do that a hundred but how many people get caught driving? No, not fucking none. Yeah, right, right. Whoever saw that comment, rideshare. Remember when you were a kid and there was kid taxis, whoever thought, man, I could have my own taxi. These to have a shit called Gypsy taxis.

Speaker 1:          01:46:31       Right. And they would arrest those people in New York? Yes. Yeah. They would arrest them for trying to do the Uber thing. Why don't they get an Uber? Why would they be a gypsy cab? Five bucks. This is before that. It was a year that I lived in New York that some insane number of gypsy cab drivers got murdered. Insane. Oh, for real. It was something like 40 plus in a year got murdered. So it was almost one a week. They were killing gypsy cab drivers. They would rob them and kill them. Did they have a, that guy, I don't know if it was just one tiles, people. They were there were just deciding that these gypsy cab drivers, I think this was, you know, boy we're talking like probably like 1990s, 1992 or some shit like that. Like there was no, uh, there was no internet and there was, I don't know, people were paying ever with credit cards, no cash.

Speaker 1:          01:47:21       It was all cash. So if you're a gypsy cab driver, they saw you as being someone who had a, a wad of cash on you and then you can't report it to the police cause you're a gypsy cab driver. So you shouldn't even be doing it. Yeah. But they would just kill him. But if you're a criminal, yeah, it's a great crime. Yeah. It's a smart crime. Like I'm going to rob somebody that shouldn't be doing what they're doing for a living, so they can't really report them. Report to the police that I'm robbing you. Yeah. But there was shoot them and kill them. The thing is they would just shoot him in the head and it should've been, it's like they would be considered like maybe these people were illegals. Maybe these people didn't have a lot of documentation. Maybe when they killed them it would be a dead end because they wouldn't know what to do.

Speaker 1:          01:48:03       Maybe they were here by themselves. Maybe they figured the cops don't care about. They would definitely figure the cops don't care and you know, because it's cash and because it's not, it's there's no meter. Right. So this is like, there's no record of everything. Right. How many did you find it in a way that quickly just Google it. There was one, I found a story from New York Times 1983 there's a weekend where 11 people were murdered, but the store just has a story of one guy that was found in the front seat of a gypsy cab murdered. Could have been a shot. Could've been ice. It was the 1990s it was the 1990s it was definitely why, why we moved there. I think I moved to New York in 91 I think I lived there from 91 I lived back and forth in 92 which a story from 1990 a sixth cabeus land in the Bronx, but it's New York Times.

Speaker 1:          01:48:48       It was just paypal thing. Yeah. One was killed. Yeah. I think there was a, there was a long stretch where it started to become a big deal, but it's, I mean if there was 40 Wall Street guys murdered murders, Italian two nineties originated the creation of pirate tax, kind of the article about it. It's 19 180 drivers since 1990 180 drivers have lost their lives while on duty in the streets, which averages more than two per month. Wow. That's crazy. I don't know if that's regular kid. I don't know. I don't know either. It might just be cab drivers, but um, you know, because Gypsy cab drivers, how do you prove that guy was a gypsy cab driver? You just got a dead guy in a car with a bullet in the back of the head and then you have to ask his friends. Was this Guy Gypsy cab driving? Maybe it was, it was a certain style of car too because so that passengers could identify it as it just a cap so that they could take it and it's like if you're taking a gypsy cab, you have limited amount of money and you don't want to pay a cab, but you want to get to where you're going have to be identifiable.

Speaker 1:          01:49:49       Here it is. Cabbies risk death. Uh, daily in New York jungle under siege crime hours are long and the mortality rate high so far this year, 32 taxi drivers had been killed by armed robbers posing as customers. Yeah. And I think that's just regular taxi drivers. Yeah. That's a rough Gig, man. Yeah. Dope. When we were living in New York, imagine if just now you go there, it's just Uber's everywhere. Everybody's [inaudible]. Everybody's just using their phones, standing out like the comedy stores become a fucking disaster trying to get into the parking lot. That's a pain in the ass and age. Just pull up and block the driveway. They don't give a fucking, no one stops them and they're just going in there left and right, but just blocking everything, dropping people off, picking people up. It's never ending. You can never get in there. It's weird. It's like a new thing that no one saw coming. What could be that like let's, let's play Gary v here. What's next? What book? What could, what could we get? Oh, on the front lines of, for something like that scooter stuff.

Speaker 6:          01:50:49       It's crazy. There's like a one year pilot program, I think they're calling it for Los Angeles County. That's why they're more and more have popped up. I think they're just sort of saying, fate, we're going to do a year, figure it out. No one is going to be like taken down for doing this for like they were trying and Santa Monica to get rid of them for a minute, like the bird scooters and whatnot. They've ramped it up completely. There's all sorts of electronic bikes now. There's at least, I want to say six or seven different companies just in Hollywood where I live. They're just everywhere, laying all over the sidewalks. But that's sort of what we're trying to figure out is how do you leave them around? Where are you going to leave them? Is it successful? I don't know how much taxes they're paying and how, like how much money the city gets brought in. But

Speaker 5:          01:51:27       yeah I don't mind them but it's just dangerous walking cause I was walking down the street one day and I was about to just, you know, you just walk in but you just change a stride a little bit to go to the right and I almost got hit by one and it was coming fast and I'm like this the sidewalk, you know what I mean? Like you could be serious ass

Speaker 6:          01:51:49       Manila is that you're supposed to be on the street with those. It says do not ride this on the sidewalk, but it is 100% not safe to be on the streets of La on those cause people are getting run over and healthy. I don't know if anybody's died, but like downtown La, somebody driving 50 miles an hour, ran over someone on a sidewalk or on a scooter. Like why the fuck you driving so fast downtown also?

Speaker 1:          01:52:11       Well, this people that are crazy hit and runs happen anyway. They happen all over the place and then there's assholes. You know? People are gonna shoot. Cab drivers are going to run over scooter drivers. Yeah. [inaudible] everywhere though. It's weird to see them and they've started a band them in certain places. Right. Some neighborhoods have tried like West Hollywood. You kinda can't like them anywhere. But I think there's cities, the West Hollywood city. Yeah. But I mean outside of California, I mean other cities have just said no more. Yeah. You Know Vegas, you can't no fucking way because you have them Vegas. Most drunk people, right? Yeah. Oh my God. Drunk people on scooters. If he was drunk, drunk people on scooters and drunk people driving while you were on a scooter. Yeah. Let's fuck plus weed now. Weed. Yeah. How good was Vegas? It was a good time.

Speaker 1:          01:52:56       It was just fun. He just had me thinking about what could be next door. Yeah. What could be next? Like if we didn't see scooters coming, we didn't see Uber coming. What would be the next? What do we, what do we need? What do we need? We need protection from the ocean. The ocean's going to rise up and take us. That's good. We're melting the ice caps. It's going to fucking, we're going to have to move to Tucson boats. They're making more subways here right now. Yeah. They're going to fill up with water. What a good name. I have one in Beverly Hills. There's going to be canals, canals. We'll use those for the toilet. Your 20, 90. Yeah. We're going to throw our shit down those tubes. Like I wonder, man, there were some shit that I was reading today about the ice caps melting at an accelerated rate.

Speaker 1:          01:53:39       It's always, it's never good news. Whenever the, it's like ice cap melting news. Like, Hey, and we just found out, uh, we actually have more ice than we thought. We're good. All right. Don't worry about it. What does that mean? Vegas can get water now? No Vegas gets their water figured. They figured out there's so much money in Vegas, they just steal it. What do they get it from a hole in the ground. No ideas. Is there a well out there? All I know that got good water pressure in every hotel I've ever been in. It's wonderful. Look, that's a human ingenuity. They build it more shit. Yeah. And if the uh, ice cabs do melt, it'll just bring it closer to Vegas. Vegas or use it. Yeah. The water will be like real close. Yeah. I mean we just move inside to the middle.

Speaker 1:          01:54:21       It's like this is what people have been doing forever. This idea that you're supposed to be able to keep your fucking house on the water in Santa Monica sitting crazy, you know? Yeah. You build a house where the beach is, your front yard is so nuts distinct. Those cliffs were always there. This shit was different decades before. So keep on thinking it's going to be like that all the time. Yeah. If you buy like a seaside house in like Marina del Ray or someone really nice, you're making a gamble like over the next, I'm only going to be alive for 40 more years over those years. I'm going to let's, let's hope that this water stays over there. Exactly. Stays put as hope Mother Nature does what I want it to do. Yeah. I just, I'm going to spend $7 million on this fucking house with literally no backyard.

Speaker 1:          01:55:08       It's just ocean and I'm just going to hope it stays like this. I just can't wait till my credit becomes beach front property and then I could sell it. I've rented space at a beach house a couple of years ago when I'm my kitchen. I was getting my kitchen fixed and we rented this house in Malibu on the water. It was beautiful man. You would wake up, you eat breakfast, damn. Just be sitting there staring out over the water and the water would literally come almost underneath the balcony. So it looked like you were sitting in water like you were floating and while we were on a boat, I was like, wow, this is so beautiful. It's so, it makes you feel so good. Yeah. Does being by the ocean, but what a gamble. Yeah. Even though it's the best, like you sound like that's the ultimate infinity pool. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. I don't mind. Like la Jolla, you have the condo right by the beach and, and, and you go to sleep at night. You can hear the ocean, you wake up. But then I'd be like, what if is this is the night, this is the night where, you know what I'm saying? Yeah. Just taste the building down and rushes it out to the mountains.

Speaker 1:          01:56:19       Let me know this happen so many times in history. Yeah. All it takes is a earthquake or an asteroid hits the ocean. Oh yeah, yeah. Oh my God. If an asteroid hit the ocean and we wouldn't even be safe here, we wouldn't be safe. We'd probably wouldn't be safe in Arizona. It would go deep in Arizona. Asteroid hit the fucking ocean just outside of Malibu. Boom. Just a big one. Everybody in the Midwest be laughing. They'd be laughing our asses off. We had the best property all the time. Yeah, so we had a duck. Hurricanes, they have the scariest shit. I think a tornadoes are the scariest shit. Yeah. Those things are so random and they happen every year. Right? Every year. It's not like earthquakes happen every year or hurricane you can track, you know it's coming. You can prepare. You could just leave a tornado.

Speaker 1:          01:57:07       It's just like, did you show up? Hey Man, I'm here. Yeah. Yeah. That's the scariest. Yeah, but that's just something that people deal with when they, you see, they wipe out entire towns, they wipe, they, they took towns off the map. I feel like they just always aim for the small towns. Why? I think it has to do with the, with agriculture, if I'm right, I think it has to do with like flat areas and the type of weather that they have. And I don't think they'd take place in areas where there's a lot of trees and forests. Is that true?

Speaker 6:          01:57:42       It's more like they don't really happen in cities because the heat structure and that creates like a, where the pressure of air pressure starts cause it's a caught cold air pressure system that kind of starts swirling because of the artificial concrete. Yeah. All those creates tornadoes almost protect the bulb. It does happen in cities from time to time or like on the outskirts. But like it's very rare to see when roll through a downtown. But does one ever go through like Colorado on the mountain? Look in one up right here. That's why as you were saying trees, I got video of one, like just ripping trees up in Texas, so like mm. But it does mostly the Hash for sure. I'm flatland. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:58:17       Yeah. Well Texas, uh, Texas is a lot of crazy wind.

Speaker 6:          01:58:22       It's so close to Oklahoma. Oklahoma's like tornado alley. So you were around there. There was one that was on t v though. That

Speaker 1:          01:58:28       was mad. It was hitting this area where they had these oil trucks and it was carrying the semi trucks in the air. I don't know if there were oil trucks there. Semis, like can't like, you know, like a 16 wheeler like fucking sure hugging like that. It was flying in a circle in the sky. Like a fucking newspaper. Yeah. News. A page from a newspaper gets caught in the wind. So I was flying around this, this fucking tornado was carrying trucks like that in this video. This is a Missouri earlier this year. Hmm. I don't see, I don't see any evidence. That's fair. Honestly. New stuff. Okay. Yeah, but there's a video of the, that's it right there. That's the video. This is a video where you see, look at this, why you see the trucks. As they get closer, you can see inside the fucking thing that is a truck flying in a circle.

Speaker 1:          01:59:19       If this is the same video. Sorry, I don't know if that's it. No, that's, that's the seminar after lands. I mean, that might not have even been it, but it was one where it was probably so many fucking tornado videos, but it was one where these trucks were literally flying around in a circle like it was carrying this gigantic semi and just floating it in the air like a paper airplane. Was it from twists or though, was it some fake footage? No, it was real. It was real. Some news footage from television. He was like, then it's hard to catch that because all of these are just already on the ground. Yeah, no, it was in it from a distance. There was some news footage. Anyway, just fucking rambling. Speaking around, but Ian Ned,

Speaker 5:          02:00:04       what is that? Somebody special? When's it coming out? A Friday at midnight on comedy central. Oh Shit. Why did you decide to do it in that style? It's kind of interesting. He did it like a Ted talk because there's so many specials out there. And I get to do my material when I do it that way, but I had a little twist and an extra layer to it that'll make people be more interested in it than if I was just going to do like just a regular stand up. That's why you clever bastard once in a while I got an idea. You know what I'm saying? And you got the microphone, a regular microphone just sitting on the stool in case you change your mind. Well, the last bit I use the Mike [inaudible] noticed that. Yeah. Good. Yeah. The last bit I do with the Mike.

Speaker 5:          02:00:50       What is in your hand? Uh, the clicker because, because some of the topics put on the screen, like, just like a tech talk he taught you click the thing, that picture represents what you're talking about and then you keep on going. I, I've seen people do that before, um, with, uh, with, with Ted talks and I've always thought that'd be a good thing with comp. Yeah. Because like even when you look at your standup, you take on a topic, you dissect it and you give people an alternate view of that topic, just like a tech tone and then you move on to the next one. So like comics, like you and me and other people, it's a perfect format for our standup. Yeah. Are you doing that when you do, when you headline we do headline Gig. Nah, maybe you should maybe I about doing that.

Speaker 5:          02:01:40       Yeah, I did. Yeah, I did thought about it at one point in time, but I'm too lazy. Yeah. Yeah. Like I don't have merits or anything so I don't bring it merge. I don't want to have to make sure they have a screen on transport one and all that shit. Then that strategy, it gets cumbersome. Well, I heard that Kevin Hart at one point in time had pyrotechnics, like he would hit a punchline but 20 flips off flames that shoot through this guy and arenas and I'm like, man, that's when that's you add to the standup, right. It's like props, but way better. Right? Like, I feel like props are the rare, one of the rare things where you can't do them anymore cause Cara top owns that. Whereas when I was a kid, man, there was prop comedians. Yeah, there was a lot of them.

Speaker 5:          02:02:25       Right. Jamie, you don't know about anything. I just remember a lot of ventriloquists and some people that were doing little prop things, but yet no one really had that truck full of, it'd be the comic that show up to the mic with a briefcase. Yeah. And then afterwards he has to gather his stuff. Like a stripper. Yeah, they have to his duffle bag have everything in there. Yeah. It was a guy that was a, he was really funny man. A guy in Boston that used to do that. Fuck, I'm blanking on his name, but he had glasses and he had a real similar kind of act, but it was kind of like science based. He had a bunch of weird shit that he would show Alex Zerbe. Nope. Okay. No, it was a long time ago. You ever seen chips? Cooney chips, Cooney. I've heard the name.

Speaker 5:          02:03:13       Yeah, he, he had props. But he, he was a fake magician really. So like I remember the name of that Tupperware that's expanded. Yeah. Like that was one of his friends was just all was, but he was funny, like, you know, and then pull it out. That's the trick. And this keep going onto the next goofy thing. There was a guy named Lenny Schulz and he, uh, he remember, remember crazy Lenny. Yeah. He had a bunch of problems. Yeah. I watched a Steve Burns documentary on the amazing Jonathan that he's just put out. It was really good, wasn't it? Yeah. I liked as a younger kid, I love, I liked him just because of a zany crazy shit he did. But watching the documentary was awesome. So what is it? Yes. Shout out to Steve Burn. What does it basically about? Like he lived in excess, right? It's definitely about that sort of like his rise and maybe I would say fall, but then sort of how he came back and was died.

Speaker 5:          02:04:03       There's a lot of to about this. A Fan that became his manager and sorta he helped him and guided him along and apprenticed him a little bit and just about the relationship and one footage together. It was just interesting. It's an interesting guy. Wow. Yeah. Those guys from the fucking eighties went hard, man. That was the Kinison era. You know, if you wanted to be a wild man, you haven't figured out how to snort coke on stage. He's just like fall, make a joke about it. It was supposed to be fake coke, but he's really saying I'm really doing it like a lot. So he made a bit. Yeah. Huh. That was not a prop. That's real shit. Yo. I bet people have done a lot of weasley shit like that. Like just put something into their act. They'll pull something off, you know, like I would think like it's a, one of the core things about comedy is also one of the weird things that it's so open ended like the club, just

Speaker 4:          02:05:01       like you get booked to the Bray Improv. Right, right. You show up like what's up being, how are you man, you know, and you're like, Hey, this is my opening act. They, they shake hands, everybody's cool. They don't even ask you what you're going to talk about. Right. They got everybody sitting there. People paid money, they've sold tickets, they sold drinks, and they have not a clue as to what you're going to discuss and you just go up there and say whatever the fuck you want.

Speaker 5:          02:05:23       America love it. Crazy. Yeah. What a weird way to make a living and then you'd do the same thing for like a TV show or something. You have to type it out. Yeah, send it to them. They've got to look at it. That's a beautiful thing to do with Netflix. Netflix didn't say shit. They just said, hey, we want to do, we want to do a special with you. I said, great. All right, let's do it. I said, okay, let's

Speaker 4:          02:05:45       do it. It was that easy. We did it and they said, okay, great. You did it. We like it. We'll put it up. Boom.

Speaker 5:          02:05:51       I had to send comedy central or a proof of concept, like I got to shoot the set, like in a small club, sent it to them and they're like, all right, okay. Oh yeah. Well the good news is they approved, right. It's on TV and a special is always in my opinion, really just an advertisement to get people to come see you. Exactly right. So I'm glad the advertisements out. Oh yeah. Cause me to, I've said it before. I'll say it again. Why are you here? You one of the best comics in the world. The shore. It's like, it's so many times people come up to me, Rogan was talking about you like I don't even have to be on the show. Like they were like Rogan's talking about you. It's so like people will come up to come to a show because you just spoke about me. But it's true.

Speaker 4:          02:06:38       You and I had been friends for 20 what? 28 years or some shit. Something crazy. So long fucking time. But you've always been one of the best comics in the world, you know? And I think right now your new Shit, man, that you're doing this. Not even the special. I was crying this weekend in Vegas, that new thing. I want to say what it is, but God damn, it's good. It's really good man. I love that. You know, I love the transition between when someone does a special to writing and working on new stuff because then you just get this new angles and and having to write shit. That's like, I've been trying to tell this to Bobby Lee who was another guy that is one of the best comics in the world and it's fucking shame that Bobby Lee doesn't have a special and he doesn't, you know, it's like he's thing is like, well no, no, I won't be able to use that in my mat material. Like yeah, but you'll write better stuff.

Speaker 5:          02:07:29       Yeah. You'd be forced to. I think he shooting a special though. Yes, he's talking about it. Yeah. Cause he's, he asked me who directed mine, so I was like, oh wait a minute, is Bobby about to shoot a special? But he'll see how what you've seen and what I'm seeing now that how great it is to like come up with a new set of material with all their fillings. It's very terrifying. Yeah. I've had some, uh, some amazing medio cassettes. Jesus. I feel bad. I love when you first tried out new stuff. It's like you don't know. Yeah. You just don't know. And then you said something the other day when we was in Vegas, he was talking to Allie like we was all in the back after the show about how you had a joke that was new. It was working. You wrote it, it's new, it's working.

Speaker 5:          02:08:17       And then you broke it by over fixing it. Yeah. Then you have to take shit back out. And that's happened to me during this new set of material too. I started a joke, created it, and then broke it by over doing stuff to it. And then I have to like figure out what part that I put in there that threw it off and take it out and fix it back. Well, it's always interesting to talk to someone that's really just a few years in a comedy because then you got to go over your own process and think about it more. Yeah. The one of the things that happens in Jujitsu is

Speaker 4:          02:08:50       in Jujitsu you get better when you teach. It's a real strange, like a lot of guys that wind up getting a job teaching Jujitsu to like beginners, they're Jujitsu jumps, the jumps up several notches. It's really interesting and I think sometimes that happens with comedy. So when we're dealing with selling like Allie out to Allie Makowski, our friend Alex, she's only been doing comedy for what, four years? Around somewhere around four or five years and she's just coming into her own and she's, what was she, 22.

Speaker 5:          02:09:15       All right. 22 or 23. 22 or 23. Very funny. Very promising. And uh, she, he was

Speaker 4:          02:09:23       going to come down and watch us because she came to San Diego to watch when Tony and Andrew and I did that, uh, that giant arena down there because she's, because she opens up for me all the time at the Improv. And the comedy store. She's getting to be around all these assassins and she's getting to see it from the outside. But that was her first time opening and I was like, it's cause she said she was going to come down and watch. I said, you want to do a set? And she was like, I was secretly hoping you would ask. I said all right, come on, can we do this up? So she opened, she did 10 minutes in front of, you know, it's like 1200 people. It's a lot of people for her first big show in Vegas on a Friday night. And she murdered and she did good.

Speaker 4:          02:10:00       She did great. Yeah, super relaxed. But when you talking to someone who's a up and coming like that, I love that. I love, I love talking to like, Hey Suze, hey Suze trio or like a, you know, a Frank Castillo or any of these young guys coming up because you get a chance to talk to them about how you formulate stuff and compare notes. And sometimes they have interesting ways that they deal with, cause I never considered, you know, and sometimes people have interesting ways of thinking about their mentality to think about and when they go walk their dog, they'll play, they're set in their ear or they'll, you know, when they go on hikes, they'll just go on a hike and think about one joke and try to work the joke out while they're hiking.

Speaker 5:          02:10:38       You could have done that. Yeah. I've learned a lot from by talking to younger comics too, so I get that completely.

Speaker 4:          02:10:44       You also, the thing that's happening to you right now is a thing that happens to them except the fact that you're far more skilled at it is like they're trying to put together an act. But you've already done it many, many times. You've already put out specials and records so that when you're doing this, it's like you know how to write jokes. You're always writing new jokes. You've been doing comedy forever, but it's still, you're starting from jump when you start from zero, from ground zero like, and then you try to put together an act that you hope people want to pay to see that as a dare.

Speaker 5:          02:11:10       Yeah, it's terrifying. Yeah. And then there was a part of it in this new set of material that I was doing wrong. Like, like just this style of joke that I was writing. I just felt off like even when some of the bits were working and then I was in Atlanta a few weeks ago and then it just hit me what I was doing wrong. I was the laughing skull. Yeah. I was the one laughing. So yeah, it's a dope ass club to help little room and it's a great room to go headline. And when you're like got new material that you'd need to just work out. Yeah. I say about those rooms like the belly room and like the laughing's call, like that's where you find out what's bullshit. Yeah. And I, and I found out what was pool of Shit for sure. Sometimes you can like song and dance your way through the 300 seat room. Check them like enough people start laughing to get the other people laughing but, and then you'll kind of go along with it and with your delivery and you can kind of make funny out of it, but there's no momentum with 70 people. Yeah. You have to like really make them laugh. It's gotta be real. Yeah. Was 70 people you got, you know,

Speaker 4:          02:12:20       I did a Jeremiah walk-in show, stand up on the spot on Tuesday. That's the best example of that because you're also there yelling out subjects, you know, and so you just get to and you find out and find and but that also like constructing a new set. What's interesting about it is that you get a chance to figure something out and make it real. What like Bobby Lee's doing right now is working with tried and true material. Tried and proven. He kills every night. He knows it's going to kill. If it didn't kill, he'd be stunned. Right. He'd be like, what? This is my shit. I've been killing with this for four years. He knows what he's doing. He's just a funny machine.

Speaker 5:          02:12:58       So like, I don't even know how to describe it just is just him. He's just a funny ass fucking, yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:13:04       So funny. And people don't, not enough people know. Cause most people know them from podcasts and that helps for sure. And from television shows that helps for sure. But that needs to be something people could see of his stand up. Yeah. So we're, we're getting them, he's listening. It's like he's a slow, but he'll listen. Take a little time. He listens. It's getting in there. It's getting in there. It's too good. It's still good. The other ones, Owen Smith. Yeah. Yes. Oh, and Smith good to good. Has his own style. Fucking funny. He's a, yeah man. He's a top flight headliner. Yeah. Like a good headliner. Like a top of the food chain headlines. Yeah. Like if someone told me Owen Smith was selling out arenas, I'd be like, good. It should have been happened in a long time. Exactly. You know, and as much as Kevin Hart or fucking fill in the blank, whoever can sell out giant ass places and Smith's material is as good as it.

Speaker 4:          02:13:55       The songs in those places. A hundred percent hundred percent. And sometimes these guys, they just don't do, they don't do enough a road work or they don't do enough. They'd got writing jobs or something takes them off the path where people don't necessarily see, they do a lot of acting. It's all different little paths. It kind of deviate you away from, from stand up. Right. And I think I went back, went down that path when I was on fear factor. Oh yeah. It was on fear factor. I didn't really tour much, you know, it was mostly just being around la cause it was, we're filming so much film, so many episodes. And you guys traveled a lot to different places. Yeah. Yeah. That shit is exhausting, man. Exhausting. Yeah. And it was exhausting too because you'd be filming all day, you'd be out in the heat and then you would come back and you know, after that I would do standup at night and I was just like, I'm just going to just do the store and then go home.

Speaker 4:          02:14:49       I wasn't going to travel anywhere I a little bit, but not much. So it's like things can be good where it's like it's great to have a good Gig, but things, those things can be bad cause it ultimately takes you away from your standup. You know what I mean? Lucy Kay said that to me once. He was in the period after he stopped doing his show and he just stopped doing it for awhile and I said, I haven't done anything other than stand up for a year. And I said, well, wouldn't, what made you do that? He goes, I just wanted to really concentrate on standup. He said, I don't think you could be at your best while you do other things. He goes, I think you could be good, but I think at your best you really have to just do standup. I think he's right.

Speaker 4:          02:15:28       Oh he's right. Even if you don't do much in that day and if you just write one line or one tag or something as just, it just counts so much towards the whole thing and by the end of the year where you, where you end up is going to be way further than you would have been. I think it's not an even formula though, because I do think that there's some value in taking some time and doing things as well. There's like there's value in like vacations, there's value in experiences and then there's also you have to do a lot of stand up. This is like both things are true because if you only do stand up, one of the things that does happen is guys lose their point of references because their whole life revolves around traveling. So you get a lot of airplane jokes and it revolves around drinking. Cause people drink at clubs. You don't have enough experiences. You gotta live a little yes, yes. To put it on the paper. Yeah. On stage. You gotta live a little. I think that's a, that's something that gets missed, but it's like, it's not a perfect formula. It's also like how much enthusiasm do you have? Like sometimes more enthusiasm,

Speaker 5:          02:16:30       like when you have, you feel good about it when you take time off and it makes you better. Right. It's just hard to know. It's just like an athlete. Like, like in England, the soccer season is over, right? So the soccer players go on vacation, but while they're on vacation, you gotta get in a month or so. You've got to get back to training in a month or so. But you can't go back to camp out of shape. So there's a point where you have to be with a trainer while you're kind of offered a season getting in shape so that when you go to camp, your not out of shape and you losing your spot on it. Is this, this or this is a delicate balance of everything. Yeah, that makes sense. And also so insanely competitive, right? There's so many people lined up, but you take your spot.

Speaker 5:          02:17:17       Yeah, you can't get fat when you're on vacation. So it's comedies like when you, uh, shoot a special and then the guy that couldn't follow you is killing because he still has his material that he's been had and you're like not doing as good because you're working on shit. It kind of, it kind of fucks with me a little bit. Yeah. You know what I mean? Just to competitiveness offshore. And then I said, hey man, this is just a natural order. Things just keep doing what you're doing and, and everything is going to be fine. You would figure it out. You're growing again. There's nothing wrong with that. Whenever new bits come to life and they start to really work, I go, okay, this just trusting the process. This is what happens. You trust the process, keep grinding, but you have to do that. If there is no, if, if you don't put in that time, if you just decide, oh, I need a new act, but you don't work on it, it's not going to just show up.

Speaker 5:          02:18:10       Uh, seems you have to, you have to make that process is a real thing. Right. And there's going to be subsets. Just a care man for sure. Like, yeah, like yeah, you take one old joke on stage and there's butter it add to it. Yeah, but one thing is true for sure for me who sent when someone like you is writing new stuff and that new stuff kills like this past weekend. That makes me excited about writing new shit. I go, oh my God, there it's out there. I've got to find it. I got to find the bits. They're out there. Look, he just found two giant juicy giant drinks. It's like someone come back from a fishing trip. Oh good. The guys that tuna, I'm calling toner Fisher. It's out there. It's out there. There's gold in San Francisco. Yeah, let's go dig it. It's cold in them there hills.

Speaker 5:          02:18:58       But I always see you go find new material, so it's always good. Like, like we both had new shit this weekend and we're enthusiastic about it and excited about it. So it adds a different level to just going out to do a show that we would normally do. We get to talk about it afterwards with the excitement of how new the material is and how it's coming along and it just, that's, that's a level of fun right there. You don't experience unless you're, you're out there writing and growing. Yeah. There's no other way around it. And I think a metaphor

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       for life. I think the people that get stagnant in life things cause you're not taking any chances. You're not doing anything new. You're not growing. Yeah. You've got to, I mean, and artistically with stand up, it's one of the rare art forms where you cannot do the old stuff. They don't want, I mean, maybe if Jim Gaffigan people want to hear hot pockets, but they also want to hear an hour, a new shit. You maybe if you're Bert Kreischer, they want to hear the machine story. He says they get mad if you don't. He doesn't tell the machines, tells the machine store, take his shirt off. They, he's mad at his clothes when he starts taking his pants off and then just puts him back on. I'm like, Hey, fucking pants off while you pants on, bro. How dare you. It's free. That'd be his new shirt, party and pants.

Speaker 1:          02:20:07       Free Party with no pants or partying pants. Free Party and pants. Pants. Yeah, Bert Kreischer. There you go. That's maybe a new special party and pants free. Just you fas. Fuck with boxer shorts. They're talking shit about sober October wise. It'd be way better tidy white. Go all in. Yeah, but boxer shorts, when he moves funny, his dick hole will open up a little bit and get a peer. Mr Speedos. Well, how about just speedos? How about Bert onstage of speedos on speedos? Don't seem like a comfort move. Seems like a bad decision. That's not someone who really wants their Dick to be caressed and cradled details are like you're punishing your deck. Fucking took your, it's like a tent in a storm and nail it down. Punishing it or showing it off, right? Yeah. If you got to hog. Yeah. Penis enlargement by speedos. Yeah, just put a, just take your circumcised Dick and pull it all the way down so it's a full erection.

Speaker 1:          02:21:04       Hey Man. And then put a ring, a rubber ring around the base of the balls to contract all the blood or constrict all the blood. Yeah. That's a weird thing that someone figured that out, right? Cock rings. Yeah. Hmm. How do I, uh, how do I stay hard here? It's gotta be a way to put a rubber band. The praise your Dick. Try our grow. Yeah. Yikes. Yeah. That's the one thing that if they do ever come up, I, I used to have a bit about that. If they ever come up with a pill for how to look a boner or a a dick enlargement pill, that actually works. It'd be 30 seconds later. The first dude would die of an overdose. Oh yeah. Just take one. You're going to find out how many, give me a stroke. How Big One. The one that Jesus Christ, y'all had a hole.

Speaker 1:          02:21:53       There was a whole sequence where women would evolve because people just don't have sex, but the dicks would get bigger and then Ryan would develop these flying Squirrel pussies. They would just jump off cliffs to get away from dudes who were chasing after them with their big dicks and shopping carts, Solaris grow wings. Why are women growing wings? Just to fit so people could make, yeah. Yeah. If you could grow a big, like, have you ever watched a porn and said, that's just too much. Yeah. Yeah. It's like this comes a certain point in time where like how big do you want your arms, right? Yes. You want a big arm or do you want an arm where the bicep touches your fingers when you go like this? Right. Do you want that? Oh, you can't even move. Yeah. That's crazy. It's too big. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:22:35       Right. Does that mean send me, you can never do this. You just do anything like this now. Yeah. You probably can't even walk. Yeah. You're just too heavy. You probably waddling everywhere you go. You weigh 600 pounds and you're five, eight. How the fuck are you doing that right? There is a, there's too much. You can get too much. Yeah, you can get too much dick, but I bet it's like you get too much. Those girls who get, uh, body dysmorphia with their breast size. Some girls go crazy, like they have triple e's and they need them an f, they get nuts. It's crazy. They don't see it like the way you're saying it. That's how it happens with anorexics bodybuilders. Yeah. And this God Damn Bananas. It is the Dick things to weird one. Right. Yeah. That will definitely, it's definitely gonna happen since women overdo it with their breast size and like you say, they can't see how weird it looks.

Speaker 1:          02:23:30       Yeah. It's a normal thing with humans. If you've seen those guys that inject their muscles with oil and it makes their muscles swell up like balloons, it looks so fake, but they don't see it there. It's body dysmorphia. Yeah. The thing that an anorexic gets when they don't recognize that they're there look like a skeleton. When was at the airport in Vegas and waiting for your pool thing. There was this chick and she had like a weird but poor girl and it wasn't real and you could tell only she didn't know that it didn't look real. She probably thought it looked amazing. Right? Yeah. She's walking around with like button every confidence that yeah, people get strange because the butt thing is treated differently than the boob thing. Like a woman with really large fake breasts is still hot. Yes. But a woman with really large fake butts like come on.

Speaker 1:          02:24:23       Yeah. That's comes off crazier. Yeah. And Fake Lips. So another one. That's crazy too. Yeah, and we have rules. It's weird. Yeah. Fake Lips. It's like, what am I supposed to do? Just pretend this is not happening in front of me right now. Well it's also, it fucks with your, apparently we have an, when we see a certain person when see people's faces, we have a, an expectation where things are going to be based on where things are. Right. It's all like the Fibonacci sequence, like the golden ratio, the way your face is designed like, like Ari Shaffir. If RSU figure had a tiny nose, you'd be like, what is wrong with your face? Your face is big nose. This is like how your style of face is supposed to come with that style or no. If it doesn't, it's weird. But then you look at a guy like Greg Fitzsimmons, his little nose, you know, if he had Ari's nose, you'd be like, what is that nose doing on your face? It's crazy. It's like you fuck with that. When you do something to make something

Speaker 4:          02:25:24       bigger or wider or you know with, with your face, you know, people get tattoos and different things. I suppose people start in large in areas of their face. You just like getting big ears, big of noses. Who would have big ears come into frame Dumbo ears thing. Well, how about those holes where people stretch, they do those ages and they pull their fucking ear hole out. The put the, that earring hole at the bottom. Make it giant like a hoop that's bananas. Like what are you doing to your ears? Yeah. Like I don't want to fuck up the chance of me not be able to hear some shit. I don't think he does. I don't think it's just, I'm not doing anything personally close to anything that I need. I need this for what I need this for. I'm not going to do anything to it.

Speaker 4:          02:26:12       That might jeopardize it in any way. I always feel like that about cauliflower here too. They go to all the years that I did Jujitsu, I don't have cauliflower here because I always wore ear guards, right? It's like if you fuck with the shape of your ear, it fucks with the way sound goes in there. Like take your ear and then talk, go blah, blah, blah. Now put your tip, the tips of your fingers on the top of your ear and then fold them down. La, la, la, la, la, la, la. It changes the way sounds changes. Sound like this helps sound. These are speakers. These are bows, right? You know what I'm saying? Yeah. You fucking with your boat, your bows, it's the shape. Nature figured out a shape to collect all that sound and get it inside your ear holes, but when you're outside of your ears like a rock, like a lot of these wrestlers or Jujitsu guys, they have, it's all calcified so that with that cauliflower ear on, if you ever touched a call for a year, it's like a rock under the surface.

Speaker 4:          02:27:08       Calcium rock. That's what it's like because the, it's what it is. It's the break in the skin. It swells up because it bleeds and then that blood calcifies and hardens and the only way to fix my friend Brett had his fixed, um, Brent, um, Brent, my friend Brent had affected, they had a cut his ear like a fish. They had a full plant and then they had to open it up and scrape out all the hard tissue and then sew it back up together. And he couldn't do Jujitsu forever because if he did Jujitsu again after the operation, it would break open and start bleeding again. Pam? Yeah. I was looking for a picture where a guy gets this part. I've seen people with a plug in a hole on the inner part here. Oh, I've seen that. Yeah. But this guy took it to a whole spot home, knows he'd sit, oh my God, that definitely had flux with his hearing. 100% oh yeah, 100%. He's got a giant gage hole in the bottom and a medium gauge hole in the top. And then big ones on his nostrils where his nostrils, he has like the bottom hole where his nostrils are. And then the above the nostros get to holes. We can see the Septum, the opened up the side of his nostril, quarter size hole easily. Right. I can't say that dude's real happy. I just don't see it. I don't understand that look. But Hey, hey man, what are you going to do?

Speaker 4:          02:28:38       Ian Edwards will be with me with Dave Chappelle Coma, Washington and then Salt Lake City Salt Lake City the next day, which is August 3rd tickets just went on sale. Um, I don't think so. I think they're on sale on Friday. Yeah, but they went on presale. The Way Dave does it, you have to register as a legit fan, like a human being. They have to make sure that you're not a ticket agency. This scalp on these tickets and buying them up in mass and then selling them back. So Ian Edwards, it would have to be, you have to show your driver's license or something. I don't know how they verify it, but, and then once you register, then you could buy the tickets and it's for those people for a while. And then after that, then it's opened up to the general public or the thing on Saturday. Something like that. But a, Ian's going to be with me.

Speaker 2:          02:30:24       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:30:25       Yeah.
