00:00:01.095 --> 00:00:03.770
- [Instructor] We're asked
to plot the image of point A

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.937
under a dilation about point P
with a scale factor of three.

00:00:10.481 --> 00:00:12.738
So what they're saying when
they say under a dilation,

00:00:12.738 --> 00:00:16.043
they're saying stretching
it or scaling it up or down

00:00:16.043 --> 00:00:18.385
around the point P.

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.256
Now so what we're going
to do is just think about,

00:00:20.256 --> 00:00:24.541
well how far is point A and
then we want to dilate it

00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:26.463
with a scale factor of three.

00:00:26.463 --> 00:00:29.073
So however far A is from point P,

00:00:29.073 --> 00:00:32.765
it's going to be three times
further under the dilation.

00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:34.938
Three times further in the same direction.

00:00:34.938 --> 00:00:36.701
So how do we think about that?

00:00:36.701 --> 00:00:38.073
Well, one way to think about it

00:00:38.073 --> 00:00:41.133
is to go from P to A
you have to go one down

00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:45.701
and two to the left, so
minus one and minus two.

00:00:45.701 --> 00:00:48.443
And so if you dilate it
with a factor of three,

00:00:48.443 --> 00:00:51.614
then you're going to want to
go three times as far down.

00:00:51.614 --> 00:00:55.781
So minus three, and three
times as far to the left,

00:00:57.731 --> 00:00:59.430
so you'll go minus six.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.868
So one, let me do this, so
negative one, negative two,

00:01:03.868 --> 00:01:07.543
negative three, negative four,
negative five, negative six.

00:01:07.543 --> 00:01:10.798
So you will end up right over there.

00:01:10.798 --> 00:01:12.592
And you can even see
it, that this is indeed

00:01:12.592 --> 00:01:17.009
three times as far from
P in the same direction.

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.517
So we could call the image of point A,

00:01:18.517 --> 00:01:21.502
maybe we call that A prime,
and so there you have it.

00:01:21.502 --> 00:01:24.803
It has been dilated with
a scale factor of three.

00:01:24.803 --> 00:01:25.927
And so you might be saying, wait,

00:01:25.927 --> 00:01:28.489
I'm used to dilating being
stretching or scaling.

00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:30.423
How have I stretched or scaled something?

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:32.093
Well imagine a bunch of points here

00:01:32.093 --> 00:01:34.107
that represents some type of picture

00:01:34.107 --> 00:01:38.087
and if you push them all three
times further from point P,

00:01:38.087 --> 00:01:40.379
which you could do as
your center of dilation,

00:01:40.379 --> 00:01:42.532
then you would expand
the size of your picture

00:01:42.532 --> 00:01:44.888
by a scale factor of three.

00:01:44.888 --> 00:01:48.051
Let's do another example with a point.

00:01:48.051 --> 00:01:51.727
So, here we're told,
plot the image of point A

00:01:51.727 --> 00:01:55.894
under a dilation about the
origin with a scale factor of 1/3

00:01:58.872 --> 00:02:01.391
so first of all we don't
even see the point A here,

00:02:01.391 --> 00:02:03.355
so it's actually below the fold.

00:02:03.355 --> 00:02:05.814
So let's see, there we
go, that's our point A.

00:02:05.814 --> 00:02:07.930
We want it to be about the origin,

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.457
so about the point zero zero.

00:02:10.457 --> 00:02:13.763
This is what we want to, the
dilation about the origin

00:02:13.763 --> 00:02:18.554
with a scale factor of 1/3, scale is 1/3.

00:02:18.554 --> 00:02:20.207
Scale factor, I should say.

00:02:20.207 --> 00:02:21.780
So how do we do this?

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.063
Well here, however far
A is from the origin

00:02:26.063 --> 00:02:29.903
we now want to be in the same
direction, but 1/3 as far.

00:02:29.903 --> 00:02:32.599
So one way to think about it,
to go from the origin to A

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.516
you have to go six down
and three to the right.

00:02:39.226 --> 00:02:44.118
So 1/3 of that would be two
down and one to the right.

00:02:44.118 --> 00:02:48.285
Two is 1/3 of six and one is 1/3 of three,

00:02:49.911 --> 00:02:52.210
so you will end up right over here.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.796
That would be our A prime.

00:02:53.796 --> 00:02:57.992
So notice, you are 1/3
away from the origin

00:02:57.992 --> 00:03:00.066
as we were before because once again,

00:03:00.066 --> 00:03:03.992
this is point A under a
dilation about the origin

00:03:03.992 --> 00:03:06.406
with a scale factor of 1/3.
