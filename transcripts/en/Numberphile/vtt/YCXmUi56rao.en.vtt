00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
[Hannah] Do you want to share
this sandwich with me, Brady?

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.900
[Brady] Uh, do you know what?
I kinda do.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.740
[H] It looks really appetizing.
[B] It's nice.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.000
[H] Don't you think?
[B] Yeah.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.020
[H] This bread's been squashed
in my bag a little bit.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.500
[B] Yeah, I love that you went for white bread.
Like, you didn't, you know, go all trendy and go...

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.360
[H] No. None of that, none of that.
I want full-on carbs, that's what I want.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.460
Okay, if we're gonna do this fairly then, Brady,
I think we need to cut the sandwich in half...

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.780
But that does leave me with a bit of a quandary,
because how do I know exactly

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.380
what a half a sandwich is?

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.360
Because look, you know,
you've got this bread's sort of lopping around there,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.980
the ham isn't exactly even...

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.900
You know, how do you-
how do you...?

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.420
If this sandwich is a bit badly made,
as I am prone to doing,

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.620
how can you work out where halfway is?

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.200
[B] Well, first of all,
how are we defining half a sandwich?

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.640
What is half a sandwich?

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.400
[H] I want exactly half of this slice,

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.260
I want exactly half of the ham,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.500
and I want exactly half of that slice.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.460
[B] Does the cut have to be straight?
[H] Oh yeah, and only one cut.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.040
And it doesn't matter
where the sandwich is.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.820
I want it even if it's like that.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.880
But thankfully,
the Ham Sandwich Theorem can help us!

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.180
So, the Ham Sandwich Theorem says that

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.620
when you have three objects
in three-dimensional space,

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.640
you will be able to cut each of them
exactly in half using only one cut.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.840
And.. The best way to explain this
is by building up from just one slice.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.660
Let's say that you want to cut
this slice of bread in half.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.220
But... Let's imagine someone's already come past
and taken a bit of a nibble off of it.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.340
Just so it's a bit harder.
'Cus, you know.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.180
[B] Okay.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.120
[H] Hmm, that's a bit better.
Okay. Uh, now-

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.340
[B] So it's less obvious where to cut.
[H] Less obvious where to cut.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.000
Let's muck it up a little bit more,
here we go.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.960
Less obvious where to cut.
Right, we want to get this exactly in half,

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.760
this slice of bread.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.034
Now if I hold the knife here,

00:01:45.034 --> 00:01:48.640
all of the bread is on
this side of the knife.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.360
And if I move the knife over there,

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.940
now, all of the bread
is on this side of the knife.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.860
So what that means is that there must be
some point in the middle

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.980
where exactly half of the bread
is on this side,

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.720
and half of the bread
is on that side.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.800
[B] The crossover point.
[H] Exactly, exactly.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.580
But that was me
holding the knife at this angle

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.020
and moving through that way.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.420
It would also be true
if I heard the knife that way,

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.740
or... [Cracks up] Slightly more difficult
to get the angles, but that way.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:24.440
So any angle at which I hold the knife,
I can guarantee that there's gonna be some point

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.940
where half of the bread
is on either side.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.980
Regardless of the fact that the bread is all,
kind of, messed up and been eaten by mice.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.940
So! That's fine.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.780
Now, let's imagine
that we add in our ham.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.220
Let's make it a little bit more difficult,
let's kinda fold the ham up in a slightly awkward way...

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.800
[H] [Laughs]
[B] Cool.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.120
[H] Yum.
[B] Nice. I'm going off the sandwich a bit.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.720
[Both laughing]

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.860
[H] Is it 'cus
I keep touching it?

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.100
[B] I hadn't thought about that!
Now I'm definitely off it.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.280
[Both continue laughing]

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.280
[H] "Welcome to cooking
with Hannah!"

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.580
[B] Right, yeah.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:02.500
[H] We already know that we can cut
this slice of bread here at any angle, okay?

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.760
So what we can do is we can
pick a point on this bread,

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.340
let's say like that,

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.920
where we know that 50%
of the bread is on this side,

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.740
and 50% is on that side.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:20.640
But, what you'll notice is that all of our ham, now,
in this example, is on this side of the knife.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.880
But because we know
that we can cut this bread at any angle,

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.820
You can rotate this knife
so that now all of the ham is on this side.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.300
Which means that there must be a point in the middle,

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.560
Where exactly half of the ham is on this side of the knife and half on the other side?

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.580
[B] There's one magic line.
[H] At least one magic line.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:45.420
Now, the third component: this extra slice of bread. Yum! Brady, look at this delicious sandwich, I've made!

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.420
[B] Nice, nice.
[H] Okay.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.900
You can apply the same principles.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.380
It's slightly trickier to explain this one, but the idea is the same.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.220
Except in this case, you now have the angle of the knife to play with as well.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.300
So you're sorta sweeping over, turning it around and rotating it that way, and that way.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:11.360
There should be a way where you can make a cut through all three perfectly in half.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.860
One small thing; we know for a fact that this line exists.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:22.580
The theory doesn't actually help you find it very much.  So, there's that.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.980
[B]: Who came up with this?
[H]: It was originally suggested by Steinhaus and Banach.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.200
That's Banach, from a Banach Tarski thing,

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:38.200
where you can rearrange a sphere to make two spheres that look basically the same as the original one did.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:44.160
And, but then it was proved in the N dimensional case, by Stone and Tukey.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.180
[B]: There seem to be a lot of mathematical problems that center around things that happen in lunch rooms and tea breaks, isn't there?

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.240
[H]: Weird, huh?  I know.
[B]: Right.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.400
[H]: Exactly.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.700
Yeah, you'd always think that maybe that was the most productive part of a mathematicians day.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.620
See these five circles on the screen?

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:06.500
Do you think you can draw a line through them, that will divide them into two equal parts with the same area and perimeter?

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.520
***Spoiler Alert***

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.720
Apparently the answer is yes, and it uses the Ham Sandwich problem that you just watched a video about.
