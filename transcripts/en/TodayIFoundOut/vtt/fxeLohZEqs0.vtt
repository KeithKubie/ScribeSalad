00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.200
Controversial research programs, unethical
experimentation, and human trials have been

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.200
part of the medical field for centuries.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.200
It doesn’t make it any less wrong, but certain
scientists with questionable ethics have gotten

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.200
away with a lot in the name of, well, science.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.200
The more (in)famous examples of wayward science
include eugenics sterilization, electroshock

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.200
therapy, ionizing radiation experiments, and
the CIA program MKULTRA.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.200
But the government sponsored Tuskegee syphilis
experiment, a program that ran for forty years

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.200
in Macon County, Alabama during the mid-20th
century, is one of the more appalling and

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.200
deceitful of the bunch.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.200
In 1932, the medical community still did not
know a whole lot about treating syphilis.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.200
This was the case despite documentation of
the disease dating all the way back to just

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.390
after Columbus made his famous jaunt across
the big blue.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.340
According to the Oxford Journal, syphilis
was a “cultural embarrassment” and had

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.360
many different names that exemplified prejudices
of different nationalities.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.770
The German and English called it the “French
Pox.”

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.390
The Russians referred to it as the “Polish
sickness” and the Poles as the “German

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.390
sickness.”

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.649
The Japanese called it the “Chinese ulcer.”

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:41.890
In the 16th century, Europe experienced a
syphilis epidemic likely caused by the abundance

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.840
of sailors traveling from sea port to sea
port and doing what sailors do when they come

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.840
into port.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.890
In fact, there is some evidence that points
to Columbus and his crew being the ones who

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.150
brought syphilis back from the new world.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.450
Either way, despite the disease being around
for at least 450 years (and some evidence

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.530
points to longer than that), there was no
one, true, successful treatment for it.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.170
One popular remedy for several centuries was
the use of mercury, which is quite poisonous

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.950
in it’s own right, either by ingestion or
rubbing it on the skin.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.840
This led to the popular saying “a night
in the arms of Venus leads to a lifetime on

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.840
Mercury.”

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.479
In 1908, Japanese scientist Sahachiro Hata
(working in Germany) discovered the drug Salvarsan

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.270
was somewhat effective as a treatment for
syphilis.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.249
It was also quite toxic, as it came from the
arsenic family.

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:32.499
There were instances of patients losing limbs
after taking the drug.

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:37.549
Eventually, in 1912, Hata and Nobel Prize
winner Paul Ehlric developed a easier-to-administer,

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:42.880
but still toxic, drug called Neosalvarsan—which
became the standard treatment for syphilis

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.880
until the late 1940s.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.305
Tuskegee University was established in 1881
as a school for former slaves to pursue higher

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:46.305
education after the Civil War.

00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:47.305
It was the brainchild of Lewis Adams, a former
slave, and George W. Campbell, a former slaveholder.

00:01:47.305 --> 00:01:48.305
A year later, in 1882, the great Booker T.
Washington became president of the school

00:01:48.305 --> 00:01:49.305
and expanded the University by buying the
grounds of a former plantation near by.

00:01:49.305 --> 00:01:50.305
The school was located in Tuskegee, Alabama,
which was part of Macon County.

00:01:50.305 --> 00:01:51.305
As stated by Tuskegee.edu, this region was
often referred to as the “Black Belt”

00:01:51.305 --> 00:01:52.305
because of “its rich soil and vast number
of black sharecroppers who were the economic

00:01:52.305 --> 00:01:53.305
backbone of the region.”

00:01:53.305 --> 00:01:54.305
In the early 20th century, the United States
Public Health Service (PHS) was in charge

00:01:54.305 --> 00:01:55.305
of monitoring, identifying, and figuring out
ways to treat ailments, diseases, and conditions

00:01:55.305 --> 00:01:56.869
that were impacting all US citizens.

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.369
They were divided into divisions, with one
division completely focused on venereal diseases.

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.340
In 1957, this particular division would be
transferred over the Center for Disease Control

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.080
(CDC), but in 1932 the PHS covered sexual
transmitted diseases.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:18.410
Between 1929-1931, the Rosenwald Fund, an
organization that promoted the education and

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.280
health care of poor African-American farmers,
sponsored a study with the PHS to identify

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.010
the Southern counties with the highest rate
of syphilis among African-American males.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.990
Their original intention was to identify and
treat the disease.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.260
Macon County, Alabama had the highest rate,
with over thirty five percent of the male

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.870
population infected with the disease.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.880
By 1931, the Great Depression was at it’s
height and the Rosenwald Funds were short.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.209
Despite the need to continue research, the
Rosenwald Fund stopped operating in this capacity.

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.750
So, the PHS approached the Tuskegee Institute
(located in Macon County) about forming a

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.230
research group in order to study the effects
of untreated syphilis on a black male population

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.240
for a duration of six to nine months and then
follow-up with a treatment plan.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.650
The Institute agreed, along with the head
of the University’s hospital Dr. Eugene

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.650
Dibble, and was complacent through the first
year, thinking treatment was the ultimate

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:05.650
goal.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.650
Later, they would claim they were deceived
themselves and just as much victimized as

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:07.650
the men in the study.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.650
The study, during the first year, was led
by Dr. Taliafero Clark.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.010
The PHS enrolled six hundred Macon County
men, 399 with syphilis and 201 who weren’t

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.720
infected, to be part of the study.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.330
None of the men actually knew what the study
was for.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.659
They were lured in with the promise of “free
health care,” something that none of them

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:26.739
had, and treatment of “bad blood,” a general
localized term that encompassed several different

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.459
afflictions, including anemia, fatigue, and
other venereal diseases.

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.739
The men were told that they were going to
get free medical exams, meals, and burial

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:35.739
insurance.

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.819
For those who actually had syphilis, they
were never informed of their diagnosis nor

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.269
given any treatment for it.

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.959
Additionally, very painful and unnecessary
spinal taps were performed on many in the

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:47.959
study.

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.030
It was said that the reason for the deception
was that it would be the only way the men

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.510
would stay in the study and the researchers
wanted to closely observe the course of the

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.709
disease over a large sample-size to see the
effects as the disease progressed, even to

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:02.709
death.

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.720
But not to worry, as long as the ones that
died allowed autopsies to be performed, their

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.920
funeral expenses were covered…

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.409
It was actually not an uncommon practice at
the time of taking the government’s consent

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:14.440
in medical manners, rather than the individual.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.910
But in part, the deception seemed to result
from the lack of respect the doctors had for

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.170
the men’s intellectual capabilities (most
were illiterate, which the researchers thought

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.720
was helpful as it would be harder for the
subjects to figure out what was going on);

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.040
there was also less than subtle hints of racial
prejudice.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.890
In a letter to a colleague, according to a
Michigan State 2005 medical ethics curriculum,

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.070
Dr. Clark wrote that “these negroes are
very ignorant and easily influenced by things

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.560
that would be of minor significance in a more
intelligent group.”

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.290
Dr. Raymond Vonderlehr was the on-site director
of the study.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.450
He actually supported partial treatment for
the men for the sole purpose of making sure

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.100
they remained in the study (as in, stayed
alive).

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.761
He was the one who gained “consent” of
the men for the painful spinal taps by framing

00:04:55.761 --> 00:04:56.761
them as a “special free treatment.”

00:04:56.761 --> 00:04:57.761
In letters he sent to the men with the header
from the Macon County Health Department, it

00:04:57.761 --> 00:04:58.761
read,

00:04:58.761 --> 00:05:00.850
You will now be given a last chance for a
second examination.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.260
This examination is a very special one and
after it is finished you will be given a special

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.450
treatment if it is believed you are in condition
to stand it.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.560
The study, originally only intended to go
nine months, went beyond a year and then,

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.400
due to breakthroughs, extended.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.410
In 1934, two years after the study began,
the first major medical paper was published

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.180
detailing health effects on untreated syphilis.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.910
By 1936, according to the CDC, a medical paper
was published criticizing the treatment plan

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:28.910
for the men.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.380
1940, once again according to the CDC website,
brought efforts “to hinder the men (in the

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.430
study) from getting treatment ordered under
the military draft effort.”

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.970
You see, about 250 of them had registered
for the draft and been found to have syphilis

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.630
and ordered to be treated.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.380
In 1928, Nobel laureate Alexander Fleming
discovered penicillin.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.030
1930 was the first recorded medicinal use
of penicillin to treat infections.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.260
After penicillin was used to treat the survivors
of the Boston Cocoanut Grove fire in 1942,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.410
it became the medicine of choice for the United
States military for infections.

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:03.020
By 1945, penicillin was the accepted treatment
for syphilis.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.590
Despite this, the subjects of the Tuskegee
Syphilis Experiment were never administered

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.930
nor offered penicillin as treatment.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.590
The study administrators wanted to watch the
progression of the disease as the men got

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:18.210
sick and, in many cases, died for the forty
years the study went on even though for much

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.230
of it a relatively effective treatment was
available.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:26.770
All total it’s estimated that 128 of the
men died either directly from syphilis or

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:32.630
complications related to it, 40 infected their
wives (and in some cases possibly others),

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:37.030
and there were 19 of the men’s children
born with congenital syphilis.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:42.220
Finally, on July 25, 1972, Jean Heller of
the Associated Press broke the story that

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.560
uncovered the truth about the study.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.100
A government panel ruled that the study was
“ethically unjustified” and it ended.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:52.430
In the summer of 1973, attorney Fred Grey
filed a class-action suit on behalf of the

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:56.830
men against the PHS and it ended with nine
million dollars (about fifty million dollars

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:01.900
today) being handed out to the participants
as settlement.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.170
In a similar study, this time to test penicillin’s
effectiveness in treating syphilis and other

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:12.920
STDs, researchers led by Dr. John Charles
Cutler from the United States (funded by the

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.420
Public Health Services, the Pan American Health
Sanitary Bureau, and the National Institutes

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.880
of Health) headed to Guatemala in 1946 and
found prostitutes who had syphilis, getting

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:26.630
them to then give it to unsuspecting Guatemalan
soldiers, mental health patients, and prisoners.

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:33.310
They also directly infected certain individuals
by “…direct inoculations made from syphilis

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:38.490
bacteria poured into the men’s penises and
on forearms and faces that were slightly abraded

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:41.920
… or in a few cases through spinal punctures.”

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.080
It isn’t known how many people died as a
result of this as the results from the study

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:59.780
were never published.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:04.030
Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease,
and one of the symptoms is marks on the hands

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:05.650
and face of the infected person.

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:09.920
These marks could often be found during this
time on Catholic priests, cardinals, and a

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:10.920
pope.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.880
It showed that celibacy couldn’t be policed
and was not always followed.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:18.430
For reference, Catholic priests were first
required to be celibate in 304 AD thanks to

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:23.900
the Council of Elvira, which resulted in Canon
33 stating: “bishops, presbyters, and deacons

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:27.350
and all other clerics… [must] abstain completely
from their wives…”

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:30.960
However, this wasn’t widely adopted at this
time and it wasn’t until the Second Lateran

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.659
Council of 1139 when priests were forbidden
to marry.

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:40.030
In 1563, the Council of Trent once again affirmed
this stance on celibacy and against marriage.

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.599
The priests are still human, however.

00:08:42.599 --> 00:08:48.630
Martin Luther said it best when he stated,
“Nature never lets up…

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.970
We are all driven to the secret sin.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:09:10.750
To say it crudely but honestly, if it doesn’t
go into a woman, it goes into your shirt.”
