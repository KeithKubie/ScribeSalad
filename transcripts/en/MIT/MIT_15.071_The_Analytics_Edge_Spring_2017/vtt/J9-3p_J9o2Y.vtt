00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.490
In this video, we'll design
the optimization problem

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.520
that the operating room
manager would need to solve.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.090
The decision to be made is
how many operating rooms

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.760
to assign each
department on each day.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.120
This means that we need
to define integer decision

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.810
variables x_jk.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.430
x_jk will represent the
number of operating rooms

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.040
department j is
allocated on day k.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.780
So here j can take values such
as ophthalmology, gynecology,

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.460
general surgery, and so on.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.010
Whereas k would take values
like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.020
and so on.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.650
The objective of
this problem will

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.930
be to maximize the percent
of target allocation hours

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.890
that each department
is actually allocated.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.830
So if target allocation hours
are t_j for department j,

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:13.680
then we want to maximize the sum
of 8*x_jk divided by t_j over

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.660
all departments and
days of the week.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.050
Let's break this down.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.070
For example, if
otolaryngology has

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.640
a target of 37.3
hours per week--

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.760
that means t_j equals to
37.3-- and we allocate them

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.930
4 operating rooms, then their
percent of target allocation

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.160
hours is equal to
8 times 4, that

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.229
is, they got 32 hours,
divided by the 37.3 hours

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:43.560
they asked for.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.229
So they got 85.8%
of what they wanted.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.150
And we try to maximize
this percentage value

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.150
for every department.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.450
So that's why we sum
over all departments

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.640
and all days of the week.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.880
Let's continue on
to the constraints.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.389
Remember that Mount Sinai
has 10 operating rooms.

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.380
Therefore, at most
10 operating rooms

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.079
can be assigned
on any given day.

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:19.220
Also, the number of operating
rooms allocated to a department

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.440
on a given day cannot exceed
the number of surgery teams that

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.860
the department has
available that day.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.420
And as we said before, we must
meet department daily minimums

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.060
and maximums as well as
weekly minimums and maximums.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.160
Let's turn these
constraints into math.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.510
So the first constraint is
that at most 10 operating rooms

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.540
can be assigned
on any given day.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.100
Let's consider
Monday for example.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.220
That means that x
for ophthalmology

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.090
on Monday plus x for
gynecology on Monday

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.010
plus x for oral
surgery on Monday

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.000
plus x for
otolaryngology on Monday

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.850
plus x for general
surgery on Monday

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.110
must add up to something
less than or equal to 10.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.530
We would have a
similar constraint

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.700
for Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday and Friday.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.710
The next set of constraints is
that the number of operating

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.500
rooms allocated to a department
on a given day cannot exceed

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.610
the number of surgery teams
that are available that day.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:27.930
So for example, for
gynecology on Friday

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.079
there are 3 teams available.

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:35.750
That means that x gynecology
Friday must be between 0 and 3.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.540
For oral surgery on Wednesday
it must be between 0 and 0

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.780
because the oral surgeon is only
in on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.530
The next set of
constraints is that we

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.390
must meet department daily
minimums and maximums.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.060
For example, the general
surgery department on Tuesday

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.570
requires between 0
and 6 operating rooms.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.160
We would have a similar
constraint for every department

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.910
and for every day of the week.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.810
We also need to meet department
weekly minimums and maximums.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.150
So for example, the
ophthalmology department

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.970
has a minimum of 3 and a
maximum of 6 operating rooms

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.959
that it needs in any given week.
