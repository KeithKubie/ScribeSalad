00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.440
In this session we discussed
variables and constants.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.560
They're indeed two of the most basic
ingredients of any application.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.660
As you've seen, you can accomplish many
simple tasks using just variables and

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:12.680
constants.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.190
But soon you'll start combining
variables into larger constructs

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.520
to build solutions to
more complex problems.
