00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.640
Evaluate the expression 4n
to the first power minus 2n

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.900
to the zeroth power for n
equals 1 and n equals 5.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.630
So, let's do n equals 1 first.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.660
So, every place we see an
n, let's put a 1 in there.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:21.270
So this is equal to 4 times 1 to
the first power minus 2 times 1

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.630
to the zeroth power.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.480
Every place we saw an
n, we have an n there.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.240
We have an n to the
first, one to the first.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.100
So remember, we want to do
our order of operations.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.900
We have PEMDAS.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.233
And I'm going to write it
this way just to make it clear

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:36.600
that we do parentheses
then exponentiation.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.870
Then multiplication and
division are at the same level,

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.300
they get the same priority.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.670
And then addition
and subtraction

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.170
get the same priority.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.060
So, we want to do our exponents
before we do anything else.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.640
There are no parentheses here.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.510
So, we first want to evaluate
one to the first power.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.230
And anything to the first
power is just that anything.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.970
If I just have any number
to the first power,

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.340
that is just going to
be equal to that number.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.720
So, 1 to the first power
is just equal to 1.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.724
So, this is going
to be 4 times 1.

00:01:05.724 --> 00:01:06.390
Let me write it.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.930
4 times 1 minus 2 times
1 to the zeroth power.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.610
Now, any number other
than 0 to the zeroth power

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.230
is going to be 1.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.870
So, if I tell you x to the
zeroth power is equal to what?

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.850
And I tell you that
x is not equal to 0.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.870
What is x to the zeroth power?

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.390
You should immediately
know that it is equal to 1.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.330
I exclude 0 because
0 to the zeroth power

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.240
is usually undefined.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.659
Or for our purposes, you can
accept it to be undefined.

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.325
And maybe in the
future, I'll do a video

00:01:40.325 --> 00:01:43.240
on explaining why
it's undefined.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.920
There's some good arguments
for why this should be 0.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.675
Because 0 to pretty much
any other power is a 0.

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:50.300
But then there's a
really good argument

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.258
for why it should be 1.

00:01:51.258 --> 00:01:54.830
Because any other number
to the zeroth power is 1.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.520
So that's why,
for the most part,

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.120
we like to keep this undefined.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.000
So with that said, 1
to the zeroth power

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.630
is just going to be 1.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.460
Anything other than 0 to
the zeroth power is 1.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.250
So, we have 4 times 1, which is
4, minus 2 times 1, which is 2.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.700
So, 4 minus 2 is
just equal to 2.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.100
Now, let's do the same
thing with n equals 5.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.650
So it becomes 4 times 5 to the
first power minus 2 times 5

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.480
to the zeroth power.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.010
Same thing.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.890
5 to the first power is
just going to be equal to 5.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.780
So, I want to do that
in a different color.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.100
5 to the first power is
just going to be equal to 5.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.550
5 to the zeroth power is
just going to be equal to 1.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.440
And so, this expression becomes
4 times 5 minus 2 times 1.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:55.470
Or 4 times 5 is 20, minus
2 times 1, that is 2.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.670
And this is equal to 18.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.460
And we're done.
