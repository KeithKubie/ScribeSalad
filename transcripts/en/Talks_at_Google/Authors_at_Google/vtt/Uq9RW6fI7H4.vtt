ELLEN SPERTUS: Thank you
for coming here today

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.960
to hear Jessica Stern of IGLHRC.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.580
Jessica Stern is the
executive director

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.740
of the International Gay and
Lesbian Human Rights Commission

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.460
and specializes in gender,
sexuality, and human rights

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.010
globally.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.130
She was the first researcher
on LGBT rights at Human Rights

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.000
Watch and a Ralph Bunche Fellow
at Amnesty International,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.730
where she conducted fact-finding
investigations and advocacy

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.300
in relation to Iran, Kyrgyzstan,
South Africa, and the United

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.660
Arab Emirates.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.280
Prior to working
internationally,

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.970
she campaigned extensively for
social and economic justice

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.130
in the United States
for the Center

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.600
for Constitutional Rights, the
National Gay and Lesbian Task

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.910
Force, the Urban
Justice Center, and is

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.980
a co-founding collective member
of Bluestockings bookstore.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.540
A past board member of
Queers for Economic Justice,

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.450
she currently serves on the
board of the International Bar

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.760
Association's committee on
LGBT rights and the law.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.220
Educated at the London
School of Economics,

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.420
she's taught graduate
and law classes

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.165
at Columbia University, the
City University of New York,

00:01:15.165 --> 00:01:18.780
and Universidad de los Andes.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.790
There's paragraphs
more I could read

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.290
about her many accomplishments,
but instead I'd

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.450
like to say a few words
about my experiences.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.430
I've been following
IGLHRC, as it's called,

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.250
for about two decades.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.420
I remember when there was
the change in government

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.290
in South Africa, that they
played a role in getting

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.520
LGBT rights enshrined into
the constitution, which

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.340
is one of the best in the world.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.570
I also remember that
back when they started,

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.040
it was because no other
organization was looking

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.930
at LGBT rights internationally.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.480
There'd been a movement to try
to get Amnesty International

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.920
to include homosexuals among
the prisoners of conscience,

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.690
but they didn't.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.900
Back then in 1990,
gay rights was not

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.710
considered human rights.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.350
And that has changed,
Amnesty International,

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:23.280
Human Rights Watch, IGLHRC
also pioneered work on asylum

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.590
for people escaping prejudice
against GLBTs and people

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.020
with AIDS, another group
they've worked to help.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.390
And now that standard,
that's accepted.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.750
When I visited the IGLHRC
offices about 20 years ago,

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.200
I remember seeing
their database and how

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.260
surprised I was that
for gender, they

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.540
had male, female, and other.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.170
And nowadays, that's
something that we pretty much

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.210
take for granted.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.730
It's offered on Facebook
and some Google projects.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.760
But back then, it wasn't.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.680
It's because of
pioneers like IGLHRC

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.250
that so many other organizations
are doing similar work.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.140
Unfortunately, there's
still a lot left to do.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.965
As William Gibson said,
"The future is already here.

00:03:12.965 --> 00:03:16.250
It's just not very
evenly distributed."

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.770
So there have been
tremendous advances

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.820
in GLBT rights in
the United States

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.600
and some other
countries, although more

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.090
remains to be done.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.900
But we set our clocks
back an hour this weekend.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.450
Uganda recently set
it back 100 years.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.790
So if you've ever wished you
could have helped the pioneers

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.360
before, who worked
hard, who were brave,

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.150
who showed themselves
like Alan Turing,

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.150
before it was safe to do
so, you can help such people

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.490
through groups like IGLHRC.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.680
OK, I'll turn things
over to our speaker.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.820
JESSICA STERN: I'm Jessica,
and I thank Ellen Spertus very

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.000
much for organizing this
today, and I thank all of you

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.190
for working through
lunch to talk

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.110
about LGBT rights
and social justice.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.360
Ellen gave the acronym
of my organization

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.590
because that is how
we call ourselves,

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.140
but we actually have
a very long name.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.649
It's the International Gay
and Lesbian Human Rights

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:23.560
Commission,
I-G-L-H-R-C for short.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.280
And it doesn't sound good in any
language anywhere in the world,

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.560
but I'm going to say
IGLHRC a lot today.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.890
I'm probably going to speak
in acronyms a fair amount.

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.200
The one I'll use most
frequently is LGBT.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.330
Do people know what LGBT means?

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.510
Yes, OK.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.780
In case anyone's
unfamiliar, it's

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.110
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual,
and Transgender.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.350
And we're talking about
LGBT rights globally today,

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.670
so I really want to
underscore that "LGBT"

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.340
is a placeholder for much more
nuanced, much more complicated

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.920
ways of describing
ourselves, whether it's

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.410
how I would present myself to
someone in a bar in the Castro

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.560
or how I would describe myself
if I were speaking in Spanish.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.669
So LGBT is going to be
the jargon you here today.

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:16.460
And perhaps during the
question and answer,

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.876
we can talk about other terms
that you think are relevant.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:26.160
So the title of my
talk is "Post-Sochi,

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.680
Where LGBT Rights are Getting
the Gold and Getting Prison

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.780
Terms."

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:37.610
And I propose that we talk
about four key issues today.

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:42.000
So the first is what's been
happening internationally

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.980
for LGBT rights, and
I'm going to focus

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.930
on three of the biggest
stories of late as

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.350
kind of case studies.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:54.219
So we're going to talk about
Russia, India, and Uganda.

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:55.760
The second thing I
want to talk about

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.658
is, what meaning and effect
do these laws actually have?

00:05:59.658 --> 00:06:02.116
Are they just laws on the books,
or are there consequences?

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.360
At that point, I think you
might feel really depressed,

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.460
so the next topic will
be reasons for hope.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.240
And then the
fourth, final, and I

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.790
think most important piece
is global solidarity.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.900
What works, what doesn't?

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.640
How does that sound?

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.290
All right?

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.810
OK, great.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:24.310
Thank you.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.250
So starting with what's
happening today for LGBT rights

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.010
internationally, I
would argue to you

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.870
that over the last six
months, LGBT rights

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:43.890
have assumed an unheralded
prominence in global affairs.

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.940
And I'm going to
start with Russia.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:51.470
So in June of 2013, in the
name of children's rights,

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:54.650
Russian President Vladimir
Putin passed a law

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:58.290
that takes aim at
anyone, it claims,

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:03.120
quote, "promoting nontraditional
sexual relations."

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.640
And I always love
terms like that, right,

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.650
because they're so
broadly defined.

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:12.120
And we know that the code is,
in many ways, homosexuality.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.940
In this particular
context, we know this

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.990
because we know what
arguments have been used.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.030
But actually what's
really being criminalized

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.770
is any sexuality that's
not considered acceptable

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:25.010
at a current moment.

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.430
Under this law what
I would probably

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:32.220
describe as life-saving
information about LGBT

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.820
rights and public
health was equated

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:40.280
with pornography and
child sexual abuse.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:44.260
Any individual or legal
entity, quote unquote,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:49.490
"distributing" information about
these nontraditional sexual

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:52.350
relations can be punished.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:57.130
And the fines range from
$3,100 for an individual

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:01.860
to $31,000 for a legal entity.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.640
And I have to tell
you that I don't

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.340
know a single nonprofit
anywhere in the world,

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.190
whether in Russia or
elsewhere, that has

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:12.290
$31,000 to spare because
they've been doing LGBT rights

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:13.390
education.

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:15.830
And I definitely don't know
a single activist anywhere

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:19.056
that has $3,000 to spare.

00:08:19.056 --> 00:08:20.430
And given that
we're at Google, I

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:24.910
think it's important to say
that the fines range in size,

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:28.100
but the steeper fines
are for information

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.550
that's distributed online.

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:32.659
So information that
anybody can get to

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:34.620
is some of the
information that is

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:38.510
seen as the most threatening,
the most criminal.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:43.320
And I want to mention that prior
to President Putin's signature,

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:47.770
the lower chamber of the federal
assembly, the State Duma,

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:49.013
passed this bill unanimously.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.540
But there's good news.

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:56.480
This terrible bill was
enacted, but outrage

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.010
erupted internationally.

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:01.720
Let me run through some
of the examples of this.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.320
First, you probably read
about it in the media,

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.660
right, because it
was everywhere.

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.390
The media ran story
after story about what

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.990
was happening in Russia.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:15.340
Second, even the International
Olympic Committee

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:20.490
had to get involved because,
pressured by LGBT activists,

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:24.630
they actually raised concerns
with the Russian government

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:28.910
to ensure the safety of
LGBT athletes and tourists

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:32.540
during the Sochi Winter Games.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.750
There were people who questioned
whether Russian products should

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:37.980
be boycotted entirely.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.970
And there were even some
not too far from here

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:42.980
who dumped vodka
that they thought

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.290
was made in Russia
into the harbor.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.190
Russian LGBT activists
had to organize.

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:54.130
So imagine a country
as vast as Russia.

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:55.720
There are many
different organizations

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.290
working for LGBT rights.

00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:00.500
There are many allies
working alongside of them.

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.910
And they had to form a
coalition and find unanimity

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:06.930
because suddenly they
had to answer questions

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:08.980
flooding in from around
the world about what

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:13.170
was good solidarity and
what would be hurtful.

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:17.220
Celebrities from Lady Gaga
to Madonna to Elton John

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.120
spoke out against the bill.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.580
And you know that an issue
has been mainstreamed

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:25.240
when American Apparel start
selling t-shirts about it.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:30.800
And we go from Russia to
India, hopefully with love.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.870
In 2009 the New Delhi
High Court struck down

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:37.030
the country's sodomy law.

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:41.950
The sodomy law was a colonial
inheritance from the British.

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:44.170
And with it, the
New Delhi High Court

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:48.240
issued a verdict so stunningly
beautiful in its affirmation

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:52.500
of humanity and human rights
that it became a model

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.270
decision, studied
around the world.

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:58.200
The court found
that the sodomy law

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.360
was in violation of the
Indian constitution,

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:06.343
specifically the guarantees
of equality before the law,

00:11:06.343 --> 00:11:11.890
prohibition from discrimination,
and the protection of life

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:13.035
and personal liberty.

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:19.840
So as you can imagine, LGBT
activists, LGBT people in India

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.160
rejoiced.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.260
But the decision was
appealed to a higher court.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:29.570
And in December 2013, the
Supreme Court of India

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:31.360
struck down the ruling.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.690
And with its decision,
sodomy was again

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:34.945
criminalized in India.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.220
Because of the influence of the
decision of the New Delhi High

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.520
Court, everyone was
watching and waiting

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.300
for years for this decision.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.570
Indian activists working
through the coalition known

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:55.090
as Voices Against 377 called
for a day of solidarity.

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.990
And in less than a
week, on December 15,

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:00.590
vigils and protests were
held throughout the world.

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:07.120
Moving on from India to
Uganda, which I think

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.880
is probably the most
famous story of them all.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.900
The issue of LGBTI
rights in Uganda

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.790
resurfaced one
Friday in December

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:17.740
when the Ugandan
parliament convened

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:21.040
an extraordinary session
to pass what was then

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.440
known as the
anti-homosexuality bill.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.920
And two weeks ago,
Ugandan president Museveni

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.610
signed the bill
into law, never mind

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:34.250
that homosexuality was
already criminalized.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:37.480
Have you guys been
hearing about Uganda?

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.350
Yes.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.010
It's been hard not
to hear about it

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:41.742
because it's such
a serious issue.

00:12:41.742 --> 00:12:43.575
And the reason why it's
such a serious issue

00:12:43.575 --> 00:12:46.660
is because what's actually
written into the law itself.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:50.000
So I'll just highlight
four points about the law.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.280
The first is that
the new law calls

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:55.880
for life imprisonment for
so-called serial offenders.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.920
So someone utterly
boring like me,

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.130
who goes home to my
partner every day

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:03.380
and tries to cook dinner
but sometimes just

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.540
succeeds in ordering
takeout, I would

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.610
be considered a serial offender.

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:09.385
And I would be liable
upon conviction

00:13:09.385 --> 00:13:10.260
to life imprisonment.

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:18.230
The second point is that
activism for LGBT rights

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:25.580
is criminalizes, with conviction
of up to seven years in prison.

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:27.590
And it is written into
the law in a way that

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:31.190
is so broad that human rights
activists of all stripes

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:33.080
can be targeted.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.990
So what you see is
that this law is also

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:39.010
being used to silence debate,
to silence public opinion,

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:41.740
to silence dissent.

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.860
A third issue in my
reading of the law

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:50.220
is that it effectively sentences
LGBT people to homelessness.

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:51.720
And this is because,
again, the law

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.985
is written so broadly
and punitively

00:13:54.985 --> 00:13:58.810
that any landlord would
fear criminal conviction

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:02.570
for up to five years for
renting to someone suspected

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:05.180
of being LGBT.

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.240
And in that scenario, what I
think is also really important

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.870
is that the rule of
law doesn't really

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:12.920
matter because you
don't get charged.

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.460
You don't go before
a magistrate.

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:17.790
It's the mere
perception that you're

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:19.765
LGBT that makes you guilty.

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:24.860
And the fourth and final
point that really strikes me

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:28.890
about the Ugandan law
is that it effectively

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:33.070
requires Ugandan to
tell on Ugandan, parent

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:37.580
to tell on child, neighbor
to tell on neighbor,

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:41.480
in a complete erosion
of the social fabric,

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:45.310
or else face between five and
seven years in prison for,

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:49.870
quote, "aiding and
abetting homosexuality."

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:52.190
A law so far reaching
and so damning

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.975
is not good for anyone,
whatever your views are

00:14:54.975 --> 00:14:56.475
on homosexuality
and transgenderism.

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.550
At the signing of the
bill, President Museveni

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:05.270
announced that
homosexuals-- and I'm

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:08.800
going to quote him here--
"should rehabilitate

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:14.590
themselves, and society
should assist them to do so,"

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:20.510
end quote, leaving little
doubt as to his intention

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:25.585
to reinforce his own political
career on the bodies of LGBT

00:15:25.585 --> 00:15:29.360
Ugandans, human rights
defenders, and their allies.

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:35.460
But significantly,
the world noticed.

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:39.290
Within days, President
Obama said, and I quote,

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:41.870
"Enacting this legislation
will complicate

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:45.530
our valued relationship
with Uganda."

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:47.840
The governments of Norway
and the Netherlands,

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:51.170
both major donors
to Uganda, announced

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:54.130
that they would redirect
portions of their foreign aid

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:58.790
away from government
programs in Uganda.

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:01.160
And in a third
example, the World Bank

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:05.610
announced that it would delay
a $90 million loan to Uganda.

00:16:09.754 --> 00:16:11.170
But I want to
underscore that when

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:15.230
we're talking about LGBT rights
in other people's countries,

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:18.780
we have to also think about LGBT
rights here in this country,

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:22.090
in the United States.

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:23.560
And things have
been looking pretty

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.410
good for LGBT people in the
US, and that's something

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:27.220
that we celebrate.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.845
And I really celebrate
it standing here

00:16:28.845 --> 00:16:31.770
in California, given all the
work that people have done here

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:35.590
to achieve the progress that
we all are now enjoying.

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:37.740
But I want to remind
everyone that it was just

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:42.050
last month that the Arizona
legislature passed a bill that

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:45.180
would've made it
legal for businesses

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:50.300
to refuse service to anyone
they perceived to be as LGBT.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:53.900
And it took the governor's
veto to prevent this bill

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:57.090
from passing into law.

00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:59.510
And so I think
it's not surprising

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:01.980
that the "Atlantic"
magazine, which

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:06.140
is a 125-year-old mainstream
journal that studies policy

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:11.640
and current events wrote an
article a month ago about how

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.220
Sochi became the gay Olympics.

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:20.859
I want to move on from
the kind of theory

00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:24.810
of the law to the effect of
the law because, as we know,

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:26.510
it's one thing
travel on the books,

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:29.680
but it's quite another thing
to see how it's implemented

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:34.840
and what impact it has on
people's everyday lives.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:39.910
So starting with Russia, LGBT
Russians and mainstream human

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:44.680
rights activists tell IGLHRC
that the anti-gay laws

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:49.140
are a test for a crackdown on
vulnerable groups across Russia

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.310
more broadly.

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:55.010
Today, they say, it
is the LGBT community,

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:58.520
but tomorrow it could be
immigrants and racial,

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:01.380
religious, or ethnic minorities.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:05.040
They tell us that the
treatment of LGBT Russians

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.850
is a litmus test for a
broader right-wing momentum

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:11.520
around state power.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.010
Putin's influence in the
Ukraine and deployment

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:19.420
of troops of late has
underscored their analysis.

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:23.390
And I just want to underscore
this is not about Russian

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:26.580
bashing because there has been
all too much of that lately.

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.220
And there's an ugly
history of Russia

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:30.850
bashing in the United States.

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:32.620
This is actually
about understanding

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:36.410
that there is always a
difference between society

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:39.410
and the government.

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:42.630
But I do want to say that
when the government sacrifices

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:46.920
one group, when the
government incites hatred,

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.930
there are consequences.

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:52.180
Neo-Nazis and
gangs of thugs have

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:56.490
rounded up those they suspect
of being LGBT in Russia,

00:18:56.490 --> 00:19:01.660
shaved their heads to out
them, beaten them severely,

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:03.700
and then bragged
about these beatings

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:05.180
by posting videos online.

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:14.180
In the context in
India, I would say

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.110
that the movement is
getting back on its feet

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:20.720
after what can only be
described as a devastating blow.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:25.340
Lawyers for 377 filed something
called a review petition that

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:28.990
amounts to an appeal,
but it was rejected.

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:32.000
And they are regrouping
and figuring out next steps

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.540
because, clearly, justice
through the courts

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:38.290
is going to be a
long time coming.

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:42.340
In the context of Uganda,
I'll cite maybe five examples

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:44.470
of what the effect has been.

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:46.520
Have you guys read about
the tabloid outings

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.210
that have happened?

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:49.120
Yeah.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:52.470
So within days-- I
think it was actually

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:55.950
within less than 24 hours
of President Museveni

00:19:55.950 --> 00:20:00.350
signing the bill into law,
the first tabloid published

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:01.530
an article.

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:05.370
"Top 200 Homos," it
declared on the front page,

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:08.830
literally sacrificing
people's safety and security

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:12.040
in the interest
of tabloid sales.

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.330
Since then, they've
run subsequent stories

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:18.220
and a second newspaper has
also published names, photos,

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.022
and descriptions
of people, making

00:20:20.022 --> 00:20:21.480
them totally and
completely unsafe.

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:28.390
As a consequence,
LGBT people in Uganda

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:31.350
are terrified, and so are
human rights activists because

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:33.270
of the far-reaching
nature of this law.

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:39.340
Within days of the bill
being signed into law,

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:43.150
we heard of eight
suicide attempts.

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:46.940
And of course President Museveni
has gained a distraction

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:49.180
from other domestic
initiatives that

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.420
have come under
scrutiny for violating

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:53.050
international human
rights standards,

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:56.120
such as the public order
management bill, which

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:59.860
is basically an attack on
community-based organizations

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:03.370
and nonprofits, and the
anti-pornography law, which

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:07.000
in many ways is an
attack on women.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.570
And in the process, he
won populace credibility.

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:13.330
He recently received
the endorsement

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:19.430
of a group of religious leaders
for a fifth term in office.

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.930
Five.

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:28.770
So I guess in
summary I would say

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:32.600
that whether or not
someone finds themselves

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.470
in the crosshairs
of one of these laws

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:36.900
directly, whether or not
a police officer stops

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:40.080
them, arrests
them, charges them,

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.750
they go before a court of
law, and they are eventually

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:45.550
convicted, these laws
have a criminalizing

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:47.820
effect on LGBT people.

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:51.010
They incite hatred
against vulnerable groups.

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:55.150
They make it hard to do HIV and
AIDS prevention and treatment.

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:58.710
They make it hard for people
to rent homes, get jobs, go

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:02.610
to school, feel like they are
valuable and have self-worth

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:05.520
and are entitled to be alive.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:09.810
And these laws
incite mob justice.

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:13.820
They so thoroughly
demonize a group of people

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:17.450
that neighbor turns on neighbor.

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:19.471
Are you all really depressed?

00:22:19.471 --> 00:22:19.970
Good.

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:20.553
You should be.

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:24.630
But that's not the full story.

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:31.680
I think that when we hear about
these kinds of initiatives

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.850
being codified
into law, we should

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:35.730
be freaked out, we
should be horrified,

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:37.910
and we should be angry,
especially when we're

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:42.030
standing in the Bay
Area and so many of us

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:45.030
have LGBT people in our
lives that matter to us.

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:46.940
And we care about human rights.

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:50.160
We know that this is wrong.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:54.100
But I want to argue that
although this moment

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:58.130
and these examples
of legal inequality

00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:00.770
are horrifically bad,
I believe that this

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:05.230
is a temporary dip in the
overall trajectory of equality

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:08.380
and justice for LGBT people.

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:10.520
And so I want to give
you some examples outside

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.550
of these countries so that
you can hear about what's

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:16.740
not really being
covered in the news.

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:23.540
In Nigeria, the same sex
marriage prohibition bill

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:27.990
was signed into law by President
Goodluck Jonathan in December.

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:29.560
And this was very bad.

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:33.350
And it is incredibly serious
for activists in Nigeria.

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:35.140
But the bill was
first introduced

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:38.400
in Nigerian parliament in 2006.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:42.260
And they kept the bill at bay,
so they fought successfully

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:45.220
for years.

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:49.000
And that showed the
tenacity of a movement.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.570
In Zambia, Paul Kasonkomona,
an outspoken HIV

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:57.470
and AIDS activist,
dared to say that stigma

00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:00.690
around homosexuality
and transgenderism

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:02.570
fueled the AIDS crisis.

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:05.960
And he found himself
facing criminal charges.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:13.210
And last month, when standing
before a court of law in Zambia

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:16.910
just outside of
Lusaka, he was forced

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:20.340
to answer the charges
that he had violated

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:24.550
public decency, public morality,
by making such statements.

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:25.870
He was acquitted.

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:29.810
He was acquitted by a local
court of law in Zambia.

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:32.310
And in Chile-- no one
ever talks about Chile

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:36.532
in the American press--
things are happening.

00:24:36.532 --> 00:24:37.990
And I want to tell
you that they're

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:40.360
happening on a major scale.

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:43.070
The senate recently
passed a bill

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:47.870
that would recognize the
expressed gender of people,

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:51.560
regardless of
bodily modification.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.610
And so transgender
people won a victory

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:58.090
in the Chilean senate
with a vote of 29 to zero

00:24:58.090 --> 00:24:58.835
in their favor.

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:04.160
And last but not least, I think
we can talk a little bit more

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.240
about Uganda as a case study.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.680
The bill was, much like the
version in Nigeria, first

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:10.930
introduced years ago.

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:14.140
It was introduced in
2009 after a group

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:18.120
of American evangelicals,
including the pastor known

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.470
as Scott Lively,
traveled to Uganda

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:25.490
and said it's not enough to
think homosexuality is a sin.

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:30.260
You have to criminalize those
that agitate for LGBT rights.

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:33.690
And so Ugandan activists
made public the role

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:37.280
of American
evangelical strategies

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:39.940
and money and
power and influence

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:44.370
in the introduction
of this bill into law.

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:47.353
And they called out these
tools used by Americans.

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:53.400
And they said,
actually, not only

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:57.650
is this most recent
version of foreign import,

00:25:57.650 --> 00:26:02.160
but the original sodomy law is
also a British colonial legacy.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:07.745
And what is Ugandan is tolerance
and community and compassion.

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:14.260
And to prove it, they even built
a coalition of human rights

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:18.490
organizations that now includes
approximately 35 organizations

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:20.960
of all political
stripes, including

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:23.630
academic institutions,
organizations working

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:27.560
for women's rights, for refugee
rights, for HIV and AIDS,

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:31.340
and even for the rule of law.

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.030
And so what I want
to argue to you

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:36.250
is that, yes, we're seeing
very severe and very dangerous

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:39.130
setbacks around the
world for LGBT rights.

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:42.490
But these setbacks
have in many instances

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:45.990
come as a result of people
asserting their rights.

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:50.330
So this is a backlash
against progress.

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:55.300
And what gives me hope is that
LGBT communities are actually

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:58.010
building coalitions with
mainstream human rights

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:00.745
organizations and
building alliances

00:27:00.745 --> 00:27:02.700
that make social
change possible,

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:06.240
not just the legal kinds, but
the part where society actually

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:06.740
changes.

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:12.980
So I want to kind of
move into the summary

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:15.522
by talking about what
global solidarity is useful

00:27:15.522 --> 00:27:16.730
and what's counterproductive.

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:23.860
I want to underscore that
while I am an optimist and so I

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:27.900
believe these setbacks
are temporary,

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:31.590
it does not make the dangers
faced by LGBT people,

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:34.750
people perceived as LGBT,
and people doing human rights

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:37.060
work in these countries
and other countries

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:38.870
around the world
any less vulnerable.

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:46.500
Make no mistake, it
is life threateningly

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:51.660
dangerous to be LGBT, to
engage in LGBT practices,

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:56.190
to talk about the right to human
sexuality or bodily autonomy,

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:58.890
or to speak out for human
rights in many countries

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:00.990
around the world today.

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:03.690
And so I think it is the
responsibility of those of us

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:07.190
who are not on the front
lines to be scrupulously

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:11.070
careful with how we
enact our solidarity.

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:14.190
And I'm going to give you four
examples of what not to do

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:19.820
and one extremely easy, very
specific, and utterly vital

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:23.530
example of what to do.

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:26.085
So first, the first don't.

00:28:26.085 --> 00:28:28.450
Don't essentialize.

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:30.990
Don't think that all
Russians, Indians, or Ugandans

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:33.110
are homophobic or transphobic.

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:36.380
Perhaps this is obvious,
but you would be surprised

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:39.830
what you read in the
comments pages under articles

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:42.790
and what people have said to me.

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:45.120
Don't think that all people
in eastern Europe, south

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.850
Asia, or east
Africa are, either.

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:51.390
You know about these
laws because LGBT people,

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:54.160
their families, their friends,
their religious leaders,

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:57.130
their human rights colleagues
are standing alongside of them

00:28:57.130 --> 00:29:02.544
and made these examples
international news.

00:29:02.544 --> 00:29:03.960
And there is always
the difference

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:07.720
between a government
and its people.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:10.470
The second thing I would
not recommend that you do

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:12.710
is play Noah's ark.

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:15.340
Don't fantasize about it either.

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:18.980
Don't think that all Russians,
Indians, or Ugandans want

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:22.200
to leave their country and/or
come to the United States.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:25.280
Some do, and we
have an obligation

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:29.320
to make it easy for those people
who need asylum and refugee

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:33.230
status to get the services
and support that they need.

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:35.380
This should be obvious.

00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:39.300
But it should also be
obvious that not all LGBT

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:41.560
people can ever leave home.

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:44.740
And there is no such
thing as an LGBT country.

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:48.522
So we have to invest our
efforts, our solidarity,

00:29:48.522 --> 00:29:49.980
in making sure that
people can live

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:54.270
in their homes with
their families safely.

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:56.020
The third thing
is very important.

00:29:56.020 --> 00:30:00.470
I know that Google employees
have a history of philanthropy.

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:04.480
So the third don't is
don't donate foolishly.

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.750
I'm speaking to you
seriously about this.

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:10.870
Don't donate money without
knowing where it's going.

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:13.410
There is currently a
website circulating--

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:16.460
I am intentionally not
naming this website--

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:20.570
but it claims to be fundraising
to get all LGBT people out

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:23.100
of their countries
in harm's way.

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:25.290
Please don't be naive.

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:29.390
The savior complex
does no one any good.

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:34.110
And the fourth and final point
that I would say is a don't is

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:37.390
don't think that cutting all
foreign assistance to countries

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:40.560
with sodomy laws or
countries that have a track

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:44.690
record of punishing and
targeting LGBT people

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:46.300
is a good thing.

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:48.430
If LGBTI people
become the reason

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:51.380
that foreign aid is
cut to a country,

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:54.260
there will be retaliation
against the same people

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:55.940
that you want to help.

00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:58.810
And different movements have
different strategies about what

00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:01.500
foreign assistance can
be cut and what cannot.

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:05.890
Some would say you
can cut components

00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:08.190
of foreign assistance
going to governments.

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:10.220
Some would say you
can only cut that

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:12.800
which is designed to
go to the armed forces.

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:15.410
But you can't cut
programs that are designed

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:19.260
to support clean drinking water,
microenterprise, education,

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:23.140
maternal health, et cetera.

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:26.000
The language around
this is very important.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.590
So if you find yourself with
access to people in authority,

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:31.540
don't ask them to cut aid.

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:33.960
Ask them to redirect aid.

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:36.960
Redirect aid away from those
that have supported, endorsed,

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:41.050
and campaigned for
laws that would incite

00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:43.420
and institutionalize violence.

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:45.360
Ask them to invest
in communities

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.870
that want peaceful solutions
and social harmony.

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:52.970
And from there, I'll
conclude with the example

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:55.820
of the one and only thing
that you really should do.

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:58.170
It's the one thing to remember.

00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:03.140
And it's just listen to local
LGBT activists and communities.

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:06.480
They are the experts
of their own situation,

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:10.500
as we are all the
experts of our own lives.

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:15.880
I think with that, I will
conclude and say thank you.

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:25.244
AUDIENCE: This is just
outrageous and awful

00:32:25.244 --> 00:32:26.660
and we need to do
things about it.

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:30.884
And thank you for stepping up
and coming and talking to us.

00:32:30.884 --> 00:32:32.300
I'm just trying
to think of things

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:36.310
that we can do with you
because we have different skill

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:37.970
sets that we bring.

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:41.580
So I don't know exactly where to
take that but kind of an offer

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:42.930
to brainstorm about that.

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:47.630
And things don't just happen.

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:49.290
People do things, as we know.

00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:52.130
So I thought your point
about local activists

00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:54.740
are going to be the ones who
change their own country,

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:58.550
similarly, local oppressors
are doing the work too.

00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:00.830
And so being conscious
about who and kind

00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:03.290
of attacking at
the roots of things

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:05.370
seems like a good strategy.

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:08.420
We have an office in
Kampala, with Googlers there.

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:10.590
We have many offices,
actually, across Africa

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:11.620
and in lot of
places where there's

00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:12.870
a lot of rights work going on.

00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:15.720
So maybe some of them are
teammates, I don't know.

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:19.080
So I don't have an exact thing,
but I guess sort of an ask

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:25.350
to Googlers here and
online, wherever you are,

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:27.550
or who might watch NBC,
if they have ideas,

00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:31.190
I'm interested in figuring
out what we might do.

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:32.530
Pretty hard stuff.

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:34.180
JESSICA STERN: I think there's
a lot that Google could do.

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:36.263
And I'd probably want to
give it a little bit more

00:33:36.263 --> 00:33:40.060
thought than off the cuff
because you're powerful

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:43.080
and you should use
that power well.

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:47.130
I think ensuring that
all of your office places

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:50.060
are safe, regardless of what
country people are working

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:52.940
for you in is of
the utmost priority.

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:55.960
I think that where Google
has access to government

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:59.630
and where you have conversations
with government officials,

00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:01.780
carrying the principles
of nondiscrimination

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:05.460
is phenomenally
important and also making

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:11.120
an argument for business
and human rights.

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:14.110
When people are safe in
the workplace, when people

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:18.170
are safe as consumers,
business flourishes.

00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:20.866
And I think there's a
way that an organization

00:34:20.866 --> 00:34:23.449
like the International Gay and
Lesbian Human Rights Commission

00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:24.429
can make that.

00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:27.929
But it has a totally different
authority when it actually

00:34:27.929 --> 00:34:29.719
comes from a
company saying that.

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:36.090
Just to kind of flag,
there are huge issues

00:34:36.090 --> 00:34:40.580
around the safety and security
of LGBT people online going far

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:41.730
beyond these countries.

00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:43.960
There are instances
of internet entrapment

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:46.310
that happen all the time.

00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:50.760
And online communication,
online community building,

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:55.670
is so fundamental to LGBT
communities around the world.

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:57.410
I actually think it's
one of the reasons

00:34:57.410 --> 00:35:00.070
that we've seen so much
progress in the past five years

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:01.870
because people can
find each other.

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:03.475
And when you can
find each other,

00:35:03.475 --> 00:35:05.600
you can start doing this
movement-based work that's

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.090
so important.

00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:08.870
But then the question
is, how do you

00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:12.810
help make sure people are
consuming internet services

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:15.520
safely so that they
can find each other?

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.130
And we know of many
governments that

00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:21.940
have set up entrapment
strategies that have resulted

00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:25.540
in a range of horrors
for LGBT people.

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:28.345
I don't know what Google does
around safety and security,

00:35:28.345 --> 00:35:30.720
but I think that would be
really important to talk about.

00:35:33.185 --> 00:35:34.310
AUDIENCE: Hello, I'm Ervin.

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.652
JESSICA STERN: Hi, Ervin.

00:35:34.652 --> 00:35:34.880
Nice to meet you.

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.500
AUDIENCE: I'm very
involved in this

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:39.170
as I actually have three
friends on the ground in Uganda,

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:41.340
all of whom are running
for their life right now.

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.930
You said to work
with local activists,

00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:46.420
so my first question is,
how do we identify them?

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:49.150
There's a lot of
deception out there

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:51.917
and a lot of groups
of dubious value.

00:35:51.917 --> 00:35:53.500
You said you don't
want to name names.

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.550
I'm going to ask
you to name names.

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:59.110
Who is actually effective and
useful, especially in Uganda,

00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:02.014
but other places as well?

00:36:02.014 --> 00:36:04.250
JESSICA STERN: Well,
Uganda's a great example

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:08.160
where people actually
have come together.

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:11.670
And there's something called
the Civil Society Coalition.

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:14.340
It's the group that I was
talking about earlier.

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:16.360
It has been an
incredibly useful place

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:21.062
to turn to for strategies
about navigating the new law.

00:36:21.062 --> 00:36:23.270
It's actually the work of
the Civil Society Coalition

00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:26.340
of Uganda that's spearheading
a legal challenge to the law

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:30.040
that they're filing
tomorrow if all goes well.

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.900
And I would be more
than happy to put you

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:34.480
in touch with the Safety
and Security Committee

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.210
of the Civil Society Coalition.

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:39.920
There's also a number of really
extraordinary organizations

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:42.500
working for LGBT
rights in Uganda, too.

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.501
Just to give a brief
shout out-- and if people

00:36:44.501 --> 00:36:46.500
are watching online, there
are many more of you.

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:50.110
But SMUG, Sexual
Minorities of Uganda,

00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:53.220
is a coalition of many
LGBT organizations.

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:55.710
And FARUG, Freedom
and Roam Uganda,

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:58.980
focuses on lesbians and
trans* people in Uganda.

00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:01.430
And I'd be happy to talk
with you more later.

00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:02.840
So you can Google them.

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.940
And The Civil Society
Coalition of Uganda

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:09.860
is trying to get actually a very
sophisticated 20-point strategy

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:12.720
for standing in solidarity with
people in Uganda right now,

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:15.010
out far and wide.

00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:20.800
And it is currently
available in a Google Drive,

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:23.950
actually, that you can access
through the IGLHRC website

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:27.080
if you go to the
Uganda country page.

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:32.647
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about foreign aid, right.

00:37:32.647 --> 00:37:34.730
You made a point-- and I
think it was a good one--

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:40.180
that countries sort of offering
foreign aid to countries

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:42.697
like Uganda have to be
careful about whether

00:37:42.697 --> 00:37:50.150
or not to sort of cut
off giving foreign aid.

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:53.580
But there are also churches.

00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:55.860
There are churches that
give their own private aid.

00:37:55.860 --> 00:38:01.460
To what extent do you
think, I don't know,

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:03.510
American evangelicals,
for example,

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:06.880
are providing aid to
countries like Uganda?

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:13.680
And do you think that that had
any influence on the Ugandan

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:15.640
president's decision to
sign this law, right?

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:18.640
I mean, perhaps
he doesn't really

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:21.700
worry about not receiving
US government aid because he

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:24.740
can get aid from
private churches.

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:27.320
JESSICA STERN: It's very
hard to track money.

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:29.090
So there have been
scholars and activists

00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:30.840
who've been trying to
track the money that

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:35.150
has flown from right-wing
American evangelical churches

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:36.860
into Uganda.

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:41.160
And some have been more
successful than others.

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:45.110
I would direct you to the work
of the Rev. Dr. Kapya Kaoma

00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:47.250
as one person who's
done work on this.

00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:49.000
And another person
is Jeff Sharlet.

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:58.000
I think American evangelicals
have exported a range of tools

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.490
to countries like Uganda.

00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:02.100
We see Scott Lively popping
up in eastern Europe.

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:06.250
It's not only Russia that has
these anti-gay propaganda laws.

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:09.450
But there were
similar initiatives

00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:12.210
introduced in the parliaments
of Lithuania, Moldova,

00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:14.620
among others.

00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:16.530
And some of this has
to do with money,

00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:19.430
but it also has to do
with access to power,

00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:21.730
access to American
politicians, access

00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:30.510
to American companies and
less tangible enticements.

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:34.400
In the question that
Wendy posed about

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:38.560
whether American evangelicals
influenced President Museveni's

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.800
decision to sign
the bill into law,

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:47.899
I think that President
Museveni-- all of these

00:39:47.899 --> 00:39:48.690
are hard questions.

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:52.980
I think President Museveni has
mounted a defensive strategy,

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:55.610
if you will,
claiming nationalism

00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:57.890
as a reason for signing
this bill into law.

00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:59.910
And that's very dangerous
because nationalism

00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:02.410
isn't actually
about Ugandans when

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:04.290
the bill he signed
into law violates

00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:07.340
Uganda's own constitution.

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:10.080
Uganda recently discovered
really deep and rich oil

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:12.290
reserves, and they're
scheduled to begin production

00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:15.510
in either 2015 or 2018.

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:17.720
So there is some feeling
that perhaps Uganda

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:19.780
will be less dependent
on foreign assistance

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:20.930
than in the past.

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:23.340
There's also some
feeling that there's

00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:27.000
another geopolitical
axis through which Uganda

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.090
and other countries
like it can receive

00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:31.350
foreign assistance,
those that are supporting

00:40:31.350 --> 00:40:34.110
the criminalization
of homosexual acts.

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:37.242
So I hope that
answers your question.

00:40:37.242 --> 00:40:38.450
AUDIENCE: I will ask another.

00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:41.370
I've seen different
sources for the actual text

00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:44.350
of the final bill
that was passed.

00:40:44.350 --> 00:40:46.650
It would be nice to know what
the authority version is.

00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:48.840
And I'm not sure
I'm accessing it.

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.034
But as I understand it, the--

00:40:51.034 --> 00:40:52.700
JESSICA STERN: Sorry,
is this in Uganda?

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:53.908
AUDIENCE: Yes, Uganda, sorry.

00:40:53.908 --> 00:40:55.312
I know, I'm focused there.

00:40:55.312 --> 00:40:56.270
JESSICA STERN: It's OK.

00:40:56.270 --> 00:41:00.070
AUDIENCE: The bare text of it
criminalizes conduct and not

00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:02.140
status.

00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:05.030
So the question is, do
we believe it matters?

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:07.170
Meaning, is there enough
rule of law left there?

00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:10.960
Now, of course there's rampant
vigilantism which is grievous.

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:14.510
But insofar as people
actually arrested and accused,

00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:17.020
do we even believe there's
any rule of law left that they

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:20.720
would bother to prove actual
behavior as opposed to status

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:21.875
or not care?

00:41:21.875 --> 00:41:23.490
Does that makes sense?

00:41:23.490 --> 00:41:25.300
JESSICA STERN: Yeah, it does.

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:29.630
Yes, the rule of law exists,
but so does mob justice.

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:31.750
Both things are true.

00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:34.020
I do want to say
that there's reason

00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:37.920
to have hopes from
the Ugandan courts.

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:43.880
In 2010, a tabloid that
existed at the time

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:47.900
did publish the names,
photos, and home addresses

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:51.260
of a number of LGBT
activists, putting them

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:52.880
in direct harm's way.

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:57.530
One of those individuals who
was targeted in the paper

00:41:57.530 --> 00:42:02.070
was David Kato, an activist who
may be familiar to some of you

00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:05.050
because he was
subsequently murdered.

00:42:05.050 --> 00:42:08.980
And the high court
of Kampala actually

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:13.730
heard a case on this
particular issue.

00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:16.290
And it was the case
of Kasha Jacqueline

00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:18.020
versus "Rolling Stone."

00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:21.540
And I'm happy to report that
the Ugandan court actually

00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:24.880
ruled in the activist and
LGBT community's favor

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:27.770
in a really excellent
decision that recognizes

00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:30.440
the right to privacy,
among other things.

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:33.540
So I think there is
hope through the courts.

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:35.720
And you have to believe
in the role of law

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:38.910
and work for it because
that's what we have.

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:41.740
AUDIENCE: It seems that both
the Russian and the Ugandan law

00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:44.889
criminalizes support of
LGBT right rights as well.

00:42:44.889 --> 00:42:45.680
JESSICA STERN: Yes.

00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:48.310
AUDIENCE: So how does
that stifle organizations

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:50.710
that try to argue
this in the court?

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:52.210
Are they still able to do that?

00:42:54.464 --> 00:42:55.880
JESSICA STERN:
[INAUDIBLE], you're

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:58.000
asking an excellent question.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.031
How do you say that a
law is unconstitutional

00:43:01.031 --> 00:43:03.030
when it's against the law
to say that the law is

00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:04.900
unconstitutional?

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:08.960
I mean, that's
basically what this is.

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:11.350
I think that the laws
that have recently

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:15.460
been introduced and passed
into law in Uganda and Nigeria

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:19.580
have very little to do with
criminalizing homosexuality

00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:22.730
again because homosexuality
was already against the law

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:24.900
under the penal code.

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:28.630
I think it's really
an attack on activism.

00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:33.520
And I don't think there's any
easy answer to your question.

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:36.840
And I would just underscore
that groups doing work

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:38.760
around LGBT rights
in these countries

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:42.820
are wondering how they
can continue to exist.

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:45.300
They are literally fighting
for their own survival.

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:47.646
And they're fighting
courageously and strategically.

00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:52.590
But put yourself
in their situation.

00:43:52.590 --> 00:43:55.731
Everywhere I look around
here, I see the word "Google"

00:43:55.731 --> 00:43:56.980
because that's where you work.

00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:59.080
So your office is branded.

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:02.040
Now what if "Google" meant LGBT?

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:03.910
Everything about this
space would suddenly

00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:05.740
become a liability.

00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:07.999
So I think these are
very difficult questions,

00:44:07.999 --> 00:44:10.040
and we just have to keep
monitoring the situation

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:13.960
and hope that the
laws are thrown out.

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:15.960
ELLEN SPERTUS: Thank you
for coming, all of you,

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:17.010
but especially Jessica.

00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:22.688
JESSICA STERN: Thank you guys.
