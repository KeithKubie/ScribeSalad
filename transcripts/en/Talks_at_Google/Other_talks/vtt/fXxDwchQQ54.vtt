00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.990
FEMALE SPEAKER: So thank you all
for coming to this talk.

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.720
As you know, we're going to
have D-Rev here today.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.760
And D-Rev is a San Francisco
based design company that

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.490
focuses on designing, building,
and selling products

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.460
for people living on
less than $4 a day.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.160
Their latest product is the
ReMotion Knee, which is a

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.260
prosthetic knee that compares
and performs just as well as

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.590
comparable knees but
is 1/5 the price.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.170
So we're going to have D-Rev's
CEO, Krista Donaldson, speak

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.600
about this product as well
as the PM, Vin Narayan.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.630
And they're going to have
a short presentation.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.010
Afterward, it will be
open for questions.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.510
So start thinking of what
you want to ask them.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.670
KRISTA DONALDSON: Thanks,
[INAUDIBLE].

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.140
OK so I'm going to get
a little bit started.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.110
So just to give you a little
bit of an overview, what I

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.880
thought I would do is tell
you a little bit about my

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.740
background, and a little bit
about D-Rev, and then about

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.190
the knee, the ReMotion Knee,
which is a prosthetic knee for

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.420
above knee amputees.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.250
And so you'll see some pictures
with people who've

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.550
lost their leg above
their knee.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.860
And then I thought I would share
a few lessons learned

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.620
that we've had along the way.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.100
And yeah, and I would
love questions.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.280
So definitely let me know.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.120
And then to introduce my
colleague here, this is Vin.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.870
And he also-- detailed questions
throw at him.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.610
It's good for him.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.970
OK, does anyone know what the
product is in this picture?

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.970
AUDIENCE: Tooling.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:24.630
KRISTA DONALDSON: Tooling.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.950
There is tooling there.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.380
But that's not what
I'm getting at.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.840
I'll give you a hint.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.510
It's mild steel.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.760
And it's Kenya.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.480
I won't make you suffer too
long, but I'm going to make

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.240
you suffer a little bit.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.408
AUDIENCE: A pump.

00:01:35.408 --> 00:01:35.520
Water pump.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.870
KRISTA DONALDSON: Yes,
a water pump.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.800
So what this is-- what you're
looking at is the Super

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.500
MoneyMaker.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.990
And this is actually--

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.820
there are several Super
MoneyMaker pumps.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.010
And I know the name sounds
a bit funny by Western

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.450
standards, but it was meaningful
to Kenyan farmers.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.130
But what this is is
a treadle pump.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.560
And this one actually works
by tilting your body

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.570
weight back and forth.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.280
And it enabled farmers,
small holder farmers--

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.680
like two hectares or less-- to
be able to irrigate their

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.860
farms, whereas before, they had
been dependent on rain and

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.840
just pulling water
out of the river.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.729
I'm showing you this picture,
though, because I worked here

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.169
for four years.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.920
And one of the things I learned
is that what you're

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.680
seeing here is some of my
colleagues doing inspections

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.590
on the manufacturing.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.840
And it was really boring work.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.210
And later on KickStart,
the organization--

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.870
they were called [INAUDIBLE] at
the time, decided to move

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.070
manufacturing over to
China or most of it.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.990
So keep this in mind.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.020
And I'm going to fold
that back in later.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.240
So here is actually a
picture of the main

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.620
Super MoneyMaker pump.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.080
And it works like a stair
stepper machine, pulls water

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.670
out of the ground, and pushes it
like another eight meters.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.300
And this picture is actually
from Mali.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.180
My job when I was there
was manufacturing.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.200
And so that's why I was worried
about things like are

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.680
people getting bored doing
inspections, because one of

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.820
the key things I learned is that
it's not just about how

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.080
well you design the product but
how well the product gets

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.800
made and how consistently
good the product is

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.560
continued to be made.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.230
And this is an artisan at one
of our manufacturers called

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.146
Kenya Vehicle Manufacturers.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:07.930
After I worked in Kenya
for a little

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.270
while, I worked in Iraq.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.780
And I was like the super peon
at the State Department.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.500
And what my job was was
basically to put out fires,

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.180
literally, between like a lot
of the contractors and the

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.440
policymakers.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.340
And for those of you who
followed reconstruction in

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.990
Iraq, you may have noticed
that what a lot of the

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.780
policymakers were saying from a
technical standpoint didn't

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.100
really make sense.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.840
And my portfolio was
electricity.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.540
And so here you see I'm actually
standing in front of

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.915
a power plant in Dora, which
is just south of Baghdad.

00:03:36.915 --> 00:03:40.770
The big lesson learned there
is the US government only

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.420
really thought about trying
to get the power up.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.710
Remember how I said that the
policymakers were focused on

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:47.940
these things that didn't
make sense?

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.740
Well, one of them was how many
megawatts can we produce?

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.770
I think any of us who remember
high school physics know it's

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:53.745
actually not about megawatts.

00:03:53.745 --> 00:03:56.370
It's about megawatt hours.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.220
And what it really is about is
if an Iraqi, at the end of the

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.880
day, can flip a switch
on the wall, and

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:01.990
their power comes on.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.390
Right?

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.540
The numbers are kind
of meaningless.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.870
But the US government didn't
think about, for example,

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.160
where the fuel was going
to come from to

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.020
run these power plants.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.040
They were very busy rebuilding
these power plants.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.940
They didn't think about where
the power was going to go from

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.610
the power plants in the
transmission lines, which I

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:18.860
have another picture for you.

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.720
This is a transmission line
between Baghdad and Dora.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.110
And it's very easy to
bring one down.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.070
This is one of the super
highways of power.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.920
There are only four going
in and out of Baghdad.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.010
And you can strap an explosive
to the leg--

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.330
it's sad that I know this--
and you can bring

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.490
it down very quickly.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.490
And this would happen during
election season.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.255
So kind of the lesson learned
for me at least was you can't

00:04:40.255 --> 00:04:41.760
just think about the thing,
the power plant.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.280
You can't just think
about the tower.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.790
You have to think about
how the whole

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.410
system works together.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.300
So that leads a little
bit into D-Rev, the

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.860
organization I lead now.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.800
And D-Rev is short for
Design Revolution.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.640
And we are a nonprofit.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.790
And our mission is to
empower poor people.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.400
And when we talk about poor
people, what we really mean is

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.300
people living on less than $4
a day, but really about them

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.430
empowering themselves.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.670
So getting away from the more
traditional foreign aid model,

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.900
which is giving, and high cost,
and not necessarily

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.780
higher return in terms of social
impact, but really

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.270
looking to where do people
want to empower their own

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.700
lives and supporting that.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.520
We focus on two areas.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.760
One of them is improving health
and improving income.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.520
And they're not opposite ends.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.170
Some of the products we work
on, like the knee, are

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.220
actually both.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.430
If you can improve someone's
mobility, you're actually

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.680
improving their income.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.920
We also focus on products
that scale.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.400
So one of our founders, Paul
Polak, talks about products

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.700
that at least reach a million.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.740
And sometimes he says
10 million.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.900
It really depends on his mood.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.280
But what I say is it's about
a lot of people.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.020
We're working on problems that
aren't necessarily at the

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.740
village level.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.600
We're working on problems
that ideally are

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.770
at the global level.

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.240
Three things to know about us.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.150
One is that we design products
that are world class.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.060
And if you know a little bit
about technology in the

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.670
so-called developing world,
you know that there's this

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.100
history of appropriate
technology, which is kind of

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:13.170
like these rudimentary, low
cost, local materials products

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:15.120
that were supposed
to help people.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.240
What we're saying is no, we're
designing world class

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.750
products, products that if
you're a parent, you would use

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:20.740
here with your children.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.990
We don't believe that just
because you're poor, you

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.120
deserve products that are
any less quality.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.110
So when we say world class, we
mean products that perform on

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.060
par or better than the best
products on the market.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:35.160
And this picture is actually
from east Delhi.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.230
The picture's me getting some
user feedback on one of our

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:42.300
prototypes with some
doctors there.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.895
The second thing to know
about us is that

00:06:43.895 --> 00:06:44.800
we're market driven.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.360
And what that means is that we
leverage the private sector to

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.750
manufacture, distribute,
and sell our products.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.510
And so, again, kind of in
contrast to the traditional

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:59.080
foreign aid where things are
donated or someone has to buy

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.760
stuff and donate it, if you
think about vaccines, for

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.730
example, that's never going
to be market driven.

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.910
It doesn't mean that it's not
important, but it's not going

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:07.570
to be economically
sustainable.

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.460
We feel very strongly that
the products we work

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.610
on are market driven.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.680
And the reason is that it
holds us accountable.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.720
If you don't design a good
product, people aren't

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.250
going to buy it.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.670
But if you don't design a good
product and you donate it, you

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:20.720
kind of don't care.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.820
But what we really care about
is social impact.

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.130
And we want people to buy it.

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.810
And that way, it's economically
sustainable.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.580
The key thing though, of course,
is if you're going to

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.920
design something that's market
driven, it does have to be

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.410
affordable.

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:35.720
Next thing-- and this
is a picture of Vin.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.050
Let me just go back
for sec, too.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.400
One of the reasons I like
these pictures is on the

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.750
left-hand side, this is, I
think, how we often think of

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.510
markets in the developing
world.

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:44.560
But this is also a market.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.040
This is a medical device fair
in Dehli, our colleague,

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.290
[INAUDIBLE], here on the side.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.880
The third thing about us is
that we're user-obsessed.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.870
I know we all talk about
user-centric design.

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:57.630
We try and take it
a step further.

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:59.670
It's not just about the users,
or the stakeholders, and

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:01.350
everyone in that
customer chain.

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:02.960
It's about what's the context?

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.200
How much power is there?

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.450
Are there voltage surges?

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:06.570
What's the temperature?

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:07.620
What does the market
look like?

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.110
What's the landscape
of other products?

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:11.020
How are people meeting
the need now?

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.590
And if they're not meeting
the need, why not?

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:16.390
So the picture here of my
colleague, Vin, in Ecuador

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:20.640
talking to one of our amputees
who's wearing our version two

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.870
of the knee.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:24.460
So what do we do?

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.210
So D-Rev is based in
San Francisco.

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:28.100
We like to say that we have
one foot here in Silicon

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.850
Valley and one foot in
the places we work.

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:33.360
If you think about the
design process--

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.900
I know for those of you who
develop products, this is a

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.090
total oversimplification.

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:40.390
And we agree, but identify
is the problem.

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:42.039
Identifying what the problem
is, understanding the

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:44.390
landscape, what's the market
look like, what do the supply

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:46.950
channels look like, how are
things being met now, what are

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:48.080
the challenges?

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.930
Design is what we kind of
think about design.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:54.320
Conceptual design, iterating,
prototyping, moving down the

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.970
way to design for
manufacturability and getting

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.930
ready for a market-ready
product.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:01.370
And then delivery for things
that we work on, which is

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:04.380
hardware, is the manufacturing,
the

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:07.600
distribution, getting it
from the manufacturing

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.360
door to the end user.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.530
So marketing could
be in there.

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.980
If it's medical devices, what
else might be in there?

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.110
I am going to pepper you
guys with questions

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:16.830
every once in a while.

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:20.730
Does anyone know with
medical devices?

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:23.200
What else do you need to worry
about besides just like-- if I

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.890
want to put a medical device
out there, can I

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:25.835
just go sell it?

00:09:25.835 --> 00:09:26.120
AUDIENCE: No.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.500
You need certification.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.700
KRISTA DONALDSON: Yes.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.230
In most places, you do, turns
out not all of them.

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:32.200
But this is something
we worry about.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.700
And, of course, if we're going
to say we're going to develop

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.310
a world class product, we want
to have external validation.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:39.070
It's not good enough,
particularly as a

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:40.985
Western-based organization, to
come in and be like, we've

00:09:40.985 --> 00:09:41.890
designed this great product.

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:44.010
How many times have people
heard that before, right?

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.810
So we look for external
validation like regulatory

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:50.090
approval or American Academy
of Pediatrics standards.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.030
So that would go in here, too.

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:54.330
And then scaling is I had
mentioned how we're really

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.740
looking for problems that
are at a large scale.

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:58.510
So just because something
works in India doesn't

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:01.510
necessarily mean it's going to
work in sub-Saharan Africa, or

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:04.000
Kenya, or East Africa, or even
smaller markets-- and trying

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.880
to understand that, and what's
our strategy, moving into

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.640
where there's an existing
real need.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.550
And then, because we're a
nonprofit, we want to measure

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:12.210
the impact.

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:14.050
And I'm very passionate about
this measuring, because I feel

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:15.780
like you don't really understand
if you're reaching

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:19.080
your goals if you don't
measure it, right?

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:23.280
So I mentioned we're
a nonprofit.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.170
We say we like to act
like a for profit.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:26.950
And this has been really
interesting for me as D-Rev

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:29.550
has been growing a little bit
because people kind of stumble

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:30.330
on the nonprofit.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.070
And they think about it like,
oh, you're the charity model.

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:34.700
But no, because we take this
market driven approach, we're

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.560
actually a lot like
a for profit.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.520
And it was kind of cool when
one of our first products

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.130
launched, people who were buying
it didn't even know

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:43.790
that a nonprofit was behind
the product, which to us,

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:44.570
that's great.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.695
Because we want them to be
buying the product based on

00:10:46.695 --> 00:10:51.250
its quality and the value that
it's offering people.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:54.520
So to give you an idea of how
our funding model works for

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:59.030
something like this, we raise
grants for R&amp;D type money or

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:01.300
for R&amp;D type work
in our design.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.360
And then, as I mentioned, we
leverage the private sector.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.400
So for example, we will license
the design to a

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.640
partner who will then
manufacture, sell it, and

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.800
distribute it.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.100
So we get income from
our products.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.990
Not very much because at
the end of the day,

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:15.170
our currency is impact.

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:17.080
It's not financial return.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.430
We believe that our partners
should have

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:19.560
some skin in the game.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.270
And just like we want to sell
our products to end users, we

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:25.300
think that we should also sell
our product to partners.

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.450
So we have a little bit of
income that comes in that

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:29.760
we'll move around depending
on who our target is.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.970
So for example, if we want
to sell to public rural

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:34.180
hospitals, we might say to our
partner we'll take less

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:37.020
royalties if you sell
more to those types

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.500
of clinics and hospitals.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.880
But we do raise a little bit
of grant money to do this

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:42.690
impact assessment.

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:44.340
I would say, particularly now,
because we're a little bit of

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.910
a young organization, we're
learning how to do impact

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:47.450
assessment.

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:50.460
And we don't see a lot of
examples of people doing

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.610
really great impact assessment
for these types of products.

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:55.620
So we're going through
a bit of a learning

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:58.440
cycle on our own.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.050
OK, so I'm going to start
telling you a little

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:01.110
bit about the knee.

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:05.220
These are three gentleman at
the Jaipur Clinic in India.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:09.420
And if you're from a place
where you don't have much

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:12.250
money, and you don't have access
to a lot of resources,

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:14.290
and you suffer an amputation,
there aren't a lot

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:15.720
of options for you.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.980
And you can see here,
all three of

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:19.320
them have bamboo staffs.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.150
And that's typical.

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:22.840
People actually won't usually
have a prosthesis at all when

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:23.900
they come into the clinic.

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:28.400
And so they'll be dependent
on this kind of staff.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:32.010
So just kind of going through a
very quick overview of what

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:35.670
the options could be, this is
a microcontroller knee.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:36.170
It's called the C-Leg.

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:38.920
And I actually just saw a
gentleman with this last week.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.000
And the minimum you're going to
pay for something like this

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.290
is $20,000.

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:44.850
The gentleman I talked to
paid $65,000, I heard.

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:46.916
He and his insurance company
paid for it,

00:12:46.916 --> 00:12:48.450
which is way too much.

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:51.370
But this is something like, for
example, US vets coming

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:54.780
back from Iraq or Afghanistan
may be fit with.

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:57.340
It's a smart device.

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:58.670
This is a polycentric knee.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:00.520
And what that just means is
a four bar mechanism--

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.100
I'm going to talk about that
again in a minute-- that more

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.230
mimics the natural
walking motion.

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:07.190
The minimum you're going to pay
for something like this is

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:08.490
about $1,400.

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:11.750
So a device that doesn't have
pneumatics, like some fancy

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:17.300
stuff in there, can go $1,400
maybe up to $6,000 or $7,000.

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:18.130
And then this--

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.690
and I brought some props.

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:21.120
Thanks, Vin.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.130
This is an international
Red Cross knee.

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:27.230
And it's single axis So you can
see it rotates around the

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:29.310
access like a door hinge.

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.780
And this is designed for poor
people, essentially.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.920
And I think, in some ways, this
kind of typifies what you

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.570
saw with appropriate technology,
like lower quality

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:39.210
for people who don't
have much.

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.730
And what we know is that
in many cases, we hear

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:43.740
anecdotally from prosthetists
we work with, is that people

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.450
were in the locked position--

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:48.140
so kind of like a peg leg.

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:50.110
And I'll pass this around if
you want to play with it.

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:55.400
AUDIENCE: Does it have
cushioning at all?

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.650
KRISTA DONALDSON: So that would
be attached to a socket.

00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:59.050
Yeah, and actually why
don't I just show you

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:00.882
the leg system now?

00:14:00.882 --> 00:14:02.750
AUDIENCE: You don't have
the $20,000 one?

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:03.340
KRISTA DONALDSON: I don't.

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:04.820
Sorry.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.980
And if I did, I don't know
if I'd pass it around.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.646
OK, so don't look at the knee
because you want that to be a

00:14:08.646 --> 00:14:09.600
surprise later.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.420
But you have a socket.

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:12.340
And then you have an attachment

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:14.490
that goes to a knee.

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:17.680
And then you have a pylon
that goes to a foot.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.320
And this is actually at Jaipur
leg system if you were to go

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.575
to the Jaipur Clinic in India
and be fit with something.

00:14:23.575 --> 00:14:25.530
AUDIENCE: That's the
[INAUDIBLE], right?

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:26.835
KRISTA DONALDSON: Yes, this
is-- yes, but I don't

00:14:26.835 --> 00:14:27.396
want to ruin it.

00:14:27.396 --> 00:14:28.830
It's a surprise.

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:31.940
So I'll pass it around,
though.

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:33.280
I won't make you suffer again.

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:37.190
OK, and I want to--

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:40.480
I'm showing you a video
of a man in India.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.730
And he's wearing a single axis
knee similar to-- we actually

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:44.980
have a single axis knee here.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.640
There are hinges on both
sides of his knee.

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:55.050
But it's essentially
a single axis.

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:57.170
And I like this video because
when we think about

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:59.380
prosthetics-- and the medical
device industry thinks about

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.450
prosthetics, they're thinking
about here.

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:04.350
They're thinking about generally
flat surfaces, even

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:05.790
stairs, not a lot of dust.

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:08.710
And that's not the reality
of much of the world.

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:11.460
So I'm going to pass
this around.

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:14.060
And in this video you may have
noticed, too, that even though

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:17.360
he has the ability to flex his
knee with a single axis, he's

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.840
wearing it in a locked
position.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.300
So you can see that it's
cosmetically awkward.

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.820
It's clear he's an amputee.

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.040
And it's physically
exhausting.

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.640
And particularly with older
patients, you can just imagine

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.960
what this would be like.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.870
So the problem that the original
team that looked at

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:35.670
this is for those who suffer
above knee amputations, and

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:37.170
you live on less than
$4 a day, there are

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:40.880
just really no options.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:44.970
And what's the scale
of the need?

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:48.895
It's about 3 million amputees a
year who need a new knee or

00:15:48.895 --> 00:15:49.900
a replacement.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:51.470
And so you can see the
bulk is in Asia.

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:53.890
And we actually know that about
half a million of those

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:56.560
are in India.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.730
And this is every year.

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:00.790
The second--

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:04.220
the knee that I'm passing around
now is what we call the

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.530
version one, the JaipurKnee.

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:06.960
And this was originally
developed by a group of

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.460
students at Stanford that
Vin was later a part of.

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:11.170
Oh, sorry.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:11.690
I'm jumping ahead.

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:14.180
This is the single axis knee.

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:14.910
Back up.

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:16.590
The single axis knee that's
going around--

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:17.470
it's the little one.

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:18.780
Do you see the little one?

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:19.630
OK, hold it up.

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:20.430
Perfect.

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:21.130
OK, this is a door hinge.

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:24.310
This is what the Jaipur Foot
Organization had when they

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:26.920
approached Stanford
several years ago.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:30.520
And then a student team, which
Vin was later a part of,

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.820
developed the JaipurKnee, which
is the version one of

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:33.900
the ReMotion knee.

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.960
And you can see there's
a big difference

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.750
in the walking motion.

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:41.910
The first knee lacks stability
because as your weight shifts

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:44.660
over that axis, you're going
to lose stability.

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:45.920
And this is a polycentric
knee.

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:51.820
One of the things I like to
mention, too, is with the

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:53.900
design of the JaipurKnee,
which is now

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:55.450
the ReMotion knee--

00:16:55.450 --> 00:17:00.000
it allows a lot of behaviors
that are more normal in this

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:00.940
kind of situation.

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:02.180
A lot of people sit
cross legged.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.540
This is a young amputee named,
[? Vishen Barne ?].

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:05.119
You can't see his knee.

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:07.119
But he's fit with one
of our knees.

00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:09.849
There's a lot of kneeling for
prayer, squatting, all sorts

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:12.040
of things that a lot of
Western devices aren't

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.630
actually really well
designed for.

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:17.849
And we recognize that in
the design process.

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:20.230
So here's the version one
of the JaipurKnee.

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:21.220
Is the leg system around?

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.599
I'm going to borrow it back.

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:24.160
Can I borrow it back?

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:24.874
I'll give it back to you.

00:17:24.874 --> 00:17:26.540
Thanks.

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:28.390
So what I thought I would do
is walk you through the

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:33.345
iterations of the knee, because
now we're on the V3.

00:17:33.345 --> 00:17:37.110
But the first thing is can
anyone tell me what might be

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:39.640
wrong if you're an amputee
and you're wearing this?

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:40.980
AUDIENCE: The noise.

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:42.270
KRISTA DONALDSON:
You're clicking.

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:43.410
And no one wants to click.

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:45.920
And if you think about it, here
there's a stigma attached

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:46.680
to being disabled.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:51.140
It's that much more in many
of the places we work.

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:56.270
And we saw this with how users
modified their knees.

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:58.630
So here what you see is someone
actually put a bit of

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:02.450
cloth in there to dampen
out the noise.

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:04.280
Another thing we saw is if
you're wearing this under

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.980
pants or a skirt,
is it obvious?

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:08.630
Yeah, there's a sharp
edge here.

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:10.410
And it was designed like
this because it

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:11.590
was an early prototype.

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:14.060
It works very well
for what it does.

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:16.350
But the students hadn't
quite worked

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:17.440
through the entire process.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:21.530
And we see that, too,
with patients.

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:24.090
Wrapping things around the knee
is very common so that

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:26.270
it's not quite so obvious when
you're sitting down that

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:30.420
there's a prosthetic under
your skirt or pants.

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.475
So that led to the Q2 knee,
which I'll give back this one.

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:37.580
Thanks.

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:43.300
Thanks, Vin.

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:46.030
So a couple differences when you
pass this around you may

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:48.090
notice that there's a--

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:50.480
anyone know what
this rubber is?

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:51.520
Noise dampener.

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:54.220
This is a little loose, but I
promise it doesn't click.

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.770
So there's a noise dampener
right here.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:19:01.650
Also you may notice that the
curvature is much smoother to

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:03.810
make it not quite so obvious.

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:05.430
The other thing you may notice,
too-- actually, you

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:06.680
probably won't notice--
is the attachment.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:07.700
We changed the attachment.

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:10.450
On this one over here, we used
an attachment that was

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:11.920
specific to the Jaipur
Foot Organization.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.410
It was actually threaded.

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:17.140
And that's not ideal for
alignment and for fitting.

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:19.775
So we changed it to a more
universal adaptor, so it would

00:19:19.775 --> 00:19:21.540
be applicable to a broader
range of clinics.

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:32.360
And now we're on the version
three, which we just launched

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.220
last month.

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:36.940
And if you're holding-- most
of you haven't held the V2

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:38.420
yet, but you'll notice it's
a little bit heavier.

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:39.680
It's a little bit wider.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.990
And in fact, some of the
feedback Vin got in China was

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:45.250
like, this may be fine for you
Westerners, but it's a little

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:48.350
bit big for us, meaning
Westerners are a little bit

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:49.910
more overweight.

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:53.250
So the other thing that we were
very cognizant of too is

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:55.600
if you want to have a truly
affordable product at a high

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.130
quality, it needs to be
mass produced, right?

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:00.800
This is CNC, Computer Numerical
Control, cut out

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.440
with a mill over
and over again.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.410
Not the most affordable.

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:05.170
Not the best use of resources.

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:06.590
What is this?

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:08.300
Injection molded mostly.

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:10.200
Yeah, so you'll see when
you pass it around,

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.025
it's also much narrower.

00:20:11.025 --> 00:20:13.710
I think we calculated
26% narrower.

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:18.330
And you'll see it's
much lighter.

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:21.490
And then what we think it's
going to cost-- $80.

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:23.984
So this knee actually is going
to field trials now, which I'm

00:20:23.984 --> 00:20:25.850
going to talk a little bit
about in a minute.

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:29.640
But we are hoping for it to hit
the market early next year

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.680
at a retail price of $80.

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:34.060
So not a cost of goods or
a bill of materials

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.562
but a retail cost.

00:20:35.562 --> 00:20:36.150
AUDIENCE: And that's
just for the--

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:36.430
KRISTA DONALDSON: Sorry, no.

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:36.895
That's OK.

00:20:36.895 --> 00:20:38.290
AUDIENCE: What was
the material?

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:40.234
KRISTA DONALDSON:
Material is--

00:20:40.234 --> 00:20:41.690
VIN NARAYAN: Polycarbonate.

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:44.030
KRISTA DONALDSON:
Polycarbonate.

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:45.015
AUDIENCE: Is that just
for the knee itself?

00:20:45.015 --> 00:20:47.490
What about the extension
and the foot?

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:48.410
KRISTA DONALDSON: Yeah,
that's separate.

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:51.120
So the knee itself
would be $80.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.190
VIN NARAYAN: They're all
designed and sold modularly.

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:55.550
So usually people are buying one
component from one place,

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:56.240
another component.

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.230
And then the way that they're
connected is standardized so

00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:02.778
you can match up products from
different manufacturers.

00:21:02.778 --> 00:21:03.235
KRISTA DONALDSON: Yes?

00:21:03.235 --> 00:21:05.980
AUDIENCE: Is the knee the
same for a child?

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:07.140
KRISTA DONALDSON:
Great question.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:10.670
So I'm going to repeat the
questions for our audience

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:11.950
that's not here.

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:13.650
The question is is the
knee the same for an

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:15.160
adult versus a child?

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.250
It's based on weight.

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:19.180
So depending on how large
the child is, they

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:20.020
can wear our knee.

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:22.320
But actually, one of the things
we're interested in is

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.950
redesigning the knee at another
point for children,

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:26.720
too, or having a second knee.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.580
That's a great question.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.070
Any others before we move on?

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.520
Sure.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.534
AUDIENCE: Does the $80 cover
the marginal cost of

00:21:32.534 --> 00:21:34.202
manufacturing and
distribution?

00:21:34.202 --> 00:21:35.890
KRISTA DONALDSON: Yes.

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:40.110
Yeah and actually we're hoping
we can get it lower.

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:42.210
I think one of the critical
things in this field is people

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:43.560
get really excited
about a product.

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.400
And they put out a price based
on how much they think it's

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.870
going to cost to make it.

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:49.700
And once they figure out
distribution costs, and

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:53.380
tariffs, and fees--

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:55.390
mystery fees, and all sorts of
things getting them into

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:56.240
countries--

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.510
the price goes up a lot.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:59.820
And from my standpoint, one of
the things I really learned

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:03.080
working in Kenya, is consumer
trust is so critical.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.890
And if you put out a price that
something's going to be

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:08.980
$80, but you come back and you
say, no, actually it's going

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:13.150
to be $200, you've already
had one level of

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:14.590
trust that you've lost.

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:17.300
So we built in margins
based on the best

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.020
research we could do.

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:21.190
And then we put a little extra
in for what we don't know,

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:23.050
which we think will
be something.

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:25.870
AUDIENCE: Were there any trade
offs in terms of the product

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:29.710
lifetime, like life span in
terms of the reduction in

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:31.820
costs and whether or not that
means that they would have to

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:35.520
replace it sooner or if it's
comparable to what the

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:36.655
previous ones were?

00:22:36.655 --> 00:22:37.880
KRISTA DONALDSON: Well,
there are standards

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:38.510
that we have to meet.

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:40.180
And I'll let Vin give you
the detailed answer.

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:42.810
But essentially, there are
standards that say what the

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:46.640
lifetime of a product must be.

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.630
VIN NARAYAN: Yeah, so we hit the
exact same lifetime that

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:50.550
Western devices do.

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:53.480
In fact, I think we go a little
bit further, because to

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:56.520
hit that life that they state,
they also say you can't get it

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.606
wet, you can't use it in dirty
conditions, you have to

00:22:58.606 --> 00:23:01.010
service it every six months,
which isn't really a reality

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:02.390
for the context we're
working in.

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:04.410
And so we're designing it to
hit that same lifetime but

00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:06.940
without any of those
requirements on top.

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:09.270
KRISTA DONALDSON: One of the
things we learned is

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:12.490
obviously, like Vin said, the
testing is kind of based on

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:13.690
Western wear.

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:15.500
And one of the things we really
had to think about

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.150
during the product
specifications is well,

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:20.360
actually what is our user
going to be faced with?

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:23.640
And we know there's a huge rural
population that would be

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:24.350
using our knee.

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:25.160
They're going to be in fields.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:25.770
It's going to be wet.

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:28.440
It's going to be dusty like you
saw with the gentleman,

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.590
the rough terrain.

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:32.520
And so how do we make sure that
when we do the mechanical

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.460
testing here we account
for that?

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:37.010
Because we don't want to be
discovering that when it's on

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:38.930
our test users, right?

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:45.490
So these are all things that
we're trying to stay ahead of.

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:49.540
So this is Kamal, the young
man earlier who you saw

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:50.570
working on our knee.

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:52.710
And he actually climbed
a tree later.

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:55.740
So we love this picture
of him.

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:59.550
So I had mentioned earlier how
you have to measure to know if

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:00.490
you're hitting impact.

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:03.060
And so with all of our projects,
we're very clear

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:04.300
about what the goals are.

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:07.410
And with this project it's
to re-mobilize people,

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:09.330
re-mobilize above
knee amputees.

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:12.540
And we have usually two to three
meta indicators we use

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:14.140
with all of our projects.

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:17.060
So for the knee project we look
at number of amputees

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:18.520
fit, which is a little
bit of an output.

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:23.820
For example, just how many knees
are there being worn?

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:25.965
And then just to kind of give
you a little bit of color is

00:24:25.965 --> 00:24:28.600
that this knee is now in
12 different countries.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:33.070
We have a knee in 12 different
countries, mostly the V1 knee.

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:36.350
But I think the really
meaningful impact number is

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:37.020
compliance.

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:39.900
And compliance means is the
amputee still wearing the knee

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:44.490
six months later, because that
more tells you are you really

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:47.760
truly re-mobilizing people, with
the goal being increased

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:50.490
income, increased access,
increased

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:52.010
participation in life.

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:55.670
And our compliance rate is about
79%, which is great.

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:57.420
It's not good enough,
we don't think.

00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:00.250
But as a sense of perspective,
the ICRC knee

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:02.340
system is about 65%.

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:05.560
And we have learned
through getting

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:07.130
feedback on the product--

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:08.680
and who's got-- where's
the leg system?

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.530
VIN NARAYAN: Actually,
the version--

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:11.540
the previous JaipurKnee.

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:12.430
KRISTA DONALDSON: Oh,
the previous?

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:13.140
Sorry, OK.

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:14.160
So also single axis.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.930
So thank you.

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:18.690
Has anyone got the leg system?

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:19.540
It's right here.

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:21.460
One of the things that we've
actually found is that

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:24.640
compliance, one of the things
that hurts us, when you talk

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.990
to amputees and you say, what
would you change about it,

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.770
usually the first thing
they would say

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:30.600
is, I'm not an amputee.

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:31.340
I'm not an amputee.

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:34.540
But the second thing they would
say is the socket gives

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:35.400
a lot of problems.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:36.800
So when you see this compliance
number, it's

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.260
actually are you still wearing
your leg system.

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:41.710
What's been interesting for us
if you think back that our

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:44.370
goal is re-mobilizing people,
it's made us think about what

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:47.060
could be our potential
next projects.

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.220
So it's not just
about the knee.

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:51.930
We know that the socket has a
lot of issues, too, because

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:54.090
people's residual limb
changes over time.

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:56.650
It changes just based on
a variety of things.

00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:59.850
And blistering is
a real issue.

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:00.990
I'll give this back to you.

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:02.240
Thanks.

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:09.630
So besides the numbers, I
thought I would share a few

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:10.980
patient stories.

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:13.120
And this is a young woman
named Pernima.

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.440
And she lost her leg
in a car accident.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.670
It was actually fairly tragic.

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:19.380
And she lost her
little brother.

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:21.630
One of the things that's really
amazing about her, to

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:24.770
me, I think as a female engineer
particularly, is that

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:27.920
when she was re-mobilized with
one of our knees, she said to

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.760
us, I want to go back to school,
and I want to become

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:30.810
an engineer.

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:33.680
And I love that story, because
at the end of the day, we

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.250
don't necessarily want people
like us and people based in

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:39.460
the West working on projects
to solve the problems but

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.910
people like Pernima addressing
some of the

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:43.250
issues she sees locally.

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:47.730
This is also another
funny story.

00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:50.670
So Andreas on the left is
wearing our version two knee.

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:53.070
The version two is actually only
fit on five amputees down

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:56.260
in Ecuador because we were
testing the noise dampener and

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:58.230
things like that before moving
on to wanting to

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:00.150
injection mold it.

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:03.070
But Andreas had lost his leg
in a motorcycle accident.

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:05.300
And I'm laughing because one
of the things he was most

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:08.040
excited about being re-mobilized
was to get back

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.190
on the motorcycle.

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:14.220
So here you see him here quite
happy to have his new knee

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:17.070
with his friend.

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:19.950
So to give you a sense of where
we are now with the

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:21.520
knee, this is--

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:22.990
I had mentioned the
12 countries--

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:24.650
and hopefully these
dots add up to 12.

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:27.350
But this is where our knee is
in use right now through our

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:29.040
partnership with the
Jaipur Foot Clinic.

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.160
So they actually have a central

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.690
clinic in Jaipur, India.

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:36.330
They have 22 other clinics
around India, Delhi--

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:38.480
basically name your major city,
and they have a smaller

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.310
clinic there.

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:41.680
But they also do camps
in other places.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:44.490
And so they fit the version
one knee in all

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:48.230
of these other countries.

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:50.940
As I mentioned, we're just
starting our version three

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:51.810
field trials.

00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:54.260
And we're doing that in five
different countries.

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:57.010
As of last week, Vin just
returned from Indonesia, two

00:27:57.010 --> 00:28:00.100
clinics in Indonesia that
are trying out our

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:03.230
version three knee.

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:05.820
And here's a picture, actually,
of the first amputee

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:07.730
fit in Bali.

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:08.570
And we love his smile.

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:11.590
And actually this is our
colleague, Sam, behind him

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:12.540
checking out alignment.

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:15.970
And what we're really looking
for in these field trials is

00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:19.420
does it work essentially, do we
see an increase in income,

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:22.610
increase in quality of life, but
also are there any things

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:25.530
that we need to know before we
really scale up into mass

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:26.700
production.

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.280
Are there any feature tweaks,
or anything that

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.680
we need to be changing?

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.000
And so we have a six month study
running at each of these

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.810
sites where we're getting
feedback on

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:35.060
all of these things.

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:40.840
So one of the things I'd like
to mention too, even though

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:44.080
this project, we haven't done
a lot of PR about it--

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.385
Stanford did in the early days
with the version one, but

00:28:46.385 --> 00:28:49.990
we've gotten inquiries from all
of these different places.

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:51.320
And what's been really
interesting to me is that

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:54.730
we've also gotten inquiries
from the US, patients who

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:57.630
either don't have insurance or
people, for example, who have

00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:00.330
a very active lifestyle, often
vets, who come back.

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:02.620
And they don't want to be using
that $20,000 knee to go

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:05.550
to the beach or to
go kayaking.

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:08.420
So I think a take away for
us is that there's a need

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:12.740
globally, not just in our target
populations where they

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:16.640
live on less than $4 a day.

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.650
So I thought I would share a few
lessons learned, because I

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:19.700
don't want you to think
that we have

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:20.700
everything figured out.

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:21.740
We're far from that.

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:24.320
And just to tell you what this
is because you saw this

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:27.250
earlier, these are some of the
early sketches that went into

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:28.700
the design of the V3.

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:31.810
We feel very strongly that
people should be proud of

00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:33.070
their prosthetic.

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:35.260
And at least, it should fit
with them in their life.

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:38.430
So we worked with a volunteer
industrial designer who did

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:43.950
these renderings that led
to the V3 design.

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:47.060
So this is a picture of a
prosthetics clinic in Kenya

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:49.910
that I went to go
visit last year.

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:51.770
And actually I was there for
one of our other projects.

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:54.415
But I wanted to find out about
this clinic and how

00:29:54.415 --> 00:29:55.580
it worked in Kenya.

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:57.190
Couldn't get them to
answer the phone,

00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:58.260
which is not unusual.

00:29:58.260 --> 00:29:59.260
So we just dropped in.

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:02.830
And four skilled processes,
which is not necessarily

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:04.520
unusual, but it's pretty cool.

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:06.690
One of the big challenges we
see with getting people

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:08.970
re-mobilized is they might
have-- for example, in Haiti

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:11.350
they might have a lot of
donated technology.

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:12.200
But they don't have the skilled

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.250
processes to fit people.

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:16.840
But these processes, four
processors, were really busy

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:18.680
not doing much of anything.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:22.170
And the reason was because they
could not get all the

00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:24.090
components to that leg
system that we talked

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:28.420
about into the clinic.

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:31.160
So they were waiting on
components to come in.

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.350
And in the meantime, even though
they had amputees that

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:36.400
needed to be fit, they weren't
actually fitting people.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.760
So a lesson learned-- well
actually re-learned, because I

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.200
mentioned this came up with one
of my lessons learned in

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.880
Kenya-- is impact is more
than the product.

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.990
It's about getting the product
to people and getting the

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:48.720
product to people who need it.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.890
And going back to our model of
market driven, one of the

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:53.800
reasons why we're market driven
is because if people

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:55.400
see value in your product,
they're going to buy it.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.880
And if they see value in
your product, they're

00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:57.580
going to use it.

00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:59.290
But you have to get
it to them.

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:03.950
So another kind of reminder take
away is really truly if

00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:06.550
your focus is impact, you've got
to think much beyond the

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:08.190
product or the thing
itself and think

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:09.440
about that whole system.

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:16.560
The next thing we've
really learned is

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:17.720
good design is global.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.200
And my hope is that
the foreign aid

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.590
community has seen this.

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:22.670
Because we still get a lot of
questions of like, well, why

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:24.300
are you based in
Silicon Valley?

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:26.330
And I'm like the best products
in the world

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:27.780
take a global approach.

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:32.000
And what you're looking at here
is the design process and

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.760
effort by our various partners
and us that we've put into the

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:35.520
design process.

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:38.410
And these little lines actually
do correspond to like

00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:41.200
minute design activities.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.040
But if you look at it, Stanford
did a lot of the

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.860
early work, if you remember
the student group, and the

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:46.000
Jaipur Foot Organization.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.300
These are color coded if
you can read below.

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:51.520
And then we took over from
the student group, or

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:52.750
they merged into us.

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:56.850
But as you can see, there are
lots of different players.

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:58.470
We have Northwestern
did a little bit.

00:31:58.470 --> 00:32:00.760
We have partner clinics who
have contributed a lot.

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:03.210
We've had industry experts who
have contributed a lot.

00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:05.350
And my point with this is
it's not just about one

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.810
organization.

00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:07.450
One organization
can't do this.

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:10.560
It's about a partnership of
ideally the best organizations

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:11.560
in the space.

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:12.690
And so we have partners
in India.

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:14.010
We now have partners
in Indonesia.

00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:15.950
We have partners all
over the world.

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:18.210
Manufacturing might
be in China.

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:20.720
But bringing together what we
think is the best for the end

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.025
user for us to meet our goals.

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:30.050
OK, and then the last thing is
we think this model scales,

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:32.630
like what we're doing at D-Rev.
And I alluded to one of

00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:34.460
the other projects
were working on.

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:35.390
This is Brilliance.

00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:36.750
It's a photo therapy device.

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:38.610
It's this thing right here,
the blue light.

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:40.880
And it treats babies with
severe jaundice.

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.730
And we don't think much
about jaundice here

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:44.390
in the United States.

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:46.910
But it's actually a big problem
in many parts of the

00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:50.180
developing world, particularly
there are certain areas where

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:52.810
people have a genetic marker
that makes them more

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:53.860
susceptible to jaundice.

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:56.110
And if you don't treat jaundice,
babies can suffer

00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:57.890
brain damage from very
minor to very

00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:00.430
severe, or they can die.

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:02.130
And it's also hard to collect
data about it.

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:05.080
So the medical community is now
trying to deal with it.

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:07.270
But at the same time, there's
not a lot of good data.

00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:11.370
And we started this project,
like the knee project, when a

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:14.450
user comes to us, in
this case, and

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:15.700
says, this is a problem.

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:19.690
I'm just going to really
quickly mention

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:20.740
where we are with that.

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:23.480
So Brilliance actually hit the
market through our Indian

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:26.250
partner, Phoenix, in November.

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:29.750
And we're at impact now--

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:32.320
I mentioned that we have
these meta indicators--

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:36.060
number of babies treated-- and
this is for 105 devices that

00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:38.250
are now installed
in hospitals--

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:40.400
over 2,000 babies treated.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.230
Number two is what we call
babies otherwise.

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:45.260
And this is counting babies who
otherwise would not have

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:47.645
received effective treatment
if there had been no

00:33:47.645 --> 00:33:48.950
Brilliance.

00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:52.220
And then last is that we're able
to determine the number

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:55.020
of deaths and disabilities
averted by our product.

00:33:55.020 --> 00:34:00.510
And Brilliance retails for about
$400 compared to other

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:04.020
photo therapy devices that are
usually $3,000 and up, ones

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:07.790
that meet American Academy
of Pediatrics standards.

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:09.949
And because you're Google, I
had to put in our favorite

00:34:09.949 --> 00:34:11.980
Google Fusion map.

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:13.679
So one of the things we've been
trying to do is track

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:16.739
where the devices are and where
they've been installed.

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:20.780
And so just in the last seven
months, you can see that

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:21.770
mostly India--

00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:24.060
one of the things we're really
excited about is that a public

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:24.860
tender was filled.

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:27.719
And that's when the government
purchases devices, which we're

00:34:27.719 --> 00:34:31.360
really excited about, because
we know that those get put

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:32.320
into public hospitals.

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:35.040
And public hospitals, we know,
is where the greatest need for

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.980
these photo therapy
devices are.

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:39.429
We've seen devices get sold
into the Philippines.

00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:43.550
We've seen them get sold to
Uganda, Nigeria, and now

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:46.580
Ghana, which, for me, is really
exciting after you have

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:49.780
this long design process
from the early days to

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:52.190
commercialization.

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:54.360
So I wanted to mention a few
reasons why we're particularly

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:56.389
thankful to Google, too.

00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:59.790
The first one is that working
with Googlers and Zooglers, we

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:03.650
won the Hack for Good Hackathon
a few months ago.

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:07.690
And here you can see our team,
Nicole over here with Zooglers

00:35:07.690 --> 00:35:08.150
and Googlers.

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:10.470
So thank you.

00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:12.450
The other thing is that
we're part of a pilot

00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:13.380
that Google is doing.

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:15.510
Has anyone heard of One Today?

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:16.300
Awesome.

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:18.300
OK, so we're part of that.

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:19.910
My understanding is it's
still in beta.

00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:21.770
So look for it please and
download the app.

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:23.390
But it's a micro giving.

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:25.860
So you can give $1 or 2
to an organization.

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:29.330
And we're one of the pilot
organizations.

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:33.120
And then we also recently won a
Google alumni impact award.

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:34.760
So Google has been
very good to us.

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.200
So thank you for that.

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.210
And the last thing
what I thought I

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:39.960
would do is end with--

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:41.230
you're getting a
sneak preview.

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:42.480
Actually this is really
exciting.

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:46.300
So we had a volunteer filmmaker
who works with

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:47.960
extreme affordability
class at Stanford.

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:49.440
I don't know if you're
familiar with that.

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.080
But some of our board
members are the

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:52.300
professors for that class.

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:53.860
But he said, I'm
going to India.

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:55.890
Can I film some things
for you?

00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:58.440
And we said, we would love you
to capture a patient story.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:01.340
And so he captured the story of
Dinesh who's 12-years-old.

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:02.490
You'd asked about children.

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:06.525
And this is the Jaipur Foot
Organization in Delhi.

00:36:06.525 --> 00:36:08.230
DINESH:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:10.620
MALE SPEAKER:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:11.960
DINESH:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:21.750
KRISTA DONALDSON: So one of
the reasons why we're also

00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:25.330
really excited about this
is because I think as a

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:27.580
technology organization with a
lot of engineers, we've had a

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:30.200
hard time storytelling and
learning to story tell.

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.910
So stories like Dinesh--

00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:34.360
we work with our amputees.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:37.060
And we're out talking
to people.

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:40.250
But it's amazing to have someone
help us tell the story

00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:41.580
of the work we're doing.

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:43.650
So I get teared up every
time I see this.

00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:45.250
So don't mind me.

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:49.760
So the last thing I want
to show you is--

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:51.140
invite you actually.

00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:54.370
D-Rev a couple times a year has
what we call Open Studios.

00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:56.880
And what that is is we
just open our doors.

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:59.160
We get a lot of requests for
tours, and meetings, and

00:37:59.160 --> 00:37:59.760
things like that.

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:03.310
And we love actually having the
community come in and ask

00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:04.620
us questions if they're
interested.

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:06.960
We can show you prototypes.

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.340
You can grab a drink.

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:11.190
Anyway, the next one is
going to be July 17.

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:12.210
So we'd love to have you.

00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:15.120
If you're in San Francisco,
we're up in the Dogpatch

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:16.970
neighborhood if you're familiar
with the city.

00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:17.530
Just Google it.

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:19.930
You'll be fine.

00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:22.110
Last thing is thank you.

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:23.440
So thank you for coming today.

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:24.540
And I'd love your questions.

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:24.850
Yeah?

00:38:24.850 --> 00:38:26.540
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank you.

00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:27.696
KRISTA DONALDSON: Yeah, thanks.

00:38:27.696 --> 00:38:30.444
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:30.444 --> 00:38:31.820
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:35.135
I notice that your focus
is sustainability.

00:38:35.135 --> 00:38:36.740
KRISTA DONALDSON: Economic
sustainability.

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:40.600
AUDIENCE: Economic
sustainability, scalability,

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:47.230
and then as well as solving
a global purpose.

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:50.650
I notice that you're in
a lot of countries.

00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:52.950
What's the percentage of
the countries that are

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:55.820
donating to the cause?

00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:57.770
And then, it's a compounded
question.

00:38:57.770 --> 00:39:01.980
And then you'll also note that
the cost of getting and

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:03.440
importing the goods into
the countries can

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.810
sometimes vary, right?

00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:05.990
And that's often dealt with--

00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:07.190
KRISTA DONALDSON: And the
regulatory totally varies,

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:08.590
too, and the registration.

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:09.620
All of that varies.

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:12.530
AUDIENCE: So are there
discussions, is it possible to

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:17.320
have the countries' state
departments, sorry, instead of

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:20.520
donating necessarily funds or in
addition to donating funds,

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:24.480
relax importation requirements,
and duties, and

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:25.710
fees that way?

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:27.410
KRISTA DONALDSON: That would
be so forward thinking of

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:29.180
governments.

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:31.020
AUDIENCE: Because it's
mobilizing their economy,

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:32.050
mobilizing their--

00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:32.620
KRISTA DONALDSON: Yeah.

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:34.560
Let me tell you a
few anecdotes.

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:37.750
You're touching on like 10
really great points in the

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:38.550
things you're saying.

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:40.760
So we're actually going through
a bit of a scaling

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:43.530
strategy with Brilliance, the
photo therapy device that you

00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:45.990
saw now, and that partly--

00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:48.930
there's such high need.

00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:51.570
And we're trying to obviously
match that up with demand.

00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:53.500
And what we've learned, for
example, if you look at South

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:55.900
America, like there are some
countries that the economic

00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:58.550
conditions are just such that
there's no way a foreign

00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:01.280
entity, non-profit or not,
is going to address.

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:04.800
There's another South American
country I won't mention that

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.040
there is one of the biggest
makers of photo therapy

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.130
devices in the world.

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:11.620
And 90% of hospitals do not
have a functional photo

00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:12.580
therapy device.

00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:14.970
And that's because that company
is unwilling to bring

00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:17.830
the cost down to what
the local hospitals

00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:19.350
can afford to pay.

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:21.970
So we're going from corruption,
all the way to

00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:24.470
bureaucracy, to all
sorts of things.

00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:25.154
Yeah.

00:40:25.154 --> 00:40:27.550
AUDIENCE: So then that leads
me into my other question I

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:32.130
had, which was regarding
managing your supply base.

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:36.500
So you obviously have figured
out that you want to make an

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:39.580
inherent interest in your supply
base to bring the cost

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:42.630
down, so they can
sell more goods.

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:45.550
Do you guys manage the forward
and reverse logistics, or is

00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:47.210
that outsourced to
your supply base?

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:48.260
KRISTA DONALDSON: It depends.

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:50.470
And I want to go back to your
question, too, about are local

00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:52.230
groups donating.

00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:53.640
And Vin can talk more
about this, but

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:55.090
with prosthetics clinics--

00:40:55.090 --> 00:40:58.190
it's actually a bit-- we
sell to the clinics.

00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:59.885
And when we're doing the field
trials, one of the things I

00:40:59.885 --> 00:41:02.140
didn't mention is we have to
understand our end users.

00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:04.980
We also have to understand our
paying customer, which is the

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:06.120
clinic itself.

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:09.560
Those clinics raise money
locally usually.

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:13.980
Some clinics will charge
fees or sliding fees.

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:16.340
So we do see local
money coming in

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:18.720
to address the problem.

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:18.980
I don't know.

00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:20.710
Do you want to add more
onto that, too?

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:23.610
But then just to answer your
second question really quickly

00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:25.050
is it depends on the product.

00:41:25.050 --> 00:41:27.800
With Brilliance, we partnered
with Phoenix Medical Systems,

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:30.200
the biggest maker of neonatal
equipment in India.

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:32.530
With the knee, we're going to
manage more of that supply

00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:35.090
chain because of some of the
challenges we saw and that

00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:37.000
there aren't major players
already in the

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.100
space who can do it.

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:38.940
I'm going to hand
it over to Vin.

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:41.480
VIN NARAYAN: Yeah, I think
that's just a somewhat--

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:42.240
I don't know if it's unique.

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:44.395
But it's something that we are
very proud of at D-Rev, that

00:41:44.395 --> 00:41:46.840
when we do the design process,
it's not limited to just the

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:48.670
engineering or technology
aspects.

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:51.310
We're also looking at what does
the distribution market

00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:52.210
look like for that product.

00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:53.790
And it can change from
device to device.

00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:55.330
We have a different distribution
model for the

00:41:55.330 --> 00:41:56.890
knee than we do for
Brilliance.

00:41:56.890 --> 00:41:58.950
And that's all based on what's
available and what we think

00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:00.430
the best path to scaling is.

00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:02.510
KRISTA DONALDSON: And
best path to impact.

00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:05.550
And I would say that the
philosophy and the core tenets

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:05.850
stay the same.

00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:07.000
It needs to be market driven.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.130
But the path there we're really
doing based on what we

00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:14.080
think is doable but also what's
best for the end user.

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:15.860
And the other thing I would add
is if you remember that

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:17.500
nice neat arrow of the
design process.

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:18.930
And we also know there's
a lot of iteration.

00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:20.270
That's much messier.

00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:23.090
But in that early stage of
identification, we're really

00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:25.240
trying to understand all
of those things.

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:27.630
And we're-- in some ways to back
up what Vin was saying is

00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:30.390
we're designing the delivery
model in addition to the

00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:33.240
product and very much using
a design process

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:34.815
for that whole system.

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.700
AUDIENCE: I just had a question,
because I really

00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:42.410
admire the kind of structure
you have that's very

00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:43.270
sustainable.

00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:46.950
And I think inherent in that
structure is a focus on the

00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:48.800
end user, which I really like.

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:53.220
So my question is are there
other companies or nonprofits

00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:55.680
that you kind of modeled
this after?

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:58.740
And were there any lesson
learns in the overall

00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:02.410
structure that you guys chose
for your nonprofit?

00:43:02.410 --> 00:43:04.100
KRISTA DONALDSON: I'll try and
answer that delicately.

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:06.870
I feel like a lot of the model
and the approach that D-Rev

00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:11.690
takes is recognition of where,
in many ways, the aid sector

00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:13.290
has failed people.

00:43:13.290 --> 00:43:15.122
And I hate to say that, because
I don't want to put

00:43:15.122 --> 00:43:15.770
everyone in a basket.

00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:16.820
Because there's a lot
of great work

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:18.110
that's obviously happening.

00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:20.730
But a lot of these things-- like
I saw in Kenya, and Iraq,

00:43:20.730 --> 00:43:21.940
and some of the other
places I worked.

00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:25.210
And I know Vin has a lot of
experience in working with

00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:25.890
prosthetics clinics.

00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:28.920
And really, I feel like if we're
not designing for the

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:32.430
end user and for the impact,
then what are we doing?

00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:35.510
So everything, I feel like, when
we're making decisions,

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:38.180
it all comes back to what's
best for impact and what's

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:39.310
best for the end user.

00:43:39.310 --> 00:43:42.650
And I'll also say one of the
challenges we've had is, like

00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:44.840
I had mentioned earlier, is
getting our impact assessment

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:45.400
up and running.

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:49.100
Because the impact assessment
kind of traditional model is

00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:51.650
focused, for example, in health
on DLAYs, Disability

00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:53.830
Life Adjusted Years, which is
kind of meaningless to end

00:43:53.830 --> 00:43:54.860
users and doctors.

00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:57.170
It's a very global
health thing.

00:43:57.170 --> 00:44:01.570
And we feel like if we're
focused on end users, we need

00:44:01.570 --> 00:44:03.460
to really understand what
their needs are, and

00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:05.400
understanding if they're using
the product, and how many

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:06.460
babies are using it.

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:07.290
And one of the things--

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:09.020
I wanted to keep the focus
on the knee today.

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:11.670
But Brilliance, we can actually
track the number of

00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:14.660
babies that are being treated by
the device, which helps us

00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:15.410
with impact assessment.

00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:17.290
And so we're always trying to
figure out how to do things

00:44:17.290 --> 00:44:20.940
very efficiently, because we
don't fit into the mold of a

00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:22.890
traditional product nonprofit.

00:44:22.890 --> 00:44:24.150
So if you see other groups--

00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:26.180
I mean there's a lot of great
groups out there.

00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:28.960
But if you see other groups,
too, we're all ears, because I

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:31.040
feel like we've definitely
struggled through a lot of

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.510
lessons learned,
as you can see.

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:34.740
And we're changing our path.

00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:37.600
But as much as possible, we try
and learn from what other

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:39.000
groups have been through.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.370
VIN NARAYAN: I think it's also
important to note that the

00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:43.280
approach depends on what
products you're working on.

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:45.112
It's not a one fit approach,
as Krista

00:44:45.112 --> 00:44:46.320
mentioned, for every nonprofit.

00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:49.090
So just like we had to pick the
approach that we think is

00:44:49.090 --> 00:44:51.880
most likely to lead to impact,
we also have to pick products

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:53.640
and projects that best
fit our approach.

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:55.280
We'll never do a vaccine
product.

00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:56.050
That's not going to happen.

00:44:56.050 --> 00:44:57.820
And that's not to say
that this is the

00:44:57.820 --> 00:44:59.350
right way to do vaccines.

00:44:59.350 --> 00:45:01.970
But we pick products that work
well with our approach and

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:03.830
that we think can scale
easily that way.

00:45:03.830 --> 00:45:05.380
KRISTA DONALDSON: I would also
add that we're very pragmatic

00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:06.700
at the end of the day.

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:08.190
We're 10 people.

00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:13.000
So we're very clear about what
we can and what we can't do.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.490
With jaundice, the biggest need
is actually screening.

00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:17.610
But that takes a huge
capital investment.

00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:19.810
It would take probably about
five more staff.

00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:22.380
So we can't do that until we're
at a different stage.

00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:24.470
We also felt like it didn't make
sense to have screening

00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:27.180
before there's treatment
in place.

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:31.140
So I think one of the things
that I feel like is one of our

00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:33.690
core strengths is that we have
the ability to say, no, we

00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:34.710
actually can't do this.

00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:38.180
It's beyond our scope, our skill
set, our everything.

00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:41.300
And this is best for another
organization.

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:43.080
Now that we have a little bit
more impact, we have groups

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:43.470
coming to us.

00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:46.010
And we try and match them with
groups that can carry the

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:49.290
projects forward.

00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:51.510
AUDIENCE: That was a good
segue for my question.

00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:53.140
First of all, I think
you guys are doing

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:54.270
really spectacular work.

00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:56.370
And this has been really
awesome to just

00:45:56.370 --> 00:45:58.540
hear from you live.

00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:00.330
My question was actually about
impact evaluation.

00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:03.970
So you mentioned that you're
kind of setting up how you're

00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:06.130
going to be evaluating
impact going forward.

00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:09.320
So I just wanted to get your
thoughts on where you're

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:12.280
focusing on for Brilliance or
some of the other products

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:14.630
that you're working with.

00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:17.550
And I know there are a couple
of nonprofits that focus

00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:20.990
solely on providing impact
evaluation expertise to other

00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:21.670
non-profits.

00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:24.600
So is that a direction
you're looking for?

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:26.080
KRISTA DONALDSON: We looked
at that, yeah.

00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:27.610
So how about I give
the meta answer.

00:46:27.610 --> 00:46:30.130
And then I'd love Vin to talk
about the trials a little bit,

00:46:30.130 --> 00:46:32.370
because we've done, what I think
is, an incredible job of

00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:34.570
setting up data collection
with the field trials.

00:46:34.570 --> 00:46:37.230
So on the meta levels, we've
tried to work with some of the

00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:39.810
very well known impact
assessment groups.

00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:42.130
But one of the challenges we've
run into is that we're

00:46:42.130 --> 00:46:43.270
very impact focused.

00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:44.710
And a lot of those
groups are led by

00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:46.380
academics who need to publish.

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:49.140
And there's not necessarily an
overlap in those two things.

00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:51.120
So we've said, can you please
take our project?

00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:52.560
We need third party
evaluation.

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:54.680
We would actually love third
party evaluation and for you

00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:56.390
to teach us what you're
doing so that we can

00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:57.800
do it in the future.

00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:00.090
and we haven't been
successful so far.

00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:02.390
And that's something that I
actually know a board member

00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:02.830
on one of those.

00:47:02.830 --> 00:47:05.270
And I've been bugging
him about it.

00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:10.360
I think again we try and keep
things very pragmatic.

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:13.250
But I would love you to talk
about maybe the knee.

00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:15.610
VIN NARAYAN: So I think one of
the challenges when we were--

00:47:15.610 --> 00:47:17.690
so we just set up this
100 unit trial.

00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:19.300
And it's going to be running for
the next six months or so.

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:21.920
And one of the challenges with
looking for an outside impact

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:25.740
group was that we needed such
a specific set of evaluation

00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:29.230
that I think it was going to
be difficult to set that up

00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:30.380
for such a short
period of time.

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:34.180
So what we did was really look
at what we think were the best

00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:36.230
practices that some other groups
were doing and try to

00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:37.560
implement that in
our approach.

00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:41.770
So for example, we looked at
well established prosthetics

00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:44.460
evaluation metrics, and gait
metrics, and tried to take

00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:47.130
questions from existing studies
that could be vetted

00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:50.390
and incorporate that into ours,
and then sort of combine

00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:52.710
that with other things that
maybe aren't part of the

00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:55.250
traditional prosthetics study
like what is the change in

00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:57.800
income six months later, or
things about socioeconomic

00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:00.630
status, and how those are
changing, as well as talking

00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:02.370
to some other nonprofit groups,
and looking at the

00:48:02.370 --> 00:48:03.560
impact work that they're
doing, and how

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:04.800
they're doing it.

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:07.710
A good example is that we met
with one really amazing group

00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:10.730
in New York that uses Dropbox
actually to sync.

00:48:10.730 --> 00:48:12.002
KRISTA DONALDSON: It's the
little details that make all

00:48:12.002 --> 00:48:13.470
the difference.

00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:14.930
VIN NARAYAN: And it was like
such a why didn't we think of

00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:15.240
that kind of moment.

00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:15.970
KRISTA DONALDSON: Because
we were having

00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:17.390
them fill out forms.

00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:19.280
And we're like no, they can
just load it into Dropbox.

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:20.550
And then it magically appears.

00:48:20.550 --> 00:48:21.770
VIN NARAYAN: Yeah, like
let Dropbox do the

00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:23.650
hard part of it.

00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:24.400
AUDIENCE: Or Docs.

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:25.981
KRISTA DONALDSON: Yeah,
we'll move to that.

00:48:25.981 --> 00:48:27.920
Much better--

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:29.220
Docs.

00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:30.960
VIN NARAYAN: Stage two.

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:31.390
KRISTA DONALDSON:
That's right.

00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:34.130
We're getting better
and better.

00:48:34.130 --> 00:48:36.320
VIN NARAYAN: But little things
like that and just kind of see

00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:38.410
what people were doing and
incorporating the best

00:48:38.410 --> 00:48:41.780
practices and making it fit our
approach really well was,

00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:44.670
I think, a really good
lesson learned.

00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:46.660
KRISTA DONALDSON: Yeah, the
other thing I would add is

00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:48.930
thanks to the SEED program
at Stanford.

00:48:48.930 --> 00:48:50.290
I'm not sure if you're familiar
with this big grant

00:48:50.290 --> 00:48:53.590
that the business school got
at Stanford to support

00:48:53.590 --> 00:48:56.820
enterprise creation in
low income economies.

00:48:56.820 --> 00:49:02.310
But we managed to finagle a
fellow named Sara Tollefson.

00:49:02.310 --> 00:49:05.470
And she's our official
director of impact.

00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:10.000
And I felt very strongly that
impact needs to be managed by

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.930
somebody who works on all
of the different teams.

00:49:12.930 --> 00:49:14.740
And Sara's got a really
interesting background.

00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:17.070
In fact, she's not a traditional
impact person.

00:49:17.070 --> 00:49:20.510
She's a lawyer who worked on
Truth and Reconciliation in

00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:22.240
West Africa and a few other
interesting things.

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:25.250
But she's very detail oriented,
which I think is the

00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:27.000
primary job requirement.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.590
So she works with Vin
and other people.

00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:32.560
And we're trying to do some
interesting things to like to

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:34.210
get the data off the Brilliance
machines, for

00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:38.040
example-- like the number of
hours it's been used--

00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:41.590
we are now working with Medic
Mobile to do SMSes to doctors

00:49:41.590 --> 00:49:43.260
and get the data back.

00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:44.790
We're trying to combine
with site visits.

00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:47.390
We're also running a few tests
and collecting data, like

00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:50.500
incentivizing with SMS, calling
ahead of time, and

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:52.450
then kind of comparing all
these different models to

00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:56.200
figure out what's the most
efficient way to do that that

00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:58.580
is least intrusive
to our users.

00:49:58.580 --> 00:49:59.640
So we have a lot of things.

00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:01.160
And I think we're a little
bit like you guys.

00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:02.950
We like to try a lot of things,
and collect data, and

00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:06.680
then go forward from that.

00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:09.530
AUDIENCE: So I noticed that
your organization really

00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:12.840
pushes using the market to
make great products.

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:16.140
And I'm just wondering if
there's any collaboration with

00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:20.020
existing organizations like the
Red Cross that have tried

00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:23.240
to build a design that
isn't that great.

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:25.470
And they have massive
resources,

00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:26.610
like a lot of people.

00:50:26.610 --> 00:50:28.440
They probably have distribution
channels that you

00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:30.560
don't have access to.

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:32.390
So I was wondering if there's
any collaboration between

00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:37.380
D-Rev and larger nonprofits in
addition to the hospitals and

00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:39.650
other partners that you're
working with.

00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:41.920
VIN NARAYAN: I think the easy
answer for that is just that

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:43.770
we're always open to
new partnerships.

00:50:43.770 --> 00:50:46.350
And for a group like that that
had the distribution channels

00:50:46.350 --> 00:50:48.470
in place, that would be a great
partner to work with.

00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:50.680
And so we're always open
to things like that.

00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:52.290
We're not working with
them right now.

00:50:52.290 --> 00:50:54.320
KRISTA DONALDSON:
We're trying.

00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:56.130
To answer your question
very directly is yes.

00:50:56.130 --> 00:51:00.110
We try and work with the best
people in the field, the best

00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:01.920
people with the best
distribution channels.

00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:03.010
I'll be honest.

00:51:03.010 --> 00:51:05.460
I feel like until recently they
were just like, oh, it's

00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:06.370
another student group.

00:51:06.370 --> 00:51:07.550
And we're like, we're
not students.

00:51:07.550 --> 00:51:10.075
We're actually developing
stuff, and

00:51:10.075 --> 00:51:10.820
they're getting used.

00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:13.040
So I feel like we're just
building credibility now.

00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:17.810
But yeah, I mean every time I
see certain leaders of other

00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:20.270
organizations that I know are
donating or buying devices,

00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:21.440
I'm like hey, have you
seen the knee?

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:23.070
Or are you interested in
buying Brilliance?

00:51:23.070 --> 00:51:25.260
And we're just starting
to get traction now.

00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:27.060
So totally yes.

00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:28.930
AUDIENCE: You mentioned earlier
that when you're

00:51:28.930 --> 00:51:32.090
identifying projects you try
to fit it to your approach.

00:51:32.090 --> 00:51:34.870
I just wanted to hear more about
what other factors you

00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:38.480
consider when thinking
about new projects.

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:41.220
Do you kind of have people
approach you, or do you do

00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:45.650
kind of base from
need finding.

00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:47.280
How does that look like?

00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:48.510
KRISTA DONALDSON: A
bit of everything.

00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:51.320
So we have a lot of new needs
that come into us.

00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:52.330
People approach us.

00:51:52.330 --> 00:51:54.730
The Brilliance project started
with a doctor coming.

00:51:54.730 --> 00:51:57.040
The knee started with the Jaipur
Foot Organization going

00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:58.390
to Stanford.

00:51:58.390 --> 00:52:01.090
Because we're in so many
hospitals and clinics, we see

00:52:01.090 --> 00:52:01.760
a lot of things.

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:04.690
And we talk to doctors, and
we learn about new things.

00:52:04.690 --> 00:52:06.450
It's been really interesting.

00:52:06.450 --> 00:52:09.190
With people coming to us with
needs, often if they're

00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:11.770
Westerners, they're coming
to us with solutions.

00:52:11.770 --> 00:52:13.450
They're not actually coming
to us with needs.

00:52:13.450 --> 00:52:17.490
So they'll come and say,
oh, this thing is

00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:18.530
going to solve x.

00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:20.530
And I'm like, well, what's
the problem?

00:52:20.530 --> 00:52:23.320
And what's also really
interesting is if you dig into

00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:25.880
the problem, it's often
not a problem.

00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:28.120
And so we do a lot of due
diligence, too, to really

00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:29.160
understand the problem.

00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:31.300
And one of my favorite
professors at Stanford used to

00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:33.240
always try and get your problem

00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:34.640
statement to the next level.

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:37.260
Like if you say, oh,
I need light.

00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:38.840
Well, what do you need
the light for?

00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:40.540
Like what's the problem you're
trying to solve?

00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:45.560
Is it children need to do
homework after dark, or they

00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:48.710
want to keep their business
open after dark on a road?

00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:50.380
What's the problem you're
trying to solve?

00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:53.480
And if you can get there, that's
a good place to start.

00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:56.600
We have a framework that we
kind of run needs through.

00:52:56.600 --> 00:53:00.810
And it's everything pragmatic
from is this our sweet spot,

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:03.410
are their key opinion leaders
who think this is an issue,

00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:05.360
will the key opinion
leaders advise us.

00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:07.760
Because as you can imagine,
getting in the door with the

00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:10.540
largest maker of neonatal
equipment in India, we just

00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:12.750
can't walk up and say hi.

00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:15.810
So are there a lot of these
conditions met that we think

00:53:15.810 --> 00:53:18.820
that we have a high success
rate of moving forward.

00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:20.820
And so that identify phase that
I showed you with the

00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:23.320
arrow, it's more than just
kind of like need

00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:25.370
identification, talking
to a few customers.

00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:28.590
It's a very intensive due
diligence process, which has

00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:30.580
been really interesting,
because, for example, funders

00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:32.690
aren't interested in throwing
money at you to just go

00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:33.490
research stuff.

00:53:33.490 --> 00:53:36.010
You have to go research that on
your own and then come back

00:53:36.010 --> 00:53:38.150
and say, OK, this is a real
problem that we feel very

00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:39.160
strongly about.

00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:41.940
And there are these users who
say this is an issue.

00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:44.890
And this is the scale up plan
or the development plan.

00:53:44.890 --> 00:53:46.400
VIN NARAYAN: And I can tell you
a little bit about what

00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:48.690
that conversation went with
the knee, because when it

00:53:48.690 --> 00:53:50.790
started, the student team just
had to worry mostly about the

00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:52.710
technology because there was
already a partner to scale it.

00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:55.380
But when we were deciding
whether or not we should take

00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:58.430
it forward as an independent
project and try to scale it, I

00:53:58.430 --> 00:54:00.040
think the questions really are--
and these are the same

00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:01.790
questions that D-Rev asks--

00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:04.720
can we develop it, or is there
a need for the type of things

00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:06.300
that we think we're
really good at?

00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:10.360
And are their partners available
for the other areas,

00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:12.600
is that a ripe space, are there
enough people doing the

00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:13.320
other aspects of it?

00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:16.520
So questions for us were OK, if
we make a device, are there

00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:17.670
clinics that can fit it?

00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:19.750
Are there distributors that
will be able to sell it?

00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:23.295
How much regulatory work or
other upfront costs will we

00:54:23.295 --> 00:54:24.080
need to get into it?

00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:26.710
And at the end of all that, will
it still be affordable

00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:28.950
enough for the people that
it needs to get to?

00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:31.420
And if the answers are yes, I
think that is a really ripe

00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:33.400
area for D-Rev to explore.

00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:35.180
KRISTA DONALDSON: We're really
looking at where there's a

00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:38.590
huge social need and an unmet
market that we think we can

00:54:38.590 --> 00:54:41.250
design for affordably.

00:54:41.250 --> 00:54:43.910
AUDIENCE: So I noticed in the
video at the very end that the

00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:47.070
young patient was saying that in
the hospital my doctor told

00:54:47.070 --> 00:54:50.050
me I should come here, which
sounds like the old fashioned

00:54:50.050 --> 00:54:52.460
way of getting information
out.

00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:55.700
Ideally patients who need your
technology should know exactly

00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:56.370
what's available.

00:54:56.370 --> 00:54:58.320
So what are your thoughts about
how you're going to make

00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:02.620
sure that people who need knees
know what they can have?

00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:03.650
KRISTA DONALDSON: That's
a great question.

00:55:03.650 --> 00:55:05.410
And I'd love Vin to
address this, too.

00:55:05.410 --> 00:55:07.690
I mean one of the challenges,
again if you go back to our

00:55:07.690 --> 00:55:11.160
goal of re-mobilization, a lot
of the amputees just don't

00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:13.460
know that the product
is available.

00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:18.040
And we don't, other than working
with patients to

00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:20.890
understand the fitting and
what they go through, our

00:55:20.890 --> 00:55:22.820
partner who really interfaces
is the Jaipur Foot

00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:23.380
Organization.

00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:25.520
And we know that they do media
campaigns, and will drive into

00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:27.420
communities, and they
do these camps.

00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:29.080
But that's actually
a huge problem.

00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:31.770
And one of the things that we're
dealing with now with

00:55:31.770 --> 00:55:36.370
Brilliance is actually SEOs
because we know we have target

00:55:36.370 --> 00:55:38.420
countries that really
need this product.

00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:42.110
If they type in photo therapy
device, we want them to see

00:55:42.110 --> 00:55:43.610
Brilliance, because
we know that the

00:55:43.610 --> 00:55:44.800
price point is perfect.

00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:47.900
So this is part of what we're
really learning, I would say,

00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:49.490
with the delivery phase.

00:55:49.490 --> 00:55:50.710
Do you want to add
anything to that?

00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:53.100
Because I think this is a
big issue with amputees.

00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:53.300
VIN NARAYAN: Yeah.

00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:55.390
And we're seeing that there
are limitations to scaling

00:55:55.390 --> 00:55:56.757
both on the supply
and demand side.

00:55:56.757 --> 00:55:58.770
So on the supply side, it's
all the typical problems.

00:55:58.770 --> 00:55:59.730
There are not enough clinics.

00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:00.980
They don't have access
to what they need.

00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:03.230
On the demand side, it's a lot
of times people just don't

00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:04.540
know what's available.

00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:07.280
And we're hoping that that
problem is reducing.

00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:09.840
We're seeing a lot of clinics
approaching it with some

00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:11.200
innovative techniques.

00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:13.900
So some clinics do radio
broadcast when they're going

00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:14.730
to a new area.

00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:16.380
Or some people are putting
out web hits.

00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:19.640
And we're starting to get more
and more inquiries from people

00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:21.520
in country just from
the information

00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:22.560
we have on the web.

00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:25.410
We don't know if that's just
because we're only reaching

00:56:25.410 --> 00:56:26.510
the web savvy clinics.

00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:29.170
And maybe there's this whole
other suite that isn't.

00:56:29.170 --> 00:56:32.250
But we see a really good tactic
in taking what works

00:56:32.250 --> 00:56:35.960
best in some areas and trying to
spread those best practices

00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:37.730
to other clinics so that they're
able to get the word

00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:39.010
out better as well.

00:56:39.010 --> 00:56:40.470
FEMALE SPEAKER: Let's just give
them a round of applause.

00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:41.720
KRISTA DONALDSON: Thank you.
