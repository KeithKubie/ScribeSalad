WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.910
With coming to the final section of the sound,
the fury.
And I think that,

2
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.000
um,
a question that we'll have to arise for everyone,
uh,

3
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.020
is why isn't catty the person to be telling the story in session four?

4
00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:18.000
It seems kind of logical,
right?
You know,
each of the four brothers,

5
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.980
it'll have three brothers,
um,

6
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.640
get the guest to tell a story in one session.

7
00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:28.641
So it would seem logical that Kelly should be the narrator in session four.

8
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.700
Um,
this is not a choice.
They thought the mix.

9
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.550
So we have to think about why he decides,
again,

10
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.480
using catty as the narrator.
Um,
so again,

11
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.430
just say that to us it might seem as if it would be good to have a woman's

12
00:00:44.431 --> 00:00:47.580
voice,
uh,
in that last section.
Uh,

13
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.630
it is the missing point of view has been missing so far how it feels to be a

14
00:00:52.981 --> 00:00:54.360
caddy,
uh,

15
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.390
if suddenly we have restore a more balanced gender dynamics to the sound of the

16
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:04.770
fury.
So,
um,
I think that those are the,
uh,
the,

17
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.720
the reasons that one would argue for having catty,
uh,
as the narrator.

18
00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:13.440
And I would encourage you to think about that in your section,
you know,

19
00:01:13.441 --> 00:01:17.940
to have a discussion on this point,
whether you would prefer to have as and area,

20
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.770
uh,
but today in today's lecture,
um,

21
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.840
I like to explore falconers reasons for deciding against having Kelly as a

22
00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:32.490
narrator.
Um,
and the choice that he does make,
uh,
which is,
uh,

23
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.520
to have not a first person singular and not an I tell him the story in section

24
00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:43.090
four,
but instead to have ignition duration,
um,

25
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.310
tow from an outside point of view.
Um,

26
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.710
and I would argue that this narrative choice on Faulkner's pot is also maps onto

27
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.300
a thematic emphasis on a collectivity,

28
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.770
on a communal voice.
So it was not one person's point of view,

29
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.980
but is that a really a group of people,
um,
the interrelations,
um,

30
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.250
and what emerges from that collectivity.
And,
um,

31
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.020
in thinking about these questions I think is useful to go back a little bit to

32
00:02:16.021 --> 00:02:20.580
the publication history of the sound and the fury.
Um,
as you guys know,

33
00:02:20.581 --> 00:02:24.300
the first edition came out in 1929 in San Diego.

34
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.020
The crash as we saw last time.
Um,
and um,

35
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.110
in 1946 random house decided to bring out the portable Fortner additive by a

36
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.180
very important,
uh,
Arthur and critic,
uh,

37
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.280
Malcolm Collie.
Um,
and so who,
who's also a big fan of farmers.

38
00:02:47.281 --> 00:02:49.950
So Malcolm colleague was just editing.

39
00:02:49.951 --> 00:02:54.030
There's [inaudible] which in turn out to be a very successful edition.

40
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.590
It was used a lot.
Um,
and um,

41
00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.640
this is the 1946 edition of the Political Falkland Really Analysis the

42
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:05.750
importance of partner.
Uh,
he,
he's,
uh,

43
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.420
the kind of author about home,
you will have a portable something edition.
Uh,

44
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.270
so,
um,
it was a great thing for Faulkner.

45
00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:17.190
And in preparation for the portable Faulkner,
um,

46
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.630
he decided to write an appendix,
um,

47
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.420
to sound and the fury to be included in the portable partner.

48
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.360
And this is what he said to Malcolm Collie,
uh,

49
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.550
before it came out October,

50
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.680
1945 about the appendix.

51
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.790
I should have done this when I wrote the book than the whole thing with our

52
00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:43.600
fallen into pattern,

53
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.490
like a jigsaw puzzle when the magician's one touched it.

54
00:03:48.491 --> 00:03:53.491
So that's the degree of attachment of importance that he would attach to the

55
00:03:54.191 --> 00:03:56.050
appendix.
Um,

56
00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.830
although since he was writing in 1945,

57
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.540
almost 20 years after the original sound of the fury,
um,

58
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.380
he had a somewhat change,
um,

59
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.090
idea about the novel.
Um,

60
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.130
his regulation of the novel seem a bit skewed even to mark and Carly.

61
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.150
So Carly real bad him and if it meets their axes of the original sound of fury,

62
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.840
just remind him what was in the original novel,
um,

63
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.770
and asked if he would consider,
um,
changing the,

64
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.390
revising the appendix a little bit in light of what he actually written and

65
00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:35.020
designed a period but farm that when there any of that he was stick to as

66
00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.850
appendix.
And not only that,

67
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.860
the same year random house decided to bring out and do addition of the sound of

68
00:04:41.861 --> 00:04:43.360
fury.
And as I lay down,

69
00:04:43.361 --> 00:04:48.361
we'll be reading as I lay down a little bit later on in 1946,

70
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.360
those two were brought out,
you know,
the saying go do addition,
um,

71
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.580
under the modern library imprint,

72
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.170
which is a cheaper paperback edition of Random House books.

73
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.500
So it came out in the modern library edition.

74
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.560
And in preparation for that father was also very emphatic that the appendix

75
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.950
should be in there.
So this is what he wrote to Robert [inaudible],

76
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.930
senior editor at Random House,
um,

77
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.910
at the beginning of [inaudible] 46.
When you read it,
the appendix,

78
00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.290
you will see how it is the key to the whole book.

79
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.030
And after reading it,

80
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.270
the four sections as they stand now foreign into clarity and place when you

81
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.990
issue in the book,

82
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.340
friend is appendix first and title it appendix then continue with the sections

83
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.270
as they now are,
be sure and print the appendix first.

84
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.860
So far we're really has very strange ideas about him,

85
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.040
more than of the appendix.
That's theme,
a little dubious.

86
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.980
Even two is devoted fan Malcolm.
Um,

87
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.330
and the appendix worsening in fact included in the 1946,
um,

88
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.140
modern library addition,
um,
and it was included,
um,

89
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.280
in many additions of the sound of the fury,
um,

90
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.050
all through the fifties,
sixties,

91
00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:12.560
seventies and the 80s are editor started checking it out.

92
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.420
And so in our edition,
as you can see,
there's no appendix,
um,

93
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.860
in our edition of the vintage addition,
um,

94
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.740
which was also published by random house.
Uh,
but,
uh,
just for your reference,

95
00:06:24.741 --> 00:06:28.250
I will,
uh,
post the appendix onto our website.

96
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:33.410
Some of you will see it for yourself,
um,
if,
um,
whether Faulkner's a point,

97
00:06:33.411 --> 00:06:37.370
whether it is in fact the key to the sound and fury.
But once again,

98
00:06:37.371 --> 00:06:41.180
remember the loss of people actually had reservations about the appendix.

99
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.180
So don't think that it is in fact the key to the novel.

100
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.000
Uh,
but the appendix does.
Um,

101
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.730
tell us quite a bit about how Foglar um,

102
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.550
things that are catty and how you,
things the other wrestlers are novel.

103
00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.960
So this is his very,

104
00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:04.961
very long entry on caddy Candace caddy dude.

105
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:11.470
And knew it extended to do without either seeking of fleeing loved her brother,

106
00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:18.770
this bite him,
loved him not only in spite of,

107
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.850
but because of the fact that he must value about,

108
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.530
or not her,

109
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:30.190
but the virginity of which she was custodian and on which she plays no value,

110
00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:36.410
whatever new,
the rather love death.

111
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:41.750
Best of all,
I was not jealous.
[inaudible]

112
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:46.310
in Paris,
the German occupation,
19th for the,

113
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:48.003
um,

114
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:52.430
for a good part of that entry on Kelly.

115
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:53.900
It is a very,

116
00:07:53.901 --> 00:07:58.901
very good summary of her plays in the sound of fury.

117
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.910
And you can see why Faulkner,
we're not one her,
uh,

118
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.150
to tell the story on that.
Uh,

119
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:12.190
her importance in the novel is her importance to her brothers.

120
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:16.820
Um,
and the way in which,
uh,
she is really not important.

121
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:19.020
She's an ideal of virginity issue.

122
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:23.990
There an arbitrary of virginity that is so important both to Benji and two

123
00:08:23.991 --> 00:08:25.430
Clemson.
Um,

124
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:29.470
and so she was really a kind of a cipher for her brothers.
Um,

125
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:34.180
and that's why she is what she is always existing in the minds of brothers,

126
00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:37.520
but never having an independent existence of Hurrah.

127
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:42.260
But this one other weird thing that comes out of the appendix which comes out in

128
00:08:42.261 --> 00:08:47.130
this little detail and far from the go on to elaborate on that,
um,
fell further,

129
00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:51.170
creates a whole other story about a county,
uh,

130
00:08:51.171 --> 00:08:53.240
the show and to Paris,
uh,

131
00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:57.660
that she was there apparently when the Germans occupied Paris.

132
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:02.880
Um,
and then there was this other detail about a picture of her falling into the

133
00:09:02.881 --> 00:09:07.410
hands of the library in Jefferson,
a woman who look like caddy,

134
00:09:07.411 --> 00:09:10.590
who was hanging out with a German Nazi officer.

135
00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.710
And then the librarian wasn't sure that was catty,

136
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:17.450
but she showed a picture to Jason just showed into the doc.

137
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:22.050
And nobody knew whether or not that woman who was hanging out with Nazi officer,

138
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.040
whether that was caddy.

139
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:27.810
So a whole new industry on photos in the course of the appendix.

140
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.310
And clearly Faulkner,

141
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:34.410
maybe it was even thinking of another novel based on Carrie,
uh,
you know,
his,

142
00:09:34.411 --> 00:09:36.800
his way of writing a new novel back into the sound.

143
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:41.970
You can see that she would not be the appropriate person to be telling the story

144
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.020
in session four.

145
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:47.430
So we'll see what father Ashley ends up with,

146
00:09:47.431 --> 00:09:51.780
what he chooses a two as his,
um,
you know,
uh,

147
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.440
kind of a representative,
um,
in,

148
00:09:54.441 --> 00:09:58.590
in session for the most authoritative,
um,
where you're telling the story,

149
00:09:58.591 --> 00:10:03.360
which was actually through a third party for this own nation duration.
Um,

150
00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.490
and,
um,

151
00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:10.010
that is linked to some degree with his understanding of what section four is

152
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.780
about.
Um,
and that is the,

153
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:19.010
the two people that he mentioned at the end of the appendix and that was all the

154
00:10:20.641 --> 00:10:25.641
others were not comms and they were black luster man,

155
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:28.050
age 14,

156
00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:33.650
who was not only capable of the complete care and security of an idiot twice as

157
00:10:36.021 --> 00:10:41.021
age in three times his size because keep him entertained

158
00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:45.590
deucey day and do it.

159
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:51.140
So these are the two people that he would like to talk about in those other

160
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.800
sensors,
um,
in session four.

161
00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:59.910
And I actually agree with that.
That makes a lot of sense.

162
00:10:59.911 --> 00:11:01.950
They have been so important all through the novel.

163
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:06.030
And finally in session four is devoted to luster and a,
um,

164
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:11.210
and all that revolves around them in the future that emerges from this focus on

165
00:11:12.451 --> 00:11:15.130
luster.
And they'll say,
uh,

166
00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:19.650
we already have seen something about last year that he is very young but he's

167
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:24.710
capable of replacing catty and taking good care of Benji.

168
00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:29.940
Uh,
well there's odd about this.
Three words used to describe those.

169
00:11:29.941 --> 00:11:33.870
There is still say day and doing.

170
00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:39.050
So Pharma is super conscious of pronouns and he's afraid og way of not the use

171
00:11:42.901 --> 00:11:47.670
of non what appears to be a non matching pronoun.
It should've been daisy.

172
00:11:47.671 --> 00:11:52.260
She and doers in say interviews is the third person thorough.

173
00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:57.560
And I would argue that session four is inside of session dominated by their

174
00:11:57.731 --> 00:12:01.870
pronouns.
That is involved in this very peculiar fashion.

175
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:06.820
Is the session devoted to the bird person thorough by way of someone?

176
00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:11.560
Like they'll say,
um,
so less in the resume,
the lecture,

177
00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.830
I'll be thinking about session four along those lines.
Um,

178
00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:18.370
we know there's really,
this is the first thing that we know.

179
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.800
There's this omission [inaudible].
Um,

180
00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:24.250
and these are the other points that would like to make about the whole thing

181
00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:27.820
through her.
We see the legacy of slavery.
Um,

182
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:30.050
we see a shift between outside,

183
00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:33.430
inside of nation and duration is an external point of view,

184
00:12:33.431 --> 00:12:38.060
but quite often there's a shift back to the interior of the Osi,
uh,

185
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:39.910
and along with our chef,
um,

186
00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:44.380
a kind of tension between say the sandwich between the visual and the auditory

187
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:49.270
registers.
Um,
with,
because it's a question of endurance day and do,

188
00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:50.320
um,

189
00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:55.320
farmers thinking about the future of race and of the United States by way of

190
00:12:55.481 --> 00:12:59.830
race and the tomorrow of race.
Um,
and,
um,

191
00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:05.010
we'll test a concept that we used last time that we took from Raymond Williams,

192
00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:10.630
the knowable community as well as whether or not that could be resurrected,
um,

193
00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:11.740
in section four.

194
00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:17.040
And the question who wrestle ration comes out because session or is Easter

195
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:21.440
Sunday is the day on which song resurrected in the textbook itself.

196
00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:26.110
Falconers using that as the frame for the idea of resurrecting something else.

197
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:27.340
And,
um,

198
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:31.930
obviously we think because Benji's and they're still everyone else,

199
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:36.100
Jason is still there.
Uh,
there's the possibility for cross racial,

200
00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:41.050
we emerging from day and do,
um,
and as promised last time,

201
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:45.990
um,
the horse Quinny actually mixed an appearance as well,
um,

202
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.680
in session for the sound and fury.
In fact,
she is very,
very important.
Um,

203
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:52.210
so we'll think about,
uh,

204
00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:57.270
we're not quite at the place where we can talk about a community made up of

205
00:13:57.821 --> 00:14:02.210
humans and nonhumans.
Uh,
but it is interesting.
That is not,
uh,
uh,

206
00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.071
the automobile,

207
00:14:03.071 --> 00:14:07.870
but it comes back in a big way at the very end of the sound of the fury.
So,

208
00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:11.410
um,
let's start out with ignition in the region.
Um,

209
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:16.470
and I think that there's a temptation on our part to think that on the ocean

210
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:19.770
duration is going to be benign.
That okay,

211
00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:23.590
section one is told by Benji who was mentally retarded.

212
00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:27.070
Section two is told by a Quentin who's going to kill himself.

213
00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:32.170
A session three is taught by Jason,
totally obnoxious but very sad,

214
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.240
very pathetic character.
Um,

215
00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:39.460
session certain is Tobais and definition narrator or so we might assume that

216
00:14:39.851 --> 00:14:43.750
this is going to be benign,
that this is going to be full of goodwill.

217
00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:48.010
That is not necessarily the case.
Um,
and in fact,

218
00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:53.190
the ignition erasion actually begins with a fairly of putting external,

219
00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:56.600
uh,

220
00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:01.600
and objectifying view of dose it in the sense that she's turned into an inert

221
00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:08.120
object to be observed.
So it's very striking and to some extent,

222
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:11.060
puzzling narrative choice on [inaudible] part.

223
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:17.320
This is the morning of Easter Sunday DLC opened the door of the cabin and emerge

224
00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:25.540
needled laterally into her flesh precipitating NASA,

225
00:15:25.611 --> 00:15:30.611
much the moisture as a substance partaking of the quality of thin,

226
00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:34.720
not quite congealed oil to all us.

227
00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:39.730
The Velvet Cape with the border of mangy and anonymous for about the address of

228
00:15:41.871 --> 00:15:42.860
purple silk.

229
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:48.310
And she stood in the door for a while with a myriad and sunken face lifted to

230
00:15:48.861 --> 00:15:53.861
the weather in one call and hand flags sold as the belly of a fish.

231
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:59.090
It's a repost a picture of they'll say,
uh,

232
00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:03.080
and it is first of all observing her as very,

233
00:16:03.081 --> 00:16:04.430
very close range.

234
00:16:04.431 --> 00:16:09.431
This has really deal say captured on not even the micro register but almost like

235
00:16:10.551 --> 00:16:13.460
a nano,
uh,
register,
um,

236
00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:18.490
in a sense that we're not even seeing her eyes were not seeing her hair or um,

237
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.350
you know,
the smart possible a smile and nod and smile on her face.
Um,

238
00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:28.940
we're looking at something that maybe is sweat coming out for,

239
00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:33.270
but it is not moisture.
It is a layer,

240
00:16:33.271 --> 00:16:37.760
a thin layer of congealed of oil.
They're sticking to the skin.
Um,

241
00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:42.850
it completely physical mechanical description of doc at very close range.

242
00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:46.740
It's almost Wagner telling us that when it comes to the ignition,

243
00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:51.260
Eurasia is as good as the next guy.
Didn't give us the most minute details,

244
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:56.000
most of mine you impersonal,
um,
and non benign,

245
00:16:56.420 --> 00:17:00.610
um,
level of detail attached to [inaudible].
Um,

246
00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:05.680
from that very minute and non benign in the sense that is in is completely

247
00:17:05.841 --> 00:17:10.841
neutral description of days and we move on to a slightly larger scale.

248
00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:15.880
Um,
and now we know there's the clothes that she's wearing.
Um,

249
00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:19.710
and she's wearing fancy clothes.
She's wearing clothes to goodwill station,

250
00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:23.420
she's wearing a velvet cape and a silk dress.

251
00:17:23.421 --> 00:17:26.510
So we know that those are not really her clothes.
Right?

252
00:17:26.511 --> 00:17:30.080
Those are the hand me downs,
um,
scar there by her mistress,

253
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:33.950
Mrs Compson and she's wearing them with uh,

254
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:39.220
so right there we have the legacy of slavery and coded into articles of clothing

255
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:44.480
that are to be farmed on doc.

256
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:48.710
And I would emphasize that they are to be found on say in the sense of there's

257
00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:53.160
not a whole lot of Asian say in dosage choosing to wear those clothes.

258
00:17:53.161 --> 00:17:55.470
They are just handling me.
I given to her.

259
00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:00.920
So flavoring is also something that was historically a given and quite possibly

260
00:18:04.261 --> 00:18:08.600
is still a given in the 20th century.
Uh,
the blood,

261
00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:13.530
the African American characters in session four are not slaves anymore.

262
00:18:13.531 --> 00:18:16.650
This is the 20th century.
Slavery was a thing in the past,

263
00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:19.410
but there is still the legacy of slavery.

264
00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:24.420
The shadow of slavery hanging over everyone's head asked,

265
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:29.280
they will see is still wearing the old clothes of her mistress.
Um,

266
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:33.420
so in that sense,
in thinking about the legacy of slavery,

267
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:38.490
the sound of fury could be staying in the company of other,

268
00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:42.900
uh,
other narratives are not novels,
but narrative,

269
00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:43.620
um,

270
00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:48.620
that were emerging or being produced in the 1930s just a little later.

271
00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:49.680
Um,

272
00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:54.680
and this was the project sponsored by the Federal Writer's project are lots of,

273
00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:00.330
um,
during the great depression when loss of unemployed,
um,

274
00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:01.080
authors,

275
00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:04.680
we're going around the country under the sponsorship of the federal government

276
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:09.790
to talk to add slaves,
um,
and to get the live stories,
um,

277
00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:13.230
and to make sure that those are on record and archive.
Um,

278
00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:18.090
so there's that desire in the 30th to capture something that will vanish

279
00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:21.090
otherwise Spanish forever.
Um,
and,
uh,

280
00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:24.600
those are really interesting archives to look at.
Um,
you know,

281
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:28.070
if you ever decide to go the graduate school,
um,

282
00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:30.690
in their Azure and decide to do something on Faulkner,

283
00:19:30.691 --> 00:19:34.830
it would be very interesting to look a dose in conjunction with what Fox News

284
00:19:34.831 --> 00:19:37.770
says about the slaves and the sound of the fury.
Uh,

285
00:19:37.771 --> 00:19:41.310
but that's just the kind of a reference point that what else is happening.
Um,

286
00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:45.120
within the sound of the fury,
we see that the legacy of slavery,

287
00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:47.280
it's basically a kind of a hostility,

288
00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:52.240
a visual hostility directed against a doc.

289
00:19:52.241 --> 00:19:56.400
And she's an enormously,
enormously sympathetic character,

290
00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:01.880
but she's not completely in the year from a hostile gaze that is a part of the

291
00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:08.290
omniscient narration.
Omniscient narration is completely neutral.
Um,

292
00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:09.810
it doesn't side with anyone.

293
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:14.500
It can be both for someone or get someone and initially used my fault actually

294
00:20:14.501 --> 00:20:18.390
is used against,
they'll say,
but as is the custom with Faulkner,

295
00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:21.060
quite often,
uh,
you know,
we see that he gets,

296
00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:25.970
this is giving us to both sides of the picture.
Um,
that neutral,

297
00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:31.040
maybe even hostile view of doc is quickly modified and is mollify when some

298
00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:35.310
enters the picture.

299
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:39.960
So we're getting pretty much the same dynamics that we've seen in Fitzgerald.

300
00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:44.580
The interplay of sight and sound,
auditory and the visual registers,
um,

301
00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:49.060
almost always produces a change in the visual field.

302
00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:49.690
Um,

303
00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:54.690
and this is what happened this to doc and it happens in one significant setting.

304
00:20:55.930 --> 00:21:00.640
The kitchen they will say is preparing breakfast.
They'll say,

305
00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:05.670
prepare to make biscuit as she ran the sifter Steli about the breadboard.

306
00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:09.550
She's saying to herself at first,

307
00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:13.140
something without particular tune awards,

308
00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:18.560
repetitive more info and plaintive Astir as you gran theend steadies knowing of

309
00:21:22.091 --> 00:21:27.091
flour onto the breadboard to still have began to hit the road and to fill in

310
00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.720
with as miners after fire.

311
00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:37.380
And presently she was singing louder as if a voice to have installed out by the

312
00:21:40.301 --> 00:21:44.710
growing warmth.
So as boys takes over,

313
00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.880
the Pronoun also changes a little bit.

314
00:21:48.881 --> 00:21:53.680
We're still sticking with the third person singular pronoun,

315
00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:59.190
but already there's a degree of interiority emerging in this portrait.

316
00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:03.760
It is not just an external view of they'll say,

317
00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:08.830
but the quality of sound that is coming out of her and as the quality of song is

318
00:22:08.831 --> 00:22:12.610
coming out of her,
we see what she's like when she's working,

319
00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:17.740
when she's in a place that she is familiar with this shoes at home.

320
00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:19.390
And Dan really is for domain.

321
00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:24.420
The kitchen is her domain and when doc is in her domain,

322
00:22:24.671 --> 00:22:28.410
she turns into a different kind of person.
Um,

323
00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:32.740
the Sandlers your mates is still attached to the work that she has to do.

324
00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:36.700
So this no cessation of work as she sayings,

325
00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:42.090
but the very rhythm of work and enables those here to turn it into a different

326
00:22:42.881 --> 00:22:46.330
kind of character.
She's very,
very different when she's singing.

327
00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:51.250
Then when she's seen as in a nerd object outside of cabin.
Um,

328
00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:54.820
so,
and one thing that happens,

329
00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:58.930
one other thing that emerges about doc,
um,

330
00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:01.420
in the kitchen,
um,
is there,

331
00:23:01.421 --> 00:23:06.010
she has a relation to time and here I just want to say that,

332
00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:11.020
um,
in session four,
um,
this actually both,
um,

333
00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.240
something that emerges about,
they'll say,

334
00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:18.600
but there is also a backward reference to three emblematic moment in visual,

335
00:23:19.871 --> 00:23:24.220
the three preceding section.
So what we'll see in session four,

336
00:23:24.221 --> 00:23:28.760
I think that this is the structure that thought his work working,
um,

337
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:33.030
really very intricate and very well crafted structure,
um,

338
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:37.970
is to give us one moment that,
uh,
is emblematic of Dosa.

339
00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:43.250
Um,
that is,
uh,
response,
uh,
rejoinder,
uh,

340
00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:48.320
or an amendment to earlier moment that was problematic in one of the preceding

341
00:23:49.131 --> 00:23:52.250
sections.
So just let's look at this,
um,

342
00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:55.450
very interesting moment.
Um,

343
00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:58.600
very memorable in graphic moment.
Um,

344
00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:02.390
although we're sound strong in about,
they'll say,
um,

345
00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:07.450
also in the kitchen on the war about a cupboard in visible safe at night by lamb

346
00:24:10.031 --> 00:24:10.850
light.

347
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:15.850
And even then it advancing and the nomadic profanity because it had,

348
00:24:16.161 --> 00:24:21.161
but one had a cabinet clock tick then with a preliminary sound as it had clear

349
00:24:24.181 --> 00:24:26.810
the stroke,
stroke five times

350
00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:33.380
evil due season.
Okay.

351
00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:35.390
So cloud,

352
00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:39.100
this thing Australian five doc knows is eight o'clock.

353
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:41.320
There's not up with five windows.
Just hardworking.

354
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:46.350
She's not up at 5:00 AM she was [inaudible] she knows that this is eight o'clock

355
00:24:46.811 --> 00:24:49.070
clock.
She knows the coauthor of well.
Okay.

356
00:24:49.071 --> 00:24:54.071
So we are bad to the notion of unknowable community.

357
00:24:54.351 --> 00:24:57.350
In this case.
It is a community betraying.

358
00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:02.830
They'll see and the Clark and significantly it emerges and the course of working

359
00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:11.120
height,
labor,
what hard enough.
Uh,
but,
uh,

360
00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:15.290
it was a war game and isn't a very familiar setting.

361
00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:19.680
This is the most important thing that the kitchen is a familiar setting to those

362
00:25:19.681 --> 00:25:20.120
a,

363
00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:24.770
and the clock is also her birth and million is a mechanical contrivances.

364
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:26.180
But in a case,

365
00:25:26.181 --> 00:25:30.710
in this case it is the mechanical contrivances that isn't quite working right.

366
00:25:30.711 --> 00:25:34.130
First of all,
the club has really not doing a number of things.

367
00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:38.910
It is invisible in broad daylight.
You can only see it at night by landline.

368
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.990
Even then you can barely see it because it's only has one hand.

369
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:46.340
So this is not functioning properly,
is also enough function in public.

370
00:25:46.341 --> 00:25:48.680
This is not telling the right time.
Um,

371
00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:53.800
but all of that are only makes the kitchen and more important normal community

372
00:25:54.531 --> 00:25:58.670
is only when you have a detective defective instrument and you know that

373
00:25:58.671 --> 00:26:01.610
instruction your while that you can prove that you actually know this domain

374
00:26:01.611 --> 00:26:03.110
very well.
So,
um,

375
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:07.400
they will see his knowledge of this place is proven without um,

376
00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:12.530
you know,
with just,
just,
it's beyond doubt that she knows this place very well.

377
00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:14.450
Um,
and um,

378
00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:19.480
this emblematic moment about doc obviously brings back and equally emblematic

379
00:26:21.681 --> 00:26:26.240
moment about Quentin and his relation to his watch,
right?

380
00:26:26.241 --> 00:26:29.060
This is the first thing that we know about Quentin.

381
00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:34.690
So let's look at this opening of his section and his relation to time.

382
00:26:35.901 --> 00:26:40.520
As we've seen,
and especially his relation to his own watches.
When Raj,

383
00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:44.730
when the shadow of the Sash appear on curtains,

384
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:50.460
it was between seven and eight o'clock and then I was in time again,

385
00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:56.690
I went into the dresser and took up the watch for the face still down.

386
00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:02.660
I'd have the crystal on a corner of the dresser and call it the for friends of

387
00:27:02.821 --> 00:27:07.821
glass in my hand and put them in the ashtray and twisted the hands of,

388
00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:12.900
pulled them in the tray to watch tape on.

389
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:18.440
So two points or contacts between the doc section and this section eight

390
00:27:19.081 --> 00:27:21.210
o'clock,
same time.
Uh,

391
00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:26.330
except that they have the completely different variation to eight o'clock to the

392
00:27:26.641 --> 00:27:30.450
time.
Those eight o'clock for those is another day.

393
00:27:30.451 --> 00:27:34.860
And we know that there'll be many more either class for her.

394
00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.830
For Quentin,

395
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:41.490
this is the last eight o'clock he would ever experience.

396
00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:45.700
It is the very end of the lines for him.
So rather than their,

397
00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:50.730
that is sales who tells us fully who has a future and who doesn't.

398
00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:53.720
But the other thing is that,
um,

399
00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:58.760
doc is able to make do with a broken clock.

400
00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:04.470
Quentin is the one who has well functioning was the,

401
00:28:04.471 --> 00:28:09.471
he smashes twist off the hands of that watch.

402
00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:11.160
Uh,

403
00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:15.720
and he of course he hurts his hand in the course of smashing that watch.

404
00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.360
So right there,
yeah,

405
00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:23.400
there's a capsule summary of his few tile battle with time,

406
00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:28.620
um,
and the way went and gets bloodied on this day.
This is finally the day when,

407
00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:31.350
um,
he um,
lose it,

408
00:28:31.351 --> 00:28:34.710
some kind of virginity loosens that the virginity,

409
00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:39.540
that time it is bloating in his struggle at the time.
Um,

410
00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:43.080
so,
um,
it's a very eloquent,

411
00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:45.610
a rejoinder to that earlier moment,

412
00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:49.560
but also a rewriting of that earlier moment.

413
00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:52.890
It is a dad and for Clinton,
no doubt about it.

414
00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:55.130
There's no way [inaudible] can keep eye,

415
00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:59.550
although I just say actually in terms of thoughtless models,

416
00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:04.000
he actually wrote another novel,
affluent,
affluent,
resurrecting Quentin,
um,

417
00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:05.560
in that novel or so.
Um,

418
00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:10.560
he actually manages to find a way to bring Quentin back as well by writing

419
00:29:10.561 --> 00:29:11.730
another novel about him.

420
00:29:11.731 --> 00:29:16.530
But within the sound of fear is no way he can bring them back alive.
Um,

421
00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:19.470
and is that the only way he can wrestle rec,

422
00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:25.130
Quentin in some fashion is to resurrect him by the way of DLCs and her ability

423
00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:32.490
to make,
do with time to come to terms of time to come to the toes,

424
00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:37.760
both with a defective presence and in coming to terms of a defective present to

425
00:29:38.881 --> 00:29:41.010
live onto the field show.
Um,

426
00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:45.920
so we can by way of those and we can start thinking about the arm pulling

427
00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:50.380
concept of tomorrow and it has to do with the tomorrow of race.

428
00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.550
So we know first of all,

429
00:29:51.551 --> 00:29:55.870
the importance of the kitchen and what takes place in the kitchen.
Um,

430
00:29:55.900 --> 00:30:00.190
we also know in the rest of the section that is another place that is as

431
00:30:00.191 --> 00:30:03.790
important as the occasion.
And that is the black church,
right?

432
00:30:03.791 --> 00:30:08.791
So these are the two emblematic locales where there could be you tomorrow.

433
00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:13.690
Um,
and where there could be an interesting development to that Pronoun.

434
00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:17.120
Third Person Thorough.
Um,
and we'll,

435
00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:19.150
we'll see that in the church.

436
00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:23.560
I'm the central figure in that church is the preacher or the reference shake out

437
00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:27.370
and we'll see what he does.
Um,
and we know that this is Easter Sunday,

438
00:30:27.371 --> 00:30:29.710
so this is the restaurant restoration or something.

439
00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:34.770
And we'll finally talk about the possibility of that Utopian ideal across ratio.

440
00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:40.060
We,
but first of all,
this,
um,
is the church,
um,
the uh,

441
00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:45.100
Christian Methodist Episcopal church in Oxford,

442
00:30:45.101 --> 00:30:49.860
Mississippi.
Um,
and,
uh,
as a historic church.
And,
um,

443
00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.480
I want to bring to you attention,
um,

444
00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:57.400
a figure who's written eloquently about the black church and that is,
uh,

445
00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:00.790
someone you might have read in another class.
Um,

446
00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:03.380
W E B Dubois.
Um,

447
00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:07.420
he was a very important author.
Uh,
he also,
uh,

448
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:12.250
as they studied sociology,
so he wrote the book 1903 vogue,
um,

449
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:16.660
called the Negro church,
basically a sociological report,

450
00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:21.400
a bit based on lots of field work about,
uh,
black churches in the south.

451
00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:25.480
Um,
most of us probably haven't read to need church,

452
00:31:25.481 --> 00:31:28.750
only police only specialists would be reading that book.

453
00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.090
But there's another book by Dubois,
um,

454
00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:36.210
that I bet a lot of you have read or heard of the souls of black folk also

455
00:31:36.461 --> 00:31:41.461
coming out in 1903 and because he was doing the sociological fieldwork work in

456
00:31:41.471 --> 00:31:44.710
the same time,
if he was writing this book,
and not surprisingly,

457
00:31:44.711 --> 00:31:49.240
he had a lot to say about the black church as a whole chapter called the phase

458
00:31:49.241 --> 00:31:53.020
of our fathers in which he talks at length about the black church.

459
00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:58.170
And this is what he says,
three things,
Karen,

460
00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:01.330
that any links to the black church back to the religion of the slaves.

461
00:32:01.331 --> 00:32:06.331
So this is another way Englishness the legacy of slavery in the central pality

462
00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:11.680
of the black church.
Three things characterized the religion as a slave,

463
00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:15.520
the preacher,
the music,
and the frenzy.

464
00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:21.600
The preacher is the most unique personality developed by the new grow on the

465
00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:25.660
American soil,
the leader,

466
00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:28.270
a politician and Ra,

467
00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:32.400
a Abbas and intriguer and idealists.

468
00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:37.000
All these hears and error to the center of a group of men.

469
00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:41.260
Now 20 now with thousand in number,
um,

470
00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:46.130
two boys account with the preacher is really interesting because this creature

471
00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:51.550
is both someone who's a conveyor of a form of Christianity or from spirituality.

472
00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:58.100
Um,
but divorce also see is that he is more than that.

473
00:32:58.101 --> 00:33:02.420
He's part of the politician.
Um,
he's um,
an orator,

474
00:33:02.421 --> 00:33:06.530
he has to be very good at what he's doing.
He's a boss to some extent.

475
00:33:06.531 --> 00:33:10.480
So they all taught this other non spiritual dimensions,
um,

476
00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:15.200
attached to the preacher.
Um,
and that is indeed the case,
uh,

477
00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:17.500
because the black church,
even though,
um,

478
00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:22.430
the church like this seems very local because it's part of the Methodist church.

479
00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:25.040
Um,
the local Methodist church,

480
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:28.700
Ashley been lost to the National Denomination,
right?

481
00:33:28.701 --> 00:33:33.290
Methodist church is a national denomination and quite often preachers would

482
00:33:33.291 --> 00:33:37.040
actually go from one city to another.
Uh,

483
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:42.190
depression is not always stationed at one place and that turns out to be the

484
00:33:43.161 --> 00:33:47.160
case with the reference got in the of,

485
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:52.300
this is the background to why this preacher is actually wrong all the way from

486
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:55.490
[inaudible].
He's not a local preacher.

487
00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:59.090
His broad end fully used to Sunday service,

488
00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:03.650
especially from Saint Louis.
And so there's something,
both are is special,

489
00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:08.980
but potentially alien about him and fog node begins.

490
00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:13.890
Atley.
Uh,
he gives us,
once again is once again,
uh,

491
00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:19.570
to plot a portrait of the reference Shagan um,

492
00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:24.980
uh,
to poplar tree that is based on a reversal.
As with they'll say,

493
00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:28.550
uh,
we see an external view of the reference check God,

494
00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:32.960
and then we'll see a much more interior Xeo of the reference shave up.

495
00:34:32.961 --> 00:34:37.961
But this is the external view looking at him strictly from the standpoint of a

496
00:34:38.841 --> 00:34:43.841
small town black church looking at this supposedly very important and visitor

497
00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:47.910
coming from Saint Louis,
the visitor,

498
00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:52.920
it was undersized in a shatty of Parker Code.

499
00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:58.220
He had little Lisen black face,
like a small Asian monkey

500
00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:03.620
with a visitor rose to speak.
He sounded like a white man.

501
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:09.190
His boys was level and call it side too big for him to have come from him.

502
00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:13.640
And they listen at first through curiosity.

503
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:16.760
As they worked half to a monkey talking,

504
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:21.410
they began to watch him as they weren't in there on a tight rope.

505
00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:26.380
Um,
so this is very much an external view of what the reference Shaker and is

506
00:35:26.381 --> 00:35:28.360
another sympathy.
Phew.
Um,

507
00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:33.400
he's someone that the congregation to the black local church was highly

508
00:35:34.941 --> 00:35:35.750
suspicious of.

509
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:40.080
And in fact they were very disappointed in him that he had come all the way from

510
00:35:40.081 --> 00:35:42.480
Santa Louis in broadly is unexpressed firms in the world.

511
00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.670
And it turns out that he's much,

512
00:35:44.671 --> 00:35:48.390
much less impressive looking than the own preacher,
um,

513
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:53.340
whom they would see every week.
Um,
so it was a terrible as a woman,

514
00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:57.510
uh,
for them to look at this monkey like,
um,

515
00:35:57.570 --> 00:36:01.710
tiny a clownish figure.
Um,

516
00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:05.430
and even when he's trust peaking,
he's still are putting,

517
00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:10.580
they're not warming up to him right away because he sounds like white men.

518
00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.840
This is a very peculiar,
um,

519
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:17.270
detail and thoughtfulness and there's no other way of accounting for it.

520
00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:17.821
Other than that,

521
00:36:17.821 --> 00:36:22.821
he was really thinking of the preacher as two boys were that this is not just a

522
00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:26.760
review.
He's not just a representative or some kind of spirituality,

523
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:30.990
but then he's also an operator and a politician.
Um,

524
00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:35.430
and speaking like black men is possibly,
um,

525
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:38.430
a sign that he operates in that mode.

526
00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:42.150
But we get a reversal.

527
00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:46.960
We get a switch to a totally different view of the Reverend Shaker.

528
00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:50.490
And let's just say that this external view of the revenue she got real.

529
00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:53.520
It has to do with looking at him as an inert object,

530
00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:57.130
this impersonal objective gaze directed at him and he,

531
00:36:57.190 --> 00:37:01.080
they looked like a gay if you just look at him as a single individual.

532
00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:05.280
So from that alienating perspective,

533
00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:09.710
we now turn to another look at him,
um,

534
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:14.750
which is not as a single individual but as a communal for us.

535
00:37:15.111 --> 00:37:19.590
So this is the two pose,
um,
that Faulkner,
um,

536
00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:24.830
tries to negotiate by way of the reference a shaker that he could be looked at

537
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:27.540
just as a single individual.

538
00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:31.540
This big shot preacher from send the worst Orum keep up.

539
00:37:31.541 --> 00:37:36.310
He feels with the community as a voice speaking for them.
Um,

540
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:40.750
and he takes on a completely different set of holidays when he's standing that

541
00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:45.760
live fused with the community and the congregation seem to watch with his own

542
00:37:46.981 --> 00:37:47.814
eyes.

543
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:53.000
One of voice consumed him until he was nothing and they were nothing and there

544
00:37:55.411 --> 00:37:57.150
was not even the voice.

545
00:37:57.570 --> 00:38:02.460
But instead the highest we're speaking to one another in chanting measures

546
00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:04.320
beyond the need for worse.

547
00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:08.400
So then when he came to rest again is to reading desk,

548
00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:13.640
his monkey face lifted and there's cold attitude that of Assouline torture,

549
00:38:14.971 --> 00:38:19.971
the crucifix to transcend into shabbiness and insignificance and men have no

550
00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:26.120
moment long moaning expulsion of Braf roasts from them and the women's and

551
00:38:28.171 --> 00:38:32.820
girl's soprano.
Yes,
Jesus.
Um,

552
00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:38.240
we beginning to figure out why the external of jackify ions you have the black

553
00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:44.390
headers is so the liberally thing meaning is so deliberately hostile to them

554
00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:51.690
because Fargo in fat once to suggest that in most people if you just look at

555
00:38:53.951 --> 00:38:54.784
them,

556
00:38:55.060 --> 00:39:00.060
they're really nothing to write on about and feel very sad looking specimens of

557
00:39:01.121 --> 00:39:05.710
humanity.
But the most important thing is that this,

558
00:39:05.711 --> 00:39:10.711
that looking specimens of humanity can be transformed under the proper

559
00:39:11.951 --> 00:39:16.200
circumstances and listening to the voice,
in this case,

560
00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:21.280
listening to the Voice of the referential Edgar in conjunction with the voice of

561
00:39:22.811 --> 00:39:24.160
the black congregation.

562
00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:29.730
That is one circumstance when we completely forget to in significant fiscal

563
00:39:30.851 --> 00:39:35.800
appearance of this math and we just wages w here becomes nothing.

564
00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:38.530
The congregation becomes nothing.
And that's a good thing.

565
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:40.060
When they become nothing,

566
00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:45.210
that what really does register is that voice at what that voice is able to do

567
00:39:45.761 --> 00:39:46.930
for the congregation.

568
00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:52.560
So this is no without question at the moment of epiphany and the sound of fury

569
00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:57.430
and it's by way of this initially Julius looking creature,

570
00:39:57.510 --> 00:40:02.510
a creature put on Ashley transcends that and is able in fact to do what it's

571
00:40:03.881 --> 00:40:06.580
supposed to be done,
uh,
on Easter Sunday,

572
00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:11.020
which is to bring about some kind of resurrection.
Um,

573
00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:15.850
so this is,
um,
um,
what,
um,

574
00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:18.560
we're already beginning to see happen.
Uh,

575
00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:23.610
we've already seen low bit of it and they'll say is relation to the clock and

576
00:40:24.471 --> 00:40:25.300
her kitchen.

577
00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:30.230
And now we see something else that also happens in the kitchen.
Um,

578
00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:34.950
and is the other black,
the luster and Benji,

579
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.540
uh,
in the kitchen,
um,
the session for Benji comes back in the big way.

580
00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:44.560
So in many ways this is Benji almost incorporated into the black community.

581
00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:49.580
Um,
we've measured earlier that we look,
uh,

582
00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:52.090
that the way in which he and luster,
uh,

583
00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:55.510
constantly on a unit and luster livechat other.
Um,

584
00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:59.110
and here we once again see Benji,
uh,

585
00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:02.500
as lusters significant other and the other way around as well.

586
00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:07.770
Luster of phenom with skill and from now and then his attention.

587
00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:13.650
We're return law enough to enable him to find a spoon and cause Ben to close his

588
00:41:14.231 --> 00:41:15.910
mouth.
Ponding empty air.

589
00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:19.840
But there was a parent in the lusters mind elsewhere,

590
00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:25.440
his other hand lay on the back of the chair and upon that their service it move

591
00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:31.620
tentatively delicately as if he were picking and an audible tune out of the den

592
00:41:34.221 --> 00:41:35.054
Floyd.

593
00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:40.480
And once he even forgot to take spin with a spoon and why his fingers tease out

594
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:46.510
the disclaimer with the sounders and involve a pair g or until Ben recalled him

595
00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:50.120
by women praying.
Again,

596
00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:55.940
I'm fairly on detail about luster.

597
00:41:56.620 --> 00:42:01.620
Luster doesn't play any musical instrument at law.

598
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:07.990
Fog node is counter factually representing him as picking and in all of over

599
00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:15.410
two.
And not only is it an olive oil too,

600
00:42:15.411 --> 00:42:20.300
and not only has must have become a decision in this moment,

601
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:25.670
but his way a special kind of music and of head Yael.

602
00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:26.150
Okay.

603
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:31.150
So while there's an individual is a special musical technique,

604
00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:32.450
um,

605
00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:37.010
the call not the way not being played in unison,

606
00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:40.550
but the lady in sequence,
usually the court will be played together,

607
00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:45.020
but the patio is one in which you played a court in sequence one at a time.

608
00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:47.870
So another way,
um,
and other,

609
00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:53.320
the English translation for the Italian with a measure is actually a broken

610
00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:59.180
chord.
Um,
and this is actually the kind of music that,
uh,

611
00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:00.260
that,
that,

612
00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:05.320
that lost her place is that slavery and the legacy of slavery is that broken

613
00:43:07.491 --> 00:43:12.380
chord.
The listening,
not the most harmonious kind of music.
Um,

614
00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:13.490
but as we know,
this,

615
00:43:13.491 --> 00:43:17.870
the shoe with actually has a great piece on the [inaudible] only.

616
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:20.710
So now there was a wonderful piece of music,
um,

617
00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:25.610
and as one of the most famous signature pieces by she would,
um,
but,
um,

618
00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:29.840
this is,
um,
lost days from pipe playing that,
uh,

619
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:33.140
but here's the pairs you is interesting.

620
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:37.400
And in that farmers turning this,
uh,
you know,

621
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:42.200
not very well school black character into a train the session.

622
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:47.230
So this is the reconstitution of unknowable community based on a special kind of

623
00:43:50.121 --> 00:43:54.620
knowledge.
And we know that luster,
Ashley doesn't know something,
right?

624
00:43:54.621 --> 00:43:56.780
He knows something.
That's why he's cancer minded.

625
00:43:57.170 --> 00:44:01.940
His mind is fixated on something else,
something that only he knows.

626
00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:04.300
So let's go back,
um,

627
00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:09.310
to what it is that lost a knows that makes him so absent minded at this moment.

628
00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:13.960
This is the second,
uh,

629
00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:18.960
reference back to an earlier moment in an earlier section.

630
00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:23.150
This is actually the very ending the veggie section.
So that one,
this restaurant,

631
00:44:23.151 --> 00:44:27.930
that as well,
and the absent mindedness of,
of,
of,
of,
of flustered.

632
00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:32.040
Um,
same configuration luster and then Jay,

633
00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:36.870
he put my Gal on I hush and the luster stop his head too.

634
00:44:36.871 --> 00:44:40.080
What the window that he went to the window and looked out.

635
00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:45.390
He came back and took my arm.
He or she come,
he said,
be quiet now.

636
00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:47.790
We went to the window and looked out.

637
00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:52.830
He came out with his window and climb across into the tree.

638
00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:56.790
We watched the tree shaking,
the shaking when down the tree.

639
00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:02.270
Then he came out and we watched it go across the grass.
Then we couldn't see it.

640
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:06.600
Benji's totally clueless at this moment.

641
00:45:07.110 --> 00:45:12.110
That's the is really knowledgeable about what exactly is coming out of plantains

642
00:45:13.411 --> 00:45:17.400
window so that when we do find out in session four,

643
00:45:17.401 --> 00:45:19.750
the Quentin has run away there.

644
00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:24.120
She's taken our Doosans money with her initial glance away.

645
00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:29.930
That is all news to those to his known all through the novel starting from

646
00:45:31.321 --> 00:45:33.510
session one,
he already,

647
00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:38.690
that bit of knowledge is in his possession so this is the reconstitution of the

648
00:45:40.201 --> 00:45:45.201
knowable community for luster is that he is familiar.

649
00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:48.450
Quentin is is familiar.

650
00:45:48.451 --> 00:45:53.250
He knows her well enough to know that this is something that she might do.
Um,

651
00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:58.050
and it has bad reconstitution of the knowable community that once again,

652
00:45:58.380 --> 00:45:58.891
Russell,

653
00:45:58.891 --> 00:46:03.840
Greg's this previous moment from Benji and allows her to take on a new life.

654
00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:09.380
So since we're really looking at the structural to wrestle rector earlier

655
00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:15.240
moments in section four of the sound of the fury,

656
00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:19.890
less look at the resurrection of one other thing.
And not surprisingly,

657
00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:24.150
it is the third brother who would get resurrected in that moment.

658
00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:29.750
And this has to do with a landmark and ask her,

659
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.530
which is the courthouse square.

660
00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:37.040
And we know that luster and Benji and habit of going out for a ride with

661
00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:44.010
Queenie,
the horse.
Um,
but in this case,

662
00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:44.761
in,

663
00:46:44.761 --> 00:46:48.030
at the very end of the sound of the fury in something seems to be going wrong.

664
00:46:48.450 --> 00:46:51.300
Um,
luster and Benji go on,

665
00:46:51.301 --> 00:46:55.980
arrived poly every day and nothing especially happened.

666
00:46:56.040 --> 00:47:00.930
Um,
you know,
it was just peaceful,
right?
But on this one occasion,

667
00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:06.540
some things seems to be going wrong and Benji is bellowing without stop on this,

668
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:12.120
right?
Some things seems to be going wrong.

669
00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:15.960
Luster for all.

670
00:47:15.961 --> 00:47:20.961
His knowledge of what Quentin does is actually incapable of controlling the

671
00:47:22.021 --> 00:47:25.380
situation,
is unable to stop.

672
00:47:25.381 --> 00:47:30.381
Benji from bellowing inadequately takes Jason's intervention to stop the

673
00:47:33.041 --> 00:47:34.870
bellowing of engine.

674
00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:39.900
So let's look at what it is that Jason is able to do with a bad hand tableau

675
00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:47.520
keyhole luster Osi and hold the reins and saw Quinny about and double the reins

676
00:47:49.061 --> 00:47:51.530
back and SculpSure across the hips.

677
00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:56.880
He cover again and again until plunging Gallup while bands course agony wrote

678
00:47:58.751 --> 00:48:03.751
about them and so on her about the rate of the mining and the his struck luster

679
00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:05.380
over the head with this,

680
00:48:05.381 --> 00:48:08.770
please don't you know better than to take him to the left.

681
00:48:08.771 --> 00:48:13.570
He said he reached back and struck Ben Breaking the flower stock again.

682
00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:18.730
Queenie moved again for fear began to club clubs.
They'll only again,

683
00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:21.970
and that one's been hush

684
00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:26.730
last to look quickly back over his shoulder.

685
00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:32.010
Then he drove on the broken flower drooped over Ben's fest and his eyes were

686
00:48:32.681 --> 00:48:34.550
empty and blue and as really,

687
00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:39.130
and again as corners and facade flow smoothly,

688
00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:43.120
once more from left to right person,

689
00:48:43.121 --> 00:48:48.121
tree window and doorway and sideboard each in it's ordered.

690
00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:55.320
So that was what went wrong initially with the rye is that luster for some

691
00:48:57.341 --> 00:49:02.320
reason have forgotten that they're supposed to go to the weight of the

692
00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:06.430
[inaudible],
he makes clinic or to the left.

693
00:49:06.431 --> 00:49:09.310
And so everything is happening in the long order.

694
00:49:09.850 --> 00:49:14.850
And because Benji cannot stand anything happening in the water,

695
00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:18.040
nothing will stand in front of Valerie.

696
00:49:18.550 --> 00:49:23.110
So this is a very interesting moment where from that has granted until last
year,

697
00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:26.230
a lot of knowledge in Noah's Quintlin very well.

698
00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:28.420
But for some reason he doesn't know Benji.

699
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:33.630
And this one occasion it takes Jason Ashley to demonstrate his knowledge of this

700
00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:38.710
homes rather than,
he doesn't laugh Benji,
but he knows Benji's very well.

701
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:43.240
He knows that it would have to be to have the weight of the monitor and is able

702
00:49:43.241 --> 00:49:44.590
to correct that mistake.

703
00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:49.920
So after always seeing Jesus terrible parliaments or the automobile at the very

704
00:49:52.031 --> 00:49:57.031
end of the sound of the theory follows evil to resurrect Jason to budge.

705
00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:02.980
Happier faith automobile is gone,

706
00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:06.550
is back to the world of the causes and carriages,

707
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:10.630
a 19th century world still lingering on.

708
00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:15.190
And to some extent the comedy,
the carbonate,
Jason,

709
00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:18.880
even in the 20th century is not a pretty sight,

710
00:50:18.881 --> 00:50:23.770
is not a nonviolent,
well,
days are still heading.

711
00:50:23.830 --> 00:50:26.800
Last term,
hips,
bricking,
bands,
flour.

712
00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:31.580
So none of the obnoxious things about James has gone away.

713
00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:35.090
He hasn't turned into a sweet person.
He still monster.

714
00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:36.780
But why?

715
00:50:36.790 --> 00:50:41.790
He remains monster of this made his world one that he can listen and that he can

716
00:50:43.461 --> 00:50:46.190
be a herald of sauce in Israeli.
One brief moment,

717
00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:51.220
he can be the person who comes to the rescue and sent everything back onto the

718
00:50:51.891 --> 00:50:53.120
right track.
There are like,

719
00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:58.100
so this is the way in which the [inaudible] off the sound and the fury is in

720
00:50:58.101 --> 00:51:01.940
fact an Easter Sunday story about resurrection.
