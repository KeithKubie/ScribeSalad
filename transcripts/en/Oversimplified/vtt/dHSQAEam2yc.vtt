00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:07.640
The world of 1914. A time of modern technology, culture, and fashion.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.900
Truly the height of civilization.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.480
Let's have a war.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.440
Everyone knew a big war was coming.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.380
France wanted some stuff back that Germany had taken from it,

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.600
Germany wanted to take more of EVERYONE'S stuff,

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.480
and they're building a big sexy navy that was making the British uncomfortable.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.600
These two empires thought they're really cool.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.600
But lots of different people who live there didn't think it was so cool.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.780
And some of them had even been declaring independence,

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:30.920
with help from Russia.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.860
Everyone was talking about each other behind each other's backs.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.820
Throw in the fact that military 
 technology had come a long way since the last major war,

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.260
and suddenly everyone was pretty eager to beat each other up.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.940
In this area of Austria-Hungary lived some Serbs and Bosnians who hated living in Austria-Hungary.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.840
So the Austro-Hungarian Archduke Franz Ferdinand goes there for a nice drive in an open-top car,

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.840
with his car's route published in advance.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.480
And that went just about as well as you'd expect.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.800
Some assassins were waiting for him along the way and threw bombs at his car,

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.020
but they missed and blew up some officers behind him, instead.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.300
So, the Archduke goes into hiding, leaves Sarajevo and whole war never happens.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.300
Except no. The Archduke doesn't leave,

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.020
but instead goes back out in the open top car, to visit the injured officers in hospital.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.360
The driver takes a wrong turn and by sheer coincidence gets stuck besides one of the failed assassins.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.100
Who shoots him.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.320
Austria-Hungary is understandably pissed about all this,

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.920
and they think the Serbian government had something to do with it (which they might have).

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.320
So they go to their ally Germany and say:

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.600
"Hey Germany, we're gonna declare war on Serbia!",

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.140
and Germany is all for that.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.800
So Austria-Hungary sends a big list of impossible demands to Serbia

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.200
and when Serbia refuses, they declare war.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.120
Austria-Hungary and Germany are friends and Serbia is protected by Russia,

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.180
who's friends with France, so they all declare war on each other.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.960
Montenegro joins in, too.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.200
France and Britain also have a kind of alliance.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.800
So, when France says: "Hey, Britain you got my back?", Britain is like:

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.840
"Maybe...?",

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.840
and then they decide to stay out of it.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.800
Which is great for Germany because Germany has a plan:

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.760
They know that Russia is so big and clumsy that it will take them all to get ready for war.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.360
So with this guy in charge Germany will send all its troops into France at Lightning speed while Russia is getting ready.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.660
Defeat France then move all the troops to Russia and defeat Russia. Then we all speak German and eat Pfefferpotthast every day.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.380
Just one problem:

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.540
France has loads of forts and defences along its German border.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.920
And Germany can't waste any time fighting them so Germany decides to go around them.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.940
Through Belgium.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.940
Belgium is neutral but Germany wants to march 750 thousand troops through it to get around France's defenses.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.040
They're hoping Belgium will just kind of sit down and shut up.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.540
But they don't. They fight back, and they're pretty good, too, so they slow the Germans down.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.040
What's worse is that Britain shows up. And they're pretty pissed that Germany is invading neutral countries.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.160
So now Britain declares war on Germany.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:00.160
So Germany push on through Belgium and commit some atrocities along the way. They also wear spikes and sometimes skulls on the uniform.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.260
So, if you're trying to not look like the bad guys:

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.940
Good job.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.340
The allies have a propaganda extravaganda and this starts having an influence around the world, notably in America.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.380
The US President Woodrow Wilson sees himself as a bit of a Jesus figure

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.260
and spends most of the war trying to get everyone to just hug it out.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.680
But there's also a large population of ethnic Germans living in the United States and when the war first broke out

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.300
they were like: "Yay, Germany!!" But now that they are committing atrocities in Belgium

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.740
they are less enthusiastic.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.880
Let's play: Spot the French soldier!

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.460
Did you see him? Easy right? He's wearing a bright blue uniform with red trousers

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.720
and do you know who else spotted him easily, too?

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.060
The Germans.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.900
So, when the French were slowly marching in columns to the countryside

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.200
the Germans easily tore them to shreds with their giant guns.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.900
All the nations involved in this war went in with an old-school war mentality.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.420
And all of them had to update the uniforms and tactics a lot during the great war.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.600
Because this war was going to be like nothing anyone had ever seen before.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.360
Russia is ready for war and way earlier than expected.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.440
"Hey, Austria-Hungary, can you get on top of that?"

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.960
"Oh? Yeah, sure! We've got this."

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:08.700
nope.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.380
So, Germany has to send some troops back to the east to defend against the Russians.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.400
The chief of staff of the Austro-Hungarian army is this guy. And although he is handsome,

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.060
He turns out not to be the best military strategist.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.680
Austria-Hungary constantly ignores Germany's advice,

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.000
...and then comes running back to Germany whenever they get in trouble.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.900
Austria-Hungary even gets its ass kicked by tiny Serbia who repels all their invasion attempts at the start of the war.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.060
It's better news for Germany in the North, though, where they almost

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.380
completely wipe out the Russians second army.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.060
Back on the western front, the Germans

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.360
continue advancing and are in sight of Paris.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.240
At this point anyone would be forgiven for thinking the Germans were going to get that quick victory after all.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.180
But then things start to go wrong. The French commander-in-chief knew something had to be done.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.720
And he ordered his armies to stop retreating.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.760
In the resulting battle, a gap opened up in the German lines.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.720
If a gap opens up, the enemy can use it to flank you from the side and behind.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.680
So the German armies have to retreat.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.120
The Allies launch a counter-attack, so the Germans dig into defensive positions. The Allies do the same.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.380
Then both sides move north trying to outflank each other along the way. When they reach the sea,

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.640
They're in a stalemate with trench systems running the whole way from the coast to Switzerland.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.160
The beginning of trench-warfare on the Western front.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.140
Here's, how trench warfare works:

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.580
Two opposing lines of trenches with No-man's land in between.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.580
One side would pummel the other with hundreds of thousands of artillery shells, sometimes for days at a time.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.880
This had a huge psychological effect on the soldiers leaving many shell-shocked.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.920
Then, the attacking troops would leave their trenches and rush across no-man's land,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.260
A muddy wet mess of shell craters and barbed wire.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.640
The defending trench would unleash machine-gun fire on the attackers inflicting thousands of casualties.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:50.300
The attackers would send wave after wave until either they gave up or the opposing trench was finally overrun.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:55.420
There would be months of fighting and the deaths of thousands in order to gain a few meters or kilometers of land.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.100
Living in the trenches was hard work, too. Corpses, mud that could swallow you whole,

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.220
pools of poisonous water, rats,

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.060
disease, the smell...

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.720
It's insane that millions of soldiers put up with these conditions and commanders ordered them to do so for years.
