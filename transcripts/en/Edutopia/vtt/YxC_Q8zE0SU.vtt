00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:09.790
- I appreciate y'all coming
and have a conversation.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.690
- There's a lot we do within the building

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.140
to create spaces that are
conducive for de-escalation.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.600
Kids are able to remove themselves

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.560
from a negative situation,

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.200
process what has caused the crisis,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.020
and make different choices
about how to move forward.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.260
- Sometimes it's not the
easiest thing in the world

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.380
to tell a kid, "I know all
this is happening to you.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.430
"I know all of this is going on,

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.530
"but I want you to learn."

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.680
And so we are giving them a space

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.880
and a context to process
some of that emotion,

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.610
to de-escalate, and then
transition back to class.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.490
- Many of our classrooms

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.320
have what we call de-escalation spaces,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.120
so they'll be a bean bag in the corner

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.639
or a curtain that allows you to step away.

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:56.879
Just something that creates
a little bit of separation

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.370
for kids that the teacher
recognizes need that

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.620
or the student.

00:01:01.957 --> 00:01:03.800
- [Woman] Here she comes.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.800
- [Tanzye] Hi how are you?

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.110
- [Mary] I'm decent.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.999
- Students come to me, I greet them,

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:11.265
and then I just give them alone time.

00:01:11.265 --> 00:01:14.400
Because I don't associate
the space necessarily

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.890
with academics, it's easier
for them to utilize it

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.110
outside of the classroom and
recognize it as a safe space.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.301
For myself when my emotions are high,

00:01:25.301 --> 00:01:30.301
it's best to calm down before
I begin to try to communicate.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.690
- It's giving us a time to
cool down, do the coloring.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.240
It gives me opportunity
to be like, "Okay yeah,

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.820
"take in this breath.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.850
"I can talk now without trying to cry."

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.120
Just letting us do that makes it better.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.100
- [Tanzye] So then they'll begin to share

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.160
and open up about what's bothering them.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.080
How was that?

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.340
- It wasn't good.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.320
- [Tanzye] We really try to teach our kids

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.940
how to be resilient, how
to utilize resources,

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.350
and take care of themselves.

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:01.640
We have another space where
our counselor's located.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.122
- All right, so you're gonna talk first.

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:05.490
And when he get done,
you're gonna talk, okay?

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.240
- [Tanzye] Who does real
time conflict resolution.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.050
- I didn't wanna tell
you who to hang with.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.850
- [Tanzye] We can't expect
people to just get along,

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.350
we have to show them what
getting along looks like.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.900
- You have an issue with a teacher,

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.761
with another student, they come to my room

00:02:17.761 --> 00:02:20.700
and we have a conversation
like, "Hey, what happened?"

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.000
Today I had two students.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.940
They've been friends for
about two or three years.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.081
They had a big old fight with another boy.

00:02:26.081 --> 00:02:28.561
We stopped 'em outside,
and we brought 'em in.

00:02:28.561 --> 00:02:30.681
Both are strong young men.

00:02:30.681 --> 00:02:34.240
- What is going to happen,
is knowing how I contributed

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.810
to the conflict, right?

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.210
And how to respond to you with empathy.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.150
- I wasn't solving it out the right way.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.710
I should've communicated better.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.880
- We come to the table and
say, "Hey, it aint about you.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.780
"It's about respect each other."

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.270
Y'all go ahead and go back
to class, and that's it.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.100
Anything happen, I'm
come back here, alright?

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.620
- We took it upon ourself
to go have a conversation

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.950
with the other gentlemen that was arguing,

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.250
and then that's when we
got everything solved.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.860
- When we have de-escalation spaces

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.840
where we're teaching them
to manage themselves,

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.363
then we make it so they
can be successful anywhere.

00:03:08.363 --> 00:03:10.260
Saying just power through

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.803
or white knuckle through
something, is not a strategy.

00:03:12.803 --> 00:03:16.010
When you say, "I see you, I recognize you,

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.820
"and I'm gonna teach you
how to take that moment

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.070
"to walk away, recenter,

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.595
"and come back and do
what you need to do."

00:03:20.595 --> 00:03:23.280
That's actually teaching
resilience and (mumbles).

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.690
- When I just feel like I'm
not doing something right,

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:27.940
and I just need a moment.
