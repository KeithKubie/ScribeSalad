00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Here we have the simple pulley--it's called a simple pulley because the rope goes from the rock

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
wounds over the pulley and right into the person's hand.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
There's only one, let's call it connection point to the rock.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
If we want to draw a force diagram for this rock as we are lifting,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
we have the weight going downwards and that will be balanced by the tension, label T in the rope.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Remember in a rope, the tension is constant throughout.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So, what do you think what causes the tension in the rope? And this is a sort of subtle question.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
There's a lot of things you could say or contributing tension in this rope.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
But I want to know of these three options, what is the best answer?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Is the weight of this person, is it how hard this person is pulling,

00:00:39.000 --> 99:59:59.000
or is it the normal force on the rock? Choose the best answer.
