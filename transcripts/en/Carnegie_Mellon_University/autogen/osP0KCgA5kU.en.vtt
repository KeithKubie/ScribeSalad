data and utilities and when we started

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700
data and utilities and when we started
 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.280
data and utilities and when we started
to conceptualize this I think one of the

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290
to conceptualize this I think one of the
 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.590
to conceptualize this I think one of the
things that really became one of the

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600
things that really became one of the
 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.420
things that really became one of the
hallmarks of the conversation was the

hallmarks of the conversation was the
 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.070
hallmarks of the conversation was the
need for partnerships and the need for

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080
need for partnerships and the need for
 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.800
need for partnerships and the need for
dialogue and as I just you know kind of

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810
dialogue and as I just you know kind of

between cities and utilities and
 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.390
between cities and utilities and
universities and and and the reason I

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400
universities and and and the reason I
 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.010
universities and and and the reason I
think is because there's there's big

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020

kind of a stake in the game for us and
 

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.190
kind of a stake in the game for us and
we now start thinking about data and how

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:07.200
we now start thinking about data and how
 

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.930
we now start thinking about data and how
you know that this kind of collaboration

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:08.940
you know that this kind of collaboration
 

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.400
you know that this kind of collaboration
around data comes together I know

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:10.410
around data comes together I know

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:30.680
pushing out an amazing amount of data
that again we have really no idea what

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:30.690
that again we have really no idea what
 

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:32.900
that again we have really no idea what
to do with but what everyone cares in

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:32.910
to do with but what everyone cares in

and so all this data is turned into just

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:44.130
and so all this data is turned into just
 

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:47.090
and so all this data is turned into just
a really interesting set of tools that

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:47.100
a really interesting set of tools that
 

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.189

want reliability we want efficiency or
 

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:20.960
want reliability we want efficiency or
affordability and we want to improve

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:20.970
affordability and we want to improve
 

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:23.330
affordability and we want to improve
sustainability so those are the three

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:23.340
sustainability so those are the three
 

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:26.090
sustainability so those are the three
areas that are driving a lot of the need

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:26.100
areas that are driving a lot of the need
 

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:29.900
areas that are driving a lot of the need
to collaborate and to use this data in a

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:29.910
to collaborate and to use this data in a
 

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:32.600
to collaborate and to use this data in a
very useful way right now the data is

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:32.610
very useful way right now the data is
 

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:34.700
very useful way right now the data is
very unstructured we get reams of data

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:34.710
very unstructured we get reams of data
 

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:37.790
very unstructured we get reams of data
as a utility but we don't structure that

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:37.800
as a utility but we don't structure that
 

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.100
as a utility but we don't structure that
data I haven't even spoken about

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:40.110
data I haven't even spoken about
 

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:42.080
data I haven't even spoken about
monitors and sensors that are throughout

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:42.090
monitors and sensors that are throughout

monitors and sensors that are throughout
the utility system as we begin to

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:44.490
the utility system as we begin to
 

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:46.190
the utility system as we begin to
convert our substation so those

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:46.200
convert our substation so those
 

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.290
convert our substation so those
substations are much smarter more

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:48.300
substations are much smarter more
 

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:51.770
substations are much smarter more
analytic and more data-driven so we're

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:51.780
analytic and more data-driven so we're
 

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:54.020
analytic and more data-driven so we're
moving into a society where technology

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:54.030
moving into a society where technology
 

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:56.630
moving into a society where technology
is producing data and we need to have a

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:56.640
is producing data and we need to have a
 

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.580
is producing data and we need to have a
way that we are able to structure that

00:11:58.580 --> 00:11:58.590
way that we are able to structure that
 

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:01.610
way that we are able to structure that
data and make that data much more useful

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:01.620
data and make that data much more useful
 

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:06.710
data and make that data much more useful
that's why collaboration is essential so

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720
that's why collaboration is essential so
 

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.030
that's why collaboration is essential so
I'll approach it a little bit

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:08.040
I'll approach it a little bit
 

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.940
I'll approach it a little bit
differently being a privately held

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:10.950
differently being a privately held

return on our investment and I think you
 

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:17.600
return on our investment and I think you
know we have to overcome some of the

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:17.610
know we have to overcome some of the
 

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:18.860
know we have to overcome some of the
business challenges and how did we

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:18.870
business challenges and how did we
 

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.810
business challenges and how did we
develop a sustainable model at the end

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:20.820
develop a sustainable model at the end

of the day I think you know this unique

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:23.310
of the day I think you know this unique
 

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:25.070
of the day I think you know this unique
time that we live in and these

are one being driven by a common vision
 

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:32.150
are one being driven by a common vision
right that vision that we have to work

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160
right that vision that we have to work
 

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.280
right that vision that we have to work
and live much more sustainably than we

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:34.290
and live much more sustainably than we
 

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:36.710
and live much more sustainably than we
have have in the past - I think you

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:36.720
have have in the past - I think you

speakers talk about the g2 accelerate

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:42.210
speakers talk about the g2 accelerate
 

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:45.380
speakers talk about the g2 accelerate
this we have some inertia ahead of us

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:45.390
this we have some inertia ahead of us
 

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.850
this we have some inertia ahead of us
because the economics aren't always

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:46.860
because the economics aren't always
 

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.770
because the economics aren't always
there so how do you overcome that

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:48.780
there so how do you overcome that
 

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:51.620
there so how do you overcome that
inertia the unique partnerships that

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:51.630
inertia the unique partnerships that

we're talking about I think afford us

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:53.310
we're talking about I think afford us
 

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:55.160
we're talking about I think afford us
the opportunity to do that so as we

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:55.170
the opportunity to do that so as we
 

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:58.130
the opportunity to do that so as we
think about smart cities we think that

00:12:58.130 --> 00:12:58.140
think about smart cities we think that
 

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:00.470
think about smart cities we think that
they're underpinned by three pillars the

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:00.480
they're underpinned by three pillars the
 

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.910
they're underpinned by three pillars the
first pillar is you have to cost

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920
first pillar is you have to cost
 

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.920
first pillar is you have to cost
effectively deploy all the sensors that

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:03.930
effectively deploy all the sensors that
 

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:05.329
effectively deploy all the sensors that
are out in the field to gather that data

00:13:05.329 --> 00:13:05.339
are out in the field to gather that data
 

00:13:05.339 --> 00:13:07.579
are out in the field to gather that data
the second pillar then is you have to

00:13:07.579 --> 00:13:07.589
the second pillar then is you have to
 

00:13:07.589 --> 00:13:09.829
the second pillar then is you have to
develop a communication network so you

00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839
develop a communication network so you
 

00:13:09.839 --> 00:13:11.750
develop a communication network so you
can collect all that data and move it up

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760
can collect all that data and move it up
 

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.090
can collect all that data and move it up
to the cloud the third pillar then is

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:14.100
to the cloud the third pillar then is
 

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.310
to the cloud the third pillar then is
that you have open access to that data

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320
that you have open access to that data
 

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.769
that you have open access to that data
so that we can take the folks that have

00:13:18.769 --> 00:13:18.779
so that we can take the folks that have
 

00:13:18.779 --> 00:13:20.329
so that we can take the folks that have
the intellectual capability at the

00:13:20.329 --> 00:13:20.339
the intellectual capability at the
 

00:13:20.339 --> 00:13:22.400
the intellectual capability at the
universities that have a forward lean on

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:22.410
universities that have a forward lean on
 

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:24.650
universities that have a forward lean on
that technology and forward thinking

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:24.660
that technology and forward thinking
 

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:26.750
that technology and forward thinking
that develop the tools that we need so

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:26.760
that develop the tools that we need so
 

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.490
that develop the tools that we need so
that we can operate and take that data

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:28.500
that we can operate and take that data
 

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.860
that we can operate and take that data
and make effective economic use out of

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:30.870
and make effective economic use out of
 

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:32.720
and make effective economic use out of
it so having said that then when you

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:32.730
it so having said that then when you
 

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:33.980
it so having said that then when you
look at the partnerships that are

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:33.990
look at the partnerships that are
 

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:36.139
look at the partnerships that are
evolving between universities between

00:13:36.139 --> 00:13:36.149
evolving between universities between
 

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:39.079
evolving between universities between
utilities between cities we all have

00:13:39.079 --> 00:13:39.089
utilities between cities we all have
 

00:13:39.089 --> 00:13:40.819
utilities between cities we all have
assets in the field the city is a big

00:13:40.819 --> 00:13:40.829
assets in the field the city is a big
 

00:13:40.829 --> 00:13:42.769
assets in the field the city is a big
consumer of some of the information that

00:13:42.769 --> 00:13:42.779
consumer of some of the information that
 

00:13:42.779 --> 00:13:44.030
consumer of some of the information that
will come out of this to help them

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:44.040
will come out of this to help them
 

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.160
will come out of this to help them
operate more efficiently as a utility

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:46.170
operate more efficiently as a utility
 

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:48.530
operate more efficiently as a utility
we're a platform operator so we have

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:48.540
we're a platform operator so we have
 

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.509
we're a platform operator so we have
lots of sensors in the field today we

00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:50.519
lots of sensors in the field today we
 

00:13:50.519 --> 00:13:52.400
lots of sensors in the field today we
have controls in the field to manage

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:52.410
have controls in the field to manage
 

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:53.360
have controls in the field to manage
you'll hear about that a little bit

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:53.370
you'll hear about that a little bit
 

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:54.740
you'll hear about that a little bit
later from some of the other panel

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:54.750
later from some of the other panel
 

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:56.930
later from some of the other panel
participants so we have that expertise

00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:56.940
participants so we have that expertise
 

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.850
participants so we have that expertise
it's there we've developed communication

00:13:58.850 --> 00:13:58.860
it's there we've developed communication
 

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:02.449
it's there we've developed communication
networks to gather all of that data so

00:14:02.449 --> 00:14:02.459
networks to gather all of that data so
 

00:14:02.459 --> 00:14:03.650
networks to gather all of that data so
as what said here you don't want to

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:03.660
as what said here you don't want to
 

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.540
as what said here you don't want to
replicate those investments over and

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:05.550
replicate those investments over and
 

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:07.610
replicate those investments over and
over you want to leverage the assets

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:07.620
over you want to leverage the assets
 

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.230
over you want to leverage the assets
between all the players that are at the

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:09.240
between all the players that are at the
 

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.150
between all the players that are at the
table so we need to leverage and

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:11.160
table so we need to leverage and
 

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.090
table so we need to leverage and
contribute our our infrastructure assets

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:14.100
contribute our our infrastructure assets
 

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.800
contribute our our infrastructure assets
and our knowledge to the table we

and our knowledge to the table we
partner with the universities to tap

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:17.370
partner with the universities to tap
 

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:19.550
partner with the universities to tap
into that intellectual base we tap into

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:19.560
into that intellectual base we tap into
 

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.470
into that intellectual base we tap into
the city to interface with them and

to them as well so I want to jump right
off of one of the things that you just

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:29.550
off of one of the things that you just
 

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:30.590
off of one of the things that you just
said when you were talking about

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:30.600
said when you were talking about
 

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.780
said when you were talking about
leveraging assets because one of the

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:32.790
leveraging assets because one of the
 

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:33.920
leveraging assets because one of the
things that we've done with the class

this semester and many of the students
 

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.730
this semester and many of the students
are here with us today so there I'm sure

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:37.740
are here with us today so there I'm sure
 

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:39.769
are here with us today so there I'm sure
going to be going to be listening very

00:14:39.769 --> 00:14:39.779

going to be going to be listening very
carefully and intently hi is that we do

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:44.190
carefully and intently hi is that we do
 

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:46.069
carefully and intently hi is that we do
have an opportunity particularly in a

00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079
have an opportunity particularly in a
 

00:14:46.079 --> 00:14:48.920
have an opportunity particularly in a
city that is rebuilding as we are or at

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:48.930
city that is rebuilding as we are or at
 

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:50.900

a point of infrastructure improvement

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:50.910
a point of infrastructure improvement
 

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:53.920
a point of infrastructure improvement
should really take that opportunity to

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:53.930
should really take that opportunity to
 

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:56.960
should really take that opportunity to
capitalize across utilities and so

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:56.970
capitalize across utilities and so
 

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:58.160
capitalize across utilities and so
that's really what we're thinking about

00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:58.170
that's really what we're thinking about
 

00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:00.769
that's really what we're thinking about
as a part of the class is how can we

00:15:00.769 --> 00:15:00.779
as a part of the class is how can we
 

00:15:00.779 --> 00:15:04.069
as a part of the class is how can we
actually create an ROI what makes sense

00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079
actually create an ROI what makes sense
 

00:15:04.079 --> 00:15:06.050
actually create an ROI what makes sense
for each individual player within a city

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:06.060
for each individual player within a city
 

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.780

it makes a lot of sense to me to have

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:20.620
it makes a lot of sense to me to have
 

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:23.130
it makes a lot of sense to me to have
the utility be a partner in building two

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:23.140
the utility be a partner in building two
 

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:25.830
the utility be a partner in building two
charging stations so we figured out a

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840
charging stations so we figured out a
 

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.140
charging stations so we figured out a
way to get into this we said let's do

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:28.150
way to get into this we said let's do
 

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:31.470
way to get into this we said let's do
pilots let's demonstrate that we add

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:31.480
pilots let's demonstrate that we add
 

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.980
pilots let's demonstrate that we add

value and the concerns and others have
 

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:37.890
value and the concerns and others have
about our participation do not outweigh

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:37.900
about our participation do not outweigh
 

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.660
about our participation do not outweigh
the benefits that we bring to the table

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:39.670
the benefits that we bring to the table
 

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:41.940
the benefits that we bring to the table
those are just several examples of how

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:41.950
those are just several examples of how

those are just several examples of how
partnerships can be helpful but the

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:44.860
partnerships can be helpful but the
 

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:46.350
partnerships can be helpful but the
utilities participation those

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:46.360
utilities participation those
 

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.060
utilities participation those
partnerships can be constrained by the

partnerships can be constrained by the
 

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:51.060
partnerships can be constrained by the
regulatory process do you have to start

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:51.070
regulatory process do you have to start
 

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:52.860
regulatory process do you have to start
to bring the regulator's in as part of

to bring the regulator's in as part of
 

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:54.840
to bring the regulator's in as part of
the partnership is that one of the one

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:54.850
the partnership is that one of the one
 

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:56.670

of the ways that we overcome I mean kind

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:56.680
of the ways that we overcome I mean kind
 

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:57.840

of what you're leading to David is that

00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:57.850
of what you're leading to David is that
 

00:18:57.850 --> 00:18:59.310
of what you're leading to David is that
we have all this technology out there

00:18:59.310 --> 00:18:59.320
we have all this technology out there
 

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.440
we have all this technology out there
but the rules of the game are creating

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:01.450
but the rules of the game are creating
 

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:03.900

an impediment for us to make that

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:03.910
an impediment for us to make that
 

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:06.060
an impediment for us to make that
penetration into the market I mean how

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:06.070
penetration into the market I mean how
 

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:07.320
penetration into the market I mean how
are you guys starting to find ways to

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:07.330
are you guys starting to find ways to
 

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:09.360
are you guys starting to find ways to
overcome that either in kind of the

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:09.370
overcome that either in kind of the
 

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:11.940
overcome that either in kind of the
sensor space or utility or with clean

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:11.950

that being an impediment yeah I think

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:16.090
that being an impediment yeah I think
 

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:17.580
that being an impediment yeah I think

for the private sector to work within so

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:39.220
for the private sector to work within so
 

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.760
for the private sector to work within so
that so I think that's a you know that's

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:41.770
that so I think that's a you know that's
 

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:43.980
that so I think that's a you know that's
not a regulatory thing it's a it's a

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:43.990
not a regulatory thing it's a it's a

process II that that we need to real you
 

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:48.180
process II that that we need to real you
know we need to figure out if we're

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:48.190
know we need to figure out if we're
 

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:50.100
know we need to figure out if we're
going to really propel adoption of

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:50.110
going to really propel adoption of
 

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:52.670
going to really propel adoption of
technology a lot of these kind of

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:52.680
technology a lot of these kind of
 

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:54.990
technology a lot of these kind of
bureaucracies are not allowing for it

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:55.000
bureaucracies are not allowing for it
 

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.940
bureaucracies are not allowing for it
and that's something that we we have to

00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:56.950
and that's something that we we have to
 

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:58.680
and that's something that we we have to
turn upside down in order to move this

00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:58.690
turn upside down in order to move this
 

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:01.590
turn upside down in order to move this
forward I mean on that bureaucracy front

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600
forward I mean on that bureaucracy front
 

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.320
forward I mean on that bureaucracy front
so we live in a time of incredible

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:04.330

serving the same stakeholders right but

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:48.570
serving the same stakeholders right but
 

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:50.239
serving the same stakeholders right but
when you look at other utilities under

00:24:50.239 --> 00:24:50.249
when you look at other utilities under
 

00:24:50.249 --> 00:24:52.369
when you look at other utilities under
that model its gee well if I buy that

00:24:52.369 --> 00:24:52.379
that model its gee well if I buy that
 

00:24:52.379 --> 00:24:54.680
that model its gee well if I buy that
service from Duquesne Light I can't earn

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:54.690
service from Duquesne Light I can't earn
 

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:56.539
service from Duquesne Light I can't earn
a return on it so there's ways to

00:24:56.539 --> 00:24:56.549
a return on it so there's ways to
 

00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:58.129
a return on it so there's ways to
overcome that we'd have to go to the

00:24:58.129 --> 00:24:58.139
overcome that we'd have to go to the
 

00:24:58.139 --> 00:24:59.869
overcome that we'd have to go to the
regulator and say look just because

00:24:59.869 --> 00:24:59.879
regulator and say look just because
 

00:24:59.879 --> 00:25:01.669
regulator and say look just because
we're buying a service from a utility

00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679
we're buying a service from a utility
 

00:25:01.679 --> 00:25:03.229
we're buying a service from a utility
they should be allowed to earn some type

00:25:03.229 --> 00:25:03.239
they should be allowed to earn some type
 

00:25:03.239 --> 00:25:05.449
they should be allowed to earn some type
of synthetic return on that right this

00:25:05.449 --> 00:25:05.459
of synthetic return on that right this
 

00:25:05.459 --> 00:25:07.099
of synthetic return on that right this
way we're getting a much more efficient

00:25:07.099 --> 00:25:07.109
way we're getting a much more efficient
 

00:25:07.109 --> 00:25:08.869
way we're getting a much more efficient
you know deployment you know of capital

00:25:08.869 --> 00:25:08.879
you know deployment you know of capital
 

00:25:08.879 --> 00:25:10.759
you know deployment you know of capital
so I think those programs kind of you

00:25:10.759 --> 00:25:10.769
so I think those programs kind of you
 

00:25:10.769 --> 00:25:12.379
so I think those programs kind of you
know tease some of those things out and

00:25:12.379 --> 00:25:12.389
know tease some of those things out and
 

00:25:12.389 --> 00:25:14.449
know tease some of those things out and
it's it's going to be a slower process

00:25:14.449 --> 00:25:14.459
it's it's going to be a slower process
 

00:25:14.459 --> 00:25:16.999
it's it's going to be a slower process
then you would like when you're involved

00:25:16.999 --> 00:25:17.009
then you would like when you're involved
 

00:25:17.009 --> 00:25:19.339
then you would like when you're involved
you know with the regulated industry

00:25:19.339 --> 00:25:19.349
you know with the regulated industry
 

00:25:19.349 --> 00:25:21.349
you know with the regulated industry
part of its bureaucracy as you indicated

00:25:21.349 --> 00:25:21.359
part of its bureaucracy as you indicated
 

00:25:21.359 --> 00:25:22.759
part of its bureaucracy as you indicated
and I think we're working hard to knock

00:25:22.759 --> 00:25:22.769
and I think we're working hard to knock
 

00:25:22.769 --> 00:25:24.199
and I think we're working hard to knock
all of that down we certainly are

00:25:24.199 --> 00:25:24.209
all of that down we certainly are
 

00:25:24.209 --> 00:25:25.849
all of that down we certainly are
Duquesne Light but the regulatory

00:25:25.849 --> 00:25:25.859
Duquesne Light but the regulatory
 

00:25:25.859 --> 00:25:28.459
Duquesne Light but the regulatory
process really we need an increased

00:25:28.459 --> 00:25:28.469
process really we need an increased
 

00:25:28.469 --> 00:25:30.289
process really we need an increased
focus on the part of our regulators to

00:25:30.289 --> 00:25:30.299
focus on the part of our regulators to
 

00:25:30.299 --> 00:25:32.329
focus on the part of our regulators to
kind of up their game a bit and you know

00:25:32.329 --> 00:25:32.339
kind of up their game a bit and you know
 

00:25:32.339 --> 00:25:35.899
kind of up their game a bit and you know
start being streamlining the processes

00:25:35.899 --> 00:25:35.909
start being streamlining the processes
 

00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:37.940
start being streamlining the processes
so to speak but as we know there's a lot

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:37.950
so to speak but as we know there's a lot
 

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:42.619
so to speak but as we know there's a lot
of process involved you know so so maybe

00:25:42.619 --> 00:25:42.629
of process involved you know so so maybe
 

00:25:42.629 --> 00:25:44.539
of process involved you know so so maybe
to build on that a little bit in David

00:25:44.539 --> 00:25:44.549
to build on that a little bit in David
 

00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:46.039
to build on that a little bit in David
I'm gonna pivot to you here's you know

00:25:46.039 --> 00:25:46.049
I'm gonna pivot to you here's you know
 

00:25:46.049 --> 00:25:48.709
I'm gonna pivot to you here's you know
so regulations are put in place for a

00:25:48.709 --> 00:25:48.719
so regulations are put in place for a
 

00:25:48.719 --> 00:25:50.629
so regulations are put in place for a
reason right you know so that you're

trying to protect or or provide some
 

00:25:53.459 --> 00:25:56.329
trying to protect or or provide some
sort of continuity within a system and

00:25:56.329 --> 00:25:56.339
sort of continuity within a system and
 

00:25:56.339 --> 00:25:57.499
sort of continuity within a system and
one of the things that we talked about

00:25:57.499 --> 00:25:57.509
one of the things that we talked about
 

00:25:57.509 --> 00:26:00.469
one of the things that we talked about
earlier is these ideas of challenges you

00:26:00.469 --> 00:26:00.479
earlier is these ideas of challenges you
 

00:26:00.479 --> 00:26:01.639
earlier is these ideas of challenges you
know what are some of the challenges

00:26:01.639 --> 00:26:01.649
know what are some of the challenges
 

00:26:01.649 --> 00:26:03.979
know what are some of the challenges
that you guys see in your organization's

00:26:03.979 --> 00:26:03.989
that you guys see in your organization's
 

00:26:03.989 --> 00:26:07.009
that you guys see in your organization's
in terms of you know what's up ahead

00:26:07.009 --> 00:26:07.019
in terms of you know what's up ahead
 

00:26:07.019 --> 00:26:09.139
in terms of you know what's up ahead
what would kind of you know what are you

00:26:09.139 --> 00:26:09.149
what would kind of you know what are you
 

00:26:09.149 --> 00:26:10.609
what would kind of you know what are you
worrying about whether it's like cyber

00:26:10.609 --> 00:26:10.619
worrying about whether it's like cyber
 

00:26:10.619 --> 00:26:13.849
worrying about whether it's like cyber
threat or privacy data privacy issues

yourself for some of these these

00:26:21.049 --> 00:26:21.059
yourself for some of these these
 

00:26:21.059 --> 00:26:23.600
yourself for some of these these
challenges that lay on the horizon give

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:23.610
challenges that lay on the horizon give

challenges that lay on the horizon give
a solution first and I think rich said

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:26.490
a solution first and I think rich said
 

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:29.000
a solution first and I think rich said
in and others as well that this whole

one of the things that Edison Electric

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:35.730
one of the things that Edison Electric
 

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:37.510
one of the things that Edison Electric
Institute has been doing over the last

is pulling regulators together with

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:42.780
is pulling regulators together with
 

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:46.190
is pulling regulators together with
utility executives such as rich putting

00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:46.200
utility executives such as rich putting
 

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.870
utility executives such as rich putting
them in a room and dealing with some

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:47.880
them in a room and dealing with some
 

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.899
them in a room and dealing with some
very tough issues and it's an

00:26:50.899 --> 00:26:50.909
very tough issues and it's an
 

00:26:50.909 --> 00:26:53.810
very tough issues and it's an
off-the-record conversation we have

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:53.820
off-the-record conversation we have
 

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:55.490
off-the-record conversation we have
members of the financial community there

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:55.500
members of the financial community there
 

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:57.799
members of the financial community there
too and we deal with these cutting-edge

00:26:57.799 --> 00:26:57.809
too and we deal with these cutting-edge
 

00:26:57.809 --> 00:27:00.500
too and we deal with these cutting-edge
issues so that the regulator's get an

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:00.510
issues so that the regulator's get an
 

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:04.070
issues so that the regulator's get an
understanding of how their regulations

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080
understanding of how their regulations
 

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:07.159
understanding of how their regulations
can be an impediment to the evolution

00:27:07.159 --> 00:27:07.169
can be an impediment to the evolution
 

00:27:07.169 --> 00:27:10.399
can be an impediment to the evolution
and the adoption of technologies that

00:27:10.399 --> 00:27:10.409
and the adoption of technologies that
 

00:27:10.409 --> 00:27:13.370
and the adoption of technologies that
has worked but as rich said that is a

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:13.380
has worked but as rich said that is a
 

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:17.720
has worked but as rich said that is a
very very very slow process because

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:17.730
very very very slow process because
 

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:19.549
very very very slow process because
there are hundreds of regulators

00:27:19.549 --> 00:27:19.559
there are hundreds of regulators
 

00:27:19.559 --> 00:27:21.140
there are hundreds of regulators
throughout the United States

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:21.150
throughout the United States
 

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:24.169
throughout the United States
you can pull ten regulators in if you if

00:27:24.169 --> 00:27:24.179
you can pull ten regulators in if you if
 

00:27:24.179 --> 00:27:26.870
you can pull ten regulators in if you if
you multiply that it would take you 100

00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:26.880
you multiply that it would take you 100
 

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.180
you multiply that it would take you 100
years so there's got to be a better

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:29.190
years so there's got to be a better
 

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:32.120
years so there's got to be a better
process so the regulators get together

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:32.130
process so the regulators get together
 

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:35.779
process so the regulators get together
three major times a year so what we've

00:27:35.779 --> 00:27:35.789
three major times a year so what we've
 

00:27:35.789 --> 00:27:38.630
three major times a year so what we've
tried to do at E is to have a session

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640
tried to do at E is to have a session
 

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.630
tried to do at E is to have a session
with them a Saturday session they get

into town early we spring for lunch and
 

00:27:44.309 --> 00:27:46.279
into town early we spring for lunch and
have a dialogue on some of these big big

00:27:46.279 --> 00:27:46.289
have a dialogue on some of these big big
 

00:27:46.289 --> 00:27:48.049
have a dialogue on some of these big big
issues let me tell you what some of the

00:27:48.049 --> 00:27:48.059
issues let me tell you what some of the
 

00:27:48.059 --> 00:27:50.270
issues let me tell you what some of the
big issues are and you really started

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:50.280
big issues are and you really started

so as we digitize the electric system

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:54.630
so as we digitize the electric system
 

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:56.149
so as we digitize the electric system
that's really what we're doing we're

00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159
that's really what we're doing we're
 

00:27:56.159 --> 00:27:58.130
that's really what we're doing we're
making that electric system much smarter

00:27:58.130 --> 00:27:58.140
making that electric system much smarter
 

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:01.460
making that electric system much smarter
much more accessible much more customer

these risks sure so there's a lot of
things that are going on so you have

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:52.020
things that are going on so you have
 

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:55.340
things that are going on so you have
kind of the physical risk to the system

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:55.350
kind of the physical risk to the system
 

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:57.380
kind of the physical risk to the system
and then you have the cyber risk to the

hardened our substation so that could be
the infrastructure around the substation

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440
the infrastructure around the substation
 

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.110
the infrastructure around the substation
to protect it from somebody trying to do

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120
to protect it from somebody trying to do
 

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.750
to protect it from somebody trying to do
a bad thing to the substation we take a

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760
a bad thing to the substation we take a
 

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:14.390
a bad thing to the substation we take a
look at the infrastructure of the how we

00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:14.400
look at the infrastructure of the how we
 

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.760
look at the infrastructure of the how we
design our grid so that we have

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:16.770
design our grid so that we have
 

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:19.100
design our grid so that we have
redundancy built into the grid we have

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:19.110
redundancy built into the grid we have
 

00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:21.800
redundancy built into the grid we have
two-way flows so to speak that we don't

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:21.810
two-way flows so to speak that we don't
 

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:24.470
two-way flows so to speak that we don't
have any radial feeds or we minimize the

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.480
have any radial feeds or we minimize the
 

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.570
have any radial feeds or we minimize the
radio feeds that are out there we have a

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:26.580
radio feeds that are out there we have a
 

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:28.370
radio feeds that are out there we have a
lot of technology that we deployed I

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:28.380
lot of technology that we deployed I
 

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:30.140
lot of technology that we deployed I
mentioned earlier we have thousands of

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:30.150
mentioned earlier we have thousands of
 

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:31.790
mentioned earlier we have thousands of
sensors in the field those are

00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:31.800
sensors in the field those are
 

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.350
sensors in the field those are
controlled through our SCADA system in

00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360
controlled through our SCADA system in
 

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.030
controlled through our SCADA system in
our control room so a good example of

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:35.040
our control room so a good example of
 

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.980
our control room so a good example of
that is a lot of times when you see an

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:36.990
that is a lot of times when you see an
 

00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:38.810
that is a lot of times when you see an
adage you may see your power go out for

00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:38.820
adage you may see your power go out for
 

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:40.550
adage you may see your power go out for
a minute or so and then it comes back on

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:40.560
a minute or so and then it comes back on
 

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.620
a minute or so and then it comes back on
that's our control room that's looking

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:42.630
that's our control room that's looking
 

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:44.270
that's our control room that's looking
out there and seeing through the

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:44.280
out there and seeing through the
 

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:47.150
out there and seeing through the
technology we have where is that fault

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:47.160
technology we have where is that fault
 

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:49.250
technology we have where is that fault
located and then they're isolating the

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:49.260
located and then they're isolating the
 

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:52.310
located and then they're isolating the
system remotely so that a good example

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320
system remotely so that a good example
 

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:54.290
system remotely so that a good example
that would be 30,000 customers are out

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:54.300
that would be 30,000 customers are out
 

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:54.740
that would be 30,000 customers are out
but we have

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:54.750
but we have
 

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:56.600
but we have
fault in one location they know where

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:56.610
fault in one location they know where
 

00:32:56.610 --> 00:32:58.190
fault in one location they know where
they can isolate it from the rest of the

00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.200
they can isolate it from the rest of the
 

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.080
they can isolate it from the rest of the
system bring the power back up within

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:00.090
system bring the power back up within
 

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:02.150
system bring the power back up within
minutes and now you've taken 30,000

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:02.160
minutes and now you've taken 30,000
 

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:03.770
minutes and now you've taken 30,000
customers down to within a minute down

00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:03.780
customers down to within a minute down
 

00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:06.170
customers down to within a minute down
to 5,000 customers are out ultimately

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:06.180
to 5,000 customers are out ultimately
 

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:07.610
to 5,000 customers are out ultimately
you have to roll a vehicle out there to

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:07.620
you have to roll a vehicle out there to
 

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:09.290
you have to roll a vehicle out there to
repair you know the woods out there but

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:09.300
repair you know the woods out there but
 

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:11.090
repair you know the woods out there but
that allows us really is significantly

00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:11.100
that allows us really is significantly
 

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:13.610
that allows us really is significantly
you know reduce the outage time that's

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:13.620
you know reduce the outage time that's
 

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:15.260
you know reduce the outage time that's
out there so there's a number of

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:15.270
out there so there's a number of
 

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:16.820
out there so there's a number of
investments that we're making on the

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:16.830
investments that we're making on the
 

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:19.310
investments that we're making on the
asset side on the physical side and then

00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:19.320
asset side on the physical side and then
 

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:21.770

assets in the field and the technology
 

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:39.050
assets in the field and the technology
and a field is isolated from the outside

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:39.060
and a field is isolated from the outside
 

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:41.030
and a field is isolated from the outside
world so it doesn't connect to anything

00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:41.040
world so it doesn't connect to anything
 

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:43.460
world so it doesn't connect to anything
else other than into our control room so

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:43.470
else other than into our control room so
 

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:45.830
else other than into our control room so
we isolate it that way as you start

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:45.840
we isolate it that way as you start
 

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.810
we isolate it that way as you start
looking at the proliferation of smart

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:47.820
looking at the proliferation of smart
 

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:49.850
looking at the proliferation of smart
meters and then the customer data and

00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:49.860
meters and then the customer data and
 

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:51.620
meters and then the customer data and
things that come out of that we have to

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:51.630
things that come out of that we have to
 

00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:53.000
things that come out of that we have to
look at that a bit differently because

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:53.010
look at that a bit differently because
 

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:54.680
look at that a bit differently because
there's desires for people to access

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:54.690
there's desires for people to access
 

00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:56.840
there's desires for people to access
some of that information so when you

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:56.850
some of that information so when you
 

00:33:56.850 --> 00:33:58.610
some of that information so when you
think about cyber security you know you

00:33:58.610 --> 00:33:58.620
think about cyber security you know you
 

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:00.170
think about cyber security you know you
approach that from a number of different

00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:00.180
approach that from a number of different
 

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:02.090
approach that from a number of different
ways you have multiple layers of Defense

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:02.100
ways you have multiple layers of Defense
 

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:04.490
ways you have multiple layers of Defense
for people trying to penetrate you you

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:04.500
for people trying to penetrate you you
 

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:06.260
for people trying to penetrate you you
kind of design your system like you

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:06.270
kind of design your system like you
 

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:08.210
kind of design your system like you
compartmentalize it like a ship right if

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:08.220
compartmentalize it like a ship right if
 

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:09.680
compartmentalize it like a ship right if
you have a rupture on a ship you close

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:09.690
you have a rupture on a ship you close
 

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:11.540
you have a rupture on a ship you close
doors inside it you isolate it so that

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:11.550
doors inside it you isolate it so that
 

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:13.490
doors inside it you isolate it so that
the ship doesn't go down we look at how

00:34:13.490 --> 00:34:13.500
the ship doesn't go down we look at how
 

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:15.290
the ship doesn't go down we look at how
do we isolate and compartmentalize

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:15.300
do we isolate and compartmentalize
 

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:17.480
do we isolate and compartmentalize
different systems within the company

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:17.490
different systems within the company
 

00:34:17.490 --> 00:34:19.430
different systems within the company
itself and then on top of that we need

00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440
itself and then on top of that we need
 

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.110
itself and then on top of that we need
to start thinking about from a cyber

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:21.120
to start thinking about from a cyber
 

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:23.450
to start thinking about from a cyber
perspective as we look at smart cities I

00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:23.460
perspective as we look at smart cities I
 

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:27.230
perspective as we look at smart cities I
think that has to be approached by the

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:27.240
think that has to be approached by the
 

00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:29.720
think that has to be approached by the
specific technology their specific

00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:29.730
specific technology their specific
 

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:31.310
specific technology their specific
desires we need to do with that

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:31.320
desires we need to do with that
 

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.500
desires we need to do with that
technology in the field for example you

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:33.510
technology in the field for example you
 

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:34.700
technology in the field for example you
know when we take a look at deploying

00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:34.710
know when we take a look at deploying
 

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:36.680
know when we take a look at deploying
all these sensors out there if that data

00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:36.690
all these sensors out there if that data
 

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:38.149
all these sensors out there if that data
is coming in and we want to give people

00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:38.159
is coming in and we want to give people
 

00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:39.830
is coming in and we want to give people
access to it but they can't control or

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:39.840
access to it but they can't control or
 

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.720
access to it but they can't control or
do anything with it that's one layer of

00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:41.730
do anything with it that's one layer of
 

00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:43.580
do anything with it that's one layer of
security that you'll put around it if

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:43.590
security that you'll put around it if
 

00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:45.200
security that you'll put around it if
you have control of it where you can

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:45.210
you have control of it where you can
 

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:46.730
you have control of it where you can
actually go out there and take that data

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:46.740
actually go out there and take that data
 

00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:48.740
actually go out there and take that data
look at where traffic flows are now go

00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:48.750
look at where traffic flows are now go
 

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:50.659
look at where traffic flows are now go
out and start switching traffic lights

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:50.669
out and start switching traffic lights
 

00:34:50.669 --> 00:34:52.669
out and start switching traffic lights
and changing the sequence of it that's a

00:34:52.669 --> 00:34:52.679
and changing the sequence of it that's a
 

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:53.960
and changing the sequence of it that's a
different level of control and

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:53.970
different level of control and
 

00:34:53.970 --> 00:34:55.730
different level of control and
protection that has to go around that so

00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:55.740
protection that has to go around that so
 

00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:57.740
protection that has to go around that so
I think it's you know as you look at it

00:34:57.740 --> 00:34:57.750
I think it's you know as you look at it
 

00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:59.330
I think it's you know as you look at it
you want to try to compartmentalize it

00:34:59.330 --> 00:34:59.340
you want to try to compartmentalize it
 

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:01.400
you want to try to compartmentalize it
and then apply the appropriate level of

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:01.410
and then apply the appropriate level of
 

00:35:01.410 --> 00:35:03.110
and then apply the appropriate level of
risk mitigation in each of those per

energy independence and what that means
 

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:25.490
energy independence and what that means
and how their technology may be able to

00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:25.500
and how their technology may be able to
 

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:28.040
and how their technology may be able to
fit into that so what we've done you

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:28.050
fit into that so what we've done you
 

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:30.350
fit into that so what we've done you
know we like pilot programs and pilot

00:36:30.350 --> 00:36:30.360
know we like pilot programs and pilot
 

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:33.050
know we like pilot programs and pilot
projects in San Diego as well but you

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:33.060
projects in San Diego as well but you
 

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:34.460
projects in San Diego as well but you
know going back to this kind of notion

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:34.470
know going back to this kind of notion
 

00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:36.710
know going back to this kind of notion
of collaboration when early-stage

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720
of collaboration when early-stage
 

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.810
of collaboration when early-stage
companies can sit in a room and kind of

00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:38.820
companies can sit in a room and kind of
 

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:41.930
companies can sit in a room and kind of
a neutral space with the utility with

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:41.940
a neutral space with the utility with
 

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:43.910
a neutral space with the utility with
the universities and others to talk

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920
the universities and others to talk
 

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:45.770
the universities and others to talk
about their technology and kind of the

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:45.780
about their technology and kind of the
 

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:47.510
about their technology and kind of the
real-world application of that

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520
real-world application of that
 

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:49.550
real-world application of that
technology there's significant benefit

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:49.560
technology there's significant benefit
 

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:52.430
technology there's significant benefit
in that and so I think these these types

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:52.440
in that and so I think these these types
 

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.350
in that and so I think these these types
of conversations not just happening here

00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:54.360
of conversations not just happening here
 

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.300
of conversations not just happening here
on a stage but in a room with kind of

00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:56.310
on a stage but in a room with kind of
 

00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:58.000
on a stage but in a room with kind of
the next round of innovators is

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:58.010
the next round of innovators is
 

00:36:58.010 --> 00:37:01.010
the next round of innovators is
increasingly important and we're using

00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:01.020
increasingly important and we're using
 

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:03.050
increasingly important and we're using
those that ability to facilitate those

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:03.060
those that ability to facilitate those
 

00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:04.340
those that ability to facilitate those
conversations and help in these

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:04.350
conversations and help in these
 

00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:06.680
conversations and help in these
technology companies develop a

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:06.690
technology companies develop a
 

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:09.770
technology companies develop a
technology that actually has a market in

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:09.780
technology that actually has a market in
 

00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:11.420
technology that actually has a market in
that market being around cyber energy

00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:11.430

generation energy management whatever it
 

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:16.730
generation energy management whatever it
may be yeah it's like maybe I agree

00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:16.740
may be yeah it's like maybe I agree
 

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:17.840
may be yeah it's like maybe I agree
all these comments but a slightly

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:17.850
all these comments but a slightly
 

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:21.290
all these comments but a slightly
different take which is that we feel

00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:21.300
different take which is that we feel
 

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:23.780
different take which is that we feel
that we're on the issue security and

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:23.790
that we're on the issue security and
 

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:26.420
that we're on the issue security and
privacy actually better off supporting

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:26.430
privacy actually better off supporting
 

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:30.950
privacy actually better off supporting
industry standards and and not trying to

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960
industry standards and and not trying to
 

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:31.520
industry standards and and not trying to
go it alone

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:31.530
go it alone
 

00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:35.000
go it alone
so so you know we're working with best

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:35.010
so so you know we're working with best
 

00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:37.010
so so you know we're working with best
minds and standards bodies in order to

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:37.020
minds and standards bodies in order to
 

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:39.170
minds and standards bodies in order to
establish a common set of standards and

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:39.180
establish a common set of standards and
 

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:41.840
establish a common set of standards and
ask our partners and startups to conform

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:41.850
ask our partners and startups to conform
 

00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:44.330
ask our partners and startups to conform
to a series of privacy and cyber

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:44.340
to a series of privacy and cyber
 

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:46.040
to a series of privacy and cyber
security and communications and other

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:46.050
security and communications and other
 

00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:48.230
security and communications and other
standards we need to make innovation

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:48.240
standards we need to make innovation
 

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:51.230
standards we need to make innovation
easy and predictable in order to really

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:51.240
easy and predictable in order to really
 

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.540
easy and predictable in order to really
stimulate it and so there when we talk

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:53.550
stimulate it and so there when we talk
 

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:55.700
stimulate it and so there when we talk
about platforms the rules have to be

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:55.710
about platforms the rules have to be
 

00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:58.400
about platforms the rules have to be
published and then you have to have

00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:58.410
published and then you have to have
 

00:37:58.410 --> 00:38:01.580
published and then you have to have
third parties that can verify that the

00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:01.590
third parties that can verify that the
 

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:03.440
third parties that can verify that the
rules are being enforced and so we have

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:03.450
rules are being enforced and so we have
 

00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:05.120
rules are being enforced and so we have
a number of members in the audience from

analysis on the standards that we've

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:10.950
analysis on the standards that we've
 

00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:13.760
analysis on the standards that we've
used we're using standard technology

where are some of the best strategies to

00:42:13.999 --> 00:42:14.009
where are some of the best strategies to
 

00:42:14.009 --> 00:42:16.160
where are some of the best strategies to
deploy technology you know this really

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:16.170
deploy technology you know this really
 

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:17.630

makes me think about some of the

00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:17.640
makes me think about some of the
 

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:19.549
makes me think about some of the
challenges that we've seen in the city

00:42:19.549 --> 00:42:19.559
challenges that we've seen in the city
 

00:42:19.559 --> 00:42:21.229
challenges that we've seen in the city
is that we can get the pilots up and

00:42:21.229 --> 00:42:21.239
is that we can get the pilots up and
 

00:42:21.239 --> 00:42:23.209
is that we can get the pilots up and
running the challenge we have is going

00:42:23.209 --> 00:42:23.219
running the challenge we have is going
 

00:42:23.219 --> 00:42:25.370
running the challenge we have is going
to scale so what are some things that

00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:25.380
to scale so what are some things that
 

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:27.349
to scale so what are some things that
you would kind of lend in a conversation

00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359
you would kind of lend in a conversation
 

00:42:27.359 --> 00:42:29.359
you would kind of lend in a conversation
maybe you know a quick minute or so in

00:42:29.359 --> 00:42:29.369
maybe you know a quick minute or so in
 

00:42:29.369 --> 00:42:31.400
maybe you know a quick minute or so in
terms of how do you get the scale how do

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:31.410
terms of how do you get the scale how do
 

00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:34.069
terms of how do you get the scale how do
we go beyond just the pilots so I would

00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079
we go beyond just the pilots so I would
 

00:42:34.079 --> 00:42:35.630
we go beyond just the pilots so I would

project that started as a pilot we're in

00:42:44.089 --> 00:42:44.099
project that started as a pilot we're in
 

00:42:44.099 --> 00:42:46.910
project that started as a pilot we're in
year 3 now and it's a full-scale project

00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:46.920
year 3 now and it's a full-scale project
 

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.589
year 3 now and it's a full-scale project
I think the value of it's about 43

00:42:48.589 --> 00:42:48.599
I think the value of it's about 43
 

00:42:48.599 --> 00:42:51.410
I think the value of it's about 43
million so it started as a pilot and it

00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:51.420
million so it started as a pilot and it
 

00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:53.059
million so it started as a pilot and it
actually became something real I don't

00:42:53.059 --> 00:42:53.069
actually became something real I don't
 

00:42:53.069 --> 00:42:54.469
actually became something real I don't
know that that necessarily happens all

00:42:54.469 --> 00:42:54.479
know that that necessarily happens all
 

00:42:54.479 --> 00:42:57.410
know that that necessarily happens all
the time but I think what got it to

00:42:57.410 --> 00:42:57.420
the time but I think what got it to
 

00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:58.910
the time but I think what got it to
where it was to where it is today

00:42:58.910 --> 00:42:58.920
where it was to where it is today
 

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.579
where it was to where it is today
is leadership from the city and a focus

00:43:01.579 --> 00:43:01.589
is leadership from the city and a focus
 

00:43:01.589 --> 00:43:03.199
is leadership from the city and a focus
of the city to get it to where it is

00:43:03.199 --> 00:43:03.209
of the city to get it to where it is
 

00:43:03.209 --> 00:43:05.689
of the city to get it to where it is
today but also the ability of and the

00:43:05.689 --> 00:43:05.699
today but also the ability of and the
 

00:43:05.699 --> 00:43:06.979
today but also the ability of and the
willingness of the private sector

00:43:06.979 --> 00:43:06.989
willingness of the private sector
 

00:43:06.989 --> 00:43:09.709

work with the city to make sure that the
 

00:43:12.029 --> 00:43:13.849
work with the city to make sure that the
technology not only met the needs of the

00:43:13.849 --> 00:43:13.859
technology not only met the needs of the
 

00:43:13.859 --> 00:43:15.709
technology not only met the needs of the
city but also met the needs of their own

00:43:15.709 --> 00:43:15.719
city but also met the needs of their own
 

00:43:15.719 --> 00:43:18.829
city but also met the needs of their own
needs so I think it takes a champion on

00:43:18.829 --> 00:43:18.839
needs so I think it takes a champion on
 

00:43:18.839 --> 00:43:21.650
needs so I think it takes a champion on
both ends to push it to the end and

00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:21.660
both ends to push it to the end and
 

00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:23.900
both ends to push it to the end and
really see it be built to the extent

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:23.910
really see it be built to the extent
 

00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:25.699
really see it be built to the extent
that it should be as opposed to just

00:43:25.699 --> 00:43:25.709
that it should be as opposed to just

took a few regulators I might be but I

00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:43.140
took a few regulators I might be but I
 

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:45.620
