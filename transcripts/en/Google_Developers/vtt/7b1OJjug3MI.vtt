MARTIN AGUINIS: So
I'm standing here

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.900
with Eric Seidel, who is one
of the founders of Flutter.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.700
And I believe it was
called Sky back then

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.270
when you first started it.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.540
And you were actually
on the Chrome team

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.870
when this idea came to be.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.630
But you've seen it go
from an idea to now

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.550
a globally used framework.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.540
So I'm curious just what
was your initial vision

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.940
with Flutter, and how has
that changed, if anything,

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.020
and evolved?

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.120
ERIC SEIDEL: Yeah,
Flutter started out

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.294
with a very different
purpose than it has now.

00:00:32.294 --> 00:00:34.710
Flutter started out as just
trying to make the web better.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.251
We were trying to
make Chrome better,

00:00:36.251 --> 00:00:38.590
trying to make Chrome smaller.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.160
And when we first
started Flutter,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.430
we took a couple weeks, and
we took a razor to Chrome,

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.340
we said.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.320
We even called the test results
that we came up with Razor.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.040
And we cut down Chrome and just
tried to make it fast and small

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.100
and remove some
of the sharp edges

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.700
that the web has developed
over the many, many years.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.180
Anyway, so we ended
up with a faster web,

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.960
but that wasn't sufficient.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.603
We wanted to do more.

00:01:03.603 --> 00:01:05.519
And we ended up adding
more and more and more.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.280
And once you add things,
you're no longer in the web.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.860
And we rewrote the whole
system maybe three times since,

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.122
but what we have now is Flutter.

00:01:14.122 --> 00:01:15.330
MARTIN AGUINIS: That's great.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.970
So what we have
now, obviously, has

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.470
been used all over the world.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.410
But I'm curious along
that adoption journey,

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.040
was there a moment where you
went, wow, this is legitimate,

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.166
this is really taking off?

00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:29.790
ERIC SEIDEL: I think
the biggest moment

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.250
for me was Hamilton, when
we saw the Hamilton app

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.890
ship, when we saw that team
be successful with Flutter.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.990
We'd seen teams be
successful inside Google

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.240
for several years.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.870
But seeing folks that
we had much less ability

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.650
to talk to on a
minute to minute basis

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.720
be successful with
this technology,

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.059
helped me believe that,
yeah, anybody can use this.

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:55.350
MARTIN AGUINIS: That was great.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.330
I know now they have
over a million installs,

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.460
and a lot of people
are winning tickets

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.330
through that app or $10 tickets.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.520
So that's really great.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.562
So where do you see Flutter
headed in the future?

00:02:04.562 --> 00:02:05.936
ERIC SEIDEL: So
one of the things

00:02:05.936 --> 00:02:07.350
that we're seeing
with Flutter is

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.360
we're seeing people take
Flutter to more places.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.410
We started with
I was in Android,

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.620
because that's where so
many developers are today.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.110
But we've seen people
bring Flutter to desktop.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.180
We've seen people
experiment with Flutter

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.480
on all sorts of different
sizes and shapes of devices.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.140
And I'm really excited to
get to light up more devs

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.090
as that continues.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.090
MARTIN AGUINIS: Awesome.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.089
Thank you so much, Eric.
