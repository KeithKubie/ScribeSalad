00:14:11.479 --> 00:14:13.869
experiences for our own students to
travel elsewhere so that most of our

00:14:13.869 --> 00:14:13.879
travel elsewhere so that most of our
 

00:14:13.879 --> 00:14:15.699
travel elsewhere so that most of our
undergraduates many of our graduate

00:14:15.699 --> 00:14:15.709
undergraduates many of our graduate
 

00:14:15.709 --> 00:14:17.519
undergraduates many of our graduate
students will have an experience abroad

00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:17.529
students will have an experience abroad
 

00:14:17.529 --> 00:14:20.139
students will have an experience abroad
to experience the cultures and then also

00:14:20.139 --> 00:14:20.149
to experience the cultures and then also
 

00:14:20.149 --> 00:14:22.869
to experience the cultures and then also
from a research perspective creating

00:14:22.869 --> 00:14:22.879
from a research perspective creating
 

00:14:22.879 --> 00:14:24.969
from a research perspective creating
selective collaborations particularly in

00:14:24.969 --> 00:14:24.979
selective collaborations particularly in
 

00:14:24.979 --> 00:14:27.399
selective collaborations particularly in
the Pacific Rim countries focused on

00:14:27.399 --> 00:14:27.409
the Pacific Rim countries focused on
 

00:14:27.409 --> 00:14:29.579
the Pacific Rim countries focused on
Asia South America Central America

00:14:29.579 --> 00:14:29.589
Asia South America Central America

forming the relationships so that our

00:14:31.839 --> 00:14:31.849
forming the relationships so that our
 

00:14:31.849 --> 00:14:33.489
forming the relationships so that our
faculty can work with those that other

00:14:33.489 --> 00:14:33.499
faculty can work with those that other
 

00:14:33.499 --> 00:14:35.399
faculty can work with those that other
universities are perhaps work on

00:14:35.399 --> 00:14:35.409
universities are perhaps work on
 

00:14:35.409 --> 00:14:37.449
universities are perhaps work on
projects in other countries such as

00:14:37.449 --> 00:14:37.459
projects in other countries such as
 

00:14:37.459 --> 00:14:39.429
projects in other countries such as
China where we're looking at say

00:14:39.429 --> 00:14:39.439
China where we're looking at say
 

00:14:39.439 --> 00:14:43.269
China where we're looking at say
environmental impacts on health those

00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:43.279
environmental impacts on health those
 

00:14:43.279 --> 00:14:44.979
environmental impacts on health those
environmental impacts be much greater

00:14:44.979 --> 00:14:44.989
environmental impacts be much greater
 

00:14:44.989 --> 00:14:46.419
environmental impacts be much greater
than they are here in California

00:14:46.419 --> 00:14:46.429
than they are here in California
 

00:14:46.429 --> 00:14:48.909
than they are here in California
pollution being even that much worse and

00:14:48.909 --> 00:14:48.919
pollution being even that much worse and
 

00:14:48.919 --> 00:14:51.249
pollution being even that much worse and
so and also the health behavior effects

00:14:51.249 --> 00:14:51.259
so and also the health behavior effects
 

00:14:51.259 --> 00:14:53.259
so and also the health behavior effects
of things like smoking around the world

00:14:53.259 --> 00:14:53.269
of things like smoking around the world
 

00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:55.989
of things like smoking around the world
so we learn a lot from other countries

00:14:55.989 --> 00:14:55.999
so we learn a lot from other countries
 

00:14:55.999 --> 00:14:57.879
so we learn a lot from other countries
and and we hope that they learn from us

00:14:57.879 --> 00:14:57.889
and and we hope that they learn from us
 

00:14:57.889 --> 00:14:58.859
and and we hope that they learn from us
by coming here

we still have 25 percent of foreign
 

00:15:16.459 --> 00:15:19.749
we still have 25 percent of foreign
students already now for 100 years or

00:15:19.749 --> 00:15:19.759
students already now for 100 years or
 

00:15:19.759 --> 00:15:23.649
students already now for 100 years or
more so but the question I understand a

00:15:23.649 --> 00:15:23.659
more so but the question I understand a
 

00:15:23.659 --> 00:15:25.229
more so but the question I understand a
little bit differently

00:15:25.229 --> 00:15:25.239
little bit differently
 

00:15:25.239 --> 00:15:27.549

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:33.740
and internationalization is fine you're
 

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:36.460

how do you prepare your students your

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:41.110
how do you prepare your students your
 

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:45.490
how do you prepare your students your
your faculty for the new challenges of

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:45.500
your faculty for the new challenges of
 

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.980
your faculty for the new challenges of
the globalization that's a little bit

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:47.990
the globalization that's a little bit
 

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:50.070
the globalization that's a little bit
different and for this purpose we have

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:50.080
different and for this purpose we have
 

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.120
different and for this purpose we have
created in cards for a house of

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:52.130
created in cards for a house of
 

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:56.470
created in cards for a house of
competence this means to promote social

students before they go abroad before

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:01.850
students before they go abroad before
 

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:03.490
students before they go abroad before
they go to industry that they are

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:03.500
they go to industry that they are
 

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.500
they go to industry that they are
prepared that the world is different

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:05.510

community of the students going to a

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:13.700
community of the students going to a
 

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:15.910
community of the students going to a
different country is a different event

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:15.920
different country is a different event
 

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.790
different country is a different event
in your life and what's very important

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:18.800
in your life and what's very important
 

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.770
in your life and what's very important
is that we have a very very good

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:20.780
is that we have a very very good
 

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.810
is that we have a very very good
language school to prepare those

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:22.820
language school to prepare those
 

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:25.360
language school to prepare those
students in in very very many languages

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:25.370
students in in very very many languages
 

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:27.790
students in in very very many languages
and I think this is very very important

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:27.800
and I think this is very very important
 

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.140
and I think this is very very important
before you go into a different country

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:29.150
before you go into a different country
 

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:32.800
before you go into a different country
you have to learn this language and I

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:32.810
you have to learn this language and I
 

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:35.290
you have to learn this language and I
think English is fine but English is for

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:35.300
think English is fine but English is for
 

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:37.720
think English is fine but English is for
me something like a tool and if you go

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:37.730
me something like a tool and if you go
 

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:39.040
me something like a tool and if you go
to different country which is not

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:39.050
to different country which is not
 

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:41.860
to different country which is not
America or Britain or Australia then you

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:41.870
America or Britain or Australia then you
 

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:44.140
America or Britain or Australia then you
should also learn these basics of this

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:44.150
should also learn these basics of this
 

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:46.360
should also learn these basics of this
language and I think globalization has

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:46.370
language and I think globalization has
 

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:48.220
language and I think globalization has
something to do with learning the

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:48.230
something to do with learning the
 

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:50.740
something to do with learning the
difference of the cultures and very very

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:50.750
difference of the cultures and very very
 

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:52.660

university and that's what we understand
 

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:57.190
university and that's what we understand

okay so what we just heard I think is
 

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:44.549
okay so what we just heard I think is
that between universities getting

00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:44.559
that between universities getting
 

00:18:44.559 --> 00:18:46.350
that between universities getting
students from all over the world is

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:46.360

that the universities are definitely in
a global community and of course they're

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:06.010
a global community and of course they're
 

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:07.830
a global community and of course they're
also in a technical community as well

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:07.840
also in a technical community as well
 

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:11.460

should reduce the cost but we I think
 

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:21.610
should reduce the cost but we I think
there is a some way to diffuse the cost

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:21.620
there is a some way to diffuse the cost
 

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:27.070

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:11.100
 
yes so I mean I think I mean I agree

the other hand disciplines are evolving

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:20.320
the other hand disciplines are evolving
 

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.740
the other hand disciplines are evolving
faster than then then a few years ago

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:22.750
faster than then then a few years ago
 

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:27.060
faster than then then a few years ago
and also curricula are evolving faster

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:27.070
and also curricula are evolving faster
 

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:29.250
and also curricula are evolving faster
or should be evolving faster than a few

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:29.260
or should be evolving faster than a few
 

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:31.950
or should be evolving faster than a few
years ago so I think that where

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:31.960
years ago so I think that where
 

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.950

00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:27.440
is handling those kind of agreements in
 

00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:29.290
is handling those kind of agreements in
fact there are a lot of agreement that

00:50:29.290 --> 00:50:29.300
fact there are a lot of agreement that
 

00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:33.359
fact there are a lot of agreement that
are made today between different groups

00:50:33.359 --> 00:50:33.369
are made today between different groups
 

00:50:33.369 --> 00:50:37.359
are made today between different groups
faculty and companies involving shared

00:50:37.359 --> 00:50:37.369

00:50:37.369 --> 00:50:38.829
faculty and companies involving shared
intellectual properties

00:50:38.829 --> 00:50:38.839
intellectual properties
 

00:50:38.839 --> 00:50:41.050

the basic principle at Stanford

00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:41.060
the basic principle at Stanford
 

00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:43.540
the basic principle at Stanford
University and many other university was

00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:43.550
University and many other university was
 

00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:45.700
University and many other university was
that you cannot buy intellectual

00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:45.710
that you cannot buy intellectual
 

00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:48.520
that you cannot buy intellectual
property so it's not by just funding a

00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:48.530
property so it's not by just funding a
 

00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:51.370
property so it's not by just funding a
project we can acquire the intellectual

00:50:51.370 --> 00:50:51.380
project we can acquire the intellectual
 

00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:54.690
project we can acquire the intellectual
properties however there are shared

00:50:54.690 --> 00:50:54.700
properties however there are shared
 

00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:59.880
properties however there are shared
ideas and discussions that involve other

00:50:59.880 --> 00:50:59.890
ideas and discussions that involve other
 

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:03.460
ideas and discussions that involve other
alternate that in those projects and

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:03.470
alternate that in those projects and
 

00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:06.460
alternate that in those projects and
that can be part of why we will be

00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:06.470
that can be part of why we will be
 

00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:10.359
that can be part of why we will be
sharing so the development officer at

00:51:10.359 --> 00:51:10.369
sharing so the development officer at
 

00:51:10.369 --> 00:51:12.760
sharing so the development officer at
Stanford University is working on ok

00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:12.770
Stanford University is working on ok
 

00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:15.339
Stanford University is working on ok
just to follow up comment to that you

00:51:15.339 --> 00:51:15.349
just to follow up comment to that you
 

00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:16.990
just to follow up comment to that you
know so in my experience I've seen a lot

00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:17.000
know so in my experience I've seen a lot
 

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.410
know so in my experience I've seen a lot
of diversity across Europe and us so you

00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:20.420
of diversity across Europe and us so you
 

00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:22.780
of diversity across Europe and us so you
know those telecom we've invested in you

00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:22.790
know those telecom we've invested in you
 

00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:24.400
know those telecom we've invested in you
know Germany in some universities and

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:24.410
know Germany in some universities and
 

00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:27.280
know Germany in some universities and
also in Israel there the IPR agreements

00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:27.290
also in Israel there the IPR agreements
 

00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:29.380
also in Israel there the IPR agreements
are much more you know in favor of the

00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:29.390
are much more you know in favor of the
 

00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:31.300
are much more you know in favor of the
industry in the respect that you can

00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:31.310
industry in the respect that you can
 

00:51:31.310 --> 00:51:34.630
industry in the respect that you can
gain back the IP ours at Stanford

00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:34.640
gain back the IP ours at Stanford
 

00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:37.050
gain back the IP ours at Stanford
however you know just like we discussed

00:51:37.050 --> 00:51:37.060
however you know just like we discussed
 

00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:39.160
however you know just like we discussed
there's a there's a different paradigm

00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:39.170
there's a there's a different paradigm
 

00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:41.589
there's a there's a different paradigm
but what we've sort of figured out is

00:51:41.589 --> 00:51:41.599
but what we've sort of figured out is
 

00:51:41.599 --> 00:51:44.020
but what we've sort of figured out is
that in a more open innovation model

00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:44.030
that in a more open innovation model
 

00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:46.089
that in a more open innovation model
there's a lot that the industry can gain

00:51:46.089 --> 00:51:46.099
there's a lot that the industry can gain
 

00:51:46.099 --> 00:51:48.490
there's a lot that the industry can gain
because usually the consortium you know

00:51:48.490 --> 00:51:48.500
because usually the consortium you know
 

00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:50.230
because usually the consortium you know
for our case the consortiums that we

00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:50.240
for our case the consortiums that we
 

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:51.460
for our case the consortiums that we
found that they comprise multiple

00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:51.470
found that they comprise multiple
 

00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:53.500
found that they comprise multiple
industries you know whether these are

00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:53.510
industries you know whether these are
 

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:56.050
industries you know whether these are
vendors or service providers or hardware

00:51:56.050 --> 00:51:56.060
vendors or service providers or hardware
 

00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:58.480
vendors or service providers or hardware
manufacturers they all sort of pool in

00:51:58.480 --> 00:51:58.490
manufacturers they all sort of pool in
 

00:51:58.490 --> 00:52:00.070
manufacturers they all sort of pool in
their intellect and know-how and

00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:00.080
their intellect and know-how and
 

00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:01.780
their intellect and know-how and
although we've invested in the open

00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:01.790
although we've invested in the open
 

00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:03.820
although we've invested in the open
innovation model that lets us sort of

00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:03.830
innovation model that lets us sort of
 

00:52:03.830 --> 00:52:05.950
innovation model that lets us sort of
harness which was much more than what

00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:05.960
harness which was much more than what
 

00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:08.320
harness which was much more than what
was initially invested in so we've sort

00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:08.330
was initially invested in so we've sort
 

00:52:08.330 --> 00:52:10.270
was initially invested in so we've sort
of you know try to figure out figure out

00:52:10.270 --> 00:52:10.280
of you know try to figure out figure out
 

00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:12.609
of you know try to figure out figure out
ways of working around the things dr.

00:52:12.609 --> 00:52:12.619
ways of working around the things dr.
 

00:52:12.619 --> 00:52:13.800
ways of working around the things dr.

00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:13.810
Hippler
 

00:52:13.810 --> 00:52:16.859
Hippler
yeah I I think there's a big difference

00:52:16.859 --> 00:52:16.869
yeah I I think there's a big difference
 

00:52:16.869 --> 00:52:19.150
yeah I I think there's a big difference
particularly between the US and Europe

00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:19.160
particularly between the US and Europe
 

00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:23.109
particularly between the US and Europe
and and Germany and also I think there's

00:52:23.109 --> 00:52:23.119
and and Germany and also I think there's
 

00:52:23.119 --> 00:52:25.000
and and Germany and also I think there's
a difference between private university

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:25.010
a difference between private university
 

00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:27.940
a difference between private university
and public universities and for us in

00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:27.950
and public universities and for us in
 

00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:30.640
and public universities and for us in
Germany mostly public universities I

00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:30.650
Germany mostly public universities I
 

00:52:30.650 --> 00:52:33.620
Germany mostly public universities I
think our mission is to

00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:33.630
think our mission is to
 

00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:36.980
think our mission is to
transfer money into knowledge and the

00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:36.990
transfer money into knowledge and the
 

00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:38.630
transfer money into knowledge and the
mission of industry is to transfer a

00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:38.640
mission of industry is to transfer a
 

00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:41.300
mission of industry is to transfer a
knowledge into money and this interface

00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:41.310
knowledge into money and this interface
 

00:52:41.310 --> 00:52:44.150
knowledge into money and this interface
is the most important interface and how

00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160
is the most important interface and how
 

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:47.510
is the most important interface and how
to deal with this interface depends on

00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:47.520
to deal with this interface depends on
 

00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:50.000
to deal with this interface depends on
the laws you have in your States on your

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:50.010
the laws you have in your States on your
 

00:52:50.010 --> 00:52:52.220
the laws you have in your States on your
countries and therefore the situation is

00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:52.230
countries and therefore the situation is
 

00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:55.220
countries and therefore the situation is
very very different in in in in the

00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:55.230
very very different in in in in the
 

00:52:55.230 --> 00:52:58.550
very very different in in in in the
world and it's it's not easy to handle

00:52:58.550 --> 00:52:58.560
world and it's it's not easy to handle
 

00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:03.800
world and it's it's not easy to handle
so what for my university the laws and

00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:03.810
so what for my university the laws and
 

00:53:03.810 --> 00:53:08.500
so what for my university the laws and
forces to do this and to to have this

00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:08.510
forces to do this and to to have this
 

00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:14.810
forces to do this and to to have this
own service unit for treating with

00:53:14.810 --> 00:53:14.820
own service unit for treating with
 

00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:17.240
own service unit for treating with
intellectual properties and patterns and

00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:17.250
intellectual properties and patterns and
 

00:53:17.250 --> 00:53:19.910
intellectual properties and patterns and
licenses but for us it's really really a

00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920
licenses but for us it's really really a
 

00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:22.070
licenses but for us it's really really a
red number and there's nothing coming

00:53:22.070 --> 00:53:22.080
red number and there's nothing coming
 

00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:25.310
red number and there's nothing coming
out and it takes four ages and if you

00:53:25.310 --> 00:53:25.320
out and it takes four ages and if you
 

00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:27.950
out and it takes four ages and if you
have a cash cow this is very very rare

00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:27.960
have a cash cow this is very very rare
 

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:29.510
have a cash cow this is very very rare
and the question is whether it's

00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520
and the question is whether it's
 

00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:31.250
and the question is whether it's
worthwhile to have your efforts in this

00:53:31.250 --> 00:53:31.260
worthwhile to have your efforts in this
 

00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:33.650
worthwhile to have your efforts in this
as a public university to do so I think

00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:33.660
as a public university to do so I think
 

00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:35.930
as a public university to do so I think
it's not and there are better ways to

00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:35.940
it's not and there are better ways to
 

00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:38.930
it's not and there are better ways to
deal with industry and I think what's

00:53:38.930 --> 00:53:38.940
deal with industry and I think what's
 

00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:41.000
deal with industry and I think what's
very very important is a kind of

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:41.010
very very important is a kind of
 

00:53:41.010 --> 00:53:44.630
very very important is a kind of
confidence between industry and under

00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:44.640
confidence between industry and under
 

00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:46.820
confidence between industry and under
and the university how to deal with

00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:46.830
and the university how to deal with
 

00:53:46.830 --> 00:53:48.650
and the university how to deal with
these kind of things and then in the

00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:48.660
these kind of things and then in the
 

00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:51.290
these kind of things and then in the
future this may develop much much better

00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:51.300
future this may develop much much better
 

00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:54.400
future this may develop much much better
than for having certain rules

00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:54.410
than for having certain rules
 

00:53:54.410 --> 00:54:08.530
than for having certain rules
alright more questions from the audience

00:54:08.530 --> 00:54:08.540
 
 

00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:10.830
 
okay so the question was how do you see

00:54:10.830 --> 00:54:10.840
okay so the question was how do you see
 

00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:14.290
okay so the question was how do you see
sites like Wikipedia on the quality of

00:54:14.290 --> 00:54:14.300
sites like Wikipedia on the quality of
 

00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:16.870
sites like Wikipedia on the quality of
information and the information people

00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:16.880
information and the information people
 

00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:19.390
information and the information people
trust and apparently the answers your

00:54:19.390 --> 00:54:19.400
trust and apparently the answers your
 

00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:28.090
trust and apparently the answers your
students give to tests so I'm surprised

00:54:28.090 --> 00:54:28.100
students give to tests so I'm surprised
 

00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:30.820
students give to tests so I'm surprised
that people emphasize information again

00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:30.830
that people emphasize information again
 

00:54:30.830 --> 00:54:33.700
that people emphasize information again
and again here I think universities are

00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:33.710
and again here I think universities are
 

00:54:33.710 --> 00:54:36.190
and again here I think universities are
not about transmitting information at

00:54:36.190 --> 00:54:36.200
not about transmitting information at
 

00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:38.260
not about transmitting information at
least not now you can find that the

00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:38.270
least not now you can find that the
 

00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:40.300
least not now you can find that the
risks are about helping people ask the

00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:40.310
risks are about helping people ask the
 

00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:43.510
risks are about helping people ask the
right questions lures are about helping

00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:43.520
right questions lures are about helping
 

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:44.980
right questions lures are about helping
people make the right decisions

00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:44.990
people make the right decisions
 

00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:46.360
people make the right decisions
understanding trade-offs of these

00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:46.370
understanding trade-offs of these
 

00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:48.760
understanding trade-offs of these
decisions yes we do need data we need

00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:48.770
decisions yes we do need data we need
 

00:54:48.770 --> 00:54:51.910
decisions yes we do need data we need
information for that but so that's my

00:54:51.910 --> 00:54:51.920
information for that but so that's my
 

00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:53.320
information for that but so that's my
perspective that maybe you should

00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:53.330
perspective that maybe you should
 

00:54:53.330 --> 00:54:56.380
perspective that maybe you should
rethink as we all have Wikipedia our

00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:56.390
rethink as we all have Wikipedia our
 

00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:58.660
rethink as we all have Wikipedia our
fingertips what it is that we ever

00:54:58.660 --> 00:54:58.670
fingertips what it is that we ever
 

00:54:58.670 --> 00:55:00.520
fingertips what it is that we ever
should be doing you mentioned mr. st.

00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:00.530
should be doing you mentioned mr. st.
 

00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:01.930
should be doing you mentioned mr. st.
Vincent other times before actually I'm

00:55:01.930 --> 00:55:01.940
Vincent other times before actually I'm
 

00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:05.920
Vincent other times before actually I'm
not familiar with them but I think it

00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:05.930
not familiar with them but I think it
 

00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:08.740
not familiar with them but I think it
might be time to reflect in this very

00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:08.750
might be time to reflect in this very
 

00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:09.970
might be time to reflect in this very
different world in terms of

00:55:09.970 --> 00:55:09.980
different world in terms of
 

00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:12.310
different world in terms of
globalization in terms technology to

00:55:12.310 --> 00:55:12.320
globalization in terms technology to
 

00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:13.840
globalization in terms technology to
think what we should be giving our

00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:13.850
think what we should be giving our
 

00:55:13.850 --> 00:55:17.350
think what we should be giving our
students okay one else one answer that

00:55:17.350 --> 00:55:17.360
students okay one else one answer that
 

00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:20.980
students okay one else one answer that
yeah I I completely agree I think it is

00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:20.990
yeah I I completely agree I think it is
 

00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:23.020
yeah I I completely agree I think it is
not about the answer I really don't care

00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:23.030
not about the answer I really don't care
 

00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:26.710
not about the answer I really don't care
that the answer is right I really want

00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:26.720
that the answer is right I really want
 

00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:28.900
that the answer is right I really want
to see the process of thinking the

00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:28.910
to see the process of thinking the
 

00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:31.150
to see the process of thinking the
ability to come up with new questions

00:55:31.150 --> 00:55:31.160
ability to come up with new questions
 

00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:34.890
ability to come up with new questions
and answer other new problems in

00:55:34.890 --> 00:55:34.900
and answer other new problems in
 

00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:37.780
and answer other new problems in
independently and that process is not

00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:37.790
independently and that process is not
 

00:55:37.790 --> 00:55:40.450
independently and that process is not
going to be just learned by finding the

00:55:40.450 --> 00:55:40.460
going to be just learned by finding the
 

00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:44.590
going to be just learned by finding the
answer somewhere so this is this is very

00:55:44.590 --> 00:55:44.600
answer somewhere so this is this is very
 

00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:46.960
answer somewhere so this is this is very
important in education and that process

00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:46.970
important in education and that process
 

00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:49.210
important in education and that process
is very important dr. Hall the key one

00:55:49.210 --> 00:55:49.220
is very important dr. Hall the key one
 

00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:51.490
is very important dr. Hall the key one
yeah so part of what we teach our

00:55:51.490 --> 00:55:51.500
yeah so part of what we teach our
 

00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:53.110
yeah so part of what we teach our
students is how to discriminate between

00:55:53.110 --> 00:55:53.120
students is how to discriminate between
 

00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:55.450
students is how to discriminate between
authentic and valid information versus

00:55:55.450 --> 00:55:55.460
authentic and valid information versus
 

00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:57.700
authentic and valid information versus
something that might be biased or

00:55:57.700 --> 00:55:57.710
something that might be biased or
 

00:55:57.710 --> 00:56:00.970
something that might be biased or
something might be fabricated or are

00:56:00.970 --> 00:56:00.980
something might be fabricated or are
 

00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:04.180
something might be fabricated or are
just not true and a traditional way that

00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:04.190
just not true and a traditional way that
 

00:56:04.190 --> 00:56:07.120
just not true and a traditional way that
we operate within universities is is the

00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:07.130
we operate within universities is is the
 

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:10.390
we operate within universities is is the
peer review process so essentially you

00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400
peer review process so essentially you
 

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:12.790
peer review process so essentially you
find experts experts review it they say

00:56:12.790 --> 00:56:12.800
find experts experts review it they say
 

00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:14.230
find experts experts review it they say
whether it's good or bad they provide

00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:14.240
whether it's good or bad they provide
 

00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:15.760
whether it's good or bad they provide
comments and that leads to something

00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:15.770
comments and that leads to something
 

00:56:15.770 --> 00:56:17.920
comments and that leads to something
that in a way is certified as as

00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:17.930
that in a way is certified as as
 

00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:21.370
that in a way is certified as as
authentic Wikipedia doesn't exactly

00:56:21.370 --> 00:56:21.380
authentic Wikipedia doesn't exactly
 

00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:24.610
authentic Wikipedia doesn't exactly
work that way but it is created within a

00:56:24.610 --> 00:56:24.620
work that way but it is created within a
 

00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:26.140
work that way but it is created within a
community and it does have a way of

00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:26.150
community and it does have a way of
 

00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:28.690
community and it does have a way of
validation associated with it because

00:56:28.690 --> 00:56:28.700
validation associated with it because
 

00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:31.060
validation associated with it because
people have opportunity to make changes

00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:31.070
people have opportunity to make changes
 

00:56:31.070 --> 00:56:33.250
people have opportunity to make changes
to it and corrections and comments and

00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:33.260
to it and corrections and comments and
 

00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:35.620
to it and corrections and comments and
so forth I think we're evolving to a

00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:35.630
so forth I think we're evolving to a
 

00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:38.770
so forth I think we're evolving to a
different world where what is valid and

00:56:38.770 --> 00:56:38.780
different world where what is valid and
 

00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:40.630
different world where what is valid and
not valid is determined by different

00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:40.640
not valid is determined by different
 

00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:42.730
not valid is determined by different
means that in the past and I think that

00:56:42.730 --> 00:56:42.740
means that in the past and I think that
 

00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:45.160
means that in the past and I think that
does make it a new challenge for the

00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:45.170
does make it a new challenge for the
 

00:56:45.170 --> 00:56:47.020
does make it a new challenge for the
students as well as the faculty is how

00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:47.030
students as well as the faculty is how
 

00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:49.540
students as well as the faculty is how
to discriminate and you know many cases

00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:49.550
to discriminate and you know many cases
 

00:56:49.550 --> 00:56:51.970
to discriminate and you know many cases
Wikipedia is more accurate than things

00:56:51.970 --> 00:56:51.980
Wikipedia is more accurate than things
 

00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:54.400
Wikipedia is more accurate than things
that maybe validated through peer review

00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:54.410
that maybe validated through peer review
 

00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:57.370
that maybe validated through peer review
processes and we have to figure out in

00:56:57.370 --> 00:56:57.380
processes and we have to figure out in
 

00:56:57.380 --> 00:57:01.450
processes and we have to figure out in
the future how to do that ok ok one last

00:57:01.450 --> 00:57:01.460
the future how to do that ok ok one last
 

00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:43.240
the future how to do that ok ok one last
question Martin to give a question

00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:43.250
 
 

00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:45.710
 
so I think the question is basically

00:57:45.710 --> 00:57:45.720
so I think the question is basically
 

00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:47.660
so I think the question is basically
with all this information available out

00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:47.670
with all this information available out
 

00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:48.530
with all this information available out
on the Internet

on the Internet
how do we improve how we teach how do we

00:57:50.930 --> 00:57:50.940
how do we improve how we teach how do we
 

00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:53.840
how do we improve how we teach how do we
get students to ask better questions dr.

00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:53.850
get students to ask better questions dr.
 

00:57:53.850 --> 00:57:59.230
get students to ask better questions dr.
Sydney would you like - I think it is

00:57:59.230 --> 00:57:59.240
Sydney would you like - I think it is

Sydney would you like - I think it is
it's it's very big problem in some sense

00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:03.570
it's it's very big problem in some sense
 

00:58:03.570 --> 00:58:06.080
it's it's very big problem in some sense
because we need to change the way we

00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:06.090
because we need to change the way we
 

00:58:06.090 --> 00:58:09.710
because we need to change the way we
evaluate students you know and and and

evaluate students you know and and and
 

00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:14.600
evaluate students you know and and and
in some sense we need to change ways you

in some sense we need to change ways you
 

00:58:14.610 --> 00:58:17.980
in some sense we need to change ways you
know we evaluate our surface teachers

00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:17.990
know we evaluate our surface teachers
 

00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:23.090
know we evaluate our surface teachers
and I mean I personally don't have an

00:58:23.090 --> 00:58:23.100
and I mean I personally don't have an
 

00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:25.580
and I mean I personally don't have an
answer to this we need it's the only

00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:25.590
answer to this we need it's the only
 

00:58:25.590 --> 00:58:30.230
answer to this we need it's the only
thing that is that I can say is that we

00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240
thing that is that I can say is that we
 

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:32.960
thing that is that I can say is that we
have to go away from you know teaching

00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:32.970
have to go away from you know teaching
 

00:58:32.970 --> 00:58:35.600
have to go away from you know teaching
from the from a desk you know and move

00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:35.610
from the from a desk you know and move
 

00:58:35.610 --> 00:58:39.350
from the from a desk you know and move
toward doing research together or doing

00:58:39.350 --> 00:58:39.360
toward doing research together or doing
 

00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:42.410
toward doing research together or doing
activities together so again is is the

00:58:42.410 --> 00:58:42.420
activities together so again is is the
 

00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:45.590
activities together so again is is the
issue of investing our time in

00:58:45.590 --> 00:58:45.600
issue of investing our time in
 

00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:47.750
issue of investing our time in
activities which really requires our

00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:47.760
activities which really requires our
 

00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:50.420
activities which really requires our
intervention you know leaving aside all

00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:50.430
intervention you know leaving aside all
 

00:58:50.430 --> 00:58:53.360
intervention you know leaving aside all
the activities that can be you know all

00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:53.370
the activities that can be you know all
 

00:58:53.370 --> 00:58:55.850
the activities that can be you know all
the teaching that that can be thought by

00:58:55.850 --> 00:58:55.860
the teaching that that can be thought by
 

00:58:55.860 --> 00:58:59.600
the teaching that that can be thought by
question and answer and you know in that

00:58:59.600 --> 00:58:59.610
question and answer and you know in that
 

00:58:59.610 --> 00:59:02.990
question and answer and you know in that
respect I work on the robotics and in

00:59:02.990 --> 00:59:03.000
respect I work on the robotics and in
 

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.210
respect I work on the robotics and in
that respect I think robots are really

00:59:05.210 --> 00:59:05.220
that respect I think robots are really
 

00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:08.780
that respect I think robots are really
very very interesting teaching tools

00:59:08.780 --> 00:59:08.790
very very interesting teaching tools
 

00:59:08.790 --> 00:59:11.090
very very interesting teaching tools
because you can teach using robots you

00:59:11.090 --> 00:59:11.100
because you can teach using robots you
 

00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:14.180
because you can teach using robots you
can teach a lot of different disciplines

00:59:14.180 --> 00:59:14.190
can teach a lot of different disciplines
 

00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:17.240
can teach a lot of different disciplines
and with with and so on and you know you

00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:17.250
and with with and so on and you know you
 

00:59:17.250 --> 00:59:22.820
and with with and so on and you know you
can go in-depth into that ok it's

00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:22.830
can go in-depth into that ok it's
 

00:59:22.830 --> 00:59:25.100
can go in-depth into that ok it's
getting late so what we're gonna do is

00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:25.110
getting late so what we're gonna do is
 

00:59:25.110 --> 00:59:29.109
