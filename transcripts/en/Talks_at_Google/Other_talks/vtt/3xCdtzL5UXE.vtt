EVAN WITTENBERG: Good afternoon, everyone.
Thank you very much for coming.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.980
My name is Evan Wittenberg and I head up Global
Leadership Development

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.430
here at Google.
And it is my distinct honor and pleasure to

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.890
introduce and welcome my
former colleague and good friend, Professor

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.330
Mike Useem, to Google.
I've been trying to get Mike here for three

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.930
years, ever since I
started.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.461
Mike is the Egan Professor of Management at
the Wharton School and has

00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:28.500
been teaching there for 15 years or so.
And he also is the director of Wharton Center

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.190
for Leadership and
Change.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.320
He's written countless books, all of which
get wonderful reviews and

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.870
are really good reads.
And I could talk to you all day about Mike

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.780
and what a great leader he
is and colleague he is, but I thought it would

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.250
be better to have
somebody who is a former student of Mike's

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.220
comes up and tell you a
little bit about him, so Gopi Kallayil, who

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.920
is the lead for the Product
Marketing Team for Search Advertising and

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.040
a former student of Mike's is
going to come up and do that part of the introduction.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:10.380
Gopi Kallayil: Thanks, Evan.
In 2002, I had a momentary lapse of reason

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.310
and signed up for a
experiential leadership program that took

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.970
us all on an expedition to
Mount Everest base camp.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.430
Due to political trouble in Nepal that year,
the expedition leader

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.670
decided to move the expedition to Mount Kanchenjunga
in the Himalayas.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.590
It's the third highest mountain in the world
and extremely demanding.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.420
The course was intended to be a experiential
leadership course, so the

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.710
first day, the leader of the program asked
me to be leader for a day.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.420
And at that very first day, we were caught
in the midst of the worse

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:56.580
Himalayan storm had ever seen.
These fierce winds -- that's experiential

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.120
leadership with Matt Kolinsky
on the other end.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.259
So we were caught on this worst Himalayan
storm ever seen with crazy

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:09.909
winds and sheets of ice everywhere.
One of the members of the group, Lynn Dan,

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:14.709
told me that evening, as she
was sitting in this tent about to blown away

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.489
that this was the first
ever night out in a tent --

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.719
[laughter]
-- and how terrified she was.

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:28.980
So these situations involve real -- in a difficult
life situations.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.189
Because during that one day, I had to make
decisions that took into

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:36.799
account the safety and well-being of the other
members of the group,

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:42.919
the Sherpas, and even the yaks that carried
our baggage up the

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:48.189
mountains.
The leader of that expedition was Mike Useem.

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:51.580
And this is how he teaches his student leadership
but not by using two

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.540
by two metrics as -- but by actually putting
people in the midst of

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.519
difficult life situations where you have to
call for your leadership

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.540
that can effect the life and well-being of
other people.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.189
I've had the pleasure, privilege, and honor
of being Mike's student at

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:10.870
the Wharton School of Business at the University
of Pennsylvania, where

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.370
as Evan mentioned, he's also the Director
for Center for Leadership and

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.299
Change.
And yes, Mike is a scholar.

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:22.459
He's the author of more than five books, including
his latest, which

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.879
he'll talk about today, "The Go Point: When
It's Time to Decide".

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:32.779
But what was endeared Mike to me as a teacher
is the fact that he's a

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:36.939
fantastic storyteller.
And the way he likes to teach leadership is

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:40.760
either by putting his
students in certain situations or making them

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.150
walk through the
leadership situations of other leaders who

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.989
may have led Everest
expeditions or led smoke jumpers or been in

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.329
civil war battlefields.
With that as an introduction, I'm delighted

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.859
to present before you Mike
Useem from the Wharton School.

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:57.859
Mike?

00:03:57.859 --> 00:03:58.859
[applause]

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:06.469
MIKE USEEM: All right, everybody.
Good.

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:13.199
We're about to do this as a tandem.
Anyway, my privilege to be here.

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:16.790
I know this is a very brief opportunity for
us to have a dialogue and

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.209
we're really going to make it a dialogue.
So we're going to make this an active workshop,

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.820
be ready.
A couple people have helped me out with some

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.689
of your names.
So I know that Paul is sitting right over

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:29.930
here.
So, Paul, you'll be ready, right?

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.510
And right behind Paul I think is Jenny, right?
Okay.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.159
So be ready, Jenny for a throwback of a dialogue
here.

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:42.629
I'm going to start this way.
The topic is making decisions.

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:47.159
And it's almost true by definition, if you
think about Meg Whitman,

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:51.870
maybe your future governor; or the current
governor; or John McCain; or

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.979
Hillary Clinton; or Barack Obama, people in
a position of leadership

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:02.729
responsibilities do have to be ready to make
and timely decisions.

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:07.520
Good and timely.
That's a formulation because often those two

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.050
criteria for decision
making work against each other.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:16.659
In fact, we have a phrase to indicate maybe
one end of a spectrum.

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:19.870
If somebody "shoots from the hip," they've
made a decision that's fast

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:26.159
be it may not be very good.
Other end of the spectrum, analysis paralysis,

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:29.020
perfect decision.
It just took a long time to reach it.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:35.770
We want to find the sweet spot somehow in-between.
We want it to be good and timely.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.150
And that's the agenda I'm going to work with
you for literally about

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.360
35 minutes here.
It's going to work best, if you wouldn't mind,

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.759
since this is a
workshop.

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:47.330
If you would think now about the decisions
you have made, the decisions

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.040
people that you have admired in politics or
at this company or in the

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.629
community, they have made.
Start thinking about what makes for good and

00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:00.180
timely decisions.
This is about making decisions when somebody

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:06.050
else is looking to you for
the leadership you are obliged to exercise.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.910
To get us going, on the premise that I think
we often think about these

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:16.469
issues most tangibly, which also means most
memorably, if we can see

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:20.449
these ideas embedded in experience, your own
or that of others.

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:24.680
So I have a test here.
I'm going to ask Paul to see if he can answer

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.870
this question, Paul, or
Jenny for that matter, I challenge you -- I

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.009
think you're not going to
be able to answer this question to help us

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:37.169
remember who Gustavus W.
Smith is.

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:41.260
Gustavus W. Smith.
This is really a -- this is a tough one.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.840
This is obscure.
But Jenny, you remember who Robert E. Lee

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.680
is right?
Confederate General Robert E. Lee, Paul, you're

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.080
okay on that?
Okay.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.419
Strictly speaking, keep this in mind, Robert
E. Lee, one of the great

00:06:53.419 --> 00:07:01.639
commanders of the Confederacy, was preceded
in office by a Gustavus W.

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:05.189
Smith.
I'd like you to see what he looked like.

00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:09.969
This will help us focus on what we're referencing
here.

00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:13.699
Gustavus Smith, upper left-hand corner.
I think everybody is just blanking.

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:19.949
You've thought about Jeb Stewart and Ulysses
S. Grant and Robert E.

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:24.280
Lee and George Mead, and Sheridan and Sherman,
but we're a little bit

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.349
stuck on Smith even though he was one of the
Confederacy's great

00:07:28.349 --> 00:07:34.960
commanding officers.
And here's why he's totally forgettable: June

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:43.229
1st, 1862 -- it's a
tough to see map up there -- the United States,

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:49.039
in mortal conflict now
with the Confederacy which is created in 1861.

00:07:49.039 --> 00:07:54.210
South Carolina quits, 11 -- 10 other states
joined to form the CSofA

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:59.180
the Confederate States of America, and in
the spring of 1862, the

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:06.509
United States, the 22 remaining states, decide
 -- it decides to end the

00:08:06.509 --> 00:08:12.419
Civil War, 1862.
It, of course, won't end until 1865, but the

00:08:12.419 --> 00:08:16.330
U.S. decides to end the
war in 1862 or least it thought it could,

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:23.259
Abraham Lincoln presiding
leader of the moment, by sending a force -- arrow

00:08:23.259 --> 00:08:27.349
on the right-hand
side of that photograph or that map rather

00:08:27.349 --> 00:08:32.130
there -- from Washington
down to what is then called, still is called

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:37.860
Fort Monroe not to far
from Norfolk, Virginia, and to march up then,

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:42.229
still called the
Peninsula to attack Richmond, the capital

00:08:42.229 --> 00:08:46.370
of the Confederacy.
The premise, a little bit false, but accepted

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:50.760
at the time is that if
you could capture Jefferson Davis, President

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:55.130
of the breakaway
Confederate States of America and take over

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:59.570
his White House in
Richmond, Virginia, maybe capture a good bit

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:02.529
of the defending forces,
that could end the Civil War.

00:09:02.529 --> 00:09:08.560
That's the plan.
So 125,000 U.S. soldiers are landed are Fort

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:13.880
Monroe -- lower right-hand
corner in that map -- and they begin to march

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.589
in a northwestern
direction towards Richmond.

00:09:16.589 --> 00:09:21.240
A little hard to see but it's in the upper
left-hand corner there.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:25.959
If you're Jefferson Davis, you're concerned
about the army that's

00:09:25.959 --> 00:09:32.690
defending the capital.
It's about 65,000 strong only, led by commanding

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:37.269
officer Joseph
Johnston, outnumbered 2 to 1.

00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:41.740
Of course, you got home court advantage, Johnston
is defending

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:47.230
Richmond, home -- home field.
Still, 2 to 1.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:51.060
It does not look maybe all that promising
for Jefferson Davis because

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:54.940
he knows if he's captured, he'll probably
be hung.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.650
So there's a little bit of a personal concern
here not to mention his

00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:01.910
concern about the future of the country that
leads him -- in an era

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:07.870
without any Nexus One telephones or even a
Blackberry, to go out to see

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:11.730
what's going on in the frontline.
It's hard to believe there was such an era,

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:19.260
but in 1862, May 31st, 1862
anyway, Joseph Johnston, the commanding officer

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:24.399
of the Confederate
force that is preventing the fall of Richmond,

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:28.070
the frontline of Joe
Johnston's defensive line around Richmond

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:33.630
is only about five miles from
the center of town -- Jefferson Davis, President,

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:38.639
rides out, this as if
Barack Obama decides to pick up and go to

00:10:38.639 --> 00:10:42.960
Kandahar, Afghanistan, to see
what's going directly in the field.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:47.449
That's exactly what Joe Johnston now has at
his back as his boss

00:10:47.449 --> 00:10:53.800
Jeff Davis goes out to take a look.
Jefferson Davis, within a few feet of Joe

00:10:53.800 --> 00:11:01.110
Johnston, sees Joe hit by
shrapnel and hit by a bullet at the same time.

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:08.089
This is May 31st, 1862, not fatal.
Jefferson Davis walks over and says something

00:11:08.089 --> 00:11:10.000
like this, "Joe, you're
not looking too good right now".

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.880
And Joe says, "Well, sir, I've been -- maybe
mortally wounded, to tell

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:19.790
you the truth".
It's not but it's a very serious injury, and

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:24.210
so Joe Johnston is asked
by Jeff Davis -- Jefferson Davis, to show

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:29.990
the right respect here, is
asked who his replacement is that hopefully

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:33.889
will defend Richmond
against its eminent overrun by the United

00:11:33.889 --> 00:11:40.360
States of America.
He says my number two guy, Gustavus W. Smith

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:46.070
is my able replacement.
Gustavus W. Smith, a career which actually

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:50.670
looks very good.
A bearing which is professional, sounded and

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:55.600
looked like, has a CV that
is very leadership-like as well.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.759
Looks like a leader, acts like a leader, the
resume says it all, West

00:11:59.759 --> 00:12:04.600
Point has risen up to the number two person
in the army that's

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:08.800
defending Richmond against it's eminent overrunning
by the United

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:16.209
States, he -- on the spot, this is a literal
statement now, gets a

00:12:16.209 --> 00:12:22.050
battlefield promotion.
So Gustavus Smith, his boss down, Jeff Davis

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:26.089
walks over and says, "Gus,
you're it.

00:12:26.089 --> 00:12:30.800
I hereby appoint you commanding officer of
the Army of Northern

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:38.529
Virginia and you're going to prevent my hanging.
I hope you got some ideas now to do that".

00:12:38.529 --> 00:12:42.610
Gustavus Smith, this hand, gives a salute.
"Thank you for the battlefield promotion.

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:46.290
I've always wanted to be a commanding officer.
I'm going to write home about this my kids

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:50.060
are going to show me some
respect now".

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:56.339
At that point, Jefferson Davis says to Gustavus
W. Smith, "Gus, now that

00:12:56.339 --> 00:13:02.430
you're in charge of saving the Confederacy,
what's your plan"?

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:05.090
And Gustavus Smith, keep in mind, he is number
two, this is as if Joe

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:08.779
Biden suddenly becomes President, he's probably
had to think about what

00:13:08.779 --> 00:13:13.540
he's might to do, Gustavus Smith says, "Give
me a few minutes to think

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:20.940
about that, sir".
That's a little bit of a setback to his president.

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:26.069
Jefferson Davis wanders off, returns 24 hours
later, and says, "Joe --

00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:29.980
Gus, rather.
Gus, you've had time now to give some thought

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:33.009
to your strategic plan,
what is it"?

00:13:33.009 --> 00:13:40.701
And Gustavus W. Smith famously, or infamously,
says, "Sir, to tell you

00:13:40.701 --> 00:13:47.269
the truth, I've got no plan.
Do you have any good ideas"?

00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:54.290
Now, Jeff Davis had many well-known flaws,
one of which, though -- it

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:59.379
was not -- was he was able to make good and
timely decisions.

00:13:59.379 --> 00:14:07.500
He said on the spot, "Gus, I hate to tell
you, but you are history".

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:11.500
Actually, the opposite.
But we use that phrase, you're history, you're

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:15.899
fired.
And Gustavus W. Smith becomes, in a sense,

00:14:15.899 --> 00:14:19.879
part of our non-history,
completely forgotten.

00:14:19.879 --> 00:14:25.170
But he is fired 24 hours later because Jefferson
Davis had a great

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:31.449
leader, a commanding officer of a huge army,
65,000 strong that when

00:14:31.449 --> 00:14:36.230
all was said and given command, put in a leadership
position, could not

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:40.860
take command.
Unable to make a decision, unable to conjure

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:44.660
up a plan within which to
make decisions.

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:50.790
At this point, to finish off this account,
Jefferson Davis says to his

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:57.600
military aide standing right over here named
Robert E. Lee, Davis says

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:02.639
"Bob, are you busy right now"?
And Lee says, "Of course not, sir, whatever

00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:09.800
you would like".
Robert E. Lee a long career in the Armed Services.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.050
When the war begins he is still a colonel
which is a below a General

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:18.069
Officer, but now he's the military aide to
Jefferson Davis.

00:15:18.069 --> 00:15:25.709
And on June 1st, 1862, here's the phrase -- Robert
E. Lee comes to

00:15:25.709 --> 00:15:31.210
command, it's a phrase.
Jeff Davis says to Lee, "With Gustavus Smith

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:34.709
gone, I'd like you to
become the commanding officer of the Army

00:15:34.709 --> 00:15:40.170
of Northern Virginia".
Lee takes command, didn't look a whole lot

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:45.319
different from Gustavus
Smith by way of resume, by way of deportment,

00:15:45.319 --> 00:15:50.490
demeanor, you name it.
But the difference was Lee could make decisions

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:55.980
timely, never perfect,
but usually pretty good and Smith could not.

00:15:55.980 --> 00:16:01.259
Hence, in the United States now there are
about 60 Robert E. Lee

00:16:01.259 --> 00:16:05.680
elementary schools.
There are no Gustavus W. Smith elementary

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:10.189
schools.
And arguably one difference, among several,

00:16:10.189 --> 00:16:14.610
is that Robert E Lee was
pretty good at the art of making good and

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:19.600
timely decisions.
Just to finish this off to make the point,

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:25.279
Lee takes command June 1st,
the forward observers for the Union Army called

00:16:25.279 --> 00:16:31.560
the Army of the Potomac
can see the spires of downtown Richmond but

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.509
that's as close as they're
ever going to get.

00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:39.779
Lee takes command makes a series of somewhat
 -- sometimes flawed, but

00:16:39.779 --> 00:16:45.060
usually very timely decisions and ultimately
pushes an army twice its

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:51.860
size away from Richmond, off the Peninsula.
And by the way, the Union Army -- it's a name

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:57.180
some of you will recall
-- the Union Army is commanded by a 34-year

00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:02.980
old named George McClellan.
And McClellan, with twice the force that Lee

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:08.130
has, is defeated by Lee on
the Peninsula, Abraham Lincoln fires McClellan

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:10.080
for the first of two
times.

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:14.270
McClellan, a little bit also known for the
analysis paralysis.

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:19.520
One end of the pole.
He was a commanding officer, fantastic.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.400
Soldiers loved him.
And they loved him in part because he would

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:28.030
wait until everything was
perfect before he would do anything with the

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:32.160
Army.
He had a case of analysis paralysis.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:36.330
It was often said during that era, George
McClellan would like every

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:40.420
solider who ever worked for him to retire
as a veteran never having

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:43.880
fired a shot.
Because everything was not perfect ever for

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:48.350
McClellan before he would
finally issue an order to attack -- Lee had

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:51.000
 -- did not suffer from
analysis paralysis.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.620
He defeats McClellan on the Peninsula.
I know the prolongation of Confederacy is

00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:00.580
not necessarily something we
admire, probably is not.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.020
But the point I want to leave us with is the
difference between a

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:11.200
Robert E. Lee and Gustavus W. Smith is not
the ability to think

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.930
strategically, they were both pretty good
at that.

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:19.070
They both look like a leader ought to look,
call that demeanor.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:22.660
But one of the enormous and enduring and historical
differences -- one

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:26.740
could make good and timely decisions, the
other could not.

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:31.770
My guess is many of you have worked for a
boss along the way.

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:35.640
You don't fit this description, but a boss
who was either suffering

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.590
from shooting from the hip or analysis paralysis,
one end of the

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:42.330
spectrum or the other.
We're going to work for a few minutes on getting

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:50.220
a formula to find the
sweet spot so we can make good and timely

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.780
decisions.
I'm going to add a couple thoughts from the

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:57.050
field of research and
experience on this, but before I do that,

00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:59.630
Paul, if you can get us
going, I'm going to ask to you to use your

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:02.350
best stage voice so
everybody can hear.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:08.410
What do you think defines for you personally
 -- what is the factor that

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:10.611
helps you makes good and timely decisions?

00:19:10.611 --> 00:19:16.250
PAUL: Sure, so I just made the comment that
what is good decision

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:19.450
making all about to me, it's a matter of having
confidence that you're

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:24.530
ready to make the decision.
When are you ready is when you have a well-thought

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:28.820
through rationale
that usually is data-based, and I think especially

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:33.030
at Google we prize
that, rather than just making decisions based

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:34.030
on emotions.

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:37.690
MIKE USEEM: But if you think about leadership
more generally, think

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:40.590
about yourself, think about people that lead
this company, the people

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:45.330
that you may work for, people who may work
for you, active listening is

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:49.250
a pretty good quality.
To hear what the customers want, what people

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:53.570
are looking for in terms
of value proposition, so hear what Paul has

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:55.170
said.
And now we're going to hear from Jenny in

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:56.240
an active listening sense.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:01.310
JENNY: I have to agree with Paul, I think
data is a really important

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:05.260
factor in making any decision.
I think it would also be helpful to have a

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:10.291
vision and data that
supports both things that agree with that

00:20:10.291 --> 00:20:14.650
decision and maybe aspects of
that vision that might not end up panning

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:17.990
out.
So data to support both sides.

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:20.210
MIKE USEEM: Great, Jenny, thank you.
Well-put.

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:23.780
At this point, I think I've give up on the
cold calling.

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:26.200
Thank you for being cold called and willing
to stand up here.

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:30.450
Who else would like to add a thought here
making good and timely

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:33.970
decisions?
This is going to get Rachel off the hook here,

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:36.160
if we can get somebody
to volunteer.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:44.720
Rachel, I guess it's going to be you.
Would you mind?

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:45.720
Thank you.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:56.910
RACHEL: I'd like to thank Gopi for giving
you my name.

00:20:56.910 --> 00:21:02.680
I think an important quality and a good decision
maker is the ability to

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:07.380
look past the immediate impact and understand
how your -- how your

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:15.720
decision will influence the outcome further
down the road and being

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.767
able to plan for that and factor that into
your decision process.

00:21:18.767 --> 00:21:20.100
MIKE USEEM: Great, very well-put.
Thank you on that one.

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:23.540
Anyone else want to volunteer a thought?
And I think there is some value -- there is

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:27.870
value in doing this.
It's pretty much your working philosophy,

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:31.490
we're all collectively
responsible.

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:36.080
And all of us can think better about just
about anything if we pool our

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:39.030
collective knowledge.
I think I see a hand here, oh, thank you.

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:40.570
Would you mind standing up with the microphone?

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:50.160
&gt;&gt; I think at a certain level you have to
comfortable with winging it.

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:53.370
MIKE USEEM: You do.
And say more about that.

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:59.220
&gt;&gt; Well, I mean, personally, my personal style
is I tend to have

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:04.330
analysis paralysis, but -- but because the
data -- you always want the

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:08.260
data to be complete.
And it's -- it's probably never complete but

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:13.430
in the short-term and the
timely side of things, it's really not complete.

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:15.500
So I guess if you're really on top of it,
and you're going to set up as

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:16.500
a good leader, you've probably done some preparation
beforehand, so you

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:26.750
kind of are already on the right track but
then you just wing it.

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:27.770
And stick to it.

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:29.060
MIKE USEEM: That's good.
Great.

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:30.340
Tell us who you are.

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:31.340
&gt;&gt; Oh, Sandra.

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:35.020
MIKE USEEM: Thank you very much.
Now, let's take these four great statements.

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:38.210
I'm going to add from the world of academic
research and a little

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:45.280
experience a couple more thoughts.
By the way, though, as we develop our framework

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:49.000
for making good and
timely decisions, it's a completely pointless

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.910
exercise if we can't take
those ideas and translate them into what we

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:56.200
do.
So we're going to worry a little bit about

00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:00.480
taking ideas into action,
concept into behavior.

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:04.181
That's all a way of giving you the heads up,
we have a final exam

00:23:04.181 --> 00:23:07.040
coming in about ten minutes.
So be alert.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:12.670
I want you to use some of these ideas.
Here are a couple more thoughts to flesh out

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:15.550
or add to what you just
hear I'm going to skip over a couple items

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:19.320
here.
If anybody worked with John Chambers directly

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:23.870
over the years?
Okay, is he up the street or down the street

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:28.170
from here?
South, okay.

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:30.870
John Chambers.
He is a survivor, you know that.

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:36.870
1995 came to run Cisco Systems and he's pretty
well-known for many

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:39.910
things.
He's got a great stage presence, comes out

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:41.760
of marketing, knows how to
run an off-site.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:48.801
He's also given to a pretty good record of
friendly acquisition.

00:23:48.801 --> 00:23:54.400
Now you've done a lot of that.
He's got a record of building, partly organically,

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:58.150
Cisco from what it
was to what it is, but partly through many,

00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:01.780
many always friendly
acquisitions.

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:05.350
Many companies are called to sell out to John,
few are chosen.

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:09.570
His track record, generally speaking by at
least academic assessment,

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:13.950
is pretty good for picking winners and avoiding
those that he should

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:18.840
not have acquired.
I had read that, ran into John Chambers at

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:20.300
an event a couple of years
ago.

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:24.700
And I offered up the following, "John, you're
pretty well known for

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:29.630
making good decisions when it comes to acquisition,
what's your secret"?

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:34.760
And this is what he offered up.
He said, "Well, let's see, proposal comes

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:39.550
my way from my strategy team,
the investment bank, our outside advisor has

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:43.470
given us an evaluation
that we ought to be ready to pay up around

00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:49.630
 -- and then my secret is the
following: Before I decide -- and it's always

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:55.350
these are binary, either
we buy or we don't -- I turn to my two secret

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:59.050
weapons, Larry Carter and
John Morgridge".

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:04.211
Larry Carter, Chief Financial Officer; John
Morgridge, former CEO and

00:25:04.211 --> 00:25:09.210
now non-executive, at that time, couple years
ago, Chair of the Board.

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:11.600
Larry Carter is gone but at the time he was
CFO.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:15.580
I said, "Okay, well when you turn to them
what's the deal"?

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:20.380
And he says, "Investment bank has done its
thing, strategy team has done

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:25.020
its due diligence, and then I say, 'Larry,
what do you really think?

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:29.950
Is this a good deal for us or not'?
And then I turn to Morgridge, 'John, what

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:34.960
do you think'"?
And then John Chambers completely stumped

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:39.690
me.
Stopped me on the spot, when he said the following:

00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:43.830
"I go to Larry and
I go to John Morgridge because they know the

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:46.830
company, number one, as
well as I do.

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:54.150
I get a second extremely informed opinion,
and equally importantly,

00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:59.700
they don't want my job".
And I'm thinking, what does that have to do

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:02.670
with getting a good piece
of internal advice?

00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:06.960
So I said, "John, what do you mean by that"?
So what did he mean by that?

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:14.650
So to use a scientific phrase, they're not
kissing up, so more

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:15.650
objective.

00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:19.120
[off microphone]: They don't want to see you
fail.

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:23.300
MIKE USEEM: Now that's such a statement.
Actually bold statements are amazing.

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:27.610
You want somebody who's not trying to ingratiate
himself or herself,

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:32.430
you want somebody that is not ready to see
you fail so they can get

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:35.920
your job.
Such an amazing -- can you imagine a Chief

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:40.100
Financial Officer who
wouldn't give you good, honest fully disclosing

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:43.680
advice?
I guess we've said we know human nature enough

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:48.450
to know that personal
self-interest gets in the way of good decision

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:53.590
making.
That's a way of saying, and here's now a principle

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:57.220
for making good and
timely decisions, having somebody at your

00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:03.760
elbow, well-informed, but
able to give you unbiased, non-self-serving,

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:10.020
catholic with a small "C"
line of advice.

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:13.210
A professional colleague of mine has taken
this into the research

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:19.510
terrain, I offer up her formulation very briefly
here.

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:22.920
If you've been through the Stanford Engineering
Program or the B

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:27.740
school, that is, I think, up the street here,
you may have run into

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:32.740
Kathy Eisenhardt?
Has anybody worked with Kathy Eisenhardt?

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:34.600
This is what she did.
Great study.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:39.490
She went out in this vicinity, found a bunch
of hardware and software

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:46.240
makers, put them into two buckets: The slow
movers and fast movers.

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:49.360
Slow movers would take eight months to get
a product out the door that

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:54.080
the fast movers would take four months.
The product was no better, just took more

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:59.450
time.
By the way, which bucket is Google in?

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:01.900
Okay.
The fast movers -- I see some -- super fast.

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:05.080
You're over, actually, way over on this side
of the screen.

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:08.100
So let's see -- take a look at that third
bullet right there, one of

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:11.940
the findings, inductive.
She's like an ethnographer in anthropology.

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:15.340
What's the difference between the fast movers
and the slow movers?

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:19.200
And she found that the fast movers tended
to have decision makers like

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:25.300
your own, like you, who had on the inside
 -- look at the phrase, an

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:30.750
experience counselor -- unbiased, non-self-serving,
not an outside

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:36.320
McKenzie or BCG or Bain but an insider.
Take a look at the next one.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:40.400
This breaks my heart coming from Quaker Philadelphia,
where consensus

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:45.500
is king or queen, she found that at the fast
movers, they were ready to

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:50.890
take action without 100 percent consensus
being formed around the

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:54.010
decision yet to be made.
Partial consensus.

00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:57.520
I've another way of getting at this and if
you look very carefully for

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:02.380
extra credit, you can find Evan Wittenberg,
on screen here.

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:05.160
[off microphone]: Just right of center.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:08.650
MIKE USEEM: Yeah, just a little bit right
of center, crouching down,

00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:15.360
your own Evan Wittenberg.
This is the learning formula so to speak that

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:21.330
we acquire when we take
our MBA students, 90 strong, twice a year

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:24.370
for a day and a half with the
U.S. Marine Corps.

00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:28.320
We do that not to turn them into Marines,
we still want our tuition to

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:35.240
be paid for two full years.
We do this so that we can learn about good

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:38.360
and timely decisions under a
lot of pressure which is the what the Marine

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:41.510
mission is all about.
Get in, get the job done, do it well, and

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:48.660
get out.
And Evan and others here are hearing a four-point

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:51.760
formulation.
Good and timely decision making check it out.

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:57.530
Just look at the statements here.
Number one, an officer -- this goes back to

00:29:57.530 --> 00:30:03.120
what we were just talking
about -- an officer goes for 70 percent assured-ness,

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:07.460
70 percent
confidence, 70 percent due diligence, 70 percent

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:12.320
agreement.
Not 50, but not 99.

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:19.510
70 percent, a little bit of an artificial,
overly specified measure.

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:21.830
Ann Livermore, some of you have worked with
her over at Hewlett

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:26.270
Packard, she often talks 60 percent.
It doesn't matter.

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:30.500
It's a metaphor for getting a lot of the way
there but not letting

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:37.330
perfect get in the way of a timely decision.
Look at the next line, learning to be totally

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:40.840
clear-minded to the staff
that works for you.

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:46.310
Unambiguous about intent.
Don't try to micromanage, assuming you got

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:50.350
great people on your team.
That leads to the third statement there, which

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:55.120
is this: You have to
develop a tolerance for error.

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:59.920
It's obvious.
If we're going for 70 percent confidence,

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:02.470
analysis, we're going to make
mistakes.

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:08.220
You have to develop a tolerance for errors.
But there's a caveat on that, not stated,

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:13.340
but it's pretty obvious.
Allow people who work for you to make an error

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:18.140
once, ask them to report
to you that they won't make that error again

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:23.560
because now they know
about the error of their way, so error, first

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.640
time, a great source of
schooling.

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:31.080
Second time, that's a serious mistake that
we can't allow to stand.

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:36.030
Mistakes are tolerated, first time.
Fourth statement is this: Indecisiveness is

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:42.350
fatal.
I'll make that a little bit more softly put,

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:46.520
in a position of
leadership, if you are indecisive you have

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:52.990
unequivocally probably taken
the wrong vow for your career.

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:58.680
Now this is a bit of a formulation.
I said we're coming to a final exam here.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:04.920
Have we missed anything by way of -- and I
tend to call it a template,

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:08.740
a set of guidelines for yourself, we've had
four people describe

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:12.960
theirs.
Here are a couple thoughts prior screen from

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:18.600
the world of academe, U.S.
Marine Corps, is there anything else that

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:23.370
we ought to keep in mind when
it comes to guiding ourselves and how to make

00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:24.581
good and timely
decisions?

00:32:24.581 --> 00:32:25.581
Yes?

00:32:25.581 --> 00:32:30.660
[off microphone]: I think preparations are
key to making decisions no matter how often.

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:37.690
MIKE USEEM: You're going to have to walk up
here and get you on the

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:38.690
air.

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:39.690
[PAUSE]

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:40.690
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
I've found preparation as being one of the

00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:41.690
key to making
decisions no matter how often I face that

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:42.690
situation.
Is this the first time?

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:45.750
If it is the first time, I think you look
for more data but if I've

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:47.010
been in that situation before, you'll be able
to ask the right

00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:49.260
questions.
And also I've been able to integrate probabilities.

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:50.660
How much information do you need to be more
than 50 percent right?

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:56.350
Do you need 100 percent information?
With this information, can you be confidence

00:32:56.350 --> 00:33:00.500
that you're 70 percent
right at least.

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:05.180
And then you can make the decision.

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:08.610
MIKE USEEM: Let me pick up on that.
Many of you have read the great book by Malcolm

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:13.690
Gladwell called Blank
It's All About Decision Making.

00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:16.620
He makes -- there's a secondary point in there
which is sometimes

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:21.780
overlooked that intuition is extremely valuable
but it's only as good

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:26.890
as it's informed by your past experience.
And my own view, the best people out there

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:30.990
for making decisions are
those that look back on decisions they have

00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:35.900
made and others have made,
and you stick that into the back of your intuitions

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:39.630
so that it's
informed intuition.

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:42.480
After action review, looking back on everything
 -- I'll make this very

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:45.500
tangible, going to come to final exam now
in 60 seconds.

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:50.910
I interviewed the Chief Executive a couple
years ago of Lenovo, big PC

00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:57.860
maker who bought the IBM PC line back in '05.
World's fourth largest PC maker these days,

00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:02.430
Liu Chuanzhi is his name, I
said how did you ever get into running a company

00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:05.910
because you began as a
computer scientist for the Chinese Academy

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:11.259
of Sciences?
And he says, I got a pretty good intuition

00:34:11.259 --> 00:34:15.710
because every Friday, I sit
down with whoever reports to me, we go over

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:17.450
every decision during the
week.

00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:21.970
What was good, what was flawed, how can we
do better next week.

00:34:21.970 --> 00:34:28.190
No formal training, no MBA, no nothing.
But self-training created an intuition which

00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:31.039
has been pretty good.
Final exam, here we go.

00:34:31.039 --> 00:34:39.519
Take all that we've said, I'm going to take
us to a fateful day.

00:34:39.519 --> 00:34:41.039
1865 -- I'm going to skip over a bunch of
things here.

00:34:41.039 --> 00:34:43.350
It's going to make you a little bit dizzy.
Pardon me on this.

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:52.210
Oh, wow, we're getting dizzy here.
Fateful day.

00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:58.280
This is April 9th, 1865, Robert E. Lee survives,
wins on the Peninsula

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:05.710
back in 1862, never gives up command.
Lincoln was replacing generals every few months.

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:09.759
Once Lee takes command, and remember the date,
June 1st, 1862, he never

00:35:09.759 --> 00:35:13.339
gives up command because he was as good as
they come.

00:35:13.339 --> 00:35:16.890
But he's defeated finally near Appomattox,
Virginia.

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:22.049
April 9th, 1865, Lee surrenders.
Many paintings, no photographs.

00:35:22.049 --> 00:35:26.599
I've got one shown here.
He surrenders to Ulysses S. Grant.

00:35:26.599 --> 00:35:30.460
Grant, in his wisdom, sends a telegram to
President Lincoln, I have the

00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:35.240
privilege of announcing to you that the South's
biggest army, led by

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:41.740
one Robert E. Lee, has unconditionally surrendered
today, Appomattox

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:48.859
Courthouse, Virginia.
What's Lincoln's next thought?

00:35:48.859 --> 00:35:54.299
Put yourself in the mind of the man now in
the White House when you

00:35:54.299 --> 00:35:59.059
hear -- when you read that telegram comes
over from the War Department,

00:35:59.059 --> 00:36:02.250
what's your first thought?
What should be your first thought as the leader

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:03.250
of the country?

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:04.250
&gt;&gt; Hooray!

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:05.250
[laughter]

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:12.359
MIKE USEEM: Celebrate the end of four years
of absolute human carnage

00:36:12.359 --> 00:36:20.869
and the fact that the Union now has been restored.
And to focus on that, having fought -- this

00:36:20.869 --> 00:36:26.259
was almost total war for
its era: Think Atlanta, think Sherman's Campaign.

00:36:26.259 --> 00:36:31.740
We now have to reconcile.
That's up in Washington back to Appomattox,

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:39.980
Virginia, in an odd move
Ulysses S. Grant picks a non-career officer

00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:43.579
who had taken leave from
Bowden College where he was teaching English

00:36:43.579 --> 00:36:47.720
and Speech, a guy named
Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, anybody from

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:54.740
Maine will know that name.
And he says, Grant to Chamberlain, a midlevel

00:36:54.740 --> 00:37:02.799
officer temporary, he
says, Chamberlain, on April 12th, I'm going

00:37:02.799 --> 00:37:08.519
to give you the historic
distinction of the formal surrender of the

00:37:08.519 --> 00:37:12.620
army of Robert E. Lee.
I order you to do the following: You're going

00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:19.140
to stand at the edge of
a field, 4,000 men in blue and a few women

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:21.200
are going to be at attention
behind you.

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:26.260
This is ceremonial now, three days later after
the signing, and all the

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:30.470
Confederate units, a day of ignominy, have
to come up to where you're

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:35.029
standing, they have to give you their flag,
what's called the colors

00:37:35.029 --> 00:37:40.490
for their unit and their weapons.
You have to take them.

00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:44.370
Everything else is up to you.
So here's the final exam.

00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:47.770
Got to think of -- we're almost out of time,
got to think about this

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:51.670
quickly, you're Chamberlain, you've been given
the intent.

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:56.309
Go back to that Marine Corps formulation but
all the decisions now

00:37:56.309 --> 00:38:03.200
within that intent are up to you.
So how would you script the formal surrender

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:08.029
of Robert E. Lee's army?
What would you do?

00:38:08.029 --> 00:38:10.190
Somebody give us a quick voicing.
I'll put it on the air here.

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:17.869
Well, it depends on what you want to achieve.
What's the point of the surrender?

00:38:17.869 --> 00:38:18.869
Yes?

00:38:18.869 --> 00:38:19.869
[off microphone]: Welcome home.

00:38:19.869 --> 00:38:21.710
MIKE USEEM: The statement here is welcome
home.

00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:24.849
And that is almost a perfect way to sum it
up.

00:38:24.849 --> 00:38:29.151
We hereby defeat you but the objective of
this war was not to do that

00:38:29.151 --> 00:38:35.839
but was to bring you back home.
So today is a day is a moment of reconciliation.

00:38:35.839 --> 00:38:39.839
Now we've got to take that and bring that
down tactically.

00:38:39.839 --> 00:38:43.609
So we're going to make a decision to reconcile
not humiliate.

00:38:43.609 --> 00:38:47.299
We've got to bring that down tactically.
And let me just reference how that is done

00:38:47.299 --> 00:38:52.190
with the following final
image, and we're now through the final exam

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:57.660
successfully completed.
These are the 4,000 soldiers lined up here.

00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:03.460
This is Chamberlain, the temporary officer
from Maine, hard to see but

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:10.849
in the lower left-hand, almost speck place
of this image is the first

00:39:10.849 --> 00:39:16.500
Confederate unit that's coming up a day of
ignominy, as far as they're

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:20.730
concerned.
Chamberlain, without permission, but that

00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:26.359
was Lee's -- that was Grant's
purpose -- get the intent, you make the decisions,

00:39:26.359 --> 00:39:31.559
tells a subordinate
"Carry Arms."

00:39:31.559 --> 00:39:36.890
Many of us know the term "Present Arms."
It's a formal military posture, carry arms

00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:42.250
one notch below that in
parade formation, but only given when you

00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:47.339
want to show respect.
Great respect, normally only given to a Union

00:39:47.339 --> 00:39:51.509
Officer, a General who's
come on to the scene.

00:39:51.509 --> 00:39:54.480
Chamberlain tells his number two guy "carry
arms."

00:39:54.480 --> 00:40:00.349
The word goes down, the 4,000 people so displayed
suddenly move,

00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:05.569
musket comes over here, left hand across the
stock, the Confederate

00:40:05.569 --> 00:40:09.880
Officer coming down that muddy lane, same
tradition.

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:14.299
They all come out of West Point more or less,
says to himself, whoa,

00:40:14.299 --> 00:40:19.809
carry arms.
I guess that's -- that's for us.

00:40:19.809 --> 00:40:23.210
So he in turn, still a little bit of authority
left.

00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:27.452
They're about to be disbanded.
He turns to his own subordinate number two

00:40:27.452 --> 00:40:30.589
officer and says "carry
arms."

00:40:30.589 --> 00:40:34.569
In the history of the Civil War, this becomes
known as the salute

00:40:34.569 --> 00:40:40.259
returning the salute.
And in the years after the end of the war,

00:40:40.259 --> 00:40:45.160
you mention the name Sherman
anywhere in Georgia and people are going to

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:46.880
get red in the face all
over again.

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:51.589
Some of you I know are from the South.
If you mention the name Chamberlain, those

00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:56.019
who knew about this incident
would say, Chamberlain, he was one of those

00:40:56.019 --> 00:40:58.829
people that displayed us
with respect.

00:40:58.829 --> 00:41:05.319
Let's see what does Lincoln want?
He wants to bring them back in.

00:41:05.319 --> 00:41:09.980
That's the intent.
No evidence that Chamberlain ever met Abraham

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:15.749
Lincoln, but with that
intent known, reconciliation is required,

00:41:15.749 --> 00:41:22.440
a decision is made April 12th
by Chamberlain for respect to be displayed

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:26.940
towards the defeated
Confederate Army.

00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:30.809
Maybe that's the way -- one way to sum this
up, decision making.

00:41:30.809 --> 00:41:36.220
Think the Marine Corps four-point formulation,
think Kathy Eisenhardt's

00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:41.600
five part formulation, think the four people
who nicely reported what

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:45.680
they put into their decisions, read books
like Malcolm Gladwell on

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:50.700
that, and maybe to all that how about this
as a final parting shot,

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:55.930
don't you want people working for you when
they make good and timely

00:41:55.930 --> 00:42:01.450
decisions ultimately to think like a president,
to think like you own

00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:04.819
the company, to think that everything hangs
on you?

00:42:04.819 --> 00:42:08.200
And I think that with a guideline, hopefully
people working for you in

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:12.730
their own leadership, will give you what you
want and what the company

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:14.349
needs.
My pleasure, may you all decide.

00:42:14.349 --> 00:42:15.349
Thank you very much.

00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.350
[applause]
