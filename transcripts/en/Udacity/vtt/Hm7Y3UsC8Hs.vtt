00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What we've shown already is that if I know a single one of these angles

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and one of the sides as well, I can learn everything there is to know.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I can learn the other angle by using the fact that they must add up to 180 degrees.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I can find the other sides by using these Trigonometric Ratios. Great!

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
But there's one thing we can't do quite yet, and that's to go from sides back to angles.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So, let's say I gave you a right triangle

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and I told you this side was 231 meters and this side was 266 meters.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
All right, let's say now you want to know something about one of the angles.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000
This angle for example. Now, initially this seems a bit tricky and it is.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Well, what we can do is even though I don't know what this angle is yet,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
maybe i know something about this angle.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
For this angle, would it be easier for me to calculate the sine, the cosine,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
or the tangent of this angle?

00:00:58.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Check up here which should be easiest. Tangent, sine, or cosine?
