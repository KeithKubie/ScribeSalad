00:00:00.341 --> 00:00:03.013
- [Instructor] We're asked
to plot the image of point A

00:00:03.013 --> 00:00:06.096
under a reflection across the line l.

00:00:07.388 --> 00:00:09.419
So we have our line l here,

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:12.296
and so we wanna plot the image of here,

00:00:12.296 --> 00:00:13.700
we wanna plot the image of point A

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.121
under a reflection across line l.

00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:18.868
Well, one way to think about it is point A

00:00:18.868 --> 00:00:23.035
is exactly one, two, three,
four units to the right of l.

00:00:24.788 --> 00:00:27.277
And so its reflection is going to be

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:29.118
four units to the left of l.

00:00:29.118 --> 00:00:31.951
So if we go one, two, three, four,

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.557
that would be the image of point A.

00:00:35.557 --> 00:00:38.013
We could maybe denote that as A prime.

00:00:38.013 --> 00:00:39.859
So if you're doing this on
the Khan Academy exercise,

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:42.116
you would actually just click
on a point right over there,

00:00:42.116 --> 00:00:43.180
and it would show up.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.554
But this would be the reflection

00:00:44.554 --> 00:00:46.971
of point A across the line l.

00:00:48.496 --> 00:00:51.226
Let's do another example.

00:00:51.226 --> 00:00:54.218
So here we're asked plot
the image of point B

00:00:54.218 --> 00:00:57.566
under a reflection across the x-axis.

00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:59.280
Alright, so this is point B,

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.282
and we're going to reflect it

00:01:00.282 --> 00:01:03.115
across the x-axis right over here.

00:01:04.586 --> 00:01:06.770
So to go from B to the x-axis,

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.918
it's exactly five units below the x-axis.

00:01:09.918 --> 00:01:12.251
One, two, three, four, five.

00:01:13.123 --> 00:01:16.387
So if we were to reflect
across the x-axis,

00:01:16.387 --> 00:01:18.062
essentially create its mirror image,

00:01:18.062 --> 00:01:20.440
it's going to be five
units above the x-axis.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.773
One, two, three, four, five.

00:01:23.905 --> 00:01:25.669
So that's where the image would be.

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:28.612
Maybe we could denote that with a B prime.

00:01:28.612 --> 00:01:31.612
We are reflecting across the x-axis.

00:01:32.722 --> 00:01:35.256
Let's do another example.

00:01:35.256 --> 00:01:39.423
So here they tell us point
C prime is the image of C,

00:01:40.577 --> 00:01:42.424
which is at the coordinates negative four

00:01:42.424 --> 00:01:47.357
comma negative two, under a
reflection across the y-axis.

00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:50.276
What are the coordinates of C prime?

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:51.495
So pause this video

00:01:51.495 --> 00:01:54.706
and see if you can figure
it out on your own.

00:01:54.706 --> 00:01:56.825
So there's several ways to approach it.

00:01:56.825 --> 00:01:59.425
It doesn't hurt to do
a quick visual diagram.

00:01:59.425 --> 00:02:02.426
So that could be my x-axis.

00:02:02.426 --> 00:02:04.426
This would be my y-axis.

00:02:06.161 --> 00:02:08.447
And it's the point negative
four comma negative two,

00:02:08.447 --> 00:02:09.446
so that might look like this.

00:02:09.446 --> 00:02:12.417
Negative four, negative two.

00:02:12.417 --> 00:02:15.517
So this is the point C right over here.

00:02:15.517 --> 00:02:18.806
And we wanna reflect across the y-axis.

00:02:18.806 --> 00:02:21.049
So we wanna reflect across the y-axis,

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.425
which I am coloring it
in red right over here.

00:02:24.425 --> 00:02:25.592
So let's see.

00:02:25.592 --> 00:02:29.425
The point C is four to
the left of the y-axis.

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.581
So its reflection is going to be

00:02:31.581 --> 00:02:34.342
four to the right of the y-axis.

00:02:34.342 --> 00:02:36.349
So let me do it like this.

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.094
So instead of being four to the left,

00:02:39.094 --> 00:02:43.162
we wanna go four to the
right, so plus four.

00:02:43.162 --> 00:02:46.786
So where would that put our C prime?

00:02:46.786 --> 00:02:49.328
So our C prime would be right over there.

00:02:49.328 --> 00:02:51.055
And what would its coordinates be?

00:02:51.055 --> 00:02:53.280
Well, it would have the same y-coordinate,

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.561
so C prime would have a
y-coordinate of negative two.

00:02:56.561 --> 00:02:58.535
But what would its x-coordinate be?

00:02:58.535 --> 00:03:00.318
Well, instead of it being negative four,

00:03:00.318 --> 00:03:02.984
it gets flipped over the y-axis,

00:03:02.984 --> 00:03:07.029
so now it's gonna have a
x-coordinate of positive four.

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:10.108
So the coordinates here would
be four comma negative two.

00:03:10.108 --> 00:03:11.816
Four comma negative two.

00:03:11.816 --> 00:03:13.813
You might've been able
to do this in your head.

00:03:13.813 --> 00:03:16.096
Although, for me, even if
I try to do it in my head,

00:03:16.096 --> 00:03:19.356
I would still have this
visualization going on in my head.

00:03:19.356 --> 00:03:20.848
Negative four comma negative two.

00:03:20.848 --> 00:03:22.980
I'm sitting there in the third quadrant.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.136
If I'm flipping over the y-axis,

00:03:26.136 --> 00:03:28.302
my y-coordinate wouldn't change,

00:03:28.302 --> 00:03:30.719
but my x-coordinate
would become the opposite

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:32.316
and I would end up in the fourth quadrant,

00:03:32.316 --> 00:03:33.664
and that's exactly what happened.

00:03:33.664 --> 00:03:36.989
Y-coordinate did not change,
but then my x-coordinate,

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.955
since I'm flipping over the y-axis,

00:03:38.955 --> 00:03:40.523
it became the negative of this,

00:03:40.523 --> 00:03:44.672
so the opposite of negative
four which is positive four.
