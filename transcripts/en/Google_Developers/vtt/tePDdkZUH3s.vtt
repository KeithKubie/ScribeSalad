PAUL LEWIS: Are you enjoying the
latest season of HTTP 203, sir?

00:00:03.215 --> 00:00:04.090
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I am.

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.920
Because unlike the last
season, we were in America,

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.700
and we were having
a little adventure.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.145
We went to a billiard hall,
we went to the seaside.

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:13.770
PAUL LEWIS: We went
on roller coasters,

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.310
which is always a good thing.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:16.260
JAKE ARCHIBALD: What
did we talk about?

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.410
We talked about ES6.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.844
PAUL LEWIS: Yes.

00:00:18.844 --> 00:00:20.260
We talked about
maintainable code.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.593
JAKE ARCHIBALD: We've got an
episode on HTTP2 coming up.

00:00:22.593 --> 00:00:23.360
That's cool.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.330
PAUL LEWIS: That's
going to be exciting.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.690
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
One of the things

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.820
I've been enjoying
the most is seeing

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.169
the various levels
of sunburn that I

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:30.710
have throughout the
various episodes.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.335
PAUL LEWIS: It's like
a game, because I

00:00:32.335 --> 00:00:34.380
can't remember the order
that we filmed them in.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.040
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Because
it's not the order

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.330
we've been showing them in.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.062
PAUL LEWIS: No.

00:00:37.062 --> 00:00:38.340
Why would we do that?

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.490
So instead, it's like, yeah,
oh, that's an 8 out of 10

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.450
for Jake on the sunburn-o-meter.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.490
JAKE ARCHIBALD: But
we do have a problem.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.590
Because previously, our
videos have been on the Google

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.350
Developers YouTube channel.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.271
But we're now moving everything
onto the new Chrome Developers

00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:54.770
channel.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:55.940
PAUL LEWIS: Yes, we are.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.648
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And
we need to find a way

00:00:57.648 --> 00:01:00.869
to tell the audience that,
but we don't acknowledge

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:01.910
the audience in our show.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:02.535
PAUL LEWIS: No.

00:01:02.535 --> 00:01:04.982
There's a fourth wall
that we never, ever break.

00:01:04.982 --> 00:01:06.440
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So
how are we going

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.470
to tell everyone to subscribe to
the Chrome Developers channel?

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.320
