00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
I'll just got ahead and admit it:  I am starving for female friendship.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.920
I know that might not sound that embarrassing but on the inside it feels like

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.200
Be my friend!

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.560
And I feel like I'm single in dating because every time I meet a really cool chick

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.160
I'm like

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.000
Hey I would love to take you out to dinner and a movie

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.560
You know?  Just so we can get to know each other better

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.940
maybe just hang out, learn a little bit about each other

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.740
develop a life long friendship and carry on that friendship until death do us part you know,

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.120
You know.  Nothing big, nothing big.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.860
And it's not like I don't have friends, you know.  I do.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.680
It's just that I don't have a best friend.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.520
I'm late to the party.  Everyone in LA knows each other from college

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.460
or from an old work and here I am arriving late, looking for somebody to pair up with.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.580
(Singing) Hello from the other side!

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.160
And as an adult, friendships are work.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.600
You know, everyone is pursuing their career or relationships so getting together

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.440
is something that you have to actively pursue.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.860
It's not like High School where we were all forced to be in this prison together everyday.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.980
Now, you have to make plans.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.160
Which can be tough.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.180
There's this one girl that I really like and I want to be better friends with

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.420
but I started noticing that it was always me initiating our hangouts

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.080
so I've kinda been refraining from "asking her out"

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.220
so I can finally see if she will invite me somewhere

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.800
cause friendships should be mutual, you know?  We should want to hang out with each other.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.160
Are you sure you want to hang out?

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.340
(muffled) Yeah!  Yeah!

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.520
Are you positive?

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.840
(muffled) Yes! I totally want to hang out!

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.580
But what about you?  Do you struggle with friendships or are you the type of person that just

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.360
makes and keeps friends easily?

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.520
Do you have a best friend?  Or...are you looking for one?

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.660
I'm available!
