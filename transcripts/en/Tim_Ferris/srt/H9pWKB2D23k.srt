1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,220
I'm all warmed up

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,120
just as I got my tango shoes on.
We are here to set a tangle record.

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:11,180
Where is Willmar?
Willmar.

4
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:21,730
[inaudible]

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,420
can I had a dream about this once.
Okay.

6
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:38,710
So do you think you can
dance? Um, I hope so.

7
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:39,663
They do.

8
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,330
They help you set a new Guinness Book of
World Records for the most tango spins

9
00:00:43,331 --> 00:00:46,750
in one minute. So please welcome
Ferris and Elise, the among

10
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:51,850
de [inaudible]

11
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,540
Seattle. Okay, let me ask you a question
now. All right. Where are your sleeves?

12
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,720
Seriously, you're such a good tango
dancer. Where's your sleeves? Nervously?

13
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,710
I left him in the back room. I
forgot them. How you get into tango?

14
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:11,780
Well,

15
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,610
I was a complete workaholic 1994 and uh,

16
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:21,200
I just left the country with a backpack
and a one way trip to Europe for four

17
00:01:21,201 --> 00:01:24,530
weeks of supposed to recharge.
My batteries just gone for 15 months.

18
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:29,740
I'm in Argentina where I took a
class just for no real good reason.

19
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:34,010
And there were 10 women in the class
and two guys. And you like those odds?

20
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:37,200
I like the odds. I like the
ratio signed up and here we are.

21
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,760
It's incredible. And did you
meet there? Is that how you

22
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,590
yeah, she was actually
one of my teachers and uh,

23
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,190
I became a complete fanatic about tango
and started doing it for eight hours a

24
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:51,880
day and uh,
we decided to compete and

25
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,850
the rest is history.
Okay,

26
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:58,350
well you are going to teach us how to do
a proper tango spin. So can you show us?

27
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:01,470
So tango with the fines
and tango is the embrace.

28
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:05,820
So you were talking about sexy spins. Yes.
Start right here. It's chest, the chest,

29
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,850
chest to chest.
I'll put what would should be my choice.

30
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,710
Okay.
[inaudible]

31
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,890
first thing the woman is going to do is
she's going to pivot back and backstep

32
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,870
with,
in this case her left foot,

33
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:34,900
left foot and the man is going to
follow with his foot extended here.

34
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:39,490
He's basically tracing her rear
foot and then come to round.

35
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,320
You backstep Kelly, you're
gonna take a sidestep.

36
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,493
Okay.

37
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,580
It's like this. So all
told, hey we show, okay.

38
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,230
Is

39
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:59,850
it a woman's part? Looks
like this. So Mack Mack

40
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,260
side, back side of the rights. No,

41
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,770
back to the left.
Take a side step with the right.

42
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,590
I know you're going to step forward
with the left foot around him. Forward.

43
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,820
Right Oyster on standing up.

44
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,790
You're going to pivot on your left foot.
Okay. So that you're facing him again.

45
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,890
Wilbur. This apart with,
with, with Wilmer's.

46
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,210
Exactly what it is,
what it looks like.

47
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,740
Like that. So that's what the spin
looks like. And then I turned,

48
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,030
wow.
That's exactly what we're going to do.

49
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,420
You get to the point here, which is
you to setting a new world records now

50
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:47,700
[inaudible]

51
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:54,740
and the time to beat is a 27
spins in 60 seconds. Okay. Stuart,

52
00:03:54,741 --> 00:03:56,660
when you're ready,
you give them the go ahead.

53
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,880
Okay, Tim, let's say you're ready.
Ready? Okay. Three, two, one. Go.

54
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:06,210
[inaudible] [inaudible] it'd be terrible.

55
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,790
Stuart, what's the word? Do we
have a new record? Uh, we, uh,

56
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,820
we certainly do that Guinness Record Role
[inaudible] was 27 is now thoughts he

57
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:30,970

Well done.

58
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:36,420
