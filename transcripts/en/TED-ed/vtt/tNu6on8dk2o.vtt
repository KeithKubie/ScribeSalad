00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.000
(Music)

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The eight traits successful people have in common.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Number one: passion.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Successful people love what they do.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
When I asked Russell Crowe what led to his Academy Award for Best Actor,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
he said, "The bottom line is I love the actual job of acting.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I have a great passion for it."

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Successful people in all fields love what they do,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
whether it's astrophysicist Jaymie Matthews, author J.K. Rowling

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
or athlete Michael Phelps.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And not just big names -- Margaret MacMillan, a history professor,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
says, "I spent my life doing what I loved."

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Carlos, a bus driver I sit with at Starbucks,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
says, "I love what I do. I've only missed three days in four years."

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And believe it or not, even successful dentists love what they do.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Izzy Novak says, "I love dentistry.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I can't imagine being anything else."

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
But what about business?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Many of you are in business,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and we tend to think that business is more about cold numbers than hot passion,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
more about logic than love,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
so what surprised me was how often successful business people

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
actually use the words "passion" or "love" when they talk about their work.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
When Jack Welch was CEO of General Electric,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
he was asked if he liked his job.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
He said, "No, I don't like this job. I love this job."

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
We can have passion for a profession.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Kathleen Lane, chief strategist at WorkCar,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
says, "I've found a profession I love."

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
She also says, "Stress isn't working 15 hours at a job you like,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
stress is working 15 minutes at a job you dislike."

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
We can have a passion for people.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Nez Hallett III, CEO of Smart Wireless,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
says, "I used to be in sales. Now I'm a CEO.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I just love being around people."

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
We can have passion for a product.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
James Dyson, the vacuum cleaner guy, says,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
"I love vacuum cleaners, and I will love them until the day I die."

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
(Laughter)

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Yup, when he dies, they're just going to cremate him and suck up those ashes

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
with a Dyson vacuum, and place it on the shelf.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
(Laughter)

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
We can have passion for a particular field.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Anita Roddick, the great founder of The Body Shop,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
once said, "I love retailing.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I love buying and selling and making connections."

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
She also said, "I don't like systems, financial sheets or plans."

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Yes, no matter how much we love what we do,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
there's always going to be stuff we don't love.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
The trick is to make sure the stuff you don't love only takes up 20 percent of your time,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and the stuff you do love takes up 80.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
If it's the other way around, we're in the wrong job.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Passion is sometimes mistaken for ambition.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
People call Donald Trump ambitious,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
but he says, "I'm not ambitious. I just love what I do.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And if you love what you do, you do a lot of stuff.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And then people say, 'Oh, you're ambitious.'"

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
The cool thing about passion is it turns underachievers into superachievers.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I have a long list of famous underachievers --

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
like Albert Einstein -- who people said would go nowhere when they were young.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
For instance, who said this, besides me?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
"I was sitting in my room being a depressed guy,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
trying to figure out what I was doing with my life."

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Turns out it was Bill Gates.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Bill was such an underachiever,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
his parents actually sent him to counseling.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Yeah, I can just hear the neighbors back then saying,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
"Jeez, that Gates kid. What a loser.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
He's never going to go anywhere." And he didn't,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
until he discovered his passion for software.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
The big problem is finding your passion.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Sure, there's the kid that knows they want to be an accountant or an architect

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
or an astronaut from the time they're 10,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
but I found a much bigger group of successful people who,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
when they were young, and even when they were older,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
didn't have a clue what their passion was,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and it took them a long time to find it

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
or to fall into it.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Dawn Lepore, Chief Information Officer at Charles Schwab,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
said to me, "I fell into what I do,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and I didn't know I loved it until I fell into it."

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And I hear that a lot.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So how do people find their passion?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Well they just get out there and try a lot of stuff

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and explore many paths.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Robert Munsch explored many paths.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
He said to me, "I studied to be a priest

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and that turned out to be a disaster.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
I tried working on a farm. They didn't like me.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
I worked on a boat. It sank.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
I tried a lot of things that didn't work,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
but I kept trying and then I tried something that did work."

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And I'd say it worked; as a children's author, he's sold over 40 million books.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Yes, finding a job we love is like finding a person we love.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Sometimes we've just got to go on a lot of really bad dates

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
before we find the right one.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Now, I read a survey of 18- to 25-year-olds,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and 81 percent said their first or second life goal

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
was to get rich.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And I thought, boy, they've got it all wrong.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Because I've interviewed many millionaires and billionaires,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
and guess how many of them said their life goal was to get rich?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Zero! They didn't do it for money,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
they did it for love. They went for the zing,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
not the ka-ching ka-ching.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
When Bill Gates and Paul Allen started Microsoft,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
they didn't do it for the money.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Bill says, "Paul and I never thought we'd make much money.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
We just loved writing software."

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And with that attitude, he became the richest man in the world.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
J.K. Rowling didn't write Harry Potter books for the money.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
She said, "I love writing these books.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
I just wanted to make enough money to continue to write."

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And with that attitude, she became a billionaire.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
I became a millionaire by following my heart, not my wallet,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
and a number of times I walked away from great-paying jobs

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
to do poor-paying jobs I loved better.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Once was when I had a great job, traveling the world, making a lot of money,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
but I wasn't doing the one thing I loved at the time,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
which was photography.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
So I said, I think I'll leave and start my own little photo company.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
My heart said, Yeah! Go for it.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
My wallet, and all my friends, I might add,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
said, Are you crazy? You can't walk away from all the money!

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000
You'll starve.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
I didn't listen to them. I walked away,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
and yeah, at first there wasn't much money,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
but it didn't matter, because I was having fun doing what I loved.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And eventually, the money came,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and much more than if I'd stayed in my old job.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
So I learned it's true, what they say:

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
If you do what you love, the money comes anyway.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
So I'd say if you really want to get rich,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
put money at the bottom of your goals list and passion at the top.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And why does it work that way?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Because if you love what you do, you automatically do the other seven things

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
that lead to success and wealth.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
You will work hard, you will push yourself, you will persist.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
And what if you're in a job you don't love?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Well, just follow your passion on the side.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Remember, Albert Einstein was a patent clerk.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
That was his job, but his passion was physics.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And he wrote four of his most important papers

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
in his spare time as a hobby, and became one of the world's greatest scientists.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
So it's amazing what you can do

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
if you love what you do.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
(Applause)
