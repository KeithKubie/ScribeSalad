00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.648
The only function of these three that has an inverse is this first one. F of x

00:00:04.648 --> 00:00:09.292
equals two x to the fifth. Neither this porabala nor this absolute value

00:00:09.292 --> 00:00:14.024
function pass the horizontal line test. So neither of them has an inverse. This

00:00:14.024 --> 00:00:15.609
function does, however.
