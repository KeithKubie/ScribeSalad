SUNIL VEMURI: Hi,
I'm Sunil Vemuri,

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.000
and I can't wait
for the day when

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.170
I can talk to my watch and phone
like they do in the movies.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.810
We're still a ways
away from that.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.070
But the good news is we're
introducing a new API

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.390
in Android M that takes
us an important step

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.520
in that direction.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.620
It's called voice
interaction API,

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.570
and it lets apps have
spoken dialogues with users.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.540
I love listening to the
radio on my commute,

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.940
and the TuneIn app
gives me great choices.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.289
OK Google, play music on TuneIn.

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.080
GOOGLE APP ASSISTANT:
Which genre would you

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.090
like to listen to?

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.950
SUNIL VEMURI: Classical.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.610
GOOGLE APP ASSISTANT:
Playing classical.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.890
SUNIL VEMURI: Handling
voice input can be complex.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.040
Also I didn't just
give a command.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.580
I had a conversation where
TuneIn asked me a question.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.060
That conversation
part is what's new.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.160
My colleague Barnaby and I will
show you how voice actions,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.320
together with the
voice interaction API,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.790
make it possible for you to
build conversational voice

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.030
experiences like TuneIn's.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.290
Let's first look at a
brief system overview.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.290
It starts with "OK Google"
also known as the hot word.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.970
That triggers the assistant,
in this case, the Google App.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.980
It starts listening to the user.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.320
The speech-to-text,
cloud-based natural language,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.830
and Knowledge
Graph work together

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.010
to determine what
should be done.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.750
If it's an action, an
Android intent is triggered.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.010
In our example, the intent
is handled by TuneIn.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.479
Now Barnaby will tell you
how to do this in your app.

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.020
BARNABY JAMES: Hi,
I'm Barnaby James,

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.978
and I work on the Voice
Actions team at Google.

00:01:30.978 --> 00:01:33.410
For some voice actions, it's
clear what an app should do.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.462
What if the user's
command isn't clear,

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:36.920
and your app isn't
sure what to do,

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.990
and wants to ask
the user a question?

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.592
Or maybe it needs to
confirm something is safe.

00:01:41.592 --> 00:01:44.450
The Voice Interaction API lets
your app focus on the questions

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.170
to ask the user
while Google handles

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.370
the speech-to-text,
microphone setup, and parsing

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.810
the responses.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.810
Suppose your app wanted
to confirm with the user

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.476
before playing something
that may not be

00:01:53.476 --> 00:01:55.442
suitable for younger listeners.

00:01:55.442 --> 00:01:56.900
You would call the
voice interactor

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.525
and submit a request
for a confirmation

00:01:58.525 --> 00:02:00.142
along with your prompt.

00:02:00.142 --> 00:02:01.850
Google recognizes many
of the common ways

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.090
people give a
confirmation such as yes,

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.123
please do it, go
ahead, or make it so.

00:02:07.123 --> 00:02:09.289
Or if you wanted to ask the
user to pick from a list

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.514
like TuneIn did, you'd
create an array of options

00:02:11.514 --> 00:02:13.430
when you submit the voice
interaction request.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.800
If your user speaks
something not on the list,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.520
Google will take care
of reprompting for you.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.290
OK Google, back to Sunil.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.550
SUNIL VEMURI: Thanks, Barnaby.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.580
There's one important
thing we left out.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.210
How does a user launch
your app by voice?

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.370
For many of the common
things users do with voice,

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.680
such as searching, playing
music, setting alarms,

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.060
and so on, you should
use system voice actions.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.480
Google recognizes when
a user asks for these

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.040
and fires the intent.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.650
This is what TuneIn
used, and these

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.476
are documented on our website.

00:02:42.476 --> 00:02:44.100
You can use these
right away, and we're

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.960
adding more all the time.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.370
If system actions
don't fit your app,

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.700
we recently introduced
custom actions.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.810
For example, I can say, "OK
Google, Shazam this song."

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.880
Here's the URL to learn more
about Custom Voice Sections.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.010
Voice is a great way to
drive traffic to your app

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.410
and engage users.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.710
Next, check out our CodeLab
and try out voice interaction.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:08.920
Thanks and see you next time.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.283
