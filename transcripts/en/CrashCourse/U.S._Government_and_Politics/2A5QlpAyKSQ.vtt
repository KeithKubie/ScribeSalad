Hi I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government
and Politics.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.910
And today we're going to try and untangle
the mess that is the American political campaign.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.260
One of the things about the American political
system that often confuses people who don't

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.519
live in America is the way that our politicians
run for office. There are two aspects in particular

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:21.550
that stand out about American political campaigns:
their length and their expense. We're going

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.850
to look at both of these today and see that
they're related but before we do we are going

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.140
to answer a burning question: why do we need
political campaigns anyway?

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:36.980
[Theme Music]

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.600
If you ask one hundred people about the reason
why we have political campaigns, you'll get

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.880
well, not a hundred but at least more than
one answer. And you might work for Family Feud.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.980
Probably the best answer to this question
though, is that we have political campaigns

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.320
to provide voters with information they need to choose
a candidate to represent them. So how do political

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.600
campaigns provide information? And what is a political
campaign anyway? Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.600
A campaign is an organized drive on the part
of a candidate to get elected to an office.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.829
It's also the way we refer to the organization
itself. For example, in 2012 we had the Obama

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.640
campaign and the Romney campaign. And each
consisted of a campaign organization made

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.670
up of thousands of staffers and volunteers
and all of their activities. Most campaigns

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.640
are temporary, geared towards an election
although both parties do have permanent professional

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.130
campaign organizations. At the top level are
the national committees, the DNC and the RNC.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.710
Can you guess what they stand for?

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.150
These organizations coordinate all national
campaigns, especially those for President.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.940
Each house of congress has a Republican and
Democratic campaign committee. The individual

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.620
Senate and Congressional committees are headed
up by sitting members of the Senate and the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.490
House, and because these committees give money
to candidates, their leaders are very popular.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.050
I find that I'm popular when I make it rain
at parties.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.360
Campaigns provide information in a number
of ways. The main thing they do is communicate

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.780
with the public, usually through the media
which we'll discuss in greater depth in future

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.140
episodes. The main stage of political campaigns
is the organized event where candidates can

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.820
present information about themselves and their
policies directly through voters and speeches.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.860
These are known as stump speeches, although
only rarely these days do candidates actually

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.140
speak on stumps, they have podiums and stages
now.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.020
In addition to these events, candidates present
the information by appearing on the TV, in

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.600
debates, at town meetings, and in "impromptu"
photo opportunities. They like to appear with

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.720
military hardware, too, although sometimes this can
backfire, as in the case of Michael Dukakis in 1988.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.720
Campaigns can spread their messages through
direct mail, press releases, news coverage,

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.980
and through advertisements, often on the TV,
which is like the internet, only less interactive

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.920
and has a lot of real housewives on it. Thanks,
thought bubble.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.550
Nowadays, there are many more ways that candidates
can reach out to voters. One way is through

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.069
email. If you've ever given money to a candidate
or a campaign, you can expect emails in ever-increasing

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.370
numbers as election day approaches, and we
all love that. Candidates now take to Twitter

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.520
to blast out information and individual candidates
and their campaigns often have Facebook pages.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.580
There are even campaign ads made specifically
for YouTube, although how their advertising algorithm

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.920
works is beyond me. It's weird to get a campaign ad
for the Michigan Senate if you don't live in Michigan.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.520
One other way that campaigns communicate
information is through raising money. Of course, they

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.540
need money to pay for all the campaign ribbons
and buttons and PA systems and folding chairs

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.280
and tour buses and stump speeches and axes
to chop down trees so they have stumps to

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.069
speak on. These things ain't cheap.

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.910
Even more expensive are advertisements on
the TV. A sitting president has an advantage

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.379
here in that he can usually get on TV whenever
he wants and he'll have a chance to clarify

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:12.849
his positions in the State of the Union Address.
But even he has to spend money on ads.

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.069
And raising money is another way to present
voters with information because campaign solicitations

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.989
usually come with some policy piece attached
to them. Almost every solicitation you get

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.910
will be somewhat targeted to one of your interests
and tell you, or try to tell you, where the

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.879
candidate asking for your money stands on
that issue.

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.989
So you may have gotten a campaign solicitation
and wondered, "Hey, why you need my money?"

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.220
The unhelpful answer is that they need your
money because campaigns are expensive. But

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.269
then you might ask, "why are they so expensive?"
Good question.

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.879
Campaigns are expensive because they're huge,
especially presidential campaigns; they need

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:44.750
to reach 220 million people of voting age.
Another reason they're expensive is because

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.580
they're super long. Democrat and Republican
candidates raise money, give speeches and

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:54.640
create political action committees years before
the election. It's ridiculous. I blame the eagle.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.959
Campaigns are also expensive because Americans
expect them to be personal and this takes

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.260
time and money. We like to see our candidates
in person and have them show up in small towns

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.200
in Iowa and New Hampshire, even though those states
don't matter all that much in the grand electoral picture.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.200
Another reason campaigns are so expensive
is that they rely increasingly on the TV and

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.620
other visual media that cost a lot of money
to produce. Gone are the days when William

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.329
McKinley could sit on his porch in Ohio and
have reporters come to him. Nowadays, even

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.000
when candidates get free exposure by appearing
on nightly comedy shows, like The Daily Show,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.930
it still costs the campaign in terms of time,
travel and probably wardrobe and makeup so

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:31.790
that they can look as good as I do. No makeup.
Minimal wardrobe: no pants. Sorry, Stan.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.340
How expensive are campaigns anyway? Eh...very!
In the 2008 presidential campaign both candidates

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.660
together spent three billion dollars. In 2012
the candidates spent about a billion dollars

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.960
each, and outside groups spent a further four
billion.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.220
And congressional elections weren't much cheaper,
except when you consider that there were a

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.380
lot more of them. Combined, congressional
races in 2008 cost about one billion dollars.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.440
All the money that gets spent on campaigns
leads us inevitably to campaign finance rules,

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.740
which were set up by Congress after 1970 and
refined by the courts.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.560
We have campaign finance legislation because
all that money pouring into campaigns sure

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.580
looks like it raises the potential for corruption.
Whether or not an individual's campaign contributions

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.000
can sway a congressman's vote is highly debatable
but it certainly gives the appearance of impropriety

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.960
when a congressman who receives millions of
dollars from the oil industry then works hard

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.240
to weaken regulations on oil companies so
that they can make more profit.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.580
Campaign contributions are not bribes, but
they sure look like them to lots of people.

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.760
Recognizing that campaign contributions could
potentially influence the political process,

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.060
congress passes the Federal Election Campaign
act of 1971. This was the first law that put

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.810
limits on campaign spending and donations.
It was further refined by the McCain-Feingold

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.380
Campaign Law in 2002, and by court decisions
that refined the rules for campaign spending

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.290
and donations and provided a legal rationale
for these limits.

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.509
Until recently, the most important case on
campaign finance was Buckley V Valleo. This

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:49.330
case established the idea that limits on campaign
spending were problematic under the first

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.229
amendment because limiting the amount someone
could spend on politics was basically limiting

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:56.169
what that person could say about politics.
Freedom of speech, y'all!

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:00.449
According to the rules, individuals were allowed
to donate up to $2500 per candidate and their

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:04.180
was a total limit to the amount an individual
could give. Donations to a party committee,

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.960
which because they don't go to a specific candidate
and thus seem less like bribes, were limited to $28,500.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.540
Individual donors were also allowed to give
up to $5,000 to a political action committee, or PAC.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.460
But it gets more complicated. Individuals
and PACs are allowed to give unlimited funds

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:23.760
to a 527 group, named after its designation
in the tax code, that focuses on issue advocacy.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.920
The most famous 527 group in recent political memory
is probably Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, which spent

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.700
more than 22 million dollars to raise awareness around
the issue of whether 2004 presidential candidate,

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.960
and later Secretary of State John Kerry was
completely honest about his Vietnam War record.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.760
If this sounds like it was more of an organization
against the candidate himself, well you can see why

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.700
the line between "issue advocacy" and support for a political campaign can be kind of blurry.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.550
Now here's something important: these limits
are on contributions to candidates and campaigns,

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.680
not on spending by candidates and campaigns.
What this means is that a candidate and their

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.610
campaign can spend however much they raise.
So if a candidate running for office has one

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:01.180
billion dollars, they can spend one billion trying to
win. There's no concern about self-funded candidates

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.540
bribing themselves, and you often see very rich people
spending a lot of their own money trying to win office.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.840
So Buckley Vs. Valleo set up the basic distinction
between campaign donations, which could be

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.819
limited, and campaign spending, which couldn't.
This distinction was undercut by the Supreme

00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:18.979
Court in the case of Citizens United Vs. the Federal
Election Commission in 2009. This reaffirmed the idea

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:23.320
that money is the equivalent of speech and struck
down many of the limitations on campaign donations.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:27.419
The Citizens United decision cleared the way
for Super PACs. These organizations are allowed

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:31.319
to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money
to promote a candidate or publicize a cause,

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:34.660
but they may not directly contribute to a
candidate or coordinate with a campaign. In

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:39.440
the 2012 election, there were over 500 registered
super PACs and 41 of them spent over half

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:44.289
a million dollars. The largest seven had spent
over 256 million by the end of August, one

00:07:44.289 --> 00:07:48.980
of the reasons that the 2012 election was the
most expensive ever, clocking in at around 6 billion.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:53.340
Now this sounds like a lot of money, right?
It is. Gimme it. But a little context: the

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:57.440
total spent on house and senate races was
around 3.6 billion dollars, which was less

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.900
than half of what Americans spend annually
on potato chips. So when you look at it this

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:04.770
way, the amount we spend on elections doesn't
seem like so much, which may make us rethink

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:09.160
the idea that money is corrupting American
politics. Or maybe not. Maybe potato chips

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.860
are corrupting American politics. Certainly
corrupting my belly.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:15.560
American political campaigns are big and high
stakes and raise questions about the influence

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.300
of money in politics that are tough to answer.
On the one hand, it does seem like there's

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.940
the potential for very rich people to have
a lot of influence on the elections. On the

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.150
other hand, limiting a person's ability to
register his or her preference of a candidate

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:30.009
through spending on that candidate does seem
like a limitation on their political speech.

00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:33.459
One of the arguments for limits on campaign
contributions is that forcing candidates to

00:08:33.459 --> 00:08:36.849
raise money in small amounts from a large
number of donors will make them reach out

00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:41.139
to larger numbers of constituents, and appealing
to large numbers is the essence of Democracy.

00:08:41.139 --> 00:08:44.399
But it's also time consuming for a politician
to reach out to all those potential donors

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:47.579
and congressmen already spend a considerable
amount of time raising money when they should

00:08:47.579 --> 00:08:52.619
be legislating. And watching Real Housewives.
And eating Little Caesar's. There's a lot to do.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:56.920
But this is the system we have, and unless
congress passes a law limiting campaign expenditures,

00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.900
or shortening the campaign season, we can
expect campaigns to remain long and get more

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.480
and more expensive. Thanks for watching, I'll
