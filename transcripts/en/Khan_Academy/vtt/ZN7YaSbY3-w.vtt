00:00:00.321 --> 00:00:10.075
Let's say that I have the vector a, and let's say that it's equal to (2,1)

00:00:10.075 --> 00:00:12.603
So we could draw it right over here,

00:00:12.603 --> 00:00:16.475
So it's equal to (2,1), so if we were to start at the origin

00:00:16.475 --> 00:00:20.974
and we would move 2 in the horizontal direction, and 1 in the vertical direction

00:00:20.974 --> 00:00:24.572
so we would end up right over here.

00:00:24.572 --> 00:00:27.408
Now what I want to do is think about, how we can define

00:00:27.408 --> 00:00:31.270
multiplying this vector by a scalar

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:39.496
for example, if I were to say 3 times the vector a.

00:00:40.004 --> 00:00:47.780
which is the same thing as saying 3 times (2,1)

00:00:47.934 --> 00:00:50.937
So 3 is just a number. One way to think about a scalar quantity,

00:00:50.937 --> 00:00:56.176
it is just a number, versus a vector is giving you how much you're moving

00:00:56.176 --> 00:01:01.935
in the various directions. It's giving you both the magnitude and a direction.

00:01:01.935 --> 00:01:04.870
while this is just a plain number right over here.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.181
But how do we define multiplying 3 times this vector?

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.075
Well one reasonable thing that might jump out at you is,

00:01:13.075 --> 00:01:16.483
why don't we just multiply the 3 times each of these components?

00:01:16.483 --> 00:01:21.005
So this could be equal to.. we have 2 and 1..

00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:24.011
And we're going to multiply each of these with 3.

00:01:24.011 --> 00:01:27.675
So 3 times 2 and 3 times 1.

00:01:27.675 --> 00:01:32.906
And then the resulting vector is still going to be a 2-dimensional vector.

00:01:32.906 --> 00:01:37.134
And it's going to be the 2-dimensional vector (6,3).

00:01:37.134 --> 00:01:40.735
Now I encourage you to get some graph paper out and to actually plot this vector,

00:01:40.735 --> 00:01:46.100
and think about how it relates to this vector right over here.

00:01:46.316 --> 00:01:47.739
So let me do that..

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:50.741
So the vector (6,3), if we started at the origin..

00:01:50.741 --> 00:01:56.337
We would move 6 in the horizontal direction.. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6..

00:01:56.337 --> 00:01:59.536
And 3 in the vertical.. 1, 2, 3..

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:04.936
So it gets us right over there, so it would look like this.

00:02:05.536 --> 00:02:08.434
So what just happened to this vector?

00:02:08.604 --> 00:02:11.269
Well notice, one way to think about it is what has changed,

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.405
and what has not changed about this vector?

00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:17.725
Well what's not changed is still pointing in the same direction.

00:02:17.725 --> 00:02:21.336
So this right over here has the same direction.

00:02:21.336 --> 00:02:24.669
Multiplying by the scalar, at least the way we defined it..

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:28.539
did not change the direction that my vector is going in.

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:32.072
Or at least in this case it didn't.. But it did change its magnitude.

00:02:32.072 --> 00:02:35.202
Its magnitude is now 3 times longer, which makes sense!

00:02:35.202 --> 00:02:36.935
Because we multiplied it by 3.

00:02:36.935 --> 00:02:39.601
One way to think about it is we scaled it up by 3.

00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:43.404
The scalar scaled up the vector. That might make sense.

00:02:43.404 --> 00:02:46.737
Or it might make an intuition of where that word scalar came from.

00:02:46.737 --> 00:02:52.484
The scalar, when you multiply it, it scales up a vector.

00:02:52.484 --> 00:02:57.145
It Increased its magnitude by 3 without changing its direction.

00:02:57.145 --> 00:02:59.149
Well let's do something interesting..

00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:04.501
Let's multiply our vector a by a negative number.

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:08.148
Let's just multiply it by -1 for simplicity.

00:03:08.148 --> 00:03:13.351
So let's just multiply -1 times a.

00:03:13.536 --> 00:03:16.338
Well using the convention that we just came up with..

00:03:16.338 --> 00:03:20.148
We would multiply each of the components by -1.

00:03:20.148 --> 00:03:26.364
So 2 times -1 is -2, and 1 times -1 is -1.

00:03:26.564 --> 00:03:32.602
So now -1 times a is going to be (-2,-1)

00:03:32.602 --> 00:03:34.321
So if we started at the origin,

00:03:34.321 --> 00:03:39.737
we would move in the horizontal direction -2, and in the vertical -1

00:03:39.737 --> 00:03:47.859
So now what happened to the vector? When I did that?

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:50.671
Well now it flipped its direction!

00:03:50.671 --> 00:03:54.070
Multiplying it by this -1, it flipped it's direction.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.333
Its magnitude actually has not changed,

00:03:56.333 --> 00:03:59.901
but its direction is now in the exact opposite direction.

00:03:59.901 --> 00:04:04.522
Which makes sense, that multiplying by a negative number would do that.

00:04:04.522 --> 00:04:08.274
In fact when we dealt with the traditional number line, that's what happened

00:04:08.274 --> 00:04:11.643
If you took 5 times -1, well now you're going in the other direction

00:04:11.643 --> 00:04:14.069
you're at -5, you're 5 to the left of zero.

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.936
So it makes sense that this would flip its direction.

00:04:16.936 --> 00:04:24.394
So you could imagine, if you were to take something like -2 times your vector a,

00:04:24.394 --> 00:04:26.151
-2 times your vector a..

00:04:26.151 --> 00:04:29.474
And I encourage you to pause this video and try this on your own..

00:04:29.474 --> 00:04:33.940
What would this give? And what would be the resulting visualization of the vector?

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.816
Well let's see, this would be equal to -2 times 2 is -4,

00:04:39.816 --> 00:04:43.738
-2 times 1 is -2, so this vector..

00:04:43.738 --> 00:04:46.669
if you were to start at the origin! remember you don't have to start at the origin..

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:52.898
but if you were.. it would go 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.. 1, 2..

00:04:52.898 --> 00:04:56.742
It looks just like this..

00:04:57.358 --> 00:05:04.957
And so just to remind ourselves.. our original vector a looked like this..

00:05:05.404 --> 00:05:08.564
(2, 1) looks like this..

00:05:08.564 --> 00:05:15.934
And then when you multiply it by -2.. you get a vector that looks like this..

00:05:15.934 --> 00:05:17.068
Let me draw it like this..

00:05:17.068 --> 00:05:19.870
I'm purposely not having them all start at the origin,

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.069
because they don't HAVE to all start at the origin..

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:26.552
But you get a vector that looks like this..

00:05:27.737 --> 00:05:31.610
So what's the difference between a and -2 times a?

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.973
well the negative flipped it over,

00:05:33.973 --> 00:05:37.526
and then the two flipped it over and now it has twice the magnitude

00:05:37.526 --> 00:05:41.526
but because of the negative it has twice the magnitude in the other direction.
