00:00:04.534 --> 00:00:05.868
Narrator: THE FIRST COMPUTERS

00:00:05.868 --> 00:00:08.801
USED TO BE THE SIZE
OF AN ENTIRE ROOM.

00:00:08.801 --> 00:00:12.000
THEN THEY WERE BUILT
TO FIT ON YOUR DESK.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.167
THE NEWEST DESIGN IS A PORTABLE
DEVICE THAT SITS ON YOUR LAP,

00:00:16.167 --> 00:00:18.167
AND TODAY'S LAPTOPS ARE MADE

00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:21.234
EVEN SMALLER
AND MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER.

00:00:24.534 --> 00:00:26.801
WITH ITS LIGHTNING-FAST
PROCESSOR

00:00:26.801 --> 00:00:28.601
AND IMPRESSIVE GRAPHICS,

00:00:28.601 --> 00:00:32.267
THIS LAPTOP IS DESIGNED
FOR HIGH-PERFORMANCE GAMING.

00:00:32.267 --> 00:00:35.000
THE COMPUTER'S BRAIN,
CALLED THE MOTHERBOARD,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.467
BEGINS AS
A PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD.

00:00:37.467 --> 00:00:40.200
ITS PATTERN OF LINES
AND PADS AND COPPER

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.567
IS THE WIRING
FOR THE ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS

00:00:42.567 --> 00:00:44.801
THAT WILL BE SOLDERED
TO THE BOARD.

00:00:44.801 --> 00:00:47.801
THIS MACHINE PLACES A STENCIL
OF THE COMPONENT LAYOUT

00:00:47.801 --> 00:00:49.534
ONTO THE BOARD

00:00:49.534 --> 00:00:52.767
AND APPLIES SOLDER PASTE
THROUGH THE OPENINGS.

00:00:52.767 --> 00:00:56.467
A QUALITY-INSPECTION CAMERA
PHOTOGRAPHS THE SOLDER PASTE

00:00:56.467 --> 00:00:58.834
AND SENDS THE IMAGES
TO A COMPUTER.

00:00:58.834 --> 00:01:02.534
THE COMPUTER ANALYZES THEM,
LOOKING FOR ANY MISSING PASTE,

00:01:02.534 --> 00:01:04.901
MISALIGNMENT, OR OTHER MISTAKES.

00:01:04.901 --> 00:01:06.834
IF THE BOARD PASSES INSPECTION,

00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:10.100
IT PASSES THROUGH
15 ROBOTIC MACHINES,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.033
EACH OF WHICH PLACES UP
TO 150 COMPONENTS

00:01:13.033 --> 00:01:17.567
ON THE CORRECT LOCATIONS
ON THE BOARD IN JUST 30 SECONDS.

00:01:17.567 --> 00:01:19.167
THEN THE BOARD RUNS
THROUGH AN OVEN

00:01:19.167 --> 00:01:20.934
THAT MELTS THE SOLDER PASTE,

00:01:20.934 --> 00:01:24.767
CONNECTING THE COMPONENTS
TO THE BOARD.

00:01:24.767 --> 00:01:26.667
ANOTHER CAMERA INSPECTION
ENSURES

00:01:26.667 --> 00:01:30.334
THAT THE INTERNAL PROCESSOR
IS CORRECTLY SOLDERED,

00:01:30.334 --> 00:01:34.267
AND THAT NO COMPONENT IS MISSING
OR SHIFTED OUT OF POSITION.

00:01:34.267 --> 00:01:37.234
AFTER FUNCTION TESTING
AND A VISUAL INSPECTION,

00:01:37.234 --> 00:01:39.701
THE MOTHERBOARD
MOVES TO THE ASSEMBLY LINE

00:01:39.701 --> 00:01:42.400
AND IS SET ASIDE
FOR THE TIME BEING.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.634
NEXT, TECHNICIANS MANUALLY
ASSEMBLE THE TOP HALF

00:01:45.634 --> 00:01:48.100
OF THE LAPTOP
CALLED THE PANEL KIT.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.367
THEY PLACE PROTECTION FILM
ON THE 15-INCH L.C.D. SCREEN.

00:01:52.367 --> 00:01:53.734
THEN THEY PLUG IN THE CABLE

00:01:53.734 --> 00:01:57.567
THAT WILL CONNECT THE L.C.D.
TO THE MOTHERBOARD.

00:01:57.567 --> 00:02:01.801
THEY INSERT THE L.C.D. SCREEN
INTO A FRAME WITH A WEB CAMERA

00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:05.701
AND MICROPHONE ALREADY EMBEDDED.

00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:09.934
THEN THEY ATTACH THIS ANTENNA
BOTTOM COVER TO THE SCREEN COVER

00:02:09.934 --> 00:02:13.167
AND POSITION
THE MOTHERBOARD CABLE INSIDE IT.

00:02:13.167 --> 00:02:17.000
NEXT, THEY INSTALL THE MODULE
FOR THE WEBCAM AND MICROPHONE.

00:02:20.868 --> 00:02:22.567
THEY ATTACH TWO HINGES,

00:02:22.567 --> 00:02:27.767
WHICH CONNECT THIS PANEL KIT
TO THE REST OF THE LAPTOP.

00:02:27.767 --> 00:02:29.767
THEN THEY INSTALL
THE WI-FI ANTENNA

00:02:29.767 --> 00:02:31.667
IN THE ANTENNA BOTTOM COVER.

00:02:31.667 --> 00:02:36.734
♪♪

00:02:36.734 --> 00:02:40.167
ALL COMPONENTS ARE CONCEALED
IN THE ANTENNA BOTTOM COVER

00:02:40.167 --> 00:02:42.200
BEHIND THIS ANTENNA TOP COVER.

00:02:44.267 --> 00:02:45.968
THEY COMPLETE THE PANEL KIT

00:02:45.968 --> 00:02:49.167
BY PRESSING IN A THIN METAL
FRAME AROUND THE SCREEN.

00:02:55.634 --> 00:02:59.868
NEXT, THEY ASSEMBLE THE BOTTOM
HALF OF THE LAPTOP.

00:02:59.868 --> 00:03:02.400
FIRST, TECHNICIANS ATTACH
THE TOP COVER

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.767
TO THE PANEL-KIT HINGES
AND THE TOUCHPAD.

00:03:05.767 --> 00:03:10.434

00:03:10.434 --> 00:03:14.234
THEN THEY INSTALL THE RIGHT AND
LEFT SPEAKERS IN THE TOP COVER.

00:03:17.701 --> 00:03:20.734
NOW THE MOTHERBOARD
COMES BACK INTO PLAY.

00:03:20.734 --> 00:03:23.634
AFTER INSPECTION,
A COMPUTER-GUIDED ROUTER

00:03:23.634 --> 00:03:27.033
CUTS OUT OPENINGS TO ACCOMMODATE
THE COMPUTER'S FANS,

00:03:27.033 --> 00:03:29.934
WHICH PREVENT THE ELECTRONICS
FROM OVERHEATING.

00:03:29.934 --> 00:03:34.267
A GAMING LAPTOP GENERATES A LOT
MORE HEAT THAN A REGULAR LAPTOP

00:03:34.267 --> 00:03:38.567
AND THEREFORE REQUIRES TWO
POWERFUL FANS RATHER THAN ONE.

00:03:38.567 --> 00:03:40.400
AFTER CHECKING
THAT THE FAN SCREWS

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.234
ARE SUFFICIENTLY TIGHTENED,

00:03:42.234 --> 00:03:46.501
THEY PLACE THE MOTHERBOARD
INTO THE TOP COVER.

00:03:46.501 --> 00:03:50.701
CONTAMINANTS SUCH AS DUST OR OIL
CAN IMPEDE PROPER CONTACT,

00:03:50.701 --> 00:03:53.501
SO AS A PRECAUTION,
THEY CLEAN THE CONNECTORS

00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:55.901
FOR THE MEMORY MODULES
WITH SOLVENT,

00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:59.968
THEN DRY THEM
WITH COMPRESSED AIR.

00:03:59.968 --> 00:04:02.534
THEN THEY INSTALL
THE MEMORY MODULE,

00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:05.033
THE WI-FI AND BLUETOOTH MODULE,

00:04:05.033 --> 00:04:09.501
AND THE SOLID-STATE DISC,
WHICH STORES DATA.

00:04:09.501 --> 00:04:12.734
THEY CONNECT A HIGH-CAPACITY
BATTERY TO THE MOTHERBOARD.

00:04:12.734 --> 00:04:16.000
BATTERIES FOR GAMING LAPTOPS
ARE TYPICALLY LARGER

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.834
BECAUSE THE FASTER PROCESSOR AND
DUAL FANS CONSUME MORE POWER.

00:04:20.834 --> 00:04:23.067
THE LAST COMPONENT IS
THE KEYBOARD,

00:04:23.067 --> 00:04:25.234
WHICH FITS INTO
A RECTANGULAR OPENING

00:04:25.234 --> 00:04:27.634
IN THE TOP COVER
OF THE BOTTOM HALF.

00:04:27.634 --> 00:04:28.934
A LASER-ETCHING MACHINE

00:04:28.934 --> 00:04:32.667
MARKS THE REQUIRED
INFORMATION UNDERNEATH.

00:04:32.667 --> 00:04:35.868

NUMEROUS FUNCTIONS,

00:04:35.868 --> 00:04:38.801
AND A QUALITY-CONTROL TEAM
TESTS SEVERAL OTHERS,

COLOR DISPLAYS...

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.434

00:04:51.667 --> 00:04:54.267
NOT ONLY MUST THE KEYS
FUNCTION PROPERLY,

00:04:54.267 --> 00:04:55.734
THEY NEED TO BE DURABLE,

00:04:55.734 --> 00:04:59.300
SO ENTHUSIASTIC GAMERS
WON'T BREAK THEM WHILE PLAYING.
