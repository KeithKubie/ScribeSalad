00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.529
Thanks to the latest technology in ‘paleo-biorobotics’,
this nearly three hundred million-year-old

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:07.640
fossil is WALKING.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.760
This little guy is the result of years of
advancements in CT scanning and is changing

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.520
the way we study ancient animals.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.990
It’s now evolving our perspective on how
they walked and even breathed.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.940
Early tomography machines were invented to
look inside your body, and with the creation

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.360
of computational techniques, they have the
ability to digitally reconstruct the inside

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.830
of living, and fossilized structures without
invasive measures.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.290
But don’t go running inside a paleontologist’s
CT machine, it’s slightly different.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.040
They use micro-CT scanning which sends higher
doses of X-rays that can penetrate rock and

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.050
give finer detail to specimens.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.219
This added precision helps for scanning fossils
like the one used for “OroBOT”.

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:50.350
The original fossil for this invention is
the Orobates pabsti, first described in 2004,

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.300
and thought to have roamed the earth before
the dinosaurs.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.410
This species is suspected to be a close cousin
of the last common ancestor of dinosaurs,

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.530
reptiles, birds, and mammals.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.379
It’s also considered a stem amniote, an
evolutionary link from amphibians that reproduce

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.710
in water, to land vertebrates who lay eggs.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.610
What makes it even more special, is that it’s
one of the oldest known vertebrates with a

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.130
fully preserved skeleton, AND..wait for it,
footprints to match!

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.330
By studying Orobates, we’d have a greater
understanding of how mammals, like us, evolved.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.840
Obviously, a fossil like this is too good
to be slept on, so scientists from Switzerland

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.170
and Germany teamed up to unravel the creature’s
locomotion.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.830
They started by analyzing X-ray videos of
modern animals linked to Orobates, like salamanders,

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.620
skinks, iguanas, and caimans.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.090
Biologists observed their gait, or manner
of walking, paying close attention to key

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.560
biomechanics such as: how erect the animal
stood on its legs; how bent its backbone was;

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.110
and how its joints bent as it walked.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.229
They then created a walking computer simulation
that matched perfectly with digital footprints.

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.490
This simulation identified different positions
where the bones did not bump or become disjointed.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.829
And while this simulation was awesome, it
couldn’t exactly represent the physics of

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:08.929
the real world.

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.069
So roboticists used the digital data to create
OroBOT.

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.730
OroBOT might look vaguely familiar if you
ever saw the design of Pleurobot back in 2015.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.559
It was inspired by the same mechanics but
made to fit the skeletal frame of Orobates

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:22.559
instead.

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:26.469
Each limb of the robot was separated into
actuated joints to give it better mobility.

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:29.950
In total, OroBOT has twenty-eight servomotors.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.400
Each one is used to move its limbs and is
powered by cables linked back to a computer;

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.739
which feeds OroBOT its positioning reference
signals, or its controls.

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.920
Every leg forms a kinematic chain which begins
at the girdle and ends at the foot.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.349
But OroBOT couldn’t have been built without
the original micro-CT scans made in 2015.

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:53.279
And even though not every dinosaur is becoming
a robot, scans like these are revealing other

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:57.629
unknown aspects of dinosaurs, like how some
species breathed.

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:00.709
Ankylosaurs are known for their heavily armored
exteriors.

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.359
Paleontologists wondered how these huge dinos
stayed cool during the hot Mesozoic period

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:10.379
and original CT scans revealed they had long,
coiled nasal passages.

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:15.109
At first, scientists weren’t sure why, but
with simulations using advanced computational

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:20.230
fluid dynamics, they simulated how the air
moved within the dinos’ nostrils.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.839
Simulations revealed there was a significant
heat exchange system within the canals.

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:29.109
CT scans showed hot blood vessels ran along
the nasal passages, losing heat to the air

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:30.400
as it traveled through.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.670
And simultaneously, evaporation of moisture
in the passages cooled down veins which carried

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.010
blood to the brain to keep it from overheating.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.249
They basically had a 'built-in air conditioner.'

00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:42.230
cool.The more you know.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.319
So I hope you love CT scanning more than you
ever did before because it’s practically

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.209
the foundation for all this innovative research.

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.959
The team from OroBOT says the research in
this field doesn’t end here either.

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.480
They hint that there is potential to build
on what they have, with research considering

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.479
muscles or softer tissue.

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:02.669
You can even check out their open source data
online, and play and analyze on your own.

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:07.379
So while we’re not walking around with cloned
dinosaurs, maybe we can walk around with robotic

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:08.379
ones.

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:09.379
Maybe.

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:10.379
Let’s not get our hopes up.

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.659
OroBOT wasn’t built in a day, the team has
been working on this project for the last

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:13.659
8 years!

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:16.870
I can only imagine what we’ll get if we
give ‘em another decade.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.970
