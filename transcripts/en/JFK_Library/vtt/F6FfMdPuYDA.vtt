00:00:00.206 --> 00:00:02.018
- What we've done at Bard is

00:00:02.018 --> 00:00:04.685
build an institution which sets,

00:00:06.321 --> 00:00:07.615
really the tone

00:00:07.615 --> 00:00:09.290
and sets the standard

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.142
for the return of real
educational opportunity

00:00:13.142 --> 00:00:14.774
and real hope

00:00:14.774 --> 00:00:16.107
and real meaning

00:00:17.431 --> 00:00:20.216
in our prison systems
across the United States.

00:00:20.216 --> 00:00:23.056
And the students that
you've seen in these videos,

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:25.516
it's so important to remember,

00:00:25.516 --> 00:00:27.141
are not analogous to

00:00:27.141 --> 00:00:29.688
or not in some way like,

00:00:29.688 --> 00:00:32.688
but they are exactly the same people

00:00:33.684 --> 00:00:37.610
who our last generation
of most distinguished

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.744
social scientists and
leaders in government

00:00:40.744 --> 00:00:42.488
and in education,

00:00:42.488 --> 00:00:46.276
described as super predators, right?

00:00:46.276 --> 00:00:48.384
Who we built a giant

00:00:48.384 --> 00:00:52.891
multi-billion apparatus
to keep away from us.

00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:56.041
The cynicism that was involved in that

00:00:56.041 --> 00:01:00.208
was not limited to some
imaginary terrible people.

00:01:02.906 --> 00:01:05.126
We were all culpable in it

00:01:05.126 --> 00:01:06.772
and the kind of cynicism

00:01:06.772 --> 00:01:08.741
that led to those decisions,

00:01:08.741 --> 00:01:12.201
I think were not limited
to law enforcement.

00:01:12.201 --> 00:01:15.201
They also included the great leaders

00:01:16.055 --> 00:01:18.683
of the most important secular, liberal

00:01:18.683 --> 00:01:20.328
institutions in American life.

00:01:20.328 --> 00:01:23.326
And those are our
colleges and universities.

00:01:23.326 --> 00:01:26.570
So at Bard, our idea is how do we

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.806
refashion, how do we smash the way

00:01:29.806 --> 00:01:31.931
we've done college admission

00:01:31.931 --> 00:01:32.859
in the United States

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:35.053
and engage as many kinds of Americans

00:01:35.053 --> 00:01:38.556
as we possibly can in the most ambitious,

00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:41.017
most rigorous, most dignified kind

00:01:41.017 --> 00:01:43.463
of education we possible could.

00:01:43.463 --> 00:01:46.249
At our last BA graduation two years ago,

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:47.990
at Eastern Correctional Facility,

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.573
a full half of those graduates,

00:01:51.775 --> 00:01:54.797
incarcerated men of all ages,

00:01:54.797 --> 00:01:58.947
a full half of them were
majors in mathematics.

00:01:58.947 --> 00:02:01.014
How far does that go to puncture

00:02:01.014 --> 00:02:03.279
the liberal prejudice

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:07.006
that you find in every part of life

00:02:07.006 --> 00:02:09.396
of who's interested in what

00:02:09.396 --> 00:02:11.491
and who's capable of what.
