00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.600
You’ve all seen that show.

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.560
Good guy reads the paint splatter on the wall,
tests the DNA, and bags the killer all within

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.560
50 minutes.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:13.780
But how much of that is close to real life?

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.080
Hey future serial killers,

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.769
We all think that’s how solving crimes works
right?

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:22.081
The killer is an idiot who leaves minuscule
traces of his DNA all over the place and crime

00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:25.230
scene investigators use the latest tech to
catch the bad guy.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.509
While this happens in Hollywood, it’s not
reality.

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:32.230
And unfortunately, many people can’t tell
the difference.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.720
This is what’s called the CSI effect.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.050
It’s when these shows influence how the
administration of justice plays out.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.860
Many jurors expect and demand that crimes
be solved by super tech that doesn’t really

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:43.860
exist.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.289
But through a mix of old and new techniques
science is helps solve even the most heinous

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:48.520
of crimes.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.780
You might be surprised how much you can tell
from a drop of blood.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.329
When you get your blood drawn at the doctor’s
and shipped off to be tested, a lot can be

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:56.329
revealed.

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.340
From your blood cell count, your glucose and
cholesterol levels, tests can tell if you

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.829
have certain diseases or viruses.

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.100
It can even tell you your biological age,
not just your chronological age, according

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.960
to a study published in the journal Nature.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.369
Things like bad diet, low exercise and stress
can make your body’s cells appear older

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.000
than how many trips around the sun you’ve
taken.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.750
But that’s blood collected in a precise,
clinical way, blood stains on hotel room carpet…

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.320
different story.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.520
Blood can tell a story of a crime.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.130
Blood spatter allows investigators to recreate
the events that unfolded.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.590
It’s actually an old science, the first
systematic study of bloodstains was published

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.990
at the University of Vienna in 1895, titled
“On the formation, form, direction and spreading

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.549
of blood stains resulting in blunt trauma
at the head”.

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.210
But over the decades, it’s gotten much more
advanced.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.979
The field uses a mix of math and science to
figure out what happened.

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.750
According to the book “Principles of Bloodstain
Pattern Analysis” bloodstains can be divided

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.340
into three categories: passive/gravity, spatter
and altered.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.929
Passive is like it sounds, like blood pooling
under a victim.

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.330
Spatter on the other hand, well the type of
blood spatter can sometimes tell where an

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.820
injury was.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.970
Expirated bloodstain patterns comes from more
“natural” occurrences like by breathing,

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.630
spitting and coughing up blood.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.320
You can find bubbles in these stains from
air pockets and it might be a lighter color

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.010
from being diluted from saliva.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.320
Altered means, like you would expect, that
the stain has been altered in some way, like

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.160
an object being dragged across it or an attempt
at a clean up.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.430
According to a study in SIAK-Journal - the
Journal for Police Science and Practice, impact

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.470
spatter patterns indicates something traumatic,
like a gunshot, blunt force trauma, or from

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.470
machinery.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.060
The blood drops extend outward from a point
in direct lines.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.260
If it’s an impact spatter, it’s very likely
that there was more than one blow, as the

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.220
first blow never spreads much blood.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.850
But the effectiveness of such analyses are
really varied.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.180
Depending the amount of blood, a vague idea
of a weapon, whether is was blunt or sharp

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.460
or a bullet can be determined.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.410
The location and pattern of the blood can
give investigators an idea of angle, velocity,

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.370
and trajectory of the blood.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.350
By analyzing these kinds of patterns, they
get an idea of how hard the force of impact

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.920
was or what angle the attack came from.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.090
And of course if there’s enough blood, you
can even find out someone’s identity.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.930
DNA analysis is considered the “gold standard”
of crime scene investigation reliability.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.350
But it took awhile for that technology advance.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.450
In the 70’s, the only thing they could tell
was which type of blood it was.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.170
Which depending on the type could narrow the
suspects down to 4 to 49% of the population.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.760
Now using polymerase chain reaction, PCR technique,
which takes a small piece of DNA and multiplies

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.570
it hundreds of times so it’s easier to “see’”
and analyze.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.530
After PCR, DNA then goes through a process
called gel electrophoresis which makes it

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.380
easy to compare DNA samples.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.030
You’ve probably seen these on TV or maybe
in your own biology lab.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.470
The gels looks like columns with little lines
that trap certain lengths of DNA fragments

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:52.840
in different sections.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.540
By comparing how these lines match up to known
or unknown other known, researchers can either

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.350
remove someone as a suspect or nail the sucker
down.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.960
While blood can tell the story of a crime
scene, the right domain name will tell yours.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.410
No domain extension will help you tell your
story like a DOT COM or DOT NET domain name.

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.080
And because you watch DNews, you can get 15%
off Domain Dot Com’s names and web hosting

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.530
by using the code DNews when you check out.

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.070
Of course if evidence of the crime is wiped
away with bleach, you’re screwed.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.540
Or are you?

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.410

light up like the night sky, check out this
