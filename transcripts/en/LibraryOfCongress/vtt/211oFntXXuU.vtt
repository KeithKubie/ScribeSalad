so much for joining us today,

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.760
my name is Ruth Tam, I'm a

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.270
It's a talk show on
WAMU, D.C.'s NPR station.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.650 position:56%
NPR happens to be a media partner

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:21.950
by the Library of Congress.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.780
I want to thank the co-chairman of
today's festival, David Rubenstein

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.990

who have made today's
event possible.

Today's conversation with Lois Lowry
will be followed by a recorded Q&amp;A.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.920
So before we get started,
I'd like to remind you all

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.240
to silence your cell phones.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:44.540
&gt;&gt; Lois Lowry: Ah, my
cell phone is down there.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.650
&gt;&gt; I just want to [inaudible].

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.860
&gt;&gt; Ruth Tam: [Background speaker]
Nearly every year since 1977,

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.390 position:56%
Lois Lowry has published a new book,
but perhaps even more impressive

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.760
than the number of books she's
published are the lessons

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.390
that we've all gleamed from them.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.530
She doesn't know it,
but when I was 8,

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.450
Lois Lowry taught me the
importance of questioning authority

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.590
and the value of memory,
in The Giver.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.720
She taught me how to empathize
and be brave and number the stars.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.870
And she gave me a model through her
Anastasia series, for what it means

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.830
to be unabashedly yourself.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.490
Most of all, Lois Lowry gave
me a mirror to see my own life,

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.510
helping me to better confront my
dreams, my curiosities, my fears.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.230
Now, Lois Lowry turns that
same mirror onto herself

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.210
in an update version of
her memoire, Looking Back.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.890
Please join me in welcoming
Lois Lowry.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.190 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Lois Lowry: Thank you, thank you.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:38.320
[ Applause ]

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.640
&gt;&gt; Ruth Tam: Lois, thank you so
much for being with us today.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.620
In The Giver, The Giver
transmits memories to Jonas

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.660
and you wrote your memoire looking
back in kind of a similar way.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.640
You share your life in bursts
of memories with the reader.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.140
I'm wondering, when you wrote the
original version of Looking Back

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.570
in the late 90s, just a couple
years after your wrote The Giver.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.860
Was this how you imagined you
wanted to tell your story?

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.840
Through a burst of memory?

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.150
&gt;&gt; Lois Lowry: I don't
know that it was conscious,

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.990
consciously related to The Giver.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.760
But certainly, my life,

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.440
like everybody's is made
up of a set of memories.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.120
And when I wrote the first
book, which is shown here,

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.320
I did it by trying to
answer the question

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.110
that so many people have asked and
still ask of how I get my ideas.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.780
In thinking about that and how
to answer it I realized that many

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.740
of my, ideas for books or
many of the things that appear

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.400
in my books, come from my own life.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.420
And, in thinking about that I
went back through the boxes,

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.620
in my family I became the recipient

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.270
of all the family photographs
including all the blurred snapshots

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.730
of a cat whose name
you don't remember.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.530
But in looking through
those, I identified moments

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.840
that later appeared in books.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.300
And so I put it together in
that way, fragments, it's not,

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.730
arranged in any linear fashion.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.110
And so to call it an autobiography
is, a mistake, it isn't really,

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.060
it's not, and then I did
this and then I did that.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.130
It's the little pieces that
appeared later in books,

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.120
that the book identified
and then a photograph.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.240
My father was a photographer
and so eventually was I,

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.600
so I had a great store
of photographs.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.750
This one, of me on the first
cover I'm about 4 years old.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.990 position:56%
And I'm interested and I like the
fact that the new version, same book

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.100
but 20 years added to it,
is the different photograph.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:41.740
And what fascinates me about
this, is that I'm probably 5 or 6.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.200
But when I look at this photograph,
and this I think is relevant

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.300
to why I write for
kids, because I do this.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.700
I look at this photograph,

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.690
and I relive that moment,
I remember that moment.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.890
I remember how the sand felt
on my feet, this is in a lake

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.430
where we spent summers
in Pennsylvania.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.490
I remember that horrible
bathing suit and I, look at me,

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.040
I'm doing this because
it was uncomfortable.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.440
And I also remember the
smell of the, changing place

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.190
where we would go into change
our clothes, and it was dank

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.840
and had mold and there was always
a daddy long legs on the wall.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.760
And all of that comes back to
me, when I see the photograph.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.900
And throughout the book, which
is comprised of photographs,

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.300
each one of those photographs
does that for me,

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.320
makes me relive that moment.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.370
As I eventually relived
it by rewriting it often

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.290
with a different protagonist
in a book for kids.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.630
&gt;&gt; Ruth Tam: Given the seriousness
of some of your best known works,

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.010
it's really great to see how
funny this memoire actually is,

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.530
and obviously the cover of the
photo, is a funny, a funny photo.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.910
It's got some humorous
memories behind it.

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.890
I'm wondering how did you
balance memories of happiness

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.570 position:56%
in with hardships that have happened
in your life, namely the death

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.720
of your sister, your
son, and your partner.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.850
&gt;&gt; Lois Lowry: Well, here's
my sister in this photograph,

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.870
with that look on her
face, like she hates

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.330
that moment just as much as I did.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.730
And my sister was a very
important person in my life,

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.230
and the book begins, or early on
there are a number of pictures,

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.200
and this is my only really
autobiographical novel,

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.940
which talks about the two sisters.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.510
But, here we are here
there are a number

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.240
of pictures of me and my sister.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.040
Everybody's life, if they live
to any age at all, and I'll be 80

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.520
on my next birthday, is going
to have episodes of great loss

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.780
as well as great happiness.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.580
And that's what makes up our
lives, and so that's what I put

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.140
into this book, each
of those moments.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.920
And I talked at length and
used a number of photographs,

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.980
this is a photograph
that I have to explain.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.290
Sorry about that.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.040
But it's an example of
what I was just describing,

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.840
the dress that my sister is
wearing, in this photograph,

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.830
and she's 7 years old, I'm 4.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.700 position:56%
I coveted desperately, I wanted that
dress so badly, but it was hers.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.490
And the photograph is black and
white, but I remember the color

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.730
of that dress and it was the exact
color of the Campbell's tomato soup

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:17.640
that my mother would
give us, often for lunch.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.130
Any rate, here we are
again, the two sisters,

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.400
and I think that's
one more picture here.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.050
And here she's teaching me to read.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:31.080
&gt;&gt; Mic for two second because
you're talking to the other side.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.390
&gt;&gt; Lois Lowry: I can hold it.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:36.000
That's fine, thank you.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.300
&gt;&gt; Your welcome.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.370
&gt;&gt; Lois Lowry: And so here
I think this shows something

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.960
of the importance that my
sister, her role in my life.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.230
And then of course, later in the
book I don't have photographs

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.010
of this section of the book.

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.560 position:56%
I talk about the death of my sister.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.830
Same thing, about many years
later, of the death of my son.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:01.980
All of those things weave together
to create the fabric, of a life.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:06.710
And if you try to focus
on just the sunny days,

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.050
it would be a dishonest
representation.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.500
&gt;&gt; Ruth Tam: Now the
last time that you were

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.200
at the National Book
Festival you said

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.840
that The Giver was partly
inspired by your aging father.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.520
And when his memory began to fall
through, you were thinking about,

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.930
the, how truthful memory
is and how it serves us.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.920
And I'm curious about, how
when you wrote your memoire

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.700
and when you updated it recently,
did you ever question things

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.690
that happened to you or
reinvestigate your feelings

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:35.830
about things that have
happened in the past?

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.870
&gt;&gt; Lois Lowry: Hmm,
complicated question, tough one.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:44.070 position:56%
I think, you know as I went through,
too updated to add 20 years,

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:46.780
since the publication,
and find things.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.110
And I included in the
updated section,

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:51.450
the making of the movie The Giver.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:55.950
I included a number of other
things, grandchildren who hadn't

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:59.600
yet been born during
that first publication.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.620 position:56%
And so I went back through all those
things, and found those moments

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:06.700
and the things that
related to them in books.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:10.450
I don't think it involved
any rethinking because to me,

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:14.320
20 years has gone, anybody here
who's my age or around my age,

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:19.800
realizes how quickly time
passes, after a certain age.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:26.560 position:56%
And so, for me, 20 years has gone by
in a heartbeat, and it's those days,

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.120
19 years ago seem like
yesterday to me.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.110
So to me, they didn't
require reinvestigation

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:36.570
because they happened yesterday.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:38.170
&gt;&gt; Ruth Tam: One question
I'd like to revisit.

00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:39.940
One of the things that you
said you've always liked

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.900
about The Giver is that
readers could make up their own,

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.030
ending for what happened
to Gab and Jonas.

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:46.330
And you lied.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:47.630
&gt;&gt; Lois Lowry: I lied, yeah.

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:51.240
&gt;&gt; Ruth Tam: You lied, did
anyone send you a letter

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.600
that tells you, you could lie?

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.770
&gt;&gt; Lois Lowry: People have
complained about that.

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:58.470
People say I read that
speech you wrote or,

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.560
the Newbery Acceptance
Speech for The Giver

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.010
and she said you weren't
going to divulge the ending.

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.940
At the time I wrote
it, I had no plans

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:10.430
to write any sequels
or follow up books.

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:17.410
But I do respond to, letters
and emails today from readers.

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:19.710 position:56%
And I do think about their requests,

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:24.090 position:56%
although I don't always follow their
requests like, you know the kid

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.520
who writes and says why don't
you write an adventure book

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.050
with a super hero, I'm
not going to do that.

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:35.170
But, after The Giver was published,
and the ending was ambiguous,

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:39.090 position:56%
purposely so, although I always
thought it was an optimistic ending.

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:44.670 position:56%
Many, many, many kids wrote and
asked for more books to follow that.

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:49.390
And so, it was some years later
that I wrote the second book,

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:53.310
and then some years after that, the
third, and then finally, the fourth

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:56.260
and final book which draws
all the characters together.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.410
Now I've forgotten
what your question was.

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:00.250
&gt;&gt; Ruth Tam: So I didn't
actually get to it.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:01.550
&gt;&gt; Lois Lowry: Sorry.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:02.850
&gt;&gt; Ruth Tam: But I mean I kind

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:05.210
of was wondering why you then
decided to change your mind and.

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:06.510
&gt;&gt; Lois Lowry: Yeah.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.100
&gt;&gt; Ruth Tam: Give the readers
what they're asking for.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:13.040
&gt;&gt; Lois Lowry: And also I found,
well okay, confession time.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.320
The second book is Gathering Blue.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.740
And that was a book that I
did not sit down to write

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.830
as a companion book to The Giver.

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:27.500
It was a book that was new to
me, and a whole separate book.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.640
And I began as I always
do, with a character and I,

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.600
always see the character in my mind

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.050
and in this case, I
saw a young girl.

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:38.270
They always come, interestingly
with a name,

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:42.050
only once have I changed the
name from what first came to me

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:44.140
and that was with the book Son.

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:49.120 position:56%
But in this case, a girl named Kira,
she was a particular age, a young,

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.770
maybe 14, and I could see
her in a certain situation,

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.320
that was the beginning of a book.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:58.370
And as at began to evolve I saw
it as a time in the distant,

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:03.660
it was a very primitive society and
a, kind of a wilderness village.

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.110
And it was only, as I
approached the end of it,

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:10.480
and that was at the same time that
I was still getting so many letters

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.200
from kids asking about
the ending of The Giver.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.960
I suddenly thought, I can
connect those two books.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:22.570
And so at the very end, unnamed
you see that the character Jonas,

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:25.130
from the first book is still alive.

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:28.470
Kids always know who he is,
adults, because he's not named,

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:31.160
sometimes miss that reference.

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:37.510
And so there he was, and,
that book was published.

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:39.310
I don't know what year.

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:45.650 position:56%
And, then the third book, Messenger,
goes to the village where Jonas is,

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:48.060
and so he's now a character
in the third book.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.630
And he's an adult.

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:52.600
And the little boy from the
second book is the main character,

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.040
the adolescent.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:12:01.240 position:56%
I did get some, not complaints but
questions about how could these two,

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:05.030
places in the first two books,
coexist at the same time?

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:08.790
The world of The Giver
is so, futuristic,

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:13.680
and the world of Gathering
Blue is so primitive.

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:18.110
And as I was thinking how to answer
that question and whether perhaps,

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:21.430
I would have to say, okay
guys, it couldn't happen,

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:24.690
but give me a break it's
fiction, right [laughter]?

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:28.690
But at the time, I had a cousin,
I still have the same cousin,

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:31.120
whose daughter works for
the state department.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.960
And at that, and she
goes from place to place.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:38.100
Let's see, generally 2
years in each embassy.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:42.010
And at that time, she
was in Pakistan.

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:45.410
So that was happening, my
daughter, my cousin's daughter.

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:49.060
Betsy was working in Pakistan and
she was emailing home every day,

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.900
and sending photographs
from Pakistan.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:55.110
And at the same time, I began
to send money each month

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:59.320
to a wonderful organization called
Women to Women International.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.800
And I was given a woman, and
I had her picture, on my desk,

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.250
and she lived in Afghanistan.

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:09.720
In a hut with a dirt floor
and she was trying to raise

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:14.140
and educate 4 children, and she
had no electricity and no plumbing.

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:17.850
And I was paying so her
children could go to school.

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:23.600
And, theoretically, Afghanistan,
Pakistan, you could walk

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.730
from one place to another,
it would take you awhile

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:28.870
and it would be hard, but
those two places coexisted.

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:32.550
And so that's how I answered that
question about those two books.

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:36.160
And now I've again forgotten
what you asked, sorry.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.080
This is the way I write a
book incidentally [laughter].

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.490
I start writing about something
and then my mind goes over here

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:45.560
and I add to that and that, and
then I forget what I was writing

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.860
in the first place.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.000
It generally works, okay.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.300
Got another question?

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:51.860
&gt;&gt; Ruth Tam: [Laughter]
Well it seems like,

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:55.730
obviously from the way you
approach your fiction books

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:58.930
and the way you've written
your memoire that you enjoy,

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:00.900
let's call them non-traditional
narratives and you

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.540
like a little bit of ambiguity.

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:06.970 position:56%
When you write, how much information
do you side, do you decide to leave

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:10.120
in and what, information are
you okay with taking out,

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:14.240
and letting the readers take over?

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.740
&gt;&gt; Lois Lowry: Now,
that's a good question.

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:22.100
I always, I bet most authors
would say this if not all.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.290
You always know more
than is in the book.

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:31.600
I'm just thinking of a story
I can tell you that might,

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.740
answer this question
in a very graphic way.

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.050
My very first book was
called A Summer to Die,

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:39.190
it was published back in 1977.

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:42.080
It's still in print, it's had
different covers through the years.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:47.240
But, after it was published,
I got a,

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:51.080 position:56%
letter from a little girl in Denver.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:56.770
And, she said she had read this
book, and she said she wanted

00:14:56.770 --> 00:15:00.290
to be a writer when she grew up,
I think she was 11 years old.

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:02.320
And she was going to
enter a writing contest

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.760
at that Denver Post
was holding for kids.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.690
And she said but, I just want
to ask you some questions,

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:12.390
she said that when the, there's a
scene in a meadow, and she said,

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:14.440
I could just see that meadow,

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:17.290
how did you make me
able to see that meadow?

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:22.410 position:56%
And I wrote back and I said, I could
see it myself, in my imagination.

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:26.730
And I saw it like a photograph
might be of a beautiful meadow,

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:30.860
but I couldn't put every blade of
grass and every leaf on every tree

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.170
or every petal on every flower.

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:35.800
I couldn't put all of that in
the book, and so I had to select,

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.540
and I had to leave out a lot,

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:41.200
and I tried to select what would
enable you to see the meadow.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:45.850 position:56%
I put in just a few details, and you
told me you could see the meadow.

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:48.470
And that's what a writer
does, put in just enough

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:53.210
so the reader can create
their own, place, their own,

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:56.880
character, their own whatever.

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.430
So, I got a second letter
from the little girl,

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:02.840
who incidentally had terrible
handwriting [laughter].

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:07.460
And she said, thank you, she
said I see what you mean, I,

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:11.610
now I've read Anastasia Krupnik, in
which the child, the second book,

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:13.950
the child has a baby brother.

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:17.590
And she said there's a scene
where, you're describing,

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:20.030
the hallway in their apartment.

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:23.020
And her little brother
walking down the hall,

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:26.490
and she said I could just see
him, his shoelaces were untied,

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:30.430
and his backside was bulky
because he still wore diapers.

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:32.860
And there was a stain
on the wallpaper,

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.370
because you put those details in,

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:37.570
and she said I could see the whole
scene, even though you didn't,

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:40.220
tell me every single thing in it.

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.640 position:56%
And I think it was the second letter

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:45.210
where she said she was
entering the writing contest.

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:49.400
So, then I got the third and
final letter from this child

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:53.590
and it wasn't really a letter it
was a page of the Denver Post,

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:55.380
that she had folded
and put in the envelope

00:16:55.380 --> 00:17:00.510
and she had written her terrible
handwriting on it, I did it, I won.

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:02.990
And there is a huge
picture of the child

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:05.660
and I can still see
her face in my memory.

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:13.000 position:56%
And the caption under the picture
was, blind child wins writing award.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.010
Isn't that an amazing story?

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:17.680
You know if I put that in the
book the editor would say,

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:21.250
credibility issues here.

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:25.030
But I think despite
the fact of this child

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:28.120
who would now be, in
her 40s or 50s even.

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:31.710
Despite the fact of her
particular circumstance,

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:35.870
it does illustrate what, the answer
I'm trying to give to you which is,

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:38.650
you just put in just enough

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:42.950
so that the reader can create
his own world, her own world.

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:47.430
And see it, and it will not
be the world that you saw,

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:51.830
because it's a reciprocal
act, book writing.

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:57.300 position:56%
You do your thing, and they do their
thing and you each create a book.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:58.940
&gt;&gt; Ruth Tam: That's
a beautiful story.

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:03.480
I wanted to know, your first
book, you published in 1977,

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:07.050
and in the nearly 4 decades
that have gone by since,

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:09.680
you've published nearly
one book every year.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.780
I'm wondering, when did you
realize you first wanted

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:16.340
to write books specifically
for young people?

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:20.020
&gt;&gt; Lois Lowry: I'm going to
answer that in two parts.

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:23.660
When did I first specifically
know I wanted to be a writer?

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:25.880
If anybody here wanted to do,

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:31.230
boring research you could
find, an archive somewhere.

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:37.040
On an August, 1947 issue
of Jack and Jill magazine,

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:40.000
a magazine that was
published for children then.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.190
And they published
letters from children.

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:45.460
And there were two, I don't
want to call it a center fold,

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:48.910
but the two center pages,
and in the August issue,

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:53.110
1947 there was a letter
from 10 year-old me.

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:56.580
And it said I'm writing a novel.

00:18:56.580 --> 00:19:03.880
It was that age at which I already
knew I wanted to be a writer.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.950
Whatever novel I was then
writing, never saw the light of day

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:08.610
and I'm sure it was never finished

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:11.420
but I would have been
working hard at it.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.780
But I saw, I majored in writing

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:18.060
in college then I went
off to Brown at age 17.

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:22.550
But I envisioned being a
writer and that was my goal.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:24.590
And it's what I majored
in, in college,

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:26.790 position:56%
but I envisioned writing for adults.

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:30.780
It never occurred to me to write
for kids, though I had been one.

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:35.180 position:56%
Though I eventually had four of
them, before I was 25, incidentally.

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:43.460
And it was only when, I published
a short story in a magazine,

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:45.930
which was a magazine for adults.

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:50.480 position:56%
I hesitate to tell you the name of
it, though it still exists, I think.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:55.830
But it was Redbook magazine, and at
that time, they published fiction.

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:59.610
All of these magazines morphed
into magazines that now,

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:01.620
tell you more than you
want to know about make-up

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:03.990
and clothes, and your sex life.

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:07.450
But at that time, they
published fiction.

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:11.800
I had published a story in
Redbook that was a story for adults

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.920
but it was about a child.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:19.480
It was Seen Through the Eyes of a
Child, and when that was published,

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:23.170
a children's book editor from
Houghton Mifflin read it and wrote

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:27.180
to me and said would you consider
writing a book for young people.

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:30.410
It had never occurred to
me to do that, but that's,

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:34.910
with that invitation, when I
sat down to write what turned

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:37.620
out to be my first
book, A Summer to Die.

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:42.450 position:56%
Which was a fictionalized
retelling of, the loss of my sister.

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:48.720
I think often, writers writing
a first book will incorporate,

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.920
pivotal experiences
in their own lives.

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.300
And that's certainly what I did.

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.910
&gt;&gt; Ruth Tam: So our time with Lois
Lowry is coming to a close soon

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:58.290
but we're not going to leave
without giving you the chance

00:20:58.290 --> 00:20:59.590
to ask your own questions.

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:01.340
So if you have a question
for Lois Lowry,

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:05.760
please head on to the mics
and, we will turn to you.

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:10.400
Let's start over here, with
this, with this, this side.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:13.420
&gt;&gt; Hi. If you could live in
any of your dystopian novels,

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:14.940 position:56%
which one would you want to live in?

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.820 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Lois Lowry: If I, when you say
the dystopian novels, you're talking

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.910
about the four that form
The Giver Quartet I think.

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:22.210
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:24.380
&gt;&gt; Lois Lowry: If I could
live in any of those.

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:26.590
You know I didn't get
to the point of talking

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:28.800
about the fourth one, The Son.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:32.780
But the village, in that one,

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:35.780
by the end of the book,
is where I would live.

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:40.130
Because it has, it's through the,
actions of the various characters,

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:43.650
many of them young, been healed.

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:46.490
And so many of the deep flaws

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:51.020
within those different
civilizations have been changed.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:55.300
I try always, to end with an
optimistic ending and I think

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.160
that one does, so that's
where I would live.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.460
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:21:58.460 --> 00:21:59.760
&gt;&gt; Ruth Tam: And from here.

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:05.270
&gt;&gt; So, after reading The Giver,
being a science fiction reader,

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:09.870
manger reader, HP Lovecraft,
Douglas Adams.

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:15.440
Did any of your ideas spark from
science fiction, like the type of,

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:19.590
like color coming into play,
only after the reader thinking,

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:27.670 position:56%
oh there's color and then realizing,
oh, they can only see red now.

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:32.070
So, did any of it come from that?

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:35.610
&gt;&gt; Ruth Tam: Did any of your ideas
come from stories that you saw

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:37.670
on science fiction, were you
influenced by that in any way?

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:39.910
&gt;&gt; Lois Lowry: Hmm,
confession, I am not a reader

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:43.080
of science fiction or fantasy.

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:48.680
I, when I was in college
I had to read,

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.580
some of the classic
dystopian novels,

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:54.700
like 1984 and Brave New World.

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:57.140
They were not among my
favorites [laughter].

00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:04.870
And, so I never, aspired to
write science fiction or fantasy.

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:10.370
And when I began writing, The
Giver I didn't see it as that.

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:15.000
It was only gradually that, I began
to see it was futuristic, but I,

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.340
you know I wrote it like
a contemporary novel.

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:22.680
It doesn't, and I studiously
avoided any science,

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:27.740 position:56%
so that when kids write me today and
want to know exactly the technology

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.750
that allowed them to
do this, this or that,

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:31.490
I tell them I don't have a clue.

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:33.890
You know, make it up.

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:35.190
&gt;&gt; Ruth Tam: Your question.

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:39.650
&gt;&gt; Hi, what kind of
toothpaste do you use?

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:40.950
&gt;&gt; Lois Lowry: What
was the question?

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:42.250
&gt;&gt; Ruth Tam: What kind of
toothpaste do you use, right?

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:43.550
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:48.130
&gt;&gt; Lois Lowry: You know my
father was a dentist, don't you?

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:50.720
And I'm curious why you
asked that question.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.910
&gt;&gt; It's like an interesting
thing to know, I guess.

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:58.920
&gt;&gt; Lois Lowry: You know it's
interesting that readers,

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:02.330
and I'm one who feels the
same way about authors.

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:03.630
I'd love to know what kind

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:06.640
of toothpaste Ann McEwan
uses [laughter].

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:10.800
It's you just want to get
a glimpse into the life

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:15.190
of somebody you admire, and so
you focus on those little details,

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:16.540
Crest is the answer [laughter].

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:23.220
And, but I get emails all the time
asking me what kind of food I like,

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:25.010
and what my dog's name is.

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:27.170
And I think it's just
because you want

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:29.350
to be friends with, that author.

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:33.940
And I feel that way about a number
of authors, so I understand that.

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:37.410
&gt;&gt; Ruth Tam: I think we
feel that way about you.

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:43.460
&gt;&gt; What is the book that
you gift to others the most?

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:47.270
Maybe one by, maybe a
book you didn't write.

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:50.480
&gt;&gt; Lois Lowry: I want to make
sure I heard the correctly,

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.700
what book do I give
other people the most,

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.840
and do you mean one of my own or.

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.140
&gt;&gt; Ruth Tam: Another book.

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:57.440
&gt;&gt; Lois Lowry: Or another book.

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.920
I'm going to answer that, I'm
going to answer both questions.

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.990
One of which is my own question.

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:06.340
The book of mine that
I, most like to give

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.470
to people is the book
called Autumn Street,

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:11.590
the one that I mentioned
was autobiographical.

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:15.720 position:56%
I love that book, I think because
the people in it were people I loved

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:18.100
and most of whom are gone now.

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:22.810
But obviously I don't inflict
that on everybody I know.

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:25.060
And so when I'm called upon now

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:28.890
to give somebody a gift it
depends on what's current.

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:33.430
And I will tell you that, the book
I've given to people most often,

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:37.670
this past year, was a book I'm
trying to think of the title

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:38.970
to get the title accurately.

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:42.090
I think it's When Breath
Becomes Air,

00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:46.090
which is a wonderful
title, but Paul Kalanithi.

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:51.380
I don't have time to go
into it, you can look it up.

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:52.680
&gt;&gt; Ruth Tam: Over here.

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:53.980
&gt;&gt; Hi, I just want to say thank you

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:55.560
for your engrossing
novels and characters.

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:58.780
I've been teaching The Giver for
14 years now, the kids always want

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:01.200
to know how does climate
control work,

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.010
and is The Giver Jonas' father?

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:06.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Lois Lowry: Thank you, thank you.

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:09.330
Did, I have a little difficulty
hearing these questions.

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:12.020
Was there a question at the end of
that, I'm thanking her for saying.

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:14.160
&gt;&gt; Ruth Tam: Is The Giver Jonas'
father, is that the question?

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.710
&gt;&gt; How does climate control work?

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:17.390
&gt;&gt; Lois Lowry: Oh, is
The Giver Jonas' father?

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:22.940
You know, I've been asked that,
often by kids who actually.

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:28.880
And I think the process by
which they, produce children

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:32.240
in that society, means
that you don't know.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:34.940
It's probably a sperm
bank of some sort.

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:37.090
So my guess would be no.

00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:39.390
But whatever you.

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:41.330
&gt;&gt; and how does climate
control work?

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:42.630
&gt;&gt; Lois Lowry: Pardon me.

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:43.930
&gt;&gt; How does climate control work?

00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:46.430
&gt;&gt; Lois Lowry: Technology,
look it up [laughter].

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:48.100
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:50.510
&gt;&gt; Ruth Tam: We have time
for a couple more questions,

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:55.140
let's take one from here.

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:57.390
&gt;&gt; Hello, oh how do I start?

00:26:57.390 --> 00:27:02.830
You are one of my favorite authors
of all time, I have been reading,

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:07.380
my mom introduced me to
your books when I was what?

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:14.070
9/10ish. And we have the collection
of The Giver Quartet at home.

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:18.190
I absolutely adore your books
and every time I read them,

00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:22.490
I can see bits of myself,
bits of other people I know,

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:25.890
scattered throughout the book and
connections that I can really make

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:27.360
with things going on
in the real world.

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:33.400
So I wanted to know, how, it's
mostly about the social structure

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:37.270
of the communities you create,
the worlds that you built.

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:39.800
Is there any main inspiration
that came from your life

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:45.740 position:56%
to inspire these, like social
structures, like the, complete chaos

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:51.810
and disarray of Gathering Blue, the
order and sameness of the Giver.

00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:53.950
What inspired that social.

00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:58.960
&gt;&gt; Lois Lowry: Okay, I can answer
that, for the part about The Giver.

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:03.070
Of the chaos and disarray
of Gathering Blue,

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:05.030
can from my imagination, I think.

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:09.800
Well I don't think, I know that,
and probably influenced by.

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:14.690 position:56%
For a long time I've wanted to write
a novel set in the 14th century.

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:17.720
And so I've read a lot of, I
have a whole shelf of books

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:20.390
about Medieval times, and
I've not written that novel.

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:26.530 position:56%
But, that kind of chaos existed more
so in those times, but The Giver

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:28.110
and the order and structure.

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:33.010 position:56%
My father was a career army officer,
and I grew up on army posts.

00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:39.220
And, I pictured the world,
the community that Jonas lived

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:44.040
in as looking very much like the
army posts, that I grew up in.

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:47.820
Every day, for example, probably
some you here have military

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:54.540
backgrounds, but, every day at 5
o'clock, the, what are they blow

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:58.120
on the bugle at 5 o'clock?

00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.970
It's not, it's revelry
in the morning,

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:02.340
it's something at 5 o'clock.

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:05.410
And the cannon would go off.

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:08.680
And first the cannon,
and you'd hear the cannon

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.700
and everybody would stop
what they were doing.

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:13.350
I remember my little brother
dropping his bike to the ground

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:16.550
and standing solemnly with
his hand over his heart.

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:19.930
And my mother at the clothes line,
stopping, putting the clothes pin

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:21.840
down and standing solemnly.

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:27.040
While we listened to the bugle
call there in the evening.

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.920 position:56%
That seems kind of spooky to me now.

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.820
But it's the kind of
the world of The Giver,

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:35.870
where there are these
rules that you follow and,

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:40.420
perhaps they once had a good
reason, for having been created.

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:45.210
And maybe the reason is obsolete,
but that was I think quite clearly,

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:49.910
the inspiration for that
particular kind of community.

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:51.210
&gt;&gt; Ruth Tam: I'm sorry to say

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:53.220
that that's all the time we
have with Lois Lowry today.

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:56.400
The good news is that she's
signing books from 2 to 3 p.m.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.280
on the expo floor on
the lower levels.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:00.320
&gt;&gt; Lois Lowry: Do I have time
to tell them one funny story?

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:03.970
&gt;&gt; Ruth Tam: Do we have time?

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:05.270
&gt;&gt; Lois Lowry: Very
quickly, very quickly.

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:06.650
Because it's in the book.

00:30:06.650 --> 00:30:09.070
And so this is what's your
appetite for the book.

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:13.110
I didn't have time here to
talk about the movie, but,

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:15.890
when I was in Cape Town
watching them film the movie,

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:18.420
they asked me if I wanted
to be one of the elders,

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:23.050
seated in a semi-circle on
the stage at the ceremony.

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:24.430
And I said no.

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:29.530 position:56%
And I said jokingly to Jeff Bridges,
the one who had asked me that,

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:32.320
I said now if you had left the
scene in with the naked lady

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:35.950
in the bathtub, the old
lady in the bathtub,

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:38.070
I could have played the
lady in the bathtub.

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:40.340
And he laughed and
he knew I was joking.

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:45.220
And then, on the Stephen
Colbert show, he says she wanted

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:47.280
to play the role of the lady
in the bathtub [laughter].

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.120
Okay, thank you all.

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.710
&gt;&gt; Ruth Tam: It was a joke.

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:57.260
Thank you so much for
being with us, Lois Lowry.

00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:59.830
&gt;&gt; This has been a
presentation of the Library

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:02.970
of Congress, visit us at loc.gov.
