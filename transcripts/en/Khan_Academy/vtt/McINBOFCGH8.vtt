00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.530
In the last video, we
showed that the ratios

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.080
of the sides of a
30-60-90 triangle

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.675
are-- if we assume
the longest side is

00:00:06.675 --> 00:00:08.350
x, if the hypotenuse is x.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.480
Then the shortest side is
x/2 and the side in between,

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.690
the side that's opposite
the 60 degree side,

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:14.890
is square root of 3x/2.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.125
Or another way to think about it
is if the shortest side is 1--

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:21.540
Now I'll do the shortest side,
then the medium size, then

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.390
the longest side.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.500
So if the side opposite
the 30 degree side is 1,

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.400
then the side opposite
the 60 degree side

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.340
is square root of 3 times that.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.110
So it's going to be
square root of 3.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.850
And then the hypotenuse
is going to be twice that.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.480
In the last video,
we started with x

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.460
and we said that the
30 degree side is x/2.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.110
But if the 30 degree
side is 1, then this

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.270
is going to be twice that.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.440
So it's going to be 2.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.120
This right here is the side
opposite the 30 degree side,

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.440
opposite the 60 degree side,
and then the hypotenuse opposite

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.030
the 90 degree side.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.800
And so, in general, if
you see any triangle that

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.570
has those ratios, you say hey,
that's a 30-60-90 triangle.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.075
Or if you see a
triangle that you

00:00:58.075 --> 00:01:02.290
know is a 30-60-90 triangle,
you could say, hey,

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.099
I know how to figure out
one of the sides based

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:06.660
on this ratio right over here.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.930
Just an example, if
you see a triangle that

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.510
looks like this, where the
sides are 2, 2 square root of 3,

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:15.480
and 4.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.790
Once again, the ratio of
2 to 2 square root of 3

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.440
is 1 to square root of 3.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.340
The ratio of 2 to 4 is
the same thing as 1 to 2.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.440
This right here must
be a 30-60-90 triangle.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.380
What I want to introduce
you to in this video

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.570
is another important
type of triangle

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.980
that shows up a lot in geometry
and a lot in trigonometry.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.649
And this is a 45-45-90 triangle.

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.190
Or another way to
think about is if I

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.155
have a right triangle
that is also isosceles.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.140
You obviously can't have a right
triangle that is equilateral,

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.770
because an equilateral triangle
has all of their angles

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.030
have to be 60 degrees.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.870
But you can have
a right angle, you

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.260
can have a right triangle,
that is isosceles.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.790
And isosceles--
let me write this--

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.470
this is a right
isosceles triangle.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.830
And if it's isosceles,
that means two of the sides

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:06.500
are equal.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.851
So these are the two
sides that are equal.

00:02:09.851 --> 00:02:11.350
And then if the two
sides are equal,

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.990
we have proved to ourselves
that the base angles are equal.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.440
And if we called the measure
of these base angles x,

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:25.440
then we know that x plus x plus
90 have to be equal to 180.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.610
Or if we subtract
90 from both sides,

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.060
you get x plus x is equal
to 90 or 2x is equal to 90.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.780
Or if you divide
both sides by 2,

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.750
you get x is equal
to 45 degrees.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.850
So a right isosceles
triangle can also be called--

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.010
and this is the more
typical name for it--

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.140
it can also be called
a 45-45-90 triangle.

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.030
And what I want to do
this video is come up

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.180
with the ratios for the
sides of a 45-45-90 triangle,

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.270
just like we did for
a 30-60-90 triangle.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.180
And this one's actually
more straightforward.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.950
Because in a 45-45-90 triangle,
if we call one of the legs x,

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.819
the other leg is
also going to be x.

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.610
And then we can use
the Pythagorean Theorem

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.770
to figure out the length
of the hypotenuse.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.090
So the length of the
hypotenuse, let's call that c.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.740
So we get x squared
plus x squared.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.429
That's the square of
length of both of the legs.

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:27.970
So when we sum those
up, that's going

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.740
to have to be
equal to c squared.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.310
This is just straight out
of the Pythagorean theorem.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.490
So we get 2x squared
is equal to c squared.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.566
We can take the principal
root of both sides of that.

00:03:41.566 --> 00:03:45.930
I wanted to just
change it to yellow.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.230
Last, take the principal
root of both sides of that.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.420
The left-hand side you
get, principal root of 2

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.860
is just square
root of 2, and then

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.790
the principal root of x
squared is just going to be x.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.290
So you're going to have x
times the square root of 2

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.690
is equal to c.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.790
So if you have a right isosceles
triangle, whatever the two

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.790
legs are, they're going
to have the same length.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.200
That's why it's isosceles.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.980
The hypotenuse is going to be
square root of 2 times that.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.230
So c is equal to x times
the square root of 2.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.130
So for example, if you have a
triangle that looks like this.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.940
Let me draw it a
slightly different way.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.650
It's good to have to orient
ourselves in different ways

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:27.750
every time.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.690
So if we see a triangle
that's 90 degrees,

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.640
45 and 45 like this,
and you really just

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.900
have to know two of
these angles to know

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.510
what the other one
is going to be,

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.790
and if I tell you that
this side right over here

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.909
is 3-- I actually don't
even have to tell you

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:43.450
that this other
side's going to be 3.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.970
This is an isosceles
triangle, so those two legs

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.210
are going to be the same.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.050
And you won't even have to
apply the Pythagorean theorem

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.370
if you know this--
and this is a good one

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.109
to know-- that the hypotenuse
here, the side opposite the 90

00:04:53.109 --> 00:04:55.150
degree side, is just going
to be square root of 2

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.920
times the length of
either of the legs.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.400
So it's going to be 3
times the square root of 2.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.790
So the ratio of the
size of the hypotenuse

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:09.190
in a 45-45-90 triangle or
a right isosceles triangle,

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.342
the ratio of the sides are
one of the legs can be 1.

00:05:12.342 --> 00:05:14.550
Then the other leg is going
to have the same measure,

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.820
the same length, and then
the hypotenuse is going

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.100
to be square root of 2
times either of those.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.690
1 to 1, 2 square root of 2.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:22.690
So this is 45-45-90.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.010
That's the ratios.

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.680
And just as a review,
if you have a 30-60-90,

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.800
the ratios were 1 to
square root of 3 to 2.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.820
And now we'll apply this
in a bunch of problems.
