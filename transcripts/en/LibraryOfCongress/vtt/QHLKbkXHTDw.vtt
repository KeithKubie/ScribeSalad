00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.180
&gt;&gt; Announcer: From the Library
of Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.910
&gt;&gt; Harrison Smith: It is
my great pleasure today

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.130
to introduce Aaron Becker the
writer of a wonderful series

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.520
of wordless picture books that
began in 2013 with "Journey."

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.780
Not only was it the
first book in a series,

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.940
it was also Aaron's first book and
earned a Caldecott honor in 2014.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.510
The New York Times critic
Sarah Harrison Smith --

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.640
the other Harrison Smith -- called
it a masterwork in her review.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.210
Not a bad debut.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.810
The book tells a story of a lonely
girl with a magical red marker.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.130
She draws her way from
a drab sad-looking city

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.060
to a brightly colored world
of castles and warriors

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.530
and a friendly purple bird.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.570
At the flick of her marker, she can
draw a portal, a boat, a balloon,

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.590
a flying carpet, and bring
all these things into life.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.160
The series continued with "Quest,"
which Kirkus Reviews described

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.520 position:56%
as a wordless testament to the power

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.460
of not just imagination
but art itself.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.730
And with "Return," which
came out just last month.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.190
Before working with ink and
watercolor in his journey books,

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.480
Aaron was actually a film designer.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.880
He did backgrounds, buildings,
and other elements for movies,

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.490
including Cars, Monster
House, the Polar Express,

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.810
Beowulf, and A Christmas Carol.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.760
Again, there will be time
for questions after the talk,

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.550
and I should add that anyone who
has a question will be filmed

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.110
for the Library of
Congress's archives.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.040
Aaron's also going to be signing
books today, from 1:30 to 2:30.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.510
Again, please join me in welcoming
Aaron Becker to the stage.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:44.070
[ Applause ]

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.370
&gt;&gt; Aaron Becker: Thank
you, thank you.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.950
How's everybody doing this morning?

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.580
All right.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.040
Well, we're going to be
telling some stories today,

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.060
but also have a chance to kind
of look underneath the cover

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.820
to see how I make these books
and what they're all about.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.880
How many of you by show of hands
have ever read "Journey" before?

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.740
Okay, so we've got
some fans here today.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.260
That's fantastic.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.690
We're going to run through
"Journey" kind of quickly.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.990
We're going to do the Reader's
Digest version of the book,

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.220
because I really want to have
some time today to talk more

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.030 position:56%
about what goes behind the making of
these books as well as get a chance

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.570
to share with you "Return," which
has just come out last month.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.800
This series of books is something I
started when my daughter was born,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.910
about 6 1/2 years ago now.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.810 position:56%
So this is been my life for the last
six years, and to wait this long

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.270
to finally share this final
chapter with everybody,

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.740
it's been a lesson
in patience for sure.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.390
But it's been worth the wait.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.050
I'm really excited about
how this story has ended

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.870
and the reception it's gotten.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.630
I've been out touring
the country this week.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.990
I was in Texas earlier this
week, and Georgia before that.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.230
I'll be heading to
Minneapolis and Chicago.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.800
And everywhere I go, I talk to
librarians, teachers, and schools

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.080
and students, of course,
about these books.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.690
And it amazes me wherever I
go, the children just get it.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.490
They understand what
to do with these books.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.010
It's we adults who've crossed
over that bridge to the other side

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.380
of grown-up-dom that have
forgotten how to just be open

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.060
to telling stories
with our imagination.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.200
The children really know how to do
it, and they pick out things inside

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.660
of these books that I haven't
even noticed yet after living

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.360
with these books for six years.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.480
I'll give you an example.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.960
When I was in Georgia, there was
a girl who was four years old,

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:58.430
and she asked, "Why does the
emperor, -- there's an emperor,

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.340
a bad emperor on this ship --

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.420
"Why does the emperor want to
cage this beautiful purple bird?"

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.780
And what I do when I
tell stories to a group

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.090
of children is I don't
tell them answers.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.910
I just ask them questions,
which is really the key

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.930 position:56%
to a wordless picture book if you're
reading to a child as a grown-up,

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.650
or even if you're a kid and
you're reading that for yourself.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:23.950
Ask questions.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.610
So what I did is I asked her,
"Well, what do you think?"

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.800
And you know what she said?

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.760 position:56%
She said, "Well, I think that the
Emperor is capturing the purple bird

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.570
because he must be afraid of it.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.800
He must be afraid of
this purple bird.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.400
And I thought that is amazing.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.990
That never occurred to me what
a great idea, that of course,

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.200
of course, we want to put in a cage
the things we don't understand.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:58.010
And books are a great way to help
us become exposed to the things

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.230
around us that maybe
we've never seen before.

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.670
I think that's why this
particular story might be

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.280
so powerful, is that
it is a journey.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.110 position:56%
It's a journey into the realm of our
imagination, to explore the limits

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.100
of what might be possible.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.080
So let's start with "Journey."

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.010
Right away on the cover,
we see a girl.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.630
She's going towards a castle.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.660
She's in a red boat.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.050
We're not sure what's happening.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.870
So you ask a question
-- "Who is she?

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.730
Why is she there?

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.140
What's she going to do?

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:39.050
Well, we start off back home,
and there she is on her scooter.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:45.160
She's back home, a little sad now.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.080
And right away, without words,
we know how she's feeling.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.390
We know how she's feeling
because we're human beings,

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:55.950
and we have a language
that's universal.

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.250
It's called body language.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.480
And when you see someone, you
know how they're feeling just

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.040
by the way they're
holding their bodies.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:10.660 position:56%
So she must be feeling sad,
lonely, bored, any number of things.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.650
I'll even ask a child, "How
do you know she's feeling sad,

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:15.950
lonely, and bored?"

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.300
Well, they'll explain
about how she's sitting.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.520
And then I'll say, "Well,
why do you think she's sad?"

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.550
Again, with no words, they know.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.770
Well, because the other kids won't
play with her, or she's lonely.

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.360
She doesn't have any friends.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:38.920
I haven't told anyone that, but
the child will figure it out.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.200
She goes into her house.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.390
Her mom and dad are
too busy to play.

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:47.470
So she finds this red
marker on her floor.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.090
Again, the red marker, is
it a marker, is it chalk,

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:54.570
is it an oil pastel,
a piece of crayon?

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:57.100
Maybe a colored pencil?

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.990
This is also what I do, is
I ask a group of children --

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:06.420
I tell them, "I know the right
answer, and I will tell you."

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.040 position:56%
Well, every child wants to be right.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.860
"Oh, I know, it's a
crayon it's a crayon.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.140
I know he's going to say crayon."

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.440
I say, "Look inside your head.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:18.250
Close your eyes, and I want
you to imagine what it is

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.780
that she's drawing with."

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.780
And then I say, "Whatever
is inside your head,

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.750
that is the right answer."

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:32.940
She draws her door, and through the
door she goes to a magical realm.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.550
This is the beginning of the story.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:40.270
This is the very beginning.

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.430 position:56%
She's in this magical fantasy realm,

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:47.710
this castle with waterways
instead of roads.

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:49.810
There's even a story
about this castle.

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:55.130
You see, a long time ago this
castle was inherited by a king,

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.590
a young king, and this king wanted
to do a very good job being a king.

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:05.190 position:56%
It was very important to him that he
do a better job than his own father.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:06.550 position:56%
He wanted to make sure that everyone

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:08.900
in his kingdom understood
the importance

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.470
of kindness, but he wasn't sure.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:13.430
"As a king, how do I teach this?"

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:15.260
So he would go down to
the water every day.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.570
You see, his castle was
located right by the ocean.

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:22.710 position:56%
And he would look out over the water
and watch the sunrise every morning.

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:24.010
It was a time for him to think.

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:26.510
It was a time for him to think,

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:29.680
because all day he was
very busy in meetings.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.980
He looked out over the water.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:35.610
And one day as the sun was
rising, he saw something.

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:39.670
He saw something, something in
the water, something splash.

00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:43.310
And it came closer and closer.

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:47.350
It disappeared.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:49.530
So the next day, he went
back down to the water again

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:50.830
and he watched the sunrise.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:52.980
And he was looking this
time, not for the sun,

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.280
but for something in the water.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:59.130
And soon enough, it emerged again
and it swam closer and closer,

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:02.660
until finally out from the
water popped a mermaid.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.950
And it was no ordinary mermaid.

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:08.240
You see, this mermaid
was also a young queen.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.860
She had just inherited
the kingdom under the sea.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.020
And she too wanted to do
a good job as a queen.

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.080
So they talked for a
while, and they realized,

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.950
"Perhaps we can join our
kingdoms together and work

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:21.640
to make this world a better place."

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.260
But there was a problem.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.430
You see, the king, while
he was a good swimmer,

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:29.540
could not hold his breath
and live under the ocean.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:34.970
And the mermaid, well,
she didn't have feet.

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:36.270
She couldn't walk on land.

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:37.650
She couldn't go to the castle.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.620
So the king brought his
people down the next day.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:40.920
He had an idea.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.900
He said, "Bring your shovels
down to the water's edge,

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.330
and I want you to start
digging a hole.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.100
Dig a hole from here to there.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.810 position:56%
And they dug, and they dug, and
they dug, and they dug all day long,

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:51.110
until they reach the castle.

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:53.060
And when they reached the
castle wall -- thump --

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:54.900
they hit the castle wall.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.420
They looked at the
king for instructions.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.070
He said, "Okay, take
down the castle wall."

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:59.370
They said, "What?

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:00.670
We can't take down the castle wall.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:03.960
If we take down the castle
wall, then we won't be safe.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.260
We need that wall."

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:06.560
He said, "No, no, no.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.860
For now, don't worry about it.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.160
Just take it down."

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.590
They took down the castle wall
then they hit Main Street.

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:11.970
And they looked for
him for guidance.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:13.940
He said, "Now, what I want
you to do is keep digging.

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:17.010
Dig up all of Main Street."

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:21.990 position:56%
They thought their king had lost his
mind, but they trusted him for now.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:23.430
And they dug and they
dug and they dug

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:25.770
until they hit the other
end of the castle wall.

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:28.820
And they looked the
king for instructions.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:31.260
He said, "Now I want you to
dig up all the alleyways,

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.680 position:56%
and when you reach the end of the
alleyways, dig up all the staircases

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.110
that lead up to the upper levels
of this castle and kingdom.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:40.930
Until we are done, I want
every single bit of road

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:43.750
in this castle dug up,
even the sidewalks."

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:46.490
And that's what they did.

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:51.180 position:56%
The final day, they came down to
the water's edge with their shovels.

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:53.590
And I don't know if you've
ever been to the beach before,

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:57.230
but when you're playing in the
ocean and you've dug your tunnels,

00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:01.110
what happens when you finally
connect it to the waves?

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:03.940
Well, of course, the water rushes
in, and that's just what happened.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:05.240
The water rushes in.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.540
It hit the castle wall.

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.110
It kept going down Main
Street, filled the alleyways,

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:12.990
filled the staircases, until
the entire castle was filled

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:16.120
with water with a canal system.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:23.990
Now, the mermaid could come
and join him at the castle.

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:27.690
And that is why this castle
has waterways instead of roads.

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:31.880
This one little story,
well, it's in my mind.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:35.080
But a child can look at this book
in a wordless picture book and make

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.610
up all sorts of stories like this.

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:41.770
It's up to you to decide what's
happening behind the scenes.

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:45.500
The girl goes to the castle.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.290
She draws her way through.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:51.960
She eventually finds herself in
the sky in a red hot air balloon,

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:58.610
and that's where she discovers the
caged purple bird who she rescues.

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:03.440
Flies back home through a
purple door at the bottom

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:10.210
of a palm tree, where a boy awaits.

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:13.910
Now, at the very beginning of
the story when she was lonely

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:17.190 position:56%
and we saw the other children
playing right there on the street --

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:20.590 position:56%
Well, the boy, actually was standing
there if you look in the book.

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:22.870
And up in the sky, the
purple bird was flying away.

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:26.690
Sometimes the things we're looking
for are right in front of us.

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:28.030
They draw two circles.

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:31.510
He happens to have his own
purple magic drawing implement.

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:34.240
And they draw a bike.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.680
So that was the end of "Journey."

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.660
That was the first book.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:41.850
But by the time "Journey"
was even published,

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:45.160
I had finished the drawings
for "Quest," and it picks

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.730
up right where we leave off.

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:49.710
This time, they go on a
much bigger adventure.

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:51.680
You see, in "Journey"
it was sort of the realm

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.240 position:56%
of a young child in the imagination.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.080
Everything was happening, but
yet there was no real danger.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.380
She was always going to be okay.

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:04.570 position:56%
In "Quest," things get pushed up
just a notch to the realm of getting

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:08.110
to be an older kid, where suddenly
you might have some responsibility

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:09.410
in this world.

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:14.910
You see, now the castle is on fire,
and the king has given them a map.

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:20.230
This map holds clues to
their adventure ahead.

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:23.730 position:56%
They realize there's more than just
a red and a purple drawing implement

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:25.030
in this realm with magic.

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:26.480
There are other colors as well.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.780
They go on a quest to
find them under the ocean.

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:32.260
Why, this might be the
mermaid's underwater kingdom.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.350
Who knows?

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:38.970
Into the jungle to a mountain.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.490
Just as they're about
to be caught --

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:46.150
They've collected all the markers.

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:47.760
The purple bird flies away.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.450
It paints a rainbow across
the sky, saves the kingdom

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:53.590
and the king, who's been captured.

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:54.900
And they come back home

00:13:54.900 --> 00:14:00.210
after a great celebration,
which ends "Quest."

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:02.720
I also tell children here --

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:06.010
The imagination, it may not
seem like it's a real thing.

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:08.520
It might seem like it's
something we just do for play.

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.870
But actually, the imagination
is real, because when we go out

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:14.910
and we pretend that
we're a fast runner,

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:17.510
or we pretend that
we can be an artist,

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:20.920
or we pretend that we can glide
across the sky on the back

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:27.370 position:56%
of a Pegasus, a small little part of
that play, it ends up inside of us.

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:30.540
It does, it really does.

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:34.930
It ends up inside of us, and
one day it can become real.

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:36.710
That's how we use our imagination

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:40.160
to manifest what we might
want to become one day.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.150
And just as his children might
have painted a rainbow in a land

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:45.700
of make-believe, by the
time they came home,

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:49.260
that rainbow had followed them.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.090
It was no longer raining.

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:56.580
And this leaves us off, right in
time, for the final chapter in the

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:59.510
"Journey" trilogy, "Return."

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:56.040
[ Music ]

00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:01.970 position:56%
All righty, so here we are, back
into the magical world of "Journey."

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:03.990
Now, we see the girl
running through the door.

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:06.530
This time she's just
not walking through

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:08.620
and looking at it with amazement.

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:10.260
She knows where she's
going this time.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.070
She has a purpose.

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:13.930
She's ready for adventure.

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:18.300
The king drew her and the boy an
orange crown at the end of "Quest"

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.900
to welcome them into this land.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:23.550
So she's wearing it on her head.

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.630
But let's take a step back.

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:29.950
The story begins right
where "Journey" did.

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:34.170
She's still hoping that
dad will play with her.

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:35.470
He's busy.

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:37.930
He's an architect drawing
at his table.

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:46.370
She draws another red door.

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:48.700
She's given up.

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:52.810
But dad notices this time.

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:55.130
He sees her kite.

00:16:55.130 --> 00:17:02.790
He follows her down to her bedroom,
looks through her magic door,

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:06.730
and follows her into
the magical realm.

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:11.810
In "Journey," the girl draws
a red boat by this dock.

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:14.650
Now, she's left a ball there
for the father to find,

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:17.040
or maybe she just left
it there by accident.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.650
Who knows?

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:19.970
He sees it.

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:23.400
And as he gets onto the dock, a
dragon boat appears around the bend

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:27.920
in the river, a glowing,
green-eyed dragon boat.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.480
Perhaps it's evil.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.770
But the father has no choice.

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:33.700
He has to find his daughter.

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:37.210
He jumps aboard and makes
his way to the castle.

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:41.870 position:56%
He sees her off in the distance
crossing the bridge on her red boat.

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:45.590
By the time he catches up to her,
well, she doesn't want to see him.

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:48.370
Number one, he wouldn't
play with her.

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:50.440
Number two, "This is my turf.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.740
This is my imagination.

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:53.470
You don't belong here, dad."

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:56.770
There's no time to argue.

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:59.110
For those familiar
with ancient history,

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:02.820
you might know something
about a Trojan horse.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:07.030
Well, this dragon boat is
no ordinary dragon boat.

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:09.450
It is a Trojan dragon boat.

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:14.630
And inside of its hull was hiding
the emperor and his henchmen.

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.520
They run towards our heroes.

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:21.210
The king grabs his orange
marker and draws a sword.

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:22.810
But the emperor is smart.

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:26.790
You see, he's been duped by
these kids too many times.

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:30.140
He's been tricked by them with
their magic drawing implements.

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:32.110
So he's come with a plan.

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:34.730
He's created something
out of technology,

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:38.190
something like a magic eraser.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:42.080
He cranks the box.

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.790
It sucks up all the colored
objects, the sword, the crayons.

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:50.650
The boy and the girl
still have theirs.

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:53.000
The boy, who's always
drawing animals --

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.270
purple ones, for that matter --
he draws a beast that is half lion

00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:00.130
and half eagle, a griffin.

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:04.810
Well, the emperor was
thinking ahead.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:06.300
He wasn't going to
be fooled this time.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:10.950
When he built his dragon boat,
he made sure that it had wings.

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:14.420
And he follows them and he
starts to crank his machine --

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:19.860
sucking up the purple
marker, the griffin,

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:23.740 position:56%
and our heroes fall through the sky.

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:25.870
The boy manages to catch
a hold of the king's hand.

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:32.240
But the girl and her father
fall, fall, fall into the ocean.

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:38.070
The girl has her magic drawing
implement, and she starts

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:42.450
to draw a giant shampoo bottle.

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:46.180
No -- If you remember from
the trailer, the animation,

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:49.170
you'll remember it's a submarine.

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:51.660
And when you get a chance to look
at the book, you look closely,

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:55.450
you'll see the purple bird even
has her own little earphones on,

00:19:55.450 --> 00:20:00.590
and she's listening to the
sonar -- boop, boop, boop --

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:03.410
until they find a sea cave.

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:10.410
On the walls of the sea cave are
drawings, petroglyphs in fact,

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:16.600
that tell an ancient story, a myth
about a land with the red balloon

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:21.550
and a purple rhinoceros
and a rainbow

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:24.570
and a dragon boat and
a red submarine.

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:27.700
Why in fact, this story on
the walls tells the past,

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:30.940
it tells the present, but
it also tells a prophecy

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:33.520
of what's yet to come.

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.230
And the girl looks up and she
sees a character painted much

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:38.080
like her father with a pocket.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.340
The dad always has a
pocket in his shirts

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.980
in which he's always
putting his work markers in.

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:47.210
And the dad's, like, "Me?"

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:51.220
Now, as the shadow of the dragon
boat approaches, the dad thinks,

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:55.190
"Perhaps I can learn
something from my daughter."

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:59.050
Perhaps the word "return" isn't
the return of the girl to her land,

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:03.430
but the return of the father
to his own imagination.

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:06.070
The girl can't believe her eyes.

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:07.370
"What is happening?

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:09.600
Dad has an imagination?"

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.940 position:56%
He's drawing something for the bird.

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:14.430
She's not sure what.

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:18.300
Well, it turns out dad's
pretty clever after all.

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:25.400
As the emperor runs up, he
sucks up the purple bird.

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.870
But just as he steps onto the
platform, the doors close.

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:29.170
It's a trap.

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:30.470
He's in a cage.

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:32.630
He drops his box.

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:36.270 position:56%
But dad picks it up, lifts it up
over his head, and when he throws it

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:40.460
onto the ground, all of
the colors are released.

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:41.760
The animals are free.

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.060
The purple bird is free.

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.860
Even the griffin is free.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:50.340
It picks up the caged
emperor, flies away.

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:55.540
Now, all along in this cave, for
those of us who are very observant,

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:58.990 position:56%
perhaps you've noticed a small door.

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:02.430
Perhaps you've noticed even
on the first page of the book,

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:06.430
a small door somewhere
else in the story.

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:12.120
And out from this small
door is peaking a red kite.

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:18.200
And that is the end of the trilogy.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.510
Thank you guys very much.

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:24.120
[ Applause ]

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.880
We have five minutes left.

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.990
I know it's not a lot of time.

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:30.820
I have a few slides in
another presentation

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:33.560
that I can show you just
while I'm talking about some

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:36.600 position:56%
of the things I do to make the book.

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:40.780
But are there any immediate
questions out there?

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:42.190
Yes, ma'am?

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:43.490
&gt;&gt; Question from audience:
Are there any plans

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:46.440
to make animated films
from these books?

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.740 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Aaron Becker: Are there any plans

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.070
to make animated films
from this book?

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:53.410
So the trailers that you see
are things that I did myself.

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:57.230
Because I worked in animation,
I know a few things about how

00:22:57.230 --> 00:23:02.680 position:56%
to build things in 3-D and make
camera moves and create some motion.

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:05.490
But I would like to see
"Journey" on a big screen.

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:09.300 position:56%
I do have a background in cinema,
and I think that would be fantastic.

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:12.800
I can't say anything about it
at this time, but let's just say

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:15.730
that wheels are turning
on the West Coast.

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:17.880
So we'll have to wait.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.180
Yes?

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:29.970
&gt;&gt; Question from audience: For
your third book, did you write it

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:34.870
about a girl bonding with
her dad because you wanted

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:36.510
to bond with your daughter?

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:37.870
&gt;&gt; Aaron Becker: Oh, my goodness.

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:40.180
You're killing me.

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:44.740
Did you just draw a dagger with
your magic drawing implement?

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:48.280
I think so, for sure.

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:50.070
It made a big difference
for writing this story.

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:52.920
Although I had planned out the
entire story when I started

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:56.290
"Journey," and I always her
to be met by her family.

00:23:56.290 --> 00:24:00.630
Originally, the mom and the dad
and her sister were going to come

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:02.530
and follow her into the realm.

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:04.570
But wordless picture books,
you have to be very careful,

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:06.280
and only tell a few
things at a time.

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:09.160
So I picked one of them,
and I did pick the dad,

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.160
and I think maybe you're right.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:17.250
While I was working on "Return,"
I lived in Spain with my family.

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:21.760 position:56%
In a couple weeks, if you go onto my
website, we're going to have a video

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.820
up there about my experiences
in Spain.

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:27.720
If you go to storybreathing.com,
it will be posted there.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:31.160 position:56%
And it tells a little bit more about
my experiences with my daughter,

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:35.490
working on this book in a
foreign land where I was trying

00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:42.030 position:56%
to learn Spanish and also trying to
paint at the same time and be a dad.

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:43.590
Yes, sir?

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:46.590
&gt;&gt; Question from audience: Why
don't you put words in your books?

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:47.890 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Aaron Becker: So what happened --

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:50.270
Some of these slides that you've
seen actually maybe I can even

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:51.570
go backwards.

00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:54.190
These were the first
drawings that I did.

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:55.490
There about this big.

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:58.320
They're just two-inch little
pencil sketches on paper.

00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:59.980
I'm sure you have pencil and paper.

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:01.590
You can do the same thing.

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:05.030
And I had sketched out the whole
story, and by the time I came

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:07.610
to the end of the story,
well, I went back to put words

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:10.490
because books have
words in them, right?

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:13.850
And I realized, "Wait a
minute, the story's been told.

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:16.700
The only thing I can do is
repeat myself at this point."

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:19.870
And that is actually how "Journey"
became a wordless picture book.

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:23.060
It was not an intentional
plan on my part.

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:29.630
It just happened that way
organically, or maybe be magically.

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:32.040
Yes, miss?

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:36.750
&gt;&gt; Question from audience:
How did you make

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:41.490
up the idea to write the story?

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:43.400
&gt;&gt; Aaron Becker: The idea
came from a drawing that I did

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.010
that you've seen up
here just a second ago.

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:46.630
I'll go back to it.

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:50.920
From this castle -- I
drew this castle one day,

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:55.930
and it had a little boat in it
with a kid going up to the castle.

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:57.950
And I didn't have a story.

00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:03.320
We're going to have to wrap up now,
but just one last thought here.

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.070
This is the close-up
of that drawing.

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:08.270
And children at home, if you're
feeling like you're a little scared

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:10.730
of drawing, maybe you don't
feel like you can draw as well

00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:14.140
as you can, just remember every
drawing begins with one line.

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:18.010 position:56%
And if you look very closely at my
drawings, you'll see they're nothing

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:21.680
but one line added to one
line added to one line.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.610
And I'm going to scoot ahead and
just show the young children here

00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:34.170
that long ago when I was a
child, I made my own books.

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:36.710
Almost there -- Oh, maybe not.

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:40.920
Come on. Wow, I'm show you
lots of fun stuff here.

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.850
Oh, there she is.

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:45.150
There she is.

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:46.450
There we are in Spain.

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:52.080
I learned to draw from this
gentleman, Ed Emberley.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.480
In this was me.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.000
So remember, you can do it too.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.300
Make your own books.

00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:58.600
Thank you guys, so much.

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.400
I had a great time.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:03.040
[ Applause ]

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.690
&gt;&gt; Announcer: We have
one comment, please.

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:05.990
&gt;&gt; Question from audience: Say,

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:09.290
"We would like to invite
you to come to our school."

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:10.740
&gt;&gt; Question from audience:
We would like to invite you

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:14.060
to come to our Potomac School.

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:15.360
&gt;&gt; Aaron Becker: Oh, you know what?

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:19.340
I was at the Potomac
School, but I didn't get

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:21.300
to -- Are you in kindergarten?

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:25.060
I only got to meet the second and
the third and the fourth graders.

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:28.910
But they have copies of
my book in the library.

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:32.630
You're really a lucky kid because
you have an amazing school,

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:35.350
and you have quite a
journey ahead of you there.

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:36.650

Were you there recently?

00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:37.950

was there yesterday.
