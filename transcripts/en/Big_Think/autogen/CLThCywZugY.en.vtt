00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.809
Well, I am one of the directors of science
[at NASA], and my specialty is communications.

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:16.950
There's the idea that a mission ends when
you return the data, when you make the discoveries,

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.010
when the scientists publish their papers.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.080
To me, the mission doesn’t end until you
have some sort of public involvement, until

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.820
you have some sort of public buy-in.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.620
I think that’s as important as any other
part of the mission.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.750
I’ve been trying to tell people for years
that a communications team on a mission is

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.320
just like having your crack team of electrical
engineers or your best computer programmers.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.710
You need to have people that really understand
communications well.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.859
And it helps—I mean, in my case I started
out as a research astrophysicist and so I

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:44.170
understand a lot of the topics as well.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.940
But I do communications now at NASA.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.269
And as far as why NASA is important, I think
this is one of these things that people have

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:57.090
no idea: We run, at the moment, 108 science
missions.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.460
Those are mostly spacecraft.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.319
Some of them are on balloons or sounding rockets
or on the space station.

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:03.320
Some of them are on the earth.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.159
We have people embedded with the Sami reindeer
herders trying to understand how climate change

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.200
is changing the migration of reindeer herds.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.909
I mean it’s amazing that NASA is all over.

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.670
Everything from the disaster mitigation from
all of those hurricanes—we actually sent

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:26.119
staff to Puerto Rico when FEMA was overwhelmed,
they had been setting up communication centers.

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.479
I mean everything from determining what set
off the Big Bang to where those wildfires

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.180
are going to be spreading to in southern California.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.969
We have 108 missions and I’ve never seen
any organization operate more efficiently.

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:42.149
I’ve never worked with more brilliant people.

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.369
I think people often don't understand what
the real value is as far as blue sky research,

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:47.369
you know.

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.840
People talk about spinoffs and people joke
about things like Velcro and Tang.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.219
I mean those are jokes, but the more intelligent
people might notice things like microprocessors

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.219
started at NASA.

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:58.520
Cell phones.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.319
The reason you have computers, the reason
the United States was poised to lead the computer

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:04.920
revolution was because of the Apollo program.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.289
But all those kind of fall flat, to tell you
the truth.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.100
I think that people don’t understand.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.780
It was a NASA satellite doing research just
out of curiosity to see what gases were in

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.780
the atmosphere that discovered that the ozone
hole was being depleted in the 1980s.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.230
And the NASA scientists with a number of university
scientists went running to the U.N. and said,

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.700
“If we don’t do something, we are literally
going to destroy the planet.”

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.200
And they actually got the Montreal Protocol
signed.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.590
They actually made treaties.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.180
They banned these chemicals that were depleting
our ozone layer.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.590
And we’ve since done atmospheric models
that show that we would have actually destroyed

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.630
the ozone layer, had we done nothing, by the
year 2060, which, if not in my lifetime, is

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.350
probably in our children’s lifetime.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.150
And basically, that would have destroyed agriculture.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.590
Crops would have failed all over the world.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.450
You couldn’t have livestock outside.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.120
People couldn’t have lived outside.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.230
We very nearly destroyed civilization, and
your grandchildren would have lived through

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.280
that.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.600
And so when people talk about what’s the
best NASA spinoff, you know, what's the worth

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.200
of blue sky research where you don’t understand
where it’s going to lead?

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.629
The best spinoff I know of is grandchildren.
