00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.620
Hello everyone, it's monthly mailbag time
again and today we dive into the world

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.500
of chemistry to look at some really
interesting elements in compounds

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.860
One of my colleagues at one point when we were
trying to convince the people in Sudbury

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.650
that this was a benign safe experiment
that went to the City Council and drank

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.180
a glass of heavy water to show that it's
non radioactive and perfectly safe of

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.330
course he as he was drinking it he
poured a little bit of whiskey in and

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.510
said nothing improves the taste of heavy
water like a little bit of teachers but

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.130
that's that possum per day was surprised
by the story of someone having drunk a

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.040
whole glass of heavy water yes is it
dangerous as well as expensive now heavy

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.510
water sounds scary but it's actually not
that dangerous hydrogen is the simplest

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.020
atom in the universe it's just a proton
with one electron orbiting in it but

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.590
sometimes a neutron gets squeezed in
there making a heavy version of hydrogen

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.610
called deuterium about one in every six
thousand hydrogen atoms in the world is

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.510
deuterium and it forms quite naturally
in very rare cases though another

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.079
neutron can wedge its way in there to
make tritium that's very unstable and so

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.100
that second Neutron will pop out again
that means tritium is radioactive you

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.820
can make molecules like water with these
special forms of hydrogen and since the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.729
deuterium is heavier than normal
hydrogen we call the water made with

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.030
deuterium heavy water
here's the thing though the mass of a

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.570
water molecule is dominated by the
oxygen even if you double the weight of

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.130
the both of the hydrogen using deuterium
the overall mass will only be about 11%

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.509
higher so most of its properties are
pretty similar but biological systems

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.170
are very sensitive to even tiny
differences so in large doses heavy

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.430
water can destruct enzymes and stop cell
division most guidelines say you need to

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.790
replace about half of the water in your
body with heavy water to feel any

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.570
negative effects so one glass won't hurt
all gone freezes at about minus 190

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.950
degrees centigrade and boils about minus
under 97 or something like that so it

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.020
has a very narrow liquid phase so within
three degrees ago to being a solid to

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.780
being a gas weld your William at welding
wouldn't be possible with it are gone

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.049
but what other uses does it have argon
is a extremely inert be fairly common

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.069
see fairly cheap and easy to produce
Indy a terrible heat conductor these

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.080
characteristics make it perfect for a
number

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.520
different applications its use loads and
industrial processes to make sure oxygen

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.610
or other gases can't get close to the
important reactions this is what makes

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.380
it so good for welding it also has some
unexpected applications for example in

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.680
fire extinguishers for server rooms and
in other places with delicate equipment

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.870
it's much harder to freeze argon than it
is to pre co2 so it's great if you don't

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.460
want dry ice building up on wires it's
also used as a preservative most often

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.220
this is for food or for wine but it's
also used to preserve important

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.220
documents like the American Declaration
of Independence that you see magenta

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.580
absolutely beautiful and that's why you
don't see magenta in the spectrum you

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.550
don't see magenta in the rain book
because it doesn't have a wavelength and

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.050
to finish things off a bird question
checky asked if magenta is not a

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.650
wavelength of light does that mean that
flamingos have red and blue pigment in

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.250
their feathers so first off flamingos
are born grey and they actually turn

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.280
pink over time because of the way they
break down the proteins in their diet

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.690
the third they eat mostly shrimp and
algae contain lots of carotenoids fat

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.530
soluble orange and red pigments but the
carotenoids are locked up with other

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.430
molecules that make them reflect blue or
gray hence why is shrimp analogy don't

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.420
look bright pink when they're alive the
birds digestive system then strips the

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.870
carotenoids and deposits them without
their original molecular casings in the

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.830
feathers resulting in that bright pink
coloration you're familiar with you can

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.250
simulate the effective of flamingos
digestive system with heat just put the

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.280
lobster some shrimp in a pot and they'll
turn bright red when you cook them

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.980
that's all for me today keep those
questions coming and I'll see you next

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.310
time

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.760
