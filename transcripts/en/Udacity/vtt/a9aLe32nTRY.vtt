We know that we're going to write a loop that searches for long words. And we

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.513
know that it should stop if you find one. Or if you run out of words. If I just

00:00:09.513 --> 00:00:12.994
worry about running out of words at first, I might write my loop as while

00:00:12.994 --> 00:00:18.407
in.hasNext. Keep looking. But now, there is an other condition that I have to

00:00:18.407 --> 00:00:23.301
meet as well. I have to not have already found the word. So, i want to keep

00:00:23.301 --> 00:00:28.260
looping as long as there's an other word and the wrong word is not found. Now

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.774
inside the loop, we need to actually get the next word. And then, if this word

00:00:32.774 --> 00:00:36.312
we just got is long, then we want to save the word for later, and also make

00:00:36.312 --> 00:00:41.872
sure to mark that we've found it, so that we can exit the loop. So far, I

00:00:41.872 --> 00:00:44.816
haven't created a variable for saving this, but if I scroll down a little bit,

00:00:44.816 --> 00:00:48.927
I can see that I want to print out long word. So, let's make a variable called

00:00:48.927 --> 00:00:52.773
long word. Now, in my if statement, I'll update long word and set found to

00:00:52.773 --> 00:00:57.228
true. Let's try. It says that the first long word in Alice In Wonderland is

00:00:57.228 --> 00:01:01.041
ADVENTURES. That sounds appropriate and I'd say that's an important word to

00:01:01.041 --> 00:01:02.559
Alice In Wonderland.
