ELIZABETH CHOE: OK.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.150
So this is the day
one confessional.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.380
Lecture ended a
couple hours ago.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.940
Just been trying
to do the homework

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.600
assignments along
with the students.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.420
Holy cow.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.740
It is really
exhausting to teach.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.720
And three hours goes
by way faster when

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.190
you're talking than it does
when you are listening.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.326
I

00:00:29.326 --> 00:00:31.650
I think overall, it
could have definitely

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.460
been a lot more
catastrophic than it was,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.310
so that's always good.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.720
I think the hardest thing
was just getting people

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.350
to be engaged in discussion.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.710
It was just so quiet.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.540
Overall, it was just hard to
get them engaged in discussion.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.130
Jamie was awesome,
but it's funny

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.260
because she's taught
middle school,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.100
so she clearly has a very
good handle on facilitating

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.090
these kind of things.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.930
Once she got people
to talk, some

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.430
of the stuff that
they were saying

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.505
was great-- the
conversations that they

00:01:05.505 --> 00:01:08.310
were having about their
experiences with online video.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.110
I'm really glad that she
prodded them a little bit more,

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.080
whereas I just wanted to give
up after no one said anything.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.020
Yeah, the time goes
by really fast.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.470
I was definitely
pressed for time,

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.820
which shouldn't have
surprised me but still did.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.600
And just making sure to leave
breathing room for students.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.700
I mean, I did try to
pace out the video stuff

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.595
so that they'd have sort of a
breather from hearing someone

00:01:32.595 --> 00:01:34.660
just talk to them
for three hours.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.850
But I do feel like it was just
a super dense lecture today.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.700
I think passing it off with
Chris at the end helped a lot,

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.120
but I would have liked
to have more time

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.100
to just have students get
up and use the cameras

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.970
and maybe work on the
STEM videos during class.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.795
I know a teacher who teaches
high school sociology,

00:01:55.795 --> 00:01:59.140
and his philosophy is
just stay one day ahead

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.440
on this syllabus from the class.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.910
And I've been
feeling a little bit

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.170
like that in terms
of the materials,

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.740
but maybe it's just the
adrenaline from day one.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.390
But I do feel like it was OK.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.030
A little nervous for tomorrow
with all the sixth graders.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.250
A lot nervous about tomorrow.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.045
But I've already met the
kids and they're good kids.

00:02:19.045 --> 00:02:23.430
It's just a matter
of trying to balance

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.560
everything I need to do for
work aside from lecturing.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.970
Now I get it.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.940
Now I get why
professors don't always

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.855
want to prioritize lecturing.

00:02:34.855 --> 00:02:36.230
It's not that they
don't want to.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.396
It's that there just aren't
enough hours in the day.

00:02:38.396 --> 00:02:41.150
I'm going to sleep
like a rock tonight.
