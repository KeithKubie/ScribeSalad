00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:01.570
You think sloths are cute?

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:05.190
Just wait til you see what they looked like
5 million years ago!

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.670
Not gonna lie - it's kinda terrifying.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:17.130
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and believe
it or not, the cute furry little sloths you

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.130
see today are NOT the ones that existed millions
of years ago.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.330
Back then, they were enormous creatures that
walked on hind legs, and were nowhere near

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.009
as cute as their modern descendents.

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.029
Sloths actually belong to the same family
of creatures as armadillos and anteaters,

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.160
and they're all part of the superorder Xenarthra,
which originated in South America almost 60

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.519
million years ago.

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:42.840
Obviously, sloths today look nothing like
armadillos or anteaters - but back then, they

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.649
all shared common features.

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:48.969
They had some of the lowest metabolisms of
any mammals, and all of them had extra joints

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.390
in their lower spine to aids in digging, which
is primarily how anteaters and armadillos

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.390
find food.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.769
Eventually, when North and South America fused
together around 3 million years ago, many

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.829
of the ground sloths that were once exclusive
to South America, migrated upwards - populating

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.060
the entire Western Hemisphere, where they
continued to thrive for millions of years.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.930
Now if you're wondering how an extremely slow
tree-dwelling animal managed to survive an

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.270
era that killed off creatures way bigger and
stronger than them, it's because sloths back

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.150
then were nothing like the sloths we know
today.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.390
They all lived on the ground, and some even
evolved into aquatic mammals.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.430
The Megatherium, for example, which populated
South America around 500,000 years ago - was

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.110
a gigantic creature the size of an elephant.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.970
It weighed several tons and lived a full and
active life on the ground, roaming alongside

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.360
giant armadillos the size of rhinos.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.770
Eventually, Megatheriums evolved into what
we now know as the three-toed sloth.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.060
But two-toed sloths evolved from a different
genus called Megalonyx, which consisted of

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.870
a slightly smaller - but still enormous - species
of ground-dwelling sloths.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.780
Two-toed and three-toed sloths are actually
a great example of convergent evolution.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.060
Both species likely shared a common ancestor
around 35-40 million years ago, after which

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.630
point they evolved separately, developing
many of the same characteristics.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.750
They became smaller, and their size, along
with their strong arms and hooked claws, is

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.670
likely what turned them into tree-dwelling
creatures.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.120
Although no one knows exactly WHEN that happened,
because there are no existing fossil records

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.280
of sloths that lived in trees.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.450
So how did they evolve to hang upside-down?

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.560
Well, it probably has to do with their low
metabolism.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.560
Running along the top of a tree branch requires
balance, and thus energy.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.250
So by hanging underneath a branch - which
is easy for a creature with the arm strength

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.760
of sloth - it allows them to conserve energy.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.892
It also looks really cute - which is perhaps
the most important thing of all.

00:02:43.892 --> 00:02:47.850
What about y'all, are you as surprised as
I am at how these little guys used to look?

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.760
Let us know in the comments below, and remember
- it's Sloth Week all week long!

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.650
So if you want more even more videos to fawn
over, you can check em out over on the Animalist

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.310
YouTube channel, or just head over to slothweek.com.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.540
And we'll put a link in the description below
as well, just in case!

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.040
