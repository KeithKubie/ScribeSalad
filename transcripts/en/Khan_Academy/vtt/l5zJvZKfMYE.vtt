00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.310
Let's say we have a
path in the xy plane.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.780
That's my y-axis, that is
my x-axis, in my path

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.760
will look like this.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.280
Let's say it looks like that;
trying to draw a bit of an

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.480
arbitrary path, and let's say
we go in a counter clockwise

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.450
direction like that
along our path.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.180
And we could call this path--
so we're going in a counter

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.180
clockwise direction --we
could call that path c.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.730
And let's say we also
have a vector field.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.335
And our vector field is going
to be a little unusual;

00:00:34.335 --> 00:00:36.190
I'll call it p.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.270
p of xy.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.870
It only has an i component, or
all of its vectors are only

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.240
multiples of the i-unit vector.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.410
So it's capital P of xy
times the unit vector i.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.920
There is no j component, so if
you have to visualize this

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.880
vector field, all of the
vectors, they're all multiples

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.980
of the i-unit vector.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.040
Or they could be negative
multiples, so they could

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.960
also go in that direction.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.780
But they don't go diagonal
or they don't go up.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.630
They all go left to
right or right to left.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.660
That's what this vector
field would look like.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.870
Now what I'm interested in
doing is figuring out the line

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.170
integral over a closed loop--
the closed loop c, or the

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:27.710
closed path c --of p dot dr,
which is just our standard

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.775
kind of way of solving
for a line integral.

00:01:29.775 --> 00:01:32.140
And we've seen what
dr is in the past.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:40.760
dr is equal to dx times i plus
dy times the j-unit vector.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.250
And you might say, isn't
it dx, dt times dt?

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.530
Let me write that: can't dr
be written as dx, dt times

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.780
dti plus dy, dt times dtj?

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.280
And it could, but if you
imagine these differentials

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.820
could cancel out, and you're
just left with the dx and

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.490
a dy, and we've seen
that multiple times.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.360
And I'm going to leave it in
this form because hopefully, if

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.390
we're careful, we won't have to
deal with the third

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.540
parameter, t.

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.240
So let's just look at it in
this form right here with

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.120
just the dx's and the dy's.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.580
So this integral can be
rewritten as the line integral,

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.040
the curve c-- actually let
me do it over down here.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:32.600
The line integral over the path
of the curve c of p dot dr. So

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.750
we take the product of each of
the coefficients, let's say the

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.610
coefficient of the i component,
so we get p-- I'll do that in

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:47.450
green, actually do that purple
color --so we get p of xy times

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:54.770
dx plus-- well there's no 0
times j times dy; 0 times dy id

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.290
just going to be 0 --so this
our line integral simplified

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.330
to this right here.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.890
This is equal to this original
integral up here, so we're

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.110
literally just taking the line
integral around this path.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.890
Now I said that we play our
cards right, we're not going to

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.090
have to deal with the third
variable, t; that we might be

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.230
able just solve this integral
only in terms of x.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.700
And so let's see if
we can do that.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.640
So let's look at our minimum
and maximum x points.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.410
That looks like our
minimum x point.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.250
Let's call that a.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.940
Let's call that our maximum
x point; let's call that b.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.260
What we could do is we can
break up this curve into

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.500
two functions of x.
y is functions of x.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.750
So this bottom one right here
we could call as y1 of x.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.570
This is just a standard curve;
you know when we were just

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.940
dealing with standard calculus,
this is just you can

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.570
imagine this is f of x and
it's a function of x.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:51.900
And this is y2 of x.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.090
Just like that.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.470
So you can imagine two paths;
one path defined by y1 of x--

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.800
let me do that in a different
color; magenta --one path

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.340
defined by y1 of x as we go
from x is equal to a to x is

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.110
equal to b, and then another
path defined by y2 of x as we

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.230
go from x is equal to
b to x is equal to a.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.330
That is our curve.

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.550
So what we could do is, we
could rewrite this integral--

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.820
which is the same thing as that
integral --as this is equal to

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.790
the integral-- we'll first do
this first path --of x going

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:40.130
from a to b of p of x.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.670
And I could to say p of x and
y, but we know along this

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.440
path y is a function of x.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.290
So we say x and y1 of x.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.220
Wherever we see a y we
substitute it with

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.910
a y1 of x, dx.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.030
So that covers that first path;
I'll do it in the same color.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.430
We could imagine this is c1.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.180
This is kind of the first half
of our curve-- well it's not

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.820
exactly the half --but that
takes us right from that

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:10.990
point to that point.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.430
And then we want to
complete the circle.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.960
Maybe I'll do that, and
I'll do that in yellow.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.390
That's going to be equal to--
sorry we're going to have to

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:25.920
add these two --plus the
integral from x is equal to b

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:37.290
to x is equal to a of-- do it
in that same color --of p of x.

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.230
And now y is going
to be y2 of x.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.180
Wherever you see a y, you
can substitute with y2

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.890
of x along this curve.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.350
y2 of x, dx.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.650
This is already getting
interesting and you

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.090
might already see where
I'm going with this.

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.130
So this is the curve c2.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.030
too I think you appreciate if
you take the union of c1 and

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.440
c2, we've got our whole curve.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.690
So let's see if we can simplify
this integral a little bit.

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.710
Well one thing we want to
do, we might want to make

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.130
their end points the same.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.150
So if you swap a and b
here, it just turns

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.180
the integral negative.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.810
So you make this into a b, that
into an a, and then make that

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.290
plus sign into a minus sign.

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.000
And now we can rewrite this
whole thing as being equal to

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:33.810
the integral from a to b of
this thing, of p of x and y1 of

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:44.290
x minus this thing, minus p of
x and y2 of x, and then

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.840
all of that times dx.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.310
I'll write it in a third color.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.740
Now, I'm going to do something
a little bit arbitrary, but I

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.190
think you'll appreciate why I
did this by the end of this

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.000
video, and it's just a
very simple operation.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.580
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to swap these two.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.490
So I'm essentially going to
multiply this whole thing by

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.020
negative 1, or essentially
multiply and divide

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:05.910
by negative 1.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:08.310
So I can multiply this by
negative 1 and then multiply

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.705
the outside by negative 1, and
I will not have changed the

00:07:10.705 --> 00:07:13.290
integral; I'm multiplying
by negative 1 twice.

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:16.810
So if I swap these two things,
if I multiply the inside times

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:20.250
negative 1, so this is going to
be equal to-- do the outside

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.770
of the integral, a to b.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:26.460
If I multiply the inside--
I'll do a dx out here --if I

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.790
multiply the inside of the
integral by negative 1,

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.510
these two guys switch.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:36.230
So it becomes p
of x of y2 of x.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:46.310
And then you're going to have
minus p of x and y1 of x.

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.920
My handwriting's getting
a little messy.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.420
But I can't just multiply
just the inside by minus 1.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.250
I don't want to change the
integral, so I multiplied the

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:55.480
inside by minus 1, let me
multiply the outside

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.140
by minus 1.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.160
And since I multiplied by
minus 1 twice, these two

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.120
things are equivalent.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:04.840
Or you could say this is
the negative of that.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.400
Either way, I think you
appreciate that I haven't

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.430
changed the integral
at all, numerically.

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:11.790
I multiplied the inside and
the outside by minus 1.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:15.130
And now the next step I'm going
to do, it might look a little

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.780
bit foreign to you, but I
think you'll appreciate it.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.460
It might be obvious to you
if you've recently done

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.320
some double integrals.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:30.270
So this thing can be rewritten
as minus the integral from a to

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:38.660
b of-- and let me do a new
color --of the function p of x,

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:49.460
y evaluated at y2 of x minus--
and let me make it very clear;

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:54.970
this is y is equal to y2 of x
--minus this function evaluated

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:59.520
at y is equal to y1 of x.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.820
And of course all
of that times dx.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:08.380
This statement and what we
saw right here-- this

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:14.090
statement right here --are
completely identical.

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:20.000
And then if we assume that a
partial derivative of capital P

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.590
with respect to y exists,
hopefully you'll realize-- and

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:26.870
I'll focus on this a little
bit because I don't want to

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:27.700
confuse you on this step.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:28.880
Let me write the outside
of this integral.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.180
So this is going to be equal
to-- and this is kind of a neat

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.150
outcome, and we're starting
to build up to a very neat

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:38.490
outcome, which will probably
have to take the next video to

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.210
do --so we do the outside dx.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:48.830
If we assume that capital P has
a partial derivative, this

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:51.410
right here is the
exact same thing.

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:54.550
This right here is the exact
same thing as the partial

00:09:54.550 --> 00:10:01.860
derivative of P with respect to
y, dy, the antiderivative of

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:10.010
that from y1 of x to y2 of x.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:13.040
I want to make you feel
comfortable that these two

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.740
things are equivalent.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.800
And to realize they're
equivalent, you'll probably

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.310
just have to start here
and then go to that.

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:21.540
We're used to seeing this;
we're used to seeing a double

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:25.100
integral like this, and then
the very first step we say, OK

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:29.500
to solve this double integral
we start on the inside integral

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:33.210
right there, and we say, OK
let's take the antiderivative

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:34.870
of this with respect to y.

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:37.420
So if you take the
antiderivative of the partial

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:41.830
of p with respect to y, you're
going to end up with p.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:44.330
And since this is a definite
integral, the boundaries are

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.420
going to be in terms of x,
you're going to evaluate that

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:51.020
from y is equal to y2 of x, and
you're going to subtract from

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.210
that y is equal to y1 of x.

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:55.200
Normally we start with
something like this, and we

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.610
go to something like this.

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:59.620
This is kind of unusual that we
started, we kind of solved, we

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:02.030
started with the solution of
the definite integral, and then

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:05.150
we slowly built back to
the definite integral.

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:08.400
So hopefully you realize that
this is true, that this is

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.110
just we're kind of going
in a reverse direction

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:11.020
than we normally do.

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.750
And if you do realize that,
then we've just established

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:14.850
a pretty neat outcome.

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:18.880
Because what is
this right here?

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.570
Let me go back, let me see
if I can fit everything.

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:25.745
I have some function-- and I'm
assuming that the partial of

00:11:25.745 --> 00:11:29.790
P with respect to y exists
--but I have some function

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:31.510
defined over the xy plane.

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:33.490
You know, you could
imagine we're dealing in

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:35.390
three dimensions now.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:37.980
We'll draw a little bit neater.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:46.110
So that's y, that's x, that's
z, so this, you could imagine,

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:48.560
is some surface; it just
happens to be the partial

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.350
of P with respect to x.

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:55.790
So it's some surface on
the xy plane like that.

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:57.170
And what are we doing?

00:11:57.170 --> 00:12:01.310
We're taking the double
integral under that surface,

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:02.250
around this region.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:04.580
The region's boundaries in
terms of y are defined

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.180
by y2 and y1 of x.

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:11.160
So you literally
have that curve.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:16.500
That's y2 on top,
y1 on the bottom.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.590
And so we're essentially
taking the volume above.

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:27.190
So if you imagine with the base
is-- the whole floor of this is

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:32.060
going to be the area inside of
this curve, and then the height

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:36.070
is going to be the function
partial of P with respect to y.

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:42.700
It's going to be a little hard
for me to draw, but this is

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.670
essentially some type of a
volume, if you want to

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:45.610
visualize it that way.

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:52.780
But the really neat outcome
here is if you call this region

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:56.600
r, we've just simplified
this line integral.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.580
And this was a special one.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:01.270
It only had an x-component, the
vector field, but we've just

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:06.310
simplified this line integral
to being equivalent to-- maybe

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:09.080
I should write this line
integral because that's what's

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.830
the really neat outcome.

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:13.130
We've just established that
this thing right here, which

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:16.970
is the same as our original
one, so let me write that.

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:22.570
The closed line integral around
the curve c of p of xy, dx,

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:25.300
we've just established that
that's the same thing as the

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:31.980
double integral over the region
r-- this is the region

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:40.333
r --of the partial of
P with respect to y.

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:52.120
And we could write dy, dx, or
we could write da, whatever you

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.810
want to write, but this is
the double integral

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:55.310
over that region.

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:59.560
The neat thing here is using a
vector field that only had an

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:02.850
x-component, we were able to
connect its line integral to

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:04.730
the double integral over
region-- oh, and I forgot

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:06.000
something very important.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.420
We had a negative
sign out here.

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.700
So this was a minus
sign out here.

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.390
Or we could even put the minus
in here, but I think you

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:13.940
get the general idea.

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.450
In the next video, I'm going to
do the same exact thing with

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:20.710
the vector field that only has
vectors in the y-direction.

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:22.240
And then we'll connect
the two and we'll end up

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.560
with Green's theorem.
