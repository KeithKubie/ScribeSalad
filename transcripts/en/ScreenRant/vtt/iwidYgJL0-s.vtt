00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:11.000
Studios understand the importance of media
training their talent before they head out

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.120
on a press tour.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.279
Fans are so anxious to learn any detail they
possibly can, that even the most basic quote

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:18.520
can be dissected beyond belief.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.520
Actors and directors have to be very careful
about what they say in interviews, since maintaining

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.150
secrets is typically the primary objective.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.970
Most of the time, they do a good job of avoiding
any massive reveals, but they’re only human

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.999
and are prone to mistakes like the rest of
us.

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:39.030
Here are 10 instances of actors who spoiled
their own projects.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.239
Star Wars: The Force Awakens

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.750
Star Wars fans love Harrison Ford to death,
but the actor drew the ire of some moviegoers

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.090
during a Twitter Q&amp;A prior to the release
of Episode 7.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.950
When asked what his favorite action scene
in the film was, Ford replied with “The

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.989
sword fight with Rey and Kylo Ren.”

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.501
Up until that point, the only lightsaber duel
hinted at was Finn against Kylo Ren, with

00:00:59.501 --> 00:01:02.420
Rey’s Force abilities being kept largely
under wraps.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.640
It didn’t make the moment any less awe-inspiring,
but hopefully Ford learned a few lessons for

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.740
when it’s time to promote Indiana Jones
5.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:15.320
Sometimes, too much honesty is a bad thing.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.320
Creed

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.290
Rocky fans couldn’t wait to see Sylvester
Stallone return as the Italian Stallion in

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.320
this spinoff, but some of them may have wished
they muted the actor on social media during

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.710
the buildup to the film.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.500
Giving followers a behind-the-scenes look
at the writing room, Sly tweeted out a picture

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.210
of a desk, which included a page from the
actual Creed screenplay.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.530
This wouldn’t have been a big deal, but
it was a fairly important page: the last one.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.880
Viewers were able to see that the film ended
with a recovering Rocky walking up the famous

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.720
steps with Adonis Johnson by his side, which
indeed was the final scene in the movie.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.540
Captain America: The Winter Soldier

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.490
Since their humble beginnings, Marvel has
built a strong reputation and has attracted

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.590
some top-notch talent to their films.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.780
It was big news when Hollywood icon Robert
Redford signed on for Captain America: The

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.750
Winter Soldier, and many couldn’t wait to
see his role in the movie.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.440
Apparently, Redford was equally as excited
to talk about it.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.150
In an interview, the actor said the main appeal
for him was to do something different – play

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.150
a villain.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.190
When Redford was first announced, details
on his part were scarce, so this is obviously

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.240
something Marvel didn’t want revealed.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:29.700
It ruined the twist that Hydra had infiltrated
SHIELD, but the film still turned out thrilling.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.250
The Dark Knight Rises

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.340
After the record-breaking success of The Dark
Knight, fans couldn’t wait to see the conclusion

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.230
of Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.700
A big question during the pre-release phase
was whether or not Bruce Wayne would die.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.920
While on David Letterman’s show, Anne Hathaway
was mortified when the host told his audience

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.060
“of course, Batman is dead in the end.”

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.120
Hathaway nervously chastised Letterman for
the spoiler, before Letterman laughed and

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.530
said he was lying, Bruce Wayne survives.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.680
Hathaway was just stunned and apologized to
Nolan on-camera for the situation.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.650
When audiences finally got to see the film
for themselves, Wayne is in fact alive and

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.170
well, far removed from Gotham City.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.930
Star Wars: The Force Awakens

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.240
Few actors are as good at keeping a secret
as Mark Hamill is, so it was surprising when

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.950
he posted a Star Wars spoiler on his Twitter
account.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.830
About a month before Episode 7’s premiere,
Hamill confirmed that he would be returning

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.930
for Episode 8, and was in the process of growing
his Jedi beard back.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.959
Given that Jedi have the capability to appear
as Force ghosts, this wasn’t necessarily

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.690
the biggest reveal about the highly anticipated
film.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.340
Still, fans took issue, feeling that he had
ruined a key aspect of The Force Awakens.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.290
With Luke having a major role in Episode 8,
it will be interesting to see if Hamill stays

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.150
mum on Episode 9.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.680
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.200
A frequent trope in the second installment
of a superhero film franchise is the protagonist

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.260
losing or giving up their powers as they yearn
for a more “normal” existence.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.080
Fans learned ahead of the premiere of Ghost
Rider: Spirit of Vengeance that Johnny Blaze

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.420
would be the latest to take part in this phenomenon.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.590
In an interview, star Nic Cage mentioned that
he had filmed an exorcism scene, implying

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.959
that his character would be freed of his demons
for a certain amount of time.

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.640
This was a sequence in the final film, and
while it wasn’t a shocking plot twist, it’s

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.730
still something that should have been held
back.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:22.410
Revealing specific character arc beats isn’t
always the smartest thing to do.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.710
The Walking Dead

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.160
Social media has made avoiding spoilers for
popular TV shows an art form, and any post

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.160
can be a landmine.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.150
Typically, it’s friends who don’t know
any better ruining certain elements, but here,

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.279
a Walking Dead actor sent the Internet into
a frenzy.

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:41.960
Michael Cudlitz, who plays Abraham, was interacting
with co-star Josh McDermitt on Twitter, when

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.090
he said “I had a blast working with you.”

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.009
This caused fans to speculate that one of
the characters was going to die at some point

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:49.009
in the season.

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:52.180
Making things more suspicious was when Cudlitz
amended his tweet.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:05:01.550
This was in 2015, and both characters lived,
so this was fuss over nothing.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.300
Game of Thrones

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.650
HBO executives must have had headaches after
this one.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.409
In season six of the popular show, Rory McCann
is portraying the Hound, bringing the character

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:13.409
back from the dead.

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:17.569
It was probably meant to be a surprise, but
fans learned of the reveal well before the

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:18.809
network intended.

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:23.590
In an interview, McShane admitted that he
“nursed a much-loved character back to life.”

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.419
When it was pointed out that it could either
be the Hound or John Snow, McShane essentially

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:30.110
confessed he was playing a version of the
Elder Brother.

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.340
We’re pretty sure he got a talk about what
he can and cannot say publicly later on, because

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.039
this was a big deal.

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:40.219
Agents of SHIELD

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:44.710
When mysterious blue aliens showed up on an
episode of Marvel’s TV show, fans speculated

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.559
about what species they might be.

00:05:46.559 --> 00:05:50.029
One popular theory was the Kree, and it turns
out that was right.

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:52.710
But it wasn’t Marvel that got to reveal
the fact.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.120
Actress Chloe Bennett spilled the beans in
an interview, where she said, “I know that

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.529
the alien was a Kree.”

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:01.599
She later tried to backtrack by suggesting
it was just an opinion of hers, but fans knew

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:02.599
better.

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:05.990
The Kree were now a part of the expansive
Marvel Cinematic Universe, opening avenues

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.460
for more interesting stories.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.919
It’s too bad it got ruined by one of the
show’s stars.

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:15.779
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:19.530
As a prequel, the narrative of Rogue One is
far less secretive than The Force Awakens.

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.990
Still, there are aspects that Lucasfilm wants
to keep under wraps.

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.129
They hadn’t officially revealed any details
about Madds Mikkelsen’s character when the

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:31.060
actor confirmed in an interview that he’s
playing the father of Felicity Jones’ Jyn

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.060
Erso.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.639
He even went as far to say that he shot scenes
with Jones and a younger actress playing a

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:40.090
child version of the character, meaning Rogue
One could be the first Star Wars film to include

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.090
flashbacks.

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.310
The studio typically does a great job of controlling
information, but they let Mikkelsen get a

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:46.520
bit out of hand.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.939
Expect them to rein him in as the marketing
campaign continues.

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:53.869
Those are our picks for actors who spoiled
their own projects.

00:06:53.869 --> 00:06:55.039
Are there any we missed?

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:56.559
Which ones did you manage to avoid?
