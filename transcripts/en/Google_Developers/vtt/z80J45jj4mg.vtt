MICHAL SEGALOV: Hi.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.720
Welcome to the second
episode of "Women

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.050
Techmakers" in Israel.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.550
"Women Techmakers" is a series
of videos which brings more

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.200
visibility to successful women

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.100
entrepreneurs around the world.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.570
It started in the United States,
and we're glad to host

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.470
the first series of episodes
outside the United States.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.610
I'm Michal Segalov.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.330
I'm a software engineer
at Google.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.640
Currently, I work in technical
infrastructure.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.650
So my team designs software
that's internally used by

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.126
other teams in Google.

00:00:33.126 --> 00:00:35.586
Prior to that, I worked
on YouTube.

00:00:35.586 --> 00:00:37.554
And prior to that, on
search quality.

00:00:37.554 --> 00:00:39.522
We have with us Dana.

00:00:39.522 --> 00:00:41.310
DANA GABEL: Hi, my
name is Dana.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.890
I'm also a software engineer
with Google.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.273
I've been with Google
over five years.

00:00:45.273 --> 00:00:48.360
Currently, I'm working on Google
Knowledge and Identity.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.080
Previously, I worked on the
AdWords's API and different

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.430
targeting methods for ads at
Google, and worked on social

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.280
discovery on G+.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.670
And I also have three kids.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.380
MICHAL SEGALOV: And today we're
hosting Yael Karov, CEO

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.120
and founder of Ginger
Software.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.670
So Yael, can you please
introduce yourself?

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.450
YAEL KAROV: Hi.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.030
I'm Yael Karov.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.070
I'm the founder and CEO
of Ginger Software.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.530
I founded Ginger
five years ago.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.550
And before founding Ginger, I
worked in high tech for 15

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.920
years, in roles of VP R&amp;D and
CTO in three companies.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.960
And before that, I had my MSc
from the Weizmann Institute of

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.975
Science in mathematics
and computer science.

00:01:33.975 --> 00:01:36.560
I married, and I have
three kids.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.278
MICHAL SEGALOV: So Yael, you had
a very successful career,

00:01:39.278 --> 00:01:41.618
and you're now working
as the CEO of Ginger.

00:01:41.618 --> 00:01:43.334
Can you please tell us a little
bit about Ginger and

00:01:43.334 --> 00:01:44.894
what it does, how the
idea came about?

00:01:44.894 --> 00:01:46.230
YAEL KAROV: Gladly.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:52.850
So I founded Ginger
with the idea--

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.460
Actually, I knew, myself, when I
wasn't sure about how to use

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.640
English, just trying in Google,
actually, searching

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.280
for various alternatives.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.270
For example, whether I should
say, in Monday or on Monday?

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.180
What is most popular?

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.430
And then I thought, OK, I can do
it statistically using the

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.660
same method of checking what is
most popular statistically

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.145
on the web using it in order
to correct the English of

00:02:19.145 --> 00:02:19.780
other people.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.650
So this would be a useful tool
for everyone as you try to

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.910
correct your English.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.430
And I realized that it is going
to be good not only for

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.410
correcting people's English
but also for correcting

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.140
machine text, like a machine
translation and speech

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.955
recognition, which
also produced

00:02:38.955 --> 00:02:41.720
incorrect text many times.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.450
So I looked at the algorithms
of speech recognition and

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.635
machine translations, and I
realized, with a proof of

00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:53.160
concept, that there was another
statistical model that

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.130
can correct also the
machine text.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.685
So I started just by placing a
patent on this specific idea

00:03:02.685 --> 00:03:03.770
and domains.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.500
And then my husband, who
is also a very strong

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.790
technologist [INAUDIBLE], he
started developing the proof

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:14.630
of concept.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.995
And we raised money based
on the proof of concept.

00:03:21.074 --> 00:03:24.230
DANA GABEL: We want to ask you,
where do you think Ginger

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.995
fits in as an area of English
as a second language?

00:03:27.995 --> 00:03:33.110
YAEL KAROV: So I would go at
least to cover the vast

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.310
majority of English as a second
language speakers that

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.690
already know the basic
vocabulary but are very far

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.550
from being native English
speakers.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:47.600
So they can write and speak
English, but with a lot of

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.790
mistakes and the vocabulary
is not good enough.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.730
And our goal is to help them
online in the writing, whether

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.580
they're writing in mobile or
any desktop application,

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.140
everywhere they write just to
correct their writing, to

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.840
learn the English profile,
understand personal culture.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.640
Understand what is wrong with
their English, and then offer

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.930
them private lessons that are
tailored for them to improve

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.110
their English.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.465
And it's not just grammar
and spelling.

00:04:14.465 --> 00:04:17.183
It's to improve their vocabulary
and pronunciation,

00:04:17.183 --> 00:04:19.410
to improve their overall
English.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.660
So it's a complementary software
to English learning

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.941
schools or courses.

00:04:26.941 --> 00:04:29.950
DANA GABEL: Yael, in your mind,
what is crucial for a

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.420
start-up to be successful?

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.963
YAEL KAROV: So I think it starts
with leading a team.

00:04:35.963 --> 00:04:38.930
I think the team should work
very well together and should

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.410
have a very clear vision of the
goal of the company, and

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.840
they should complement
each other.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.120
And the second thing,
I think, is the

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.840
strategy of the company.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.610
I think when you start a
start-up with some goal in

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.860
mind, it's never what
you end with.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.770
So I think it's to be
constantly aware to

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.380
opportunities and changes in
the world and feedback from

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.840
your users, your investors, and
the people you work with.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.610
And to know which changes to
take, and to change your

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.620
original goals, because of all
this feedback and inputs

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.020
you're exposed to.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.460
And which opportunities
and changes

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.950
and feedback to ignore.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.140
And to keep your--

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.700
even though the people will tell
you that it's not going

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.840
to work or not to work in a
reasonable time, and so which

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.890
ones not to.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.090
So I think the strategy
is critical.

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.090
And then last, of course,
is the execution.

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.325
Because you can have the best
ideas and strategy, but a lot

00:05:42.325 --> 00:05:46.116
of things just succeed or fail
because of execution.

00:05:46.116 --> 00:05:48.717
MICHAL SEGALOV: Do you have an
example of how Ginger changed

00:05:48.717 --> 00:05:50.373
its strategy along the way?

00:05:50.373 --> 00:05:51.180
YAEL KAROV: Yes.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.770
Absolutely.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.290
I must say that there are
many things I would

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.370
do differently today.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.380
So first is which market you
are going to go for.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.450
So our technology and products
fit consumers.

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.225
Every user can download our
product from our website.

00:06:06.225 --> 00:06:10.140
And this requires online
marketing to get to consumers.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:14.155
But it also fits the education
market, so just to schools,

00:06:14.155 --> 00:06:14.920
for example.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.950
And the corporate market,
because basically almost any

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.580
employee in any international
corporation needs it.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.620
So in the beginning, we tried
to grow in parallel on all

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.320
these three markets, because
we thought, it's the same

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.670
product and it's just a matter
of doing marketing in parallel

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.090
in three different domains.

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.010
But eventually, we got to the
conclusion we should focus

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.330
only on the online market.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:43.460
Because you sort of cheat
yourself when you think that

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.220
you can do all these market
segments without much extra

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.020
product to work and management
to work.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.720
So this is one example
of a change.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.880
And the second example is that
we started only with a focus

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.150
of English learning.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.090
So we have that Proofreader
and the

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.320
English improvement software.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.660
But we did not develop in the
beginning the other products

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.100
that are on natural language
understanding.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.540
And in the last year, we started
developing for the

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.400
speech recognition
engine and the

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.242
personal assistant software.

00:07:18.242 --> 00:07:21.679
DANA GABEL: This actually leads
to our next question.

00:07:21.679 --> 00:07:23.888
What are some other technology
trends that

00:07:23.888 --> 00:07:25.130
you are excited about?

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:28.510
YAEL KAROV: So I am personally
excited about anything that

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:33.070
helps computers understand
the human language.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:39.710
And so what is most exciting
for me today is actually

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:40.640
personal assistant.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.050
Because it's a change, I
believe, that in the next few

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.666
years we are going to see that
people speak with a mobile

00:07:47.666 --> 00:07:50.375
phone in a natural language
command without televisions,

00:07:50.375 --> 00:07:52.630
tablets, and computers.

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:55.048
And that it's going to change
the way people interact with

00:07:55.048 --> 00:07:55.542
their computer.

00:07:55.542 --> 00:07:58.780
And I find it most exciting,
because it's going to affect

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:03.670
basically almost everybody
in the world.

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:07.350
Also, the technology behind it
excites me, because in order

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:10.480
to understand the user or
to be able to make some

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.310
conversation with the
user, it's the

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.950
classical problem in AI.

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:18.630
And for me, I think it's one
of the most challenging and

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:20.050
interesting problems
to work on.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.430
DANA GABEL: That's great.

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:25.618
What is the technological or
growth potential you see for

00:08:25.618 --> 00:08:27.079
Ginger in your future?

00:08:27.079 --> 00:08:29.027
MICHAL SEGALOV: Maybe
show us a demo, too.

00:08:29.027 --> 00:08:29.950
YAEL KAROV: That
would be great.

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:32.650
I will.

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:35.409
So we are going in two
different avenues.

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:40.380
One is actually just going
our major product, the

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:44.810
Proofreader, into also
suggesting variations to the

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:45.780
sentence the user wrote.

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:50.310
So even if the user is a native
English speaker, if he

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:55.320
writes, I love you or I miss
you, it would be helpful for

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.490
him to get many other ways that
other people say it on

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:01.380
the web that means the
same but they say it

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.010
in different words.

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:04.495
So this is one problem
we are working on.

00:09:04.495 --> 00:09:08.730
And it's also some goals of
our products to people who

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:10.450
speak English as a
first language.

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:14.180
And the second one is to use
our natural language

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:18.560
understanding technology for
speech recognition and

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:23.220
personal assistant that
understands the intent and

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:27.286
slots that the user
querying had.

00:09:27.286 --> 00:09:29.077
DANA GABEL: So do you want
to show us a demo

00:09:29.077 --> 00:09:29.676
now before we continue?

00:09:29.676 --> 00:09:31.900
YAEL KAROV: Yeah, absolutely.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.350
So I'll start by demonstrating
our

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:37.695
Proofreader for the desktop.

00:09:37.695 --> 00:09:39.830
So it works in any office
application or

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:41.590
any browser and website.

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:47.220
So this is an example
writing in Gmail.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:53.202
And then I'll show the mobile
interfaces we have and the

00:09:53.202 --> 00:09:56.140
next version we are working on
that shows variations of the

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:57.290
different sentences.

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:58.888
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:52.785 --> 00:11:55.120
YAEL KAROV: The technology
grows, yes.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.570
But it's actually in the aspect
of speech recognition

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:59.070
and personal assistant.

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:02.770
So I will now show how our
software can improve the

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:06.800
speech recognition QOC by
understanding the context of

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.020
the user query.

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:13.910
In this specific example, the
user wants to order take-away,

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:16.630
but it can be any kind of other
product that the user

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.260
would like to order.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:22.250
And we understand the intent
of the user, what type of

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:24.590
product-- in this case, what
type of food the user wants,

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:28.490
in which price range, if he
indicated the restaurant or

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:30.830
not, his location, and so on.

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:35.320
And the second example is not
just a speech recognition

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.840
improvement but also
performing the

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.090
task for the user.

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:43.480
But really, the user can order
a product just in a single

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:47.390
sentence, in less than 30
seconds instead of spending 10

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:52.872
times by interacting with
the mobile application.

00:12:52.872 --> 00:12:54.321
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:54.321 --> 00:12:55.290
-Hi.

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:57.740
So today I'm going to
demonstrate the Ginger Express

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:01.840
application, which I'll
launch just now.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.060
So this is a Start screen,
and it asks you

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:05.310
what you want to order.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.020
I want to order a tuna salad
with Swiss cheese, please.

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.375
So as you can see,
we transcribe

00:13:16.375 --> 00:13:18.550
the sentence correctly.

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:20.620
And when we look at the
results-- for example, there's

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:23.610
a chef salad here, a few
chef salads, actually.

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:26.390
And if you want to understand
why we selected those--

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:31.430
because as you can see, they
have both Swiss cheese and

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:33.650
tuna in their description.

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:35.622
Likewise for this one.

00:13:35.622 --> 00:13:39.490
A chef salad with Swiss cheese
and tuna in them.

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:43.600
Let me try another order.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.550
I want to order two hamburgers
and four French fries, please.

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:52.470
So first of all, the first
thing you'll see is that

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:54.000
actual order was placed
correctly.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.730
Namely, we have two hamburgers
and four French fries here.

00:13:57.730 --> 00:13:59.770
Two turkey burgers and four
French fries, two pizza

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:01.360
burgers and four French fries.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.240
What you don't see and is a real
accomplishment is that

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.060
Ginger was actually able to
improve upon Google's speech

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:08.330
detects engine.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.290
So as you can see, the original
results received by

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:10.980
Google were--

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:14.890
I want to order to, T-O,
hamburgers and for, F-O-R,

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:16.130
French fries.

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:19.760
And Ginger was able to decode
these results and return the

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:20.370
correct ones.

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:24.320
Namely, T-W-O, two hamburgers
and four, F-O-U-R, French

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:29.150
fries, receiving the correct
results, which is quite nice.

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:32.990
Now, let me conclude with
one final example.

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:37.340
I want to order a banana
cheesecake, please.

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:39.810
So again, we got the right
transcription,

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:41.070
as you can see here.

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:43.400
Notice that the first result
is one banana.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.660
The question is why
we chose it.

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:47.260
Well, it's in the section
of the cheesecakes.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.750
So we ordered a banana
cheesecake, and we identified

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:53.050
the dish not by its actual name
but by its name together

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:56.200
with the section in
which it appears.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.850
Likewise, before, we did that
with the dish name and its

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:00.080
description.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:03.220
So I hope you've enjoyed this
demonstration today.

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:04.470
Thank you.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:13.700
So today we'll be showcasing
and demonstrating Ginger's

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:17.670
capabilities in augmenting and
improving speech-to-text

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:21.960
capabilities in a
post-processing method.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:27.440
Which relies on taking the
results received from a

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:32.710
standard speech or text engine
such as Google or Nuance, and

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:35.500
breaking it down into the
phonetic representation, and

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.880
regenerating candidates
in order to

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.185
yield the correct response.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.690
I want a ham sandwich.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:57.710
Now, here you see how Ginger was
able to not only correct

00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:01.210
but actually generate
the correct answer

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:02.900
and choose it correctly.

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:07.350
So Google saw, I want
to Huntington Beach.

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:10.540
And Ginger was able to
phonetically map that onto the

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:14.030
correct answer and augment
the results with,

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:15.280
I want a ham sandwich.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:20.350
I want to order pasta
bolognese.

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:31.560
Note that, as you can see here,
Google got, I want to

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.700
order possible Inez.

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:37.850
And Ginger Express was able to
correct this using our decoder

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:40.790
and phonetic similarity to the
correct pasta bolognese.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.990
I want to order two hamburgers,
please.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:00.480
So here you see the Ginger
Express was able to identify

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.120
the correct, I want to order
two hamburgers, please.

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:07.270
Whereas Google yielded the
following result--

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.200
I want to order two hamburg--

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.130
U-R-S, please.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:15.680
So Ginger Express was able to
identify the correct essential

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:20.040
phonemes and regenerate the
correct answer, two

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.849
hamburgers.

00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:23.334
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:17:23.334 --> 00:17:25.828
DANA GABEL: Yael, you are
leading a lot of efforts in

00:17:25.828 --> 00:17:27.684
the company you're running.

00:17:27.684 --> 00:17:31.270
How do you divide your efforts
between pushing near-term

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:33.890
goals and planning
strategically?

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:38.670
YAEL KAROV: So it starts by
building the management team

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:40.670
in a way that matches
these goals.

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:45.660
So we have a different VP R&amp;D
for the short-term goals,

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:47.720
which are releasing
new versions to

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.140
the existing products.

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:53.140
And we have a VP of NLP
Platform, Micha, who is in

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:56.796
charge of working on the
strategic projects for the

00:17:56.796 --> 00:17:58.090
future of Ginger.

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:01.690
And this division, with its
different departments and

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:05.730
different software engineers,
it's very helpful, and it also

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:08.370
helps me to divide my
time between these

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:10.294
two different tasks.

00:18:10.294 --> 00:18:13.598
DANA GABEL: If you had 20 more
skilled engineers joining

00:18:13.598 --> 00:18:15.960
Ginger tomorrow, what would
you want them to focus on?

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.390
YAEL KAROV: First, I
would be so happy.

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:21.290
So I would divide them between
two different goals.

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:26.180
The first one is that our new
version of suggesting

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:31.000
variations to your sentences
and that helps you say

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.310
something in a different way
than the way you are used to.

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:36.940
So I would really
like to release

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:38.100
it as soon as possible.

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.730
It's one of the most
exciting, I think,

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:41.190
products in our company.

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:43.960
And because there's no
other product that

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:46.070
is similar to this.

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:51.490
And the second goal I would
devote to is speech

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:53.770
recognition improvement and
the personal assistant,

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:58.360
because the personal assistant
project is huge.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:59.400
You can do--

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.352
DANA GABEL: You could staff it
with as many engineers--

00:19:01.352 --> 00:19:02.650
YAEL KAROV: 200 engineers.

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:06.144
Still I was able to do with
it two [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:06.144 --> 00:19:07.100
DANA GABEL: OK.

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:08.534
That's great.

00:19:08.534 --> 00:19:11.402
What are the major partnerships
Ginger currently

00:19:11.402 --> 00:19:13.792
has, or you would
like it to have?

00:19:13.792 --> 00:19:15.720
YAEL KAROV: Two types
of partnerships.

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:20.110
The first one is to integrate
Ginger into different

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:21.650
platforms with user rights.

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:26.100
So we offer an SDK for websites,
like any web mail or

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.270
social network, anywhere people
write [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:32.620
Just in a single minute of
downloading our product for a

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:35.870
website, they can offer
the users text

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:37.790
correction for free.

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:40.480
And the second platform
is mobile.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:44.335
So we offer mobile manufacturers
or mobile

00:19:44.335 --> 00:19:49.390
application developers, again,
to use our SDK and offer the

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:51.540
users a text correction.

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:56.840
The second type of partner are
English-learning players.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:01.958
So any network of
English-learning school for

00:20:01.958 --> 00:20:06.290
adults, for example, can
distribute to the

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:07.835
students our software.

00:20:07.835 --> 00:20:11.040
And it will also help them to
teach their students in a

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.715
better way, because the teachers
will be able to see

00:20:13.715 --> 00:20:17.570
the level of English students
have and what are the most

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:19.340
frequent problems
of each student.

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.150
So it will help them
to personalize

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:23.608
their learning courses.

00:20:23.608 --> 00:20:27.010
DANA GABEL: It looks like you
feel strongly about making a

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:28.450
difference.

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:31.730
So Ginger recently changed its
business model to the premium,

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:33.158
premium model.

00:20:33.158 --> 00:20:36.062
So how is it going to
make money now?

00:20:36.062 --> 00:20:40.090
YAEL KAROV: So currently, we are
offering our Proofreader

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:44.790
for free, but soon we are going
to start monetizing by

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:48.180
offering our users to use
our premium product.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:52.970
And the difference between the
premium and the free product,

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:55.000
first, is that you
get an unlimited

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.390
usage of the software.

00:20:56.390 --> 00:21:01.670
With the Proofreader, it's
limited to a certain number of

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:06.080
corrections you accept
per month.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:09.160
Also suggesting them the
sentence variations is going

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:12.525
to be limited in the same way,
so you can, for example, get

00:21:12.525 --> 00:21:17.950
50 variations of sentences
for free per month.

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:20.240
But then if you use it
for more than that,

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.550
then you need to pay.

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:24.270
And the second differentiator
is the functionality.

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:28.770
So in the premium product, we
also help people improve their

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:31.560
English based on their frequent
mistakes, and not

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:33.410
just get online help.

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:36.820
So we help them improve their
grammar, their vocabulary, and

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.165
pronunciation.

00:21:39.165 --> 00:21:41.620
MICHAL SEGALOV: I have one more
question about Ginger.

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:44.970
So in a way, your main client
base is not English speakers

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:48.014
as a first language, so I'm
assuming your main market is

00:21:48.014 --> 00:21:48.982
not the United States.

00:21:48.982 --> 00:21:51.402
But then some of your products,
like the enhancement

00:21:51.402 --> 00:21:55.274
or the How Do You Say? feature
is targeted towards--

00:21:55.274 --> 00:21:56.726
DANA GABEL: Personal
assistants.

00:21:56.726 --> 00:21:58.286
MICHAL SEGALOV: Is that the
personal assistant ones are

00:21:58.286 --> 00:21:59.590
targeted toward native
English speakers.

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:00.980
So how do you see
the differences

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:02.020
between these markets?

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:05.800
YAEL KAROV: So first what we
realized is that actually

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.040
countries which are
English-speaking countries

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:12.250
actually always have the
immigrant population.

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:16.170
And for example, in the United
States, it's 20% of the people

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:17.350
and then also in the UK--

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:19.680
and then these people actually
would like to improve their

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.830
English even more so than
people who live in other

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:26.020
countries, because they need
it for daily usage.

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:28.930
So currently, we distribute it
internationally, also in

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:31.930
English-speaking countries.

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:33.720
We do online marketing.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:38.520
Then Ginger is available
to anyone from any

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:39.850
place in the world.

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:44.260
It's not that we do specific
biz dev efforts in specific

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:45.690
countries at the moment.

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:50.230
And so anyone that we search
for [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:54.298
it means that he has the need
regardless of the location.

00:22:54.298 --> 00:22:56.162
I don't know if that answers
your question.

00:22:56.162 --> 00:22:56.746
MICHAL SEGALOV: Yeah.

00:22:56.746 --> 00:22:57.415
No, I know what you mean.

00:22:57.415 --> 00:23:01.020
DANA GABEL: It's interesting
the marketing to

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:03.660
English-speaking countries
because of all the immigrants.

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:06.310
YAEL KAROV: And actually, we
realized that also people who

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:09.470
are native English speakers use
our product, because, for

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:12.325
example, in mobile, everyone
has mistakes.

00:23:12.325 --> 00:23:15.340
If you type really quickly,
you have mistakes.

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:19.810
And there's no other tool in
mobile that can correct your

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:23.534
mistakes automatically and
use context for that.

00:23:23.534 --> 00:23:25.016
MICHAL SEGALOV: Oh, that's a
really good use of this.

00:23:25.016 --> 00:23:25.510
I should get that.

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:26.992
DANA GABEL: Definitely
for mobile.

00:23:26.992 --> 00:23:29.450
MICHAL SEGALOV: So throughout
your career, it seems that you

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:31.160
work in very diverse
topics, right?

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.670
You started with NLP, and then
you switched over to

00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:36.090
bioinformatics, and now
you're back here.

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:37.955
So how do you do these shifts?

00:23:37.955 --> 00:23:39.820
Or what similarities
do you see?

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:43.890
YAEL KAROV: So there's a very
strong similarity, because all

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:48.050
the problems I work on were some
research problems that

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:51.590
require the machine learning
and statistical models to

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:52.520
solve them.

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:56.190
And actually, working on
genomics was very similar,

00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:58.670
because DNA is also
a language.

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:04.200
And also, it uses statistical
models to learn the language.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.720
Actually, there is a very high
similarity in the different

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.390
problems I was working on.

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:12.460
Of course, the difference is in
the product management and

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:15.870
marketing, which I was also
involved in, was dramatically

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:19.170
different, because the genomics
product I worked on

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:24.160
was diagnostic chips for cancer
based on the new genes

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.620
that we found in Rosetta
Genomics.

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:30.240
And then its product delivery is
completely different than a

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.778
consumer product with
online marketing.

00:24:32.778 --> 00:24:34.614
So this is a dramatic
difference.

00:24:34.614 --> 00:24:37.770
And I much prefer the consumer
products and online marketing.

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:40.320
MICHAL SEGALOV: Another big
change that you made is the

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:44.081
move from being CTO and VP R&amp;D
in companies that you worked

00:24:44.081 --> 00:24:46.232
in before to be the
founder and CEO.

00:24:46.232 --> 00:24:48.144
So what made you
do this change?

00:24:48.144 --> 00:24:50.056
How do you capture
these two roles?

00:24:50.056 --> 00:24:51.980
What are your personal
preferences?

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:55.354
YAEL KAROV: So this is
a good question.

00:24:55.354 --> 00:25:00.140
I actually, after holding this
job as a VP R&amp;D and CTO job in

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:02.160
three different companies,
five years

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:05.490
each, I just gave birth.

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:08.890
So I went to a birth vacation,
and I had some time to think

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:09.795
about my career.

00:25:09.795 --> 00:25:15.970
And I felt like I can't go again
to the same type of job

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:17.320
that I did for 15 years.

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:22.250
And that what makes a company
succeed eventually is not just

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:26.260
the technology but mainly, also,
the strategy and the

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:27.415
product management
and marketing.

00:25:27.415 --> 00:25:32.820
And so I really wanted to
do it myself this time.

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:34.540
And it doesn't mean, of course,

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:36.720
that I don't do mistakes.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.510
I absolutely do.

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:40.840
But at least I can learn from
them and make the changes, I

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.060
hope, quickly.

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:50.790
So it was a wish to lead the
strategy of my own company to

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:53.750
maximize as a success
[INAUDIBLE].

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:56.360
And I think the real question
is, why didn't I do it before?

00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:02.545
Because it took me quite a
time until I got to it.

00:26:02.545 --> 00:26:04.748
MICHAL SEGALOV: So what do you
feel prepared you the most in

00:26:04.748 --> 00:26:07.260
the previous roles that you did
to your current as CEO?

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:09.630
YAEL KAROV: I think it was a
great preparation, because

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:13.520
first, it's management.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.640
Regardless of the domain,
if it's technology,

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.065
just managing people.

00:26:17.065 --> 00:26:18.660
So I did manage a
lot of people.

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:22.230
It was up to 50 or 70
people each time.

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:25.640
But still, it really
was extremely

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:28.560
helpful to the CEO role.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:31.840
And the second thing is, of
course, just the technology

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.800
itself, just being able
to be the chief

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:35.630
scientist of the company.

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:41.660
Or to work extremely well with
the R&amp;D manager and the CTO,

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:46.440
it's because of my background as
a CTO and VP R&amp;D. So it was

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:49.146
very helpful.

00:26:49.146 --> 00:26:51.032
MICHAL SEGALOV: Did you always
know you wanted to found your

00:26:51.032 --> 00:26:51.764
own company?

00:26:51.764 --> 00:26:55.005
Or did this come as a
realization some time in life?

00:26:55.005 --> 00:26:59.940
YAEL KAROV: I think maybe if
I came from a different

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:01.400
background, I would
know it earlier.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:04.160
But for me, I certainly had
no idea I wanted to be an

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:07.100
entrepreneur until
I became one.

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:11.390
And the reason, I think, it's
because I grew up in

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:14.980
[INAUDIBLE], which is in an
extremely religious place

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:18.980
where usually women do
not have a career.

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:25.280
And even if they have, they're
really tied to give their

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.090
focus only to their family.

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:30.601
And it was always very clear to
me that the family, for me,

00:27:30.601 --> 00:27:34.340
is the top priority and
that I have kids or

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:35.920
that I will have kids.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.840
And so I thought it would be
very difficult to combine

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:43.685
family with life, to be a good
mother with being an

00:27:43.685 --> 00:27:43.940
entrepreneur.

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.950
It takes all your time.

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:47.260
And that was a mistake.

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:47.650
[? lets just ?]

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:53.440
So I hope that other women will,
I guess, learn from my

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:54.350
experience.

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:55.465
It doesn't have to be so.

00:27:55.465 --> 00:27:59.730
You can be a very good mother
including being enough time

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:03.625
with your kids, and still run a
company and really devote to

00:28:03.625 --> 00:28:04.660
it all the time.

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:05.235
[INAUDIBLE]

00:28:05.235 --> 00:28:07.540
I think you can really
combine it very well.

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:10.790
And it was a mistake I had in my
perception for many years.

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:13.500
MICHAL SEGALOV: Can you tell us
how you got started as an

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:13.980
entrepreneur?

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:16.860
What were the first attempts at
entrepreneurship that you

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:18.080
took and how you started?

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:21.580
YAEL KAROV: So actually,
all along, I had

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:23.150
many ideas for companies.

00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:26.780
And again, I just didn't do
it, not because I thought

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:28.582
maybe not succeed, but because
I thought it would

00:28:28.582 --> 00:28:30.510
not work with kids.

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:35.510
And when I had this idea of
Ginger, of just the natural

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:40.560
language understanding using
the web, I was so

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:41.280
excited about it.

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:45.390
And I felt I can really do it
in relatively a short time

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:48.890
that I decided that this
time I will do it.

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:52.020
And my husband also was
extremely helpful in that,

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:55.590
because he developed the first
version of the product.

00:28:55.590 --> 00:29:02.650
We decided together that he will
back me and really take a

00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:06.930
significant role, not just like
50/50 partners but even

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:08.535
more at home.

00:29:08.535 --> 00:29:12.270
So it was actually a
mutual decision.

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:14.198
MICHAL SEGALOV: So what
motivates you?

00:29:14.198 --> 00:29:17.560
What are the things you are
most passionate about?

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:20.190
YAEL KAROV: Actually, what
motivates me is usually having

00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:23.510
a very-- it's not that I told
myself, wow, I must be an

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:25.670
entrepreneur or I must
get to an exit.

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:26.955
It's absolutely not that.

00:29:26.955 --> 00:29:29.660
It's the creation
process itself.

00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:34.080
It's having a goal that I really
believe in, having an

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:37.930
idea for a product that can be
useful for many people and can

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:40.510
be helpful not just
to generate money

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:43.700
but really help people.

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:47.030
Having a belief that I have an
idea on how to do it that is

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:51.350
different from the existing
way it's done.

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:54.890
I can only work on something
that really, really excites me

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:56.212
and I really love.

00:29:56.212 --> 00:30:00.015
I've never worked on anything
that bored me.

00:30:00.015 --> 00:30:01.915
So I think that's a motive.

00:30:01.915 --> 00:30:04.527
MICHAL SEGALOV: So another thing
that I must ask-- there

00:30:04.527 --> 00:30:06.190
aren't a lot of women
entrepreneurs.

00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:07.956
You must realize that
looking around you.

00:30:07.956 --> 00:30:10.450
What do you think the reasons
are for that?

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:14.390
YAEL KAROV: So that's right,
unfortunately.

00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:21.480
I think the reason is mainly
because many women decide they

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:28.150
want a family and a career
balance that would be broken

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:29.950
if they start their
own company.

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:32.240
They see how hard entrepreneurs

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:33.350
work, and this is true.

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:36.050
You really must work
extremely hard.

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:39.930
And I think many women are
afraid that it's going to

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:43.620
wound family life or
their motherhood.

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:46.850
And I can really understand
this concern.

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:50.020
But I really think that it
is possible to do the

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:51.930
two things at once.

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:52.560
It's difficult.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:55.805
It's not easy, but I think
it's possible to do it.

00:30:55.805 --> 00:30:57.160
MICHAL SEGALOV: So what
do you think are the

00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.078
most important things?

00:30:58.078 --> 00:31:00.373
You seem to have a great partner
by what you say.

00:31:00.373 --> 00:31:01.291
YAEL KAROV: Yeah, I do.

00:31:01.291 --> 00:31:01.750
Absolutely.

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:05.290
I feel extremely lucky
and thankful

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:06.470
to have now my husband.

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:11.040
I think it would be impossible
to do the balance very well

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.910
without him.

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:17.470
What do I think is important in
order to keep this balance?

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:21.130
I think first thing
is to build the

00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:23.710
infrastructures to your life.

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:28.150
So that means, first, at work,
you need to have a strong

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:34.140
management that can work and
proceed also without you.

00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:40.960
And at home, you need to build
the things that will be able

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.350
to run without you.

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:45.410
Except, of course, with time
with your husband or your

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:47.005
kids, that is an
emotional time.

00:31:47.005 --> 00:31:50.850
But any practical, I think,
task in life, I think it's

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:53.420
possible to organize your life
such that you reduce your

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:57.410
practical stuff and just save
yourself all these hours of

00:31:57.410 --> 00:31:58.780
practical things.

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:02.550
And I feel, also, I have a very
good support system when

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:03.960
unexpected things come up.

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:08.950
So I think my mother, my
husband's mother, our

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:11.514
babysitters group-- we have
maybe eight of them.

00:32:11.514 --> 00:32:13.418
It's a whole support system.

00:32:13.418 --> 00:32:14.846
DANA GABEL: You could
make another company

00:32:14.846 --> 00:32:15.798
in parallel, no?

00:32:15.798 --> 00:32:16.750
YAEL KAROV: Absolutely.

00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:19.505
And I think it's helpful,
actually, to learn from how to

00:32:19.505 --> 00:32:23.970
manage a high-tech company to
how to manage your private

00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:26.933
life with people that are
responsible in different

00:32:26.933 --> 00:32:28.352
aspects of your life.

00:32:28.352 --> 00:32:29.771
DANA GABEL: Which
one is easier?

00:32:29.771 --> 00:32:32.610
YAEL KAROV: Which
one is easier?

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:35.235
Actually, I imagine home
is much easier.

00:32:35.235 --> 00:32:36.484
DANA GABEL: OK.

00:32:36.484 --> 00:32:37.438
[INAUDIBLE].

00:32:37.438 --> 00:32:38.551
MICHAL SEGALOV: Are you
super organized?

00:32:38.551 --> 00:32:41.254
How do you do that?

00:32:41.254 --> 00:32:43.970
YAEL KAROV: It's a tricky
question, because I think I'm

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:46.920
super organized on
infrastructures and whatever

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:49.410
needs to be sold offline.

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:53.702
So I will look at any problem,
doesn't matter if it's a

00:32:53.702 --> 00:32:56.850
private problem or if at work.

00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:59.770
We think it through and think
how to make the infrastructure

00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:02.760
so that things in the future
will work in an easier way.

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:06.740
But I'm a very intuitive
person that

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:08.400
improvises all the time.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:09.370
And I'm late all the time.

00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:11.920
And I'm making changes
all the time.

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:15.480
So I'm not super organized in
that sense, in the sense of--

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:19.110
Like I always lose my house
keys and wallet and so on.

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:21.980
It's not in this sense that are
super-organized people.

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:24.190
DANA GABEL: It's more in
building for the future--

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:24.850
YAEL KAROV: Yeah.

00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:27.770
So it's more analytical.

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:30.650
Just treating every problem,
it doesn't matter which

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:31.520
problem, analytically.

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:35.520
So just looking at, how do
they do it in the past?

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:36.740
How other people do it?

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:37.260
What should I learn?

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:40.980
And just design the optimal
solution and execute it.

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:42.962
DANA GABEL: It's very similar
to what you have to do at

00:33:42.962 --> 00:33:43.620
work, right?

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:45.085
Solve very hard problems.

00:33:45.085 --> 00:33:46.390
It's almost the same.

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:48.790
YAEL KAROV: It's very
similar actually.

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:53.196
DANA GABEL: So you're becoming
a role model for women, in

00:33:53.196 --> 00:33:54.887
Israel at least, probably
not just.

00:33:54.887 --> 00:33:58.305
Did you have any role models
when you grew up?

00:33:58.305 --> 00:33:59.290
YAEL KAROV: Thanks.

00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:02.990
Firstly, I must say that I feel
I still need to do my big

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:04.480
success before I become
a role model.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:07.930
But even before that, having
a role model--

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:11.435
the place I grew in and the time
I grew in, there was no

00:34:11.435 --> 00:34:13.909
internet, there was
no TV for me.

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:18.350
I didn't even read newspapers,
so I didn't know about--

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:21.130
certainly not about any
women in high tech.

00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:24.109
I didn't even know about
men in high tech

00:34:24.109 --> 00:34:25.570
until after my twenties.

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:29.600
So I didn't have any
technological role models.

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:33.108
My role models were more Gandhi
and Mother Teresa,

00:34:33.108 --> 00:34:37.260
those people who made a huge
social revolution, because

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:38.621
they were idealists.

00:34:38.621 --> 00:34:42.510
So those certainly were
my role models.

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:44.710
MICHAL SEGALOV: So how did you
get excited about technology

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:47.760
if it was so unfamiliar?

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:51.280
YAEL KAROV: It started when I
was, I think, 15 or 16 years

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:57.690
old that I found some book of
the Open University by David

00:34:57.690 --> 00:34:58.140
[INAUDIBLE].

00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:02.630
And it was a completely
theoretical computer science

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:04.710
book that really excited me.

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:07.370
And then when I went to study
mathematics and computer

00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:11.630
science, I got immediately
excited about AI, which is not

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:13.340
a very fashionable term today.

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:15.200
But AI algorithms.

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:19.470
It was a very clear and
immediate excitement for me.

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:22.100
So it was clear to me when I
finished studying that I would

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:27.190
look for a company that solved
hard problems with interesting

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.820
algorithms.

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:28.820
And that's what I did.

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:30.040
That's how I got to
Click Software,

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.910
and it started there.

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:34.820
MICHAL SEGALOV: So did
you deliberately

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:36.325
select a smaller company?

00:35:36.325 --> 00:35:37.782
YAEL KAROV: Yes.

00:35:37.782 --> 00:35:41.620
I totally didn't care about
terms, [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:46.640
anything like that or any
comfortable factor.

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:51.290
I only looked for a product or
for a company that develops a

00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:54.625
product with the most
interesting algorithms for me.

00:35:58.442 --> 00:35:58.908
I'm sorry.

00:35:58.908 --> 00:36:01.704
I forgot what you asked
after that.

00:36:01.704 --> 00:36:02.636
MICHAL SEGALOV: If
you deliberately

00:36:02.636 --> 00:36:03.570
wanted to go to a smaller--

00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:04.130
YAEL KAROV: Ah, yes.

00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:11.170
And I absolutely felt that I
match a small company better

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:13.480
than a big company, because
I felt I would be able to

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:14.980
influence small.

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:18.214
And also, it's very difficult
for me to deal with

00:36:18.214 --> 00:36:19.464
bureaucracy.

00:36:23.395 --> 00:36:24.330
I looked for a small company.

00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:26.765
MICHAL SEGALOV: And--
oh, sorry.

00:36:26.765 --> 00:36:29.410
DANA GABEL: Did you ever
get really good advice?

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:30.890
And who gave it to you?

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:33.260
YAEL KAROV: So it wasn't
personal advice to me, but I

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:40.210
think the advice of Steve Jobs
to Stanford graduates was

00:36:40.210 --> 00:36:43.040
probably the best speech
I ever heard.

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:45.670
And what he said is really
follow your heart.

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:48.075
Do only the things
you believe in.

00:36:48.075 --> 00:36:53.780
And don't work with the goal for
10 years or 20 years from

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:57.915
now and manage your career
logically towards this goal.

00:36:57.915 --> 00:37:02.050
But follow your heart at
every point you have.

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:05.300
Eventually, all points
will be connected.

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:08.510
When you look back, you will
see that everything you did

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:12.410
served the goal you
really wanted.

00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:13.370
I really believe in that.

00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:15.280
That's exactly what I did.

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:18.240
And the reason it's very helpful
for me is also because

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:21.990
it encourages people to
only do things that

00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:23.090
they believe in.

00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:25.430
And sometimes it's very
difficult, because you have

00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:29.750
opinions of many people around
you that tell you different

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:31.165
things from your beliefs.

00:37:31.165 --> 00:37:36.910
And I turn back to his speech
and his advice every time I'm

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:40.595
in a dilemma with whether to
follow my heart and beliefs or

00:37:40.595 --> 00:37:42.600
the advice of other people.

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:45.950
So of course, in many cases,
it's very good to listen to

00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:47.800
other people and to follow
their advice.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:51.130
But then your heart changes,
and you already want to do

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:53.880
what you heard from them,
because they explain

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:55.960
themselves, and you change
what you want.

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:58.440
And that's easy, of course,
if you listen and learn.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:01.780
But when consistently you feel
that even though you heard

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:05.146
everyone and really listened to
them, you still believe in

00:38:05.146 --> 00:38:07.794
a different thing, I think
you should do it.

00:38:07.794 --> 00:38:09.810
MICHAL SEGALOV: Is this how
you know to move on?

00:38:09.810 --> 00:38:11.507
How do you know when it's
time to go and move

00:38:11.507 --> 00:38:12.365
to a different company?

00:38:12.365 --> 00:38:12.937
YAEL KAROV: Yeah.

00:38:12.937 --> 00:38:17.260
It's absolutely forming on
intuition and the stomach when

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:20.052
I feel my passion is
not there anymore.

00:38:20.052 --> 00:38:25.410
And it's difficult to make me
lose my passion, because I

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:28.180
stayed at each company I worked
in at least five years.

00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:34.540
And I always went through a lot
of crisis modes and that

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:36.990
this is not a reason
for me to run away.

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:43.230
But when I feel that I'm not
completely in love with the

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:46.709
goal I'm working for, then
this will hopefully

00:38:46.709 --> 00:38:48.665
[INAUDIBLE].

00:38:48.665 --> 00:38:52.577
DANA GABEL: Do you want to
give advice to the young

00:38:52.577 --> 00:38:54.533
people at the beginning
of their career,

00:38:54.533 --> 00:38:56.930
especially young women?

00:38:56.930 --> 00:39:00.290
YAEL KAROV: I think it's divided
to two, which is--

00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:01.330
The first thing is
for everyone.

00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:03.000
I think really follow
your heart.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.860
Go to work not in the
environment you think that

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:10.670
practically works the best for
you or looking at your

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:12.540
benefits and so on.

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:14.610
Go to the place that excites
you the most.

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:17.930
Eventually, also, if this is the
case, you will be good at

00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:20.270
what you are doing, and
everything will

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:21.550
work well for you.

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:24.800
And the second advice is
specifically for women.

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:30.300
I think that if you think that
you really want-- not everyone

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:33.600
wants to-- but if you really
want to do your own ideas and

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:36.690
to start a company, and you're
afraid that it will not work

00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:41.190
with being new mothers-- and I
really want to tell women that

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:44.640
I think it is possible to be a
very good mother-- and also

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:45.450
with quantity.

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:48.400
It's the number of hours you
spend with your kid, not just

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:49.890
quality time--

00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:54.376
and to be very devoted
to your company.

00:39:54.376 --> 00:39:56.128
It's possible to combine it.

00:39:56.128 --> 00:39:59.280
MICHAL SEGALOV: How do you
maintain your technical

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:02.640
credibility and technical
involvement while being a CEO

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.560
of a company?

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.855
YAEL KAROV: I'm a very technical
CEO, so I really

00:40:06.855 --> 00:40:11.910
work on the technological
problems and the algorithms

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:12.890
and hands-on.

00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:16.850
I'm also the Chief Scientific
Officer of the company.

00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:22.750
So I'm really working almost on
every project and problem

00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:24.332
we have together with
the people.

00:40:24.332 --> 00:40:27.940
I think I have excellent
people.

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:34.470
And in the company, like in my
own life, I try not to work on

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:37.890
anything operative or technical,
legal, finance, all

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:42.380
that, or even the very technical
aspects of business

00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:46.940
development, but to do devote
significant time to product

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:49.224
and technology.

00:40:49.224 --> 00:40:51.704
DANA GABEL: Michal, do you want
to ask the last question?

00:40:51.704 --> 00:40:52.696
MICHAL SEGALOV: No.

00:40:52.696 --> 00:40:53.192
[INAUDIBLE]

00:40:53.192 --> 00:40:54.690
DANA GABEL: We're good?

00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:54.960
OK.

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:55.980
YAEL KAROV: Thank you.

00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:57.462
DANA GABEL: So Yael,

00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:04.700
