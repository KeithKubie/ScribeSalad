1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.980
The Joe Rogan experience for sure in boxing too.
Yeah.

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.690
You know in boxing it used to be thought that you pretty much,
you know,

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.200
if you went to a good trainer they would teach you to keep your hands up.

4
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.700
Those always the way to box,
but then you get to a level of like a Tommy Hearns.

5
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.360
Remember the way Tommy Hearns used to fight?
He used to keep his left hand low,

6
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.370
really low down in the side hand cocked and he would snap that left hand at you

7
00:00:26.371 --> 00:00:31.080
like a fucking like us.
Colebra man is crap motor city Cobra.

8
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.150
He would just pop that fucker right in your face.

9
00:00:33.151 --> 00:00:35.430
That's why they used to call them that because it was coming out of fucking

10
00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:39.210
nowhere.
Hitman,
Tommy Hearns,
he was a bad mother fucker dude.

11
00:00:39.211 --> 00:00:42.750
And then he would hit you with that right hand and he had so much torque as he

12
00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:46.880
was a really wide,
he was really long and wide for a welterweight manly.

13
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.570
Look at him at 147 pounds.

14
00:00:48.571 --> 00:00:53.170
I think he was probably like six two and just shred it,
hijacked and just crying.

15
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.250
And 47 at six two is lightweight champ.

16
00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.210
You're see what he looked like when he fought sugar ray Leonard.
Oh my God.
Yeah.

17
00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:04.260
And then he went up to one 16 foot Hagler and got code by Hagler and a crazy

18
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.700
slugfest.
You never saw that.
Fine.

19
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.220
Pull up Marvin Hagler versus Thomas Hearns.
This might've been the great,

20
00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:12.480
I think it went two rounds,

21
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.630
but it might've been the greatest two rounds in the history of the middle weight

22
00:01:15.631 --> 00:01:18.750
division because these two guys were super skilled.
I mean,

23
00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:21.510
Marvin Hagler was a brilliant technical boxer,

24
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.300
can switch from south pod orthodox like fluidly.
Like you,

25
00:01:26.301 --> 00:01:27.390
you didn't even notice a difference.

26
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.290
He fought just as good from both sides and he knocked everybody out and an iron

27
00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:34.320
chin.
And Tommy Hearns was mark and motherfuckers.
He merch,

28
00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:39.240
Roberto Duran with one punch.
It's blocked face planted on fucking one punch,
man.

29
00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:42.870
He's,
he stung him with one shot and the,
let me let them see that first.

30
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.620
Here's the buildup.
The buildup is Tommy Hearns.

31
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.270
[inaudible] Roberto Duran.

32
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.730
Let's watch that first and then we're going to go back to Marvin Hagler versus

33
00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:57.210
Tommy Hearns.
So you get a feel for what it was like to be able to switch up.

34
00:01:57.211 --> 00:02:00.570
Their stances is so crazy to me to be able to do that so fluidly.
That will,

35
00:02:00.571 --> 00:02:03.180
that's one of the brilliant things about Hagler.

36
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.640
I mean he was just so good at that and he could buy,

37
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.860
it's weird for a guy when you're used to,

38
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.900
I remember the first time I fought a guy who was left handed.

39
00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:13.080
It was super confusing.
Everything's coming from the wrong place.

40
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.750
Everything was like reversed.
You got to get used to it.

41
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.700
You don't see it as often.
Right?

42
00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:20.220
So if you don't see it as often and sometimes it's more effective,

43
00:02:20.221 --> 00:02:22.380
but some guys were really good against southpaws.

44
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.700
Some guys have like a lightening right hand and that was one of the speculations

45
00:02:26.701 --> 00:02:31.410
about Hagler and Hearns cause Hearns had this lightening right hand and Hagler

46
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.630
oftentimes fought south part.
And that's the counter for south,
Huh?
Is A,

47
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.660
is a straight right.
Now Watch this though.

48
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.170
This is just goes to show you how God look how big he is too.

49
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.620
[inaudible]
he's playing that again.
Look at this.
Oh,

50
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.710
come on,
man.
When Tommy Hearns Merck people,

51
00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:54.690
he marked people and you've got to understand,
man,
he did this to Roberto Duran.

52
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.130
That's fast in slow motion too.
And he was so fast,
fast,

53
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.740
even in fucking slow motion.
He was so fast and he hits so hard,

54
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.130
but now you've got gotta watch this,
and this is Hagler in his prime.

55
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.670
He was 30 years old who was the undisputed mother fucking middleweight champion

56
00:03:10.671 --> 00:03:10.991
of the world,

57
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:13.510
and most people thought he was the best pound for pound fighter on earth.

58
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.460
And Tommy Hearns of course you just saw what he did to Roberto Duran and it was

59
00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:22.000
a lot of speculation,
a lot of speculation coming into this fight.

60
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.030
And they just went at it from the beginning of the round.

61
00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:29.950
There was very little Philips,
just constant pressure by Hagler,
right?
Hooks,
boom,

62
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.860
boom.
We look at this bro.
They,
they're going to war.

63
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.580
These are two of the best fucking middleweights ever,

64
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.940
and they're standing in front of each other going to war,

65
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.480
and it doesn't feel like anybody's faced.
It feels like there's,

66
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.890
it feels like they're at the exact same energy level too.
Oh Dude.

67
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:49.270
Like both of them are,
they have the same output look fucking crazy fight Matt.

68
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.660
They were for throwing full power shots from the moment the fight started and

69
00:03:55.241 --> 00:03:58.270
they right in front of each other man.
And for Hearns this,

70
00:03:58.271 --> 00:04:02.250
this negates is gigantic reach advantage over almost everybody.
Yeah.

71
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.970
So Hearns decided to fight this way.
He decided to stand right and look at him.

72
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.650
The referee can barely separated them.

73
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.220
Hers decided to stand right in front of Hagler and haggard decided to have right

74
00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:14.470
in front of her aunts and they just,
and now Hearns is moving.

75
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.250
See now this is what Hearns could have done from the beginning and made it

76
00:04:18.251 --> 00:04:22.030
interesting.
Sticking and moving.
But by the time he decided to do that,

77
00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:25.690
he was already touched up and Marvin starts moving in for the kill that left

78
00:04:25.691 --> 00:04:26.530
hand to the body.

79
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.820
And Hagler was relentless in his cardio was fucking supreme.

80
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.220
It was supreme.
He always put pressure on people and you couldn't hurt him.

81
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.090
He only had one bullshit knocked down his entire career as a bullshit knockdown.

82
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.720
He fought,
I think it was one role,
Dan and won role.
Dan kind of like,

83
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.340
it was more like a shove and maybe maybe they tripped or something like that and

84
00:04:48.341 --> 00:04:52.270
the referee called it a down.
But I remember thinking,
God dammit,

85
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.040
cause Hagler had a weird thing that he was either born with or developed.

86
00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.280
He had giant muscles on the side of his head.

87
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.930
Like he buys temple's torn with headgear.
I'm not bullshitting.

88
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.150
They had them animal with a helmet on.

89
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.210
This was like a big thing in the world of sports back in the day like that.

90
00:05:10.211 --> 00:05:14.980
He was literally almost born for this.
That's how good Hagler was.
Yeah.

91
00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:17.200
These motherfuckers are really,
I mean it's relentless dude.
They're,

92
00:05:17.201 --> 00:05:18.850
they're towed up every time it's up there,

93
00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:22.030
barely looking for any distance between each other.
And you've got to realize,

94
00:05:22.031 --> 00:05:23.860
man,
this is not how people usually fight.

95
00:05:23.861 --> 00:05:26.290
They don't throw full power shots every shot.

96
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.320
I mean they'd be tired within 15 seconds.
These guys are just going at it.

97
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.140
So I think this was like almost like a game of chicken.

98
00:05:32.141 --> 00:05:35.050
Like both of them knew they were never going to reach the 12th round.
Right.

99
00:05:35.051 --> 00:05:36.910
So they said,
fuck it,
let's just do this.

100
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.960
And haggard just stood right in front of them,
constantly blast and them.

101
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.110
And you see at the end of the first round,
Hearns is wilting.

102
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.920
He just does not have the power or the speed or the movement.
See,
he's all goofy.

103
00:05:48.921 --> 00:05:52.030
Yeah,
he's sloppy out,
exhausted.
He's exhausted.

104
00:05:52.031 --> 00:05:56.870
But still the warrior in him is making him throw these fucking bombs,
man,
you've,

105
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.560
you got to realize like at the time of no one really knew what the fuck was

106
00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:03.500
going to happen in this fight.
And then Hagler heard them.
Yeah.

107
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.680
There's a little stumble in one of one of hagglers incredible attributes besides

108
00:06:08.681 --> 00:06:11.750
the skill was his determination to win.
Man,

109
00:06:11.751 --> 00:06:15.950
he was just ferocious competitor,
man.
Just ferocious.

110
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.430
And so if someone was willing to engage him in this kind of crazy fight,

111
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.060
we're going to stand toe to toe and see who's the bigger man.
Oh my God,

112
00:06:23.061 --> 00:06:26.460
everyone's going to die.
[inaudible]

113
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:30.290
AG is going to take you to the end of the earth man to the end of the earth.

114
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.910
I mean,
haggler just looked like he just had,
it's still so much left in the tank.

115
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.520
Even at the end of the first rounds,
we can do this for years.

116
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.120
He's never out of shape.
He never partied.
He never did anything stupid.

117
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.920
He didn't want any nomination.
No,
never got fat.
No drugs,
no alcohol,
no nothing.

118
00:06:45.921 --> 00:06:46.754
No.
And how about this?

119
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.830
Retired after the sugar ray Leonard fight lost a controversial decisions.

120
00:06:50.831 --> 00:06:54.680
Sugaring Leonard that to this day,
I think he won.
And then,

121
00:06:54.681 --> 00:06:55.520
but it was a close fight,

122
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.970
but and then just retired and became a fucking movie star in Italy.

123
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.120
That's fucking wild.
Love Dot Chi.
Yeah,
but that's the way to do it.

124
00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:04.100
How kind of go out of the good prime and then just say goodnight.

125
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.030
Nobody else did it like him,
man.
Nobody else did it.
Like,
yeah,
that's the,

126
00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:10.670
you heard him now he's just moving in for the kill.

127
00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.130
You're moving in for the kill now he's taking his time.
Yeah.

128
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.640
So now it's just nice and relaxed.
This is inevitable.
Now,

129
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.060
Marvin is just moving in and decide and when he's going to uncork,

130
00:07:20.061 --> 00:07:23.660
when he's going to uncork moving in,
blocking these shots,
he knows it.

131
00:07:23.661 --> 00:07:26.390
Hearns is hurt and he starts teeing them up.

132
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.290
Dan Chan and hurts is try to move down.

133
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.150
See now that's how I thought Hearns was going to fight and Mo,

134
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.150
most people thought he was going to fight from the beginning.

135
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:39.020
Like that just moved from the outside.
Staying up from the outside like that.

136
00:07:39.021 --> 00:07:39.670
I mean that's,

137
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:44.570
that's classic Thomas Hearns but the warrior in him wanting to find out,

138
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:49.760
you know,
you want to find out who's the baddest motherfucker in town,
who is it?

139
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.730
You know,
you could fit you and you can feel him backing up.
Kind of.

140
00:07:53.731 --> 00:07:55.820
He knows what's kind of,
it's almost like he knows what's coming.

141
00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.240
He's getting in some good shots.
Even that he's,
you know,
creating distance.

142
00:07:59.241 --> 00:08:00.080
But even still,

143
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.920
it just doesn't feel like he's balanced and Hagler stand right there of them.

144
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:04.553
He's hurting them now.

145
00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.670
Haggler standing right in front of him when he is touching him,
but he's,

146
00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.470
he just doesn't have the pop anymore.

147
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.020
You know what it's like when you're working out and at the end of the workout

148
00:08:12.021 --> 00:08:15.080
you're fucking exhausted and you could barely do one rep.

149
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:18.780
That's what happens with your arms when you're fighting.
There's just,
they just,

150
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.010
there's nothing left.
There's nothing left.
It's not like,
you know,

151
00:08:22.011 --> 00:08:24.990
he's doing this on purpose.
Right.
He's,
he doesn't have it.

152
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.810
There's no gas in his arms.
Like his arms are completely flooded right now.

153
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:33.260
Like all the blood in them and every,
it's just,
they're not recovering.

154
00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:37.010
It's a horrible feeling to he swinging though.
Look,
he swinging,

155
00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.680
but it's way slower than it was in the first round.
Right.

156
00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:42.440
His snap snap was so much quicker in the first round and now he's,

157
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:44.660
now he's not following through a little bit.
Exactly.

158
00:08:44.661 --> 00:08:48.260
He's trying to conserve energy.
You realize that you can't do this forever.

159
00:08:48.261 --> 00:08:51.350
He's exhausted,
but they both look like they're fucking at that one.

160
00:08:51.351 --> 00:08:54.740
That little breaking point where it's about to be either,
I'm telling you it,

161
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.470
even though he might,
it might look like that because it is a fast pace.

162
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.660
He could do this for years.
She's just take you to do this for years.

163
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:06.270
He just didn't get tired,
man,
and you couldn't hurt him was crazy.

164
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.280
He fought a dude named John the beast.
Mugabi and John the piecemeal.

165
00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.830
Gabi was fucking terrifying people,
man.
He starts Terry Norris.

166
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:17.190
He starts to a bunch of dudes.
He was a heavy puncher,

167
00:09:17.191 --> 00:09:22.191
heavy puncher and Hagler stood right in front of them and he got caught with one

168
00:09:22.471 --> 00:09:24.600
big upper cut and it didn't even budge.

169
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.050
Upper cuts that were like Merkin people didn't even,
he didn't even flinch.

170
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:30.360
So what round was it?
Is it the third round?

171
00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.300
The beginning of the 30th that's third row.
Here's the third round right here.

172
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.990
This just shows you how fucking tough Tommy Hearns was.
I mean,

173
00:09:36.991 --> 00:09:41.430
those two rounds were just fucking knock down.
Drag out relent.
Yeah,
just nonstop.

174
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:45.030
But towards the end you clearly see Hagos coming on.
I mean,
he looks good,

175
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:50.130
he looks good,
and he's pacing himself.
Now it's just,
just moving forward,

176
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:55.080
throwing shots.
But yeah.
Hearns is exhausted,
man.
It's fucking rough,
man.

177
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.330
There it is.
Boom,
boom,
boom.

178
00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:00.780
I'm just trying to keep trying to keep them right.

179
00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.720
He's having a hard time breathing though,
man.
I mean he's exhausted.

180
00:10:03.721 --> 00:10:08.150
See that big deep breath.
You take that big side.

181
00:10:08.151 --> 00:10:12.030
It's almost like not uh oh,
somebody lost them.
Miles piece I think.

182
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.680
Is that what it was?
He called his time.
Yeah.
I think that's what happened.

183
00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:20.070
I don't know man.
It's hard to tell.
It's really blurry for,

184
00:10:20.071 --> 00:10:23.010
it's just going to say Matt is two two 40 p was weird back then.

185
00:10:23.011 --> 00:10:26.250
How it look normal to us back then.
Your eyes knew how to handle it,
right?
Well,

186
00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:30.090
you were just excited that you could see the fight.
Right.
You know,
but this was,

187
00:10:30.091 --> 00:10:33.240
it was,
I wonder if this is what it looks like when it's on Hbo.
Had to been.

188
00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:37.530
I look a little better on those TVs.
Do you know Hbo just canceled boxing?

189
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:41.340
They don't have boxing anymore at all.
At all.
Just paper view.

190
00:10:41.341 --> 00:10:45.540
Now they don't even do paper view.
They're out of the boxing business.
What?
Yeah,

191
00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:50.340
in that crazy.
So they'll never [inaudible] is right here.
Oh,
oh and he's moving.

192
00:10:50.341 --> 00:10:54.720
Boom,
right hand.
Oh,
it's done set.
He knew it.
Damn.

193
00:10:54.721 --> 00:10:58.080
Dance it.
Third round gone.
I always miss this.

194
00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.670
I always think it's the second round.
For some reason.

195
00:10:59.671 --> 00:11:04.110
I think we've actually gone over this before,
but third round.
Yeah man.

196
00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:07.800
But I don't have boxing anymore.
HBS got out of the boxing business.

197
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.260
What do you think that's because of it's not earning enough money anymore?

198
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.960
I don't know.
It makes me sad though.

199
00:11:12.961 --> 00:11:16.260
They had some of the greatest boxing telecast of all time.

200
00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:18.300
I mean that was what you would do.
You'd go,

201
00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.820
if a big fight was on Bernard Hopkins was on,

202
00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:24.030
a lot of the times it was on HBO and it was on paper view,

203
00:11:24.031 --> 00:11:26.580
then you knew it was going to be on HP or the following week.
Right.

204
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.470
So even if you couldn't afford the pay per view,

205
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.350
you could see the hang in there a week later.
You knew who won,

206
00:11:31.351 --> 00:11:33.030
but you could watch the fight on HBO.
