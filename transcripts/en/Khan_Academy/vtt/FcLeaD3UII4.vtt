00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.210
Let's say that we
have capital F of x

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.420
as being equal to the
definite integral from pi

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.400
to x of cotangent
squared of t dt.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.450
And what we're
curious about finding

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.750
is the derivative
of this business.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.000
We want to figure out what
F prime of x is equal to.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.790
Well this is a
direct application

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.704
of the fundamental
theorem of calculus.

00:00:24.704 --> 00:00:26.870
This is just going to be
the derivative with respect

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.140
to x of all of this craziness.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.910
So let me just copy
and paste that.

00:00:33.624 --> 00:00:35.790
So it's just going to be
the derivative with respect

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.580
to that.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.740
And the fundamental
theorem of calculus

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:46.229
tells us that this is going to
be equal to just this function,

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:48.270
but it's not going to be
a function of t anymore.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.210
It's going to be
a function of x.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.330
So it's going to be equal
to cotangent squared of x.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.100
And you'll often see
problems like this

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.170
if you go to calculus
competitions or things

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.895
like that and, or
maybe certain exams.

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:04.790
And It's like, oh my god, I
have to take the antiderivative

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.859
of all of this
business, evaluate it

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:08.400
at the different
boundaries, and then

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.470
I got to take the derivative.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.970
No.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.510
You just apply the fundamental
theorem of calculus,

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.520
and it's actually a very
straightforward and a very fast

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.800
thing to do.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.650
Now let's mix it
up a little bit.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.260
Let's say that you
had the expression

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.240
the definite integral from
pi-- instead of from pi

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.654
to x, let's say it's
from pi to x squared--

00:01:28.654 --> 00:01:30.820
and let me write that x
squared in a different color

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:38.040
just to make it clear what I'm
doing-- from pi to x squared

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.720
of cotangent squared of t dt.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.380
And you wanted to take the
derivative of this business.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.050
So you want to take the
derivative with respect

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.020
to x of this business.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.430
How would you do it?

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.070
Well the recognition here is
that this is capital-- capital

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.910
F of x was defined as this.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.970
Now instead of an x,
you have an x squared.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.303
So this is the exact same
thing as taking the derivative

00:02:06.303 --> 00:02:12.740
with respect to x of
capital F of-- not x.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.970
That would be this.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.190
Instead, we have
capital F of x squared.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.100
Where we had an x here before,
we now have an x squared.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.910
You can verify.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.140
If you had capital
F of x squared,

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.720
every place where you saw the
x here would be an x squared.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.370
So it would look
exactly like this.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.580
And so we just have to
apply the chain rule.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:38.840
So this is going to be
equal to the derivative of F

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.341
with respect to x squared.

00:02:42.341 --> 00:02:44.340
And this is just straight
out of the chain rule.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.760
It's going to be F
prime of x squared

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.840
times the derivative with
respect to x of x squared.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.490
This is the derivative of
F with respect to x squared

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.300
and then times the derivative
of x squared with respect to x.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.610
This is just the chain
rule right over here.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.510
So what's F prime of x
squared-- the derivative of F

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.310
with respect to x squared?

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.710
Well, if you evaluate F prime
at x squared, instead of just

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.930
being cotangent
squared of x, it's

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.820
going to be cotangent
squared of x squared.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.890
So this part right over here,
this business right over here,

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.753
is going to be cotangent
squared of x squared.

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.770
So this is the derivative of all
of this business with respect

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.430
to x squared, and then you
have to multiply that times

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.720
the derivative of x squared with
respect to x, which is just 2x.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.000
So there you have it.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.940
The derivative of this,
all this craziness,

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.743
is equal to 2x cotangent
squared of x squared.
