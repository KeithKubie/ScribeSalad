00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.190
Making a movie is a difficult task, and directors
have to keep tabs on a multitude of elements

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:18.710
to keep the ship running. They’re so concerned
with the bigger picture that sometimes small

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.220
details slide under the cracks and go unnoticed
through the process. Even the best directors

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.689
aren’t perfect, and you’ll see why. To
add to our Movie Mistakes series, here are

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.099
Screen Rant’s 10 movie mistakes that made
the final cut.

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.990
Terminator 2: Judgment Day

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.200
James Cameron’s iconic sequel marked a leap
forward for visual effects technology, pioneering

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.270
CGI via the intimidating T-1000. His liquid
metal made him a dangerous threat, and even

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.010
the animators weren’t sure how to handle
him. When the T-800 and John Connor help Sarah

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.090
escape from the hospital, the T-1000 tries
to attack the elevator they’re in. Arnie

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.280
wards it off with a bullet to the head, but
if you watch closely, the T-1000’s head

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.879
begins to split open before the T-800 pulls
the trigger. Perhaps the T-1000 just had some

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.190
difficulties adjusting to the time travel.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.190
Fury

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.600
Brad Pitt’s tank crew in Fury are among
the most courageous soldiers in the military,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.150
but they’re also apparently time travelers.
Early in the film, there’s a shot inside

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.939
the tank that shows a quick glimpse of a cowgirl
pinup poster titled “Come And Get It.”

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:17.060
It looks appropriate for the time period enough,
but that particular poster was not made until

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.890
1959. That’s well after Fury’s World War
II set story takes place. Director David Ayer

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.700
put a lot of effort into capturing the look
and feel of a war-torn Europe, but this is

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.150
one area where he didn’t do solid research.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.470
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.409
Peter Jackson’s Hobbit trilogy built up
to this moment, and the band of dwarves didn’t

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.110
come prepared. When the group is getting ready
to defend Erebor, they’re shown putting

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.729
on suits of armor. But later, when King Thorin
has a change of heart and asks his friends

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.409
to follow him into battle once more, none
of the dwarves are wearing armor. They even

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.960
go into the climactic fight without any protection.
Continuity errors do happen, but this is a

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.469
colossal oversight by an Oscar winning director
who should have spotted the error of his ways.

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.619
If the dwarves were going to war, why did
they take the armor off?

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:00.619
Titanic

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.840
In a 3-hour epic, there are small errors that
are going to slip through, but this one was

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.619
almost comical. As lovers Jack and Rose try
to escape the sinking ship, a ship’s mate

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.440
tries to force Rose away with him to safety.
In an attempt to break free, Rose punches

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.681
him in the face, giving him a bloody nose.
Or so one would think. As the film cuts to

00:02:14.681 --> 00:02:18.599
the reaction of the man who was punched, his
face appears clean. It’s not until the actor

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.360
smears fake blood over his face does the effect
take place.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.720
Avengers: Age of Ultron

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.540
Marvel’s Avengers are Earth’s Mightiest
Heroes, but they’re no experts on proper

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.720
seaport regulations. When the action cuts
to Africa, the vessel Churchill in the salvage

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.390
yard has “Great Britain” listed as a registry
port. This doesn’t seem like a big deal,

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.739
but it is inaccurate. The ports are normally
listed as cities, not a country – or in

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.750
this case, an empire. Joss Whedon had so much
on his plate making this sequel, it’s understandable

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.069
how he missed it, but somebody overseeing
the production should have been able to point

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.560
it out and make the quick switch to Liverpool
or another English city.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.129
Terminator: Genisys

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:57.930
The Terminator series has played fast and
loose with time, even pushing forward Judgement

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.489
day's actual date a number of times. But one
thing that doesn't change is Skynet, the computer

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.010
system that triggered nuclear war by launching
America's nukes at all its enemies. To make

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.849
the scene even more chilling, Terminator Genisys
shows children watching as the missiles fly

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.400
by their airplane window, not realizing they're
watching the end of the world. It's a powerful

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.890
image, but an incorrect one. The ICBMs that
carry nuclear warheads like the ones shown

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.120
travel into low orbit on the way to their
targets. Since the plane is flying at a fraction

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.989
of that height, that must be one broken missile.

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.590
Star Wars Return Of The Jedi

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.590
Some errors are minute (my-noot) details that
are easy to overlook. Others are in plain

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.549
sight. During the capture of the Rebels by
the Ewoks in Return Of The Jedi, C3PO is seen

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.090
as a god for the tiny Endor inhabitants. There
is a quick shot of the Ewok tribe hailing

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.220
him as the heroes look around in disbelief.
A second look at that shot and we can clearly

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.849
see that one of the Ewok costumes has the
eyes missing and the actor’s face can be

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.030
seen behind the mask. How could nobody notice
this obvious mistake on set or in editing?

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.250
We’re still trying to figure this one out.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.470
The Shining

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.220
Stanley Kubrick sets up the isolation of the
Overlook Hotel in The Shining’s opening

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.849
sequence, showcasing a vast building that’s
all by itself on a hill. One exterior shot

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:07.540
clearly shows the hotel facing a slope with
cars parked along the outside. Viewers were

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.930
probably too engrossed in the horror to realize
that the film’s famous hedge maze is nowhere

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.030
to be seen in those opening moments, yet it’s
there at the hotel in the end. Kubrick was

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.269
a director known for his attention to detail,
so it’s surprising that he never noticed

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.190
this and amended the mistake during his hours
of filming.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.800
The Dark Knight Rises

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.030
Christopher Nolan changed superhero cinema
with his Dark Knight trilogy, so he should

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.910
have gotten himself a proofreader. In a scene
where Bruce Wayne is investigating cat burglar

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.580
Selina Kyle, he pulls up a newspaper report
covering one of her robberies. The large-print

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.509
headline reveals that she was behind a jewel
“hiest” (HEEST) instead of a jewel heist.

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:44.430
It’s true that typos happen – even in
the real world – but with so many people

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.040
looking over the footage before the film got
to theaters, you’d think someone would be

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.130
able to point that out and save the Gotham
newspaper from losing its credibility.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.130
The Wizard of Oz

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.199
Of all the famous images in The Wizard of
Oz, few are as recognizable as Dorothy’s

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:01.410
ruby red slippers that she wears when she
goes off to see the wizard. But she brought

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.160
some extra footwear with her for the journey.
During a sequence where the Scarecrow tries

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.229
to show Dorothy how to get some apples, a
shot shows Dorothy wearing plain black shoes

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.419
instead of the iconic red slippers. Since
there’s a stark contrast between the two,

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:16.419
it’s hard to see how this was missed. Dorothy’s
slippers clearly stand out, and one can certainly

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:17.419
tell when they’re missing.

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:18.419
So what do you think of our list?

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.610
Which mistakes can you not believe ended up
in the final cut?
