00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500
On average, over 800,000 people kill
themselves every year around the world.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:12.540
Suicide is the 15th leading cause of mortality accounting for some 1.5% of all deaths.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.520
More people die by suicide than are collectively murdered, die in traffic accidents,

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.320
or are killed by animals.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.260
It remains entirely strange then that through the media we should hear so much about killers

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.340
and so little about those who take their own lives,

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.620
and judged by the statistical risks, we have, far more to fear from embarking on a love affair,

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:38.180
which may lead to the suicide of one of the parties if things go wrong, than we do from sharks.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.300
According to the data from the OECD club of developed nations, the causes of suicide breakdown as follows:

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.500
45% are estimated to be physiologically based, to do with imbalances in brain chemistry,

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.320
but the other 55% are judged to be psychologically based, with people taking their lives because of:

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:03.180
grief about that romantic love, financial/career failure, humiliation/shame/status/disgrace,

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.280
loss of hope and direction/despair, other.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.060
Suicide is the supreme reminder of our intense psychological vulnerability,

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.800
and of the deep difficulties we have in communicating this vulnerability to others,

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.300
and so, of creating communities imbued with the right, life-saving sort of attitudes.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.240
Governments in the wealthy nations tend, overwhelmingly,

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.820
to direct their efforts to dealing with poverty, illness, and aging.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.680
Suicide alerts us to a stranger problem we have: the scale of our psychological torment,

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.320
the extent of the fragility of our minds, which cannot necessarily be fixed by more money or consumer goods.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:48.400
From the causes of suicide we learn how intensely we need: love, self acceptance, meaning, hope,

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.980
status, pride, and forgiveness.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.680
These seven qualities are no luxuries; they can save lives.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.200
It's literature that has, perhaps more than any other medium, alerted as to how much these qualities matter.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.040
In 1856, in Gustave Flaubert's novel, Madame Bovary, a young mother commits suicide with arsenic

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.680
because she's been shamed by her community because of her romantic and financial transgressions.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.740
We learned from this that: to survive we need respect and forgiveness.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:24.560
In 1599, in William Shakespeare's Hamlet, Ophelia chooses to die rather than live without a beloved Hamlet.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.400
We learn from this that: to survive we need love and mechanisms for coping with its loss.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.300
In 1877, in Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, the hero, Levin, contemplates suicide keeping a rope in his office

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.180
because he's lost any sense of meaning and direction.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.520
From this we learn that: to survive we need purpose and significance.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.680
What makes many suicides so bewildering is the element of surprise.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.020
We may have known that a certain person had troubles, we didn't imagine them on that scale.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.040
But surprise is evidence of an unwitting neglect of one another, and of ourselves.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.940
We're reluctant to accord our psychological needs the centrality they deserve.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.460
Here is the philosopher, Arthur Schopenhauer, considering the matter in 1818:

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.240
"We should always be mindful of the fact that no man is ever very far from the state

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.500
in which he would readily want to seize a sword or poison in order to bring his existence to an end."

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.340
It's telling that some countries have higher rates of suicide than others.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:30.120
In Kuwait, the rate is close to zero or not 0.1 per 100,000 people, whereas in India and France it's closer to ten;

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:37.140
in Japan, its distinctly higher at 17.9 and China has the highest rate of all at 25.6.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.800
The numbers suggest that: while no society can eliminate grief,

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.880
there is much to do around the interpretation and acceptance of difficulty

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.280
which can lessen the risks of suicide.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.800
Societies with low suicide rates have a greater acceptance of failure,

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.400
a higher role for forgiveness, and a status system that honors intrinsic value over achievement.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.880
Suicide is the greatest symbol we have of the sheer difficulty of being human,

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.320
and its existence continues to surprise us is a sign that

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:10.040
there are much greater levels of distress at large than we're normally ready to countenance.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.600
Still, only a tiny proportion of the population do ever commit suicide,

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.480
but that some do so is evidence of the scale of hidden anguish;

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.100
it's a proof of how very fragile we all are, and therefore,

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.220
how we owe each other and ourselves so much more compassion and we currently tend to give.
