00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.570
So how do you handle
setbacks at the company now?

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.844
&gt;&gt; One of the best pieces of
management advice that I've ever read,

00:00:07.844 --> 00:00:11.897
actually my cofounder Dan spoke
with Dick Coslow at Twitter.

00:00:11.897 --> 00:00:15.650
And Dick said something that has
stuck with me ever since, and

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.911
it's that the hardest thing about
management is making everyone else

00:00:19.911 --> 00:00:22.020
understand what you understand.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.564
And when you think about this from
a problem solving context, first of all,

00:00:26.564 --> 00:00:28.810
there are always problems.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.850
There's always something blowing up or
something going wrong, and

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.870
it's really hard as a growing manager,
I'd never had any experience doing this.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.086
My cofounder hadn't either.

00:00:39.086 --> 00:00:42.242
It's a really, really difficult
thing to train yourself to,

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:46.243
when something goes really wrong, don't
try and solve the problem yourself.

00:00:46.243 --> 00:00:50.891
Instead think of your job as getting
everybody else to understand as much as

00:00:50.891 --> 00:00:52.675
they can about the problem.

00:00:52.675 --> 00:00:57.539
And so, you might think that your job as
a leader is to sort of present a happy

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.659
face and make it seem like everything's
rosy all the time to motivate people.

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:04.369
But it's actually not the job,

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.914
the job is to make everybody as aware
of the problems as possible and

00:01:07.914 --> 00:01:10.844
to help get them rallied
around solving them instead.

00:01:10.844 --> 00:01:14.391
And so that means confronting things
openly, being aware of reality and

00:01:14.391 --> 00:01:17.370
trying to communicate as much as
you can with the team about it
