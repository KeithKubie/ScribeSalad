Video one: candle tomato. Video two coming up banana bottle.

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.140
This is the Phantom V25 11

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.880
this is the ultra slow motion workforce for Smarter Every Day -

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.818
- and sometimes on the Slow Mo Guys -

00:00:12.818 --> 00:00:15.059
this camera can record at two-thirds of a million frames per second

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.399
But you'll notice there's no microphone on it so the question we always get in the comments is how do you record sound,

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.010
so slow? Do you do it at an ultrasonic frequency or something like that? And the answer is: no.

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.268
Welcome back to the garage where we shoot stuff and do fun things. There's a question

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.659
I always get on Smarter Every Day when I do a slow-motion video

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.180
And it's: how did you record the sound? Did you

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:43.529
record the sound with the camera and then play it back? A lot of people don't realize that when you're recording with slow motion

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.410
It's just images so today, Gordon

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:51.899
from Canada the guy that does all the magic with a slow motion is actually here

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.269
Thank you for coming Gordon for having me all right, so I'm gonna challenge you today you up for that

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:04.499
Yeah, so you know nothing about what we're gonna do correct. No, okay, so we have a gun we've got some stuff here

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.470
I'm gonna record several things in slow motion

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.220
And then let Gordon walk you through what it's like to design slow motion sound because you do that for pretty much every Smarter Every Day with

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:21.209
Slow motion right yeah, yeah, and you're good at it. Unless there's good voice over over top or something. Yeah. Yeah, okay cool, so

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.820
challenge number one a

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:25.240
rifle

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.680
Going to be putting out a candle. What do you think about that? GORDON: That would be great so,

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.430
We are gonna record the sound because one of the questions we always get is

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.040
Can you just record the sounds real time and slow it down the answer is no, which we'll explain later

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.930
Three two one oh it didn't go out

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.540
That makes your sound harder. Yeah, okay it moved like

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.869
The flame moved, but it didn't go out so you can make sound for that right? GORDON: We can make sense for that

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.659
DESTIN: Oh wait, look at that it went all the way out go all the way out

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.890
That was high speed challenge number one rollin. What are you doing? Well, so we're doing some science

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.059
Yeah, I thought we could probably learn a lot of things by

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.820
Coring this tomato and putting an M 90 in it which is ten bigger than an m-80?

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:27.369
What are these units do you know so this is the M 90 I didn't even know M 90s were a thing... GORDON: neither did I

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.619
All right, they're super illegal in Canada really well probably not super

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.419
I've I have messed around with them, but I think they were brought up from Mexico somehow

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.220
We need to protect ourselves from the oh

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.250
Wow, so you're just gonna. I'm gonna get it right in there. Oh the fuse coming out the top though

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.750
I print do we have to be careful not to wet the fuse probably I orders gunpowder not care

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.229
I don't think he cares. Okay, so what are you doing here? Oh?

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:03.459
Oh, you're gonna. You're gonna put it out the top. Yeah. I want it and you're gonna put the plug back in the bottom. I

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.960
Guess we could huh?

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.560
I came to Alabama for new experiences

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.060
It's like a birthday tomato

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.060
(laughs)

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.240
blam!

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.540
What do you think?
-yeah, not sure about (inaudible) there?

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.019
Or how like how much the tomato's gonna cushion the blow do you want me to do it?

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.180
I'll totally do it you guys are around a lot more exploding things than me, and if you think that is a safe

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.920
I'll go first and you gotta promise me you're gonna make amazing slow-mo sound for this

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.239
I'll spend a little extra time on this really yeah promise okay, thanks

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.880
Here we go

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.430
It's like nothing hit me yeah

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.160
Oh

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.559
That's great. That's awesome. It's gonna look good, it was sick. You. Have a seed right on your face

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.870
Very good

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.940
Okay, so how are you gonna? Make the sounds for that I mean we'll probably use some tomato sounds. Oh, holy cow

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.339
Awesome do a little more than just Tomatoes, Sam so what would you do with the light?

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.280
I don't know we could probably get creative I

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.070
Think like a like I really

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.529
Encapsulated sort of occluded concussion like a like a sort of sort of thing

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:50.730
Oh really cool, and it will record slow tomato sounds that are more met they're gonna match the footage a bit better

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.659
So you record that tomato sounds and then when there's another tomato

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.799
And we'll just like squish it up and throw it around and manipulate it yeah

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.609
Yeah, yeah, let me add a bunch of processing reverb pitch it down

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.670
You pitch it down so it feels slow?

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.179
Yeah, yeah, huh, cos' that's just psychoacoustics really. That's what we want

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.609
It's at this part in the process where I have to get the slow-motion files off of the flash. That's here on the camera

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:21.210
Downloaded and then push it over the internet to Gordon and let him work his magic for the first video the candle Gordon has all

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.889
The sounds he needs in a library a previously recorded stuff, so he simply watches the video

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.339
And he lays these sounds down on the track as he sees fit

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.350
However when he does new stuff like the tomato exploding sometimes

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.150
He has to record new sounds

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:42.600
And he was so gracious as to record this incredibly complicated and precise process for us the tomato

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.600
I'm not actually going to use the tomato

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.280
Was a technical reason for that

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.890
And here's an orange

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.470
And that's because I

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:57.330
Looked in the fridge, and I didn't have tomato and I thought I did and the grocery stores closed

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.580
So we're gonna use an orange

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.119
It's another very juicy fruit

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.509
squished tomatoes before us scorched oranges before

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.140
They're pretty much the same thing when it comes to sound

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.049
Believe it or not I was I was one of the smart kids at the school

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:26.370
After he's recorded the new sounds they're edited then they're cleaned up for imperfections and then brought into the session

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:27.570
They're cut to the picture

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:35.240
And then they're processed as one overall sound then after he finishes all the magic. This is the final product

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.300
Shhllllllllh

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.920
Whoooosh

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.700
Whooomkpppp

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.640
*demon sounds here*

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.920
*Stirring Macaroni*

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:25.380
All right, I hope you enjoyed this episode of smarter every day. It was sponsored by audible. I love audible audiobooks

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:28.260
It helps me reclaim. My commute and get smarter while I'm doing it

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.309
You really should be listening to audiobooks and audible is the best way to do that you can go to?

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:39.809
audible.com/smarter get any free book you want as a trial, but I recommend this one letters to a young scientist by

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:44.010
EO Wilson he's a Pulitzer prize-winning biologist, that has taunght at Harvard for years

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:50.279
It's a great book if you're a young person and you're getting into the sciences go check out letters to a young scientist by EO

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.300
Wilson the way you can get this is going to audible.com/smarter

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:58.770
Or there's actually a new way if you text the words smarter to the phone number

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:04.589
500 500 and they will reply with a link so that you can sign up for a free trial it's awesome anyway

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:05.520
That's pretty cool

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:11.339
Really neat way to do that so audible.com slash smarter or text Smarter - 500 500

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:15.390
And if you want to see all the books that I like I'll leave a link down in the video description so you can check

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:20.189
That out this was video one of two the next one is gonna be banana bottle

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:25.240
So I hope you stick around and maybe subscribe so you can see that video. I'm Destin you're getting smarter every day

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.240
Have a good one oh

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:36.519
Is the Audio recording what's happening?

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:44.840
(Destin laughing like a demonic angelic old baby of pure rage and happiness)

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.200
This is so scary
