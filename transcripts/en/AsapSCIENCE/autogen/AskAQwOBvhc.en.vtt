00:00:00.331 --> 00:00:04.401
 Well, it seems the world has become quite divided on this dress, Ma 

00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:11.080
 The color you see? On the first side we have a team that says he watches black and blue - and the other side, the white and gold team 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.531
 We asked Twitter followers and we got thousands of answers for both sides, white, gold, black and blue 

00:00:15.531 --> 00:00:19.461
 Which is worth watching, we both saw black and blue and I think this is a big joke at first 

00:00:19.461 --> 00:00:23.311
 So, how can people see it differently? 

00:00:23.311 --> 00:00:28.911
 This phenomenon is called chromatography. Take this cube as an example, the middle square 

00:00:28.911 --> 00:00:32.860
 Which at the top appears to be of brown color, but the square on the side appears to be 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.860
 Orange color, but in fact both boxes have the same color, we assure you that we did not 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.780
 Cheat or do any tricks, instead, our brains see the situation and the context, you see the shadow 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.070
 It says "Oh-shadow makes objects darker color" and so on 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.491
 The brain compensates and explains the box as a lighter and lighter color than it seems, until we do 

00:00:52.491 --> 00:00:53.620
 Remove the shadow 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.920
 Back to the dress, we have a similar case, except that the situation here is very arbitrary, 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.691
 We are so close to the dress that we do not know about the surroundings 

00:01:02.691 --> 00:01:06.841
 The brain has to make assumptions, people who see the dress in white have brains 

00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:11.381
 The dress may be interpreted as in a room with a blue light, for example, as with a window close by 

00:01:11.381 --> 00:01:15.131
 And a radiant blue sky. Logically, the white dress will be 

00:01:15.131 --> 00:01:18.341
 Color blue and golden color will not really change. 

00:01:18.341 --> 00:01:22.141
 On the other hand, the edification of people who see black and blue color can be interpreted 

00:01:22.141 --> 00:01:27.211
 The color of the dress in artificial lighting settings - as with yellow lighting. As a result, the brain sees 

00:01:27.211 --> 00:01:32.161
 The golden color as a reflection outside of the black color, believed that the blue color was not directly affected 

00:01:32.161 --> 00:01:36.331
 The chances are that this picture was taken to be completely obscure on our brains, I mean 

00:01:36.331 --> 00:01:41.051
 It all happens to realize each and every individual and even how and where you are viewing this picture 

00:01:41.051 --> 00:01:45.691
 From a realistic point of view, this blue dress, in fact, here are some pictures of the dress 

00:01:45.691 --> 00:01:49.671
 But this is a beautiful example of how our brains evolved in the interpretation of this world 

00:01:49.671 --> 00:01:52.211
 Around us, even without realizing it 

00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:56.351
