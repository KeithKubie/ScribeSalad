00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.138
That's enough HTML elements for now
I want to talk about the structure of

00:00:03.138 --> 00:00:06.503
an actual HTML document really
quick, before we move on.

00:00:06.503 --> 00:00:10.089
Now, what we've been seen before 
is just little mark up.

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:13.922
We've been seeing things like this.
You know, little tags, a few little simple tags.

00:00:13.922 --> 00:00:17.257
But an actual complete HTML document
has quite a bit more in it

00:00:17.257 --> 00:00:21.251
Here is a whole lot more HTML.
Let's take this piece by piece.

00:00:21.251 --> 00:00:24.167
But this is what a complete 
HTML document look like.

00:00:24.167 --> 00:00:29.806
First we have the Doctype, and
this is what kind of HTML this is.

00:00:29.806 --> 00:00:33.569
This string right here is,
used to be a lot more complex.

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:36.925
If you were to google for doctypes,
you would see a lot of different answers here.

00:00:36.925 --> 00:00:41.145
But now that we are using HTML5,
it has a nice clean simple doctype.

00:00:41.145 --> 00:00:46.046
Which is just the string HTML.
Very simple. Okay. Then we have a tag.

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:51.337
This is the, basically the opening
HTML tag, and the closing HTML tag.

00:00:51.337 --> 00:00:56.171
This surrounds the entire rest of the document.
That is all it does, it surrounds the entire document.

00:00:56.171 --> 00:01:03.588
Now we got this other tag here. The head.
This part of the document has, metadata

00:01:03.588 --> 00:01:08.587
and other random stuff. If you were
to include Java script and CSS.

00:01:08.587 --> 00:01:11.642
CSS, remember, we talked about, is
the styling sort of stuff.

00:01:11.642 --> 00:01:15.541
That would be included in the head section.
Now we also have this little tag here.

00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:20.836
The title. And this is the title of the page.
This is what would appear in the top

00:01:20.836 --> 00:01:27.338
of your browser window or in your browser tab.
This thing right here. Then we have the body tag.

00:01:27.338 --> 00:01:33.174
And the body tag is the actual contents 
of the document. And basically, we've been working

00:01:33.174 --> 00:01:37.465
just in the body tag in this lesson.
And for most of this course we really just

00:01:37.465 --> 00:01:42.174
Going to be focusing on generating 
the content that fits between the body tags.

00:01:42.174 --> 00:01:45.975
It's - all this other stuff is important.
And you'll see it, and we'll be sending it

00:01:45.975 --> 00:01:50.509
over the wire, but it doesn't change very often.
And, you know, it's pretty simple. But it is important

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:56.008
for it to be there. All the interesting stuff
happens between the body tags.

00:01:56.008 --> 00:01:58.789
Okay. Let's take another view
of the HTML documents.

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:01.339
They have a structure that 
can be visualized like this.

00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:05.459
An HTML document, this whole thing,
has a head section, and that is where

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:11.506
we have our title, references to any CSS
files, any Java script files, and that sort of stuff.

00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:15.303
And then we have the body section,
and this is where the actual contents

00:02:15.303 --> 00:02:19.096
of the document. The stuff you see on the screen.
This is where that comes from.

00:02:19.096 --> 00:02:24.010
And this course we're mostly going to focus
on this part of the HTML document.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.817
Just the body section. And there is 
a lot of content that can go in there.

00:02:27.817 --> 00:02:32.179
We'll discuss briefly CSS and Java script,
and how they fit in on everything,

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:36.115
but for the most part we're going to be
generating the contents. The body

00:02:36.115 --> 00:02:38.238
of an HTML document.
