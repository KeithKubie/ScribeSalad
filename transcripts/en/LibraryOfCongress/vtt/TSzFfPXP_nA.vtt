00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.230
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.170
&gt;&gt; I first became familiar
with Claire Messud's work

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.310
when I had the privilege of
reviewing The Emperor's Children

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.110
in 2006 at a time when I
was at the Buffalo News

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.810
as the editor of the paper.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.110
I really liked the book.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.470
I gave it a positive review.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.560
So did everyone else in the world.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.330
The New York Times review
called Claire Messud a novelist

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.900
of unnerving talent.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.470
The book was widely celebrated,
named one of the Times's best books

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.130
of the year, 10 best books of
the year, and was long listed

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.270
for The Man Booker Prize.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.570
Claire Messud's new book,
The Burning Girl, is,

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.850
according to NPR's review, now I'm
quoting, a subversive commentary

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.850
on the stories we tell about women

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.800
and the way those stories
circumscribe our lives.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.920 position:56%
Edgar Allan Poe wrote that the death

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.240
of a beautiful woman is
unquestionably the most poetical

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.270
topic in the world.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.630
In her new book, Messud
says, "not to us."

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.510
I give you Claire Messud.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:22.810
[ Applause ]

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.200
&gt;&gt; Claire Messud: Good
afternoon, everybody.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.500
Thank you for coming.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.610
It's wonderful to be here.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.370
And this festival is perhaps
the most exciting festival.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.150
I came here first for my last
novel, The Woman Upstairs.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.510
And there's something about the
energy of-- it was already indoors,

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.560
and there's something about
the energy of everybody

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.240
who loves books gathering
under one roof

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.110
in this incredible way
for this incredible day.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.640
And I just feel very
grateful to be part of it.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.680
So thanks for being here.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:04.080
And thought what I would do is tell
you a little bit about my novel

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.370
and where it came from and what
I thought I was trying to do.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:15.680
And then I can take questions
from you guys if you have any.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.300
The Burning Girl is set in
Massachusetts in a small town,

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.480
fictional town called Royston
about an hour north of Boston,

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.120
not far from the New
Hampshire border.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.090
And it's told by a
young girl, Julia,

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.270
who at the time of telling is 17.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.720
She's just going into her
last year of high school.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.520
But she is telling the story
of her friendship with Cassie.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.060
And the girls were best friends
in childhood, and in the course

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.590
of adolescence, their
friendship has--

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.980
it unraveled, and thereby,
hints a tale.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:04.830
And I wanted, in writing
this story, to--

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.260
I was trying to do something
I hadn't done before.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.840
And I don't know if anybody in
the-- every time you write a book,

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.610
you're trying to do something
you haven't done before.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.740
The writer, Peter Carey,
who's a very wonderful writer,

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.420
if you're not familiar with
his work, go out and grab it.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.430
He's one of the most
exhilarating writers.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.010
Every book is a new adventure.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.430
Each book is a completely imagined
world and really different.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.090
And he has said, if it doesn't
seem impossible, why bother trying?

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.960
And I really take that to heart.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.380 position:56%
I think that each time, you know,
each time I set out to do something,

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.260
I'm not really sure whether I can.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.660
And that was true of this
book in a different way

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.210
than each of my earlier books.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.600
But in some ways, this book
is a sort of companion piece

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.170
to my last novel, The Woman
Upstairs, which is a novel

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.430 position:56%
about women's friendship in midlife.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:05.140
It's about an elementary
school teacher who is an artist

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.640
in her spare time who
befriends a woman

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.410
who is a successful artist,
and how that unfolds.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.050
And this is very different, but
it's also about female friendship.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.690
And some of the themes, I
think, overlap, themes about,

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.490
I'll talk more about
them in a minute,

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.070
but about how we know each
other and don't know each other.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.170
But in writing this book, the
challenge that I was setting

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:42.350
for myself is that I wanted
to write an archetypal story

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:43.710
in a different way.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.430
So I wanted it almost-- I
wanted it to be, if you will,

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.230
a fable of American
girls' adolescence.

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:57.220
In that sense, the account of an
almost universal experience, right,

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.590
a distillation of an experience
that almost everybody goes

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:07.310
through at some time, but grounded
in the specificities of two, to me,

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.890 position:56%
very real girls, that I've imagined.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.360
And in the telling to hold
the archetype up to the light,

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.020
if that makes sense, to sort
of hold it up and ask questions

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.780
about the stories that
we think we know.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.830
I think that somewhere along the
line, and of course being me,

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.180 position:56%
I cannot remember where, which seems

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.440
in this internet age an
all too common problem.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.910
I read it somewhere.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.930
There is a source somewhere.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.350
But darned if I know.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:47.000
But I read, when I was working on
the book, I read an article about,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.730
I guess it was about neurology,

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.630
it was about how the eye
and the brain relate.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.850
And I learned that, in
fact, at any given moment,

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:02.400
our brain processes only about
30% of what our eye sees, right?

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.380
So our eye actually sees the
whole picture, and our brain,

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.150 position:56%
which is more efficient, plucks
about 30%, sort of 30% points of it,

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:15.770 position:56%
and then fills in the rest with what
our brain knows from experience.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.000
And, I mean, if you think of it,
that when you are a grown-up,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.720
you very rarely lie in bed and
think that that's a monster

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.690
across the room when
it's your laundry, right?

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.510
Because you've had a lot of
experience of looking at the pile

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.280
in the corner and thinking,
I think that's a monster,

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.370
but I know it's the laundry,
so your brain just does

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.300
that for you and skates right over.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.790
But when you're sort of four and
you don't have years and years

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.930
of experience, you
think it's a monster

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.410 position:56%
because your brain can't fill it in.

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:52.610
So I was very interested by
this, by this revelation because,

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.840
or this fact, I guess
it wasn't a revelation

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.380
to the scientist, whatever.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.020
It was a revelation to me.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.030
I was very interested
because I realized that we do

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.580
that in life all the time.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.970
And that somebody starts to tell
us a story about someone, you know,

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:12.700
did you hear about,
you know, Joe and Beth

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:16.650 position:56%
and Joe's been having an affair, and
that's just found out, and we think,

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.560
I know how that story goes, I
know how that story goes, right?

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:26.120
But the number of times that
we do it, we just assume

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.640
that we already know the ending.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:34.030
And that is-- each of us may
do that slightly differently.

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:39.660
But we do it because
we are as much made up.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.370
Now, this is a little
sentence I came up with

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:43.670
that I'm sort of proud of.

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:45.570
But it doesn't actually
say what I want it to.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:47.860
But never mind.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.810
But we are as much made up of our
literarily lived lives as we are

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:54.760 position:56%
of our literally lived lives, right?

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.320
Right? There's a little echo there.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.480
That's nice, right?

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.010
But by which I mean that we
are made up of all the stories

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:05.560
that we take in, whether we
read them, whether we hear them,

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.110
whether resee them on TV,
whether they're in the news,

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:12.120
whether they're told in our
community or by our friends.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.690
All those stories,
we internalize them.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:17.800
We may forget them, but we distill
them and they're part of us.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.630
And when we approach a narrative,

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:23.030
we bring all of that
experience to bear.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:26.470
And often, we think, I
already know this story.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:30.850
And so part of what, part of--

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:32.950
there are lots of ways in
which that's interesting to me.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:37.000
But part of what's interesting
is this symbiotic way, you know,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.680
we talk about how the stories
we tell reflect our culture.

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:45.590
But the stories we tell also
define our culture, right?

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:51.250
It's the symbiotic back and forth
in between what we all already know

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:56.200
from the stories we've internalized
and then the stories that we tell

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.100
with that knowledge in mind.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.850
And so for me, this
story is obviously

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:08.460
on some level very simply the
story about two girls going

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.960
through adolescence from
the ages of 12 to 15,

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.390
told somewhat with the
retrospect of a couple years.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.150
And it's a very simple story.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:27.250
And on some other level, it's
trying to question what a story is,

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:32.200
how we make up a story, how each of
us in our different subjectivities

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.970
in which, you know, each of
us is trapped in who we are.

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:44.790
If you go back to the 18th century
German philosophers, there was Kant

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:47.460
who wrote a lot about subjectivity.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.960
Then there was a guy called Fichte
who believed you really just--

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.460
there is no table except
the table each of us wills.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:58.450
Like there isn't actually
anything out there.

00:09:58.450 --> 00:09:59.750
I'm not going there.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:01.050
I'm not going that far.

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:02.750
I believe this is holding,
this is holding up the papers.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:04.050
We're okay.

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:10.210
But there is some way in which each

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:13.850
of us is trapped in
our own subjectivity.

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:16.610
So it's the Rashomon thing.

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:19.180
Has anybody seen the
Rashomon, the film, right,

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.480
that's the different perspectives,

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.480
and the story is different
depending where you stand.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:26.810
So it's both-- I'm getting
a little bogged down.

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:28.110
I need to open up.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:34.080 position:56%
Okay, but I would just say, it's
like, for me, I recently saw, again,

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.040 position:56%
the Nina Simone documentary, I
don't know if anybody has seen that,

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.250
but if you haven't, I
highly recommend it.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:41.280
But I thought as I was watching it,

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.930
what I was trying to
do was like jazz.

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:46.170
That there's a very simple melody.

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:54.220
And the simple melody has to be, if
not recognizable, easy to follow.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:58.710
But then I'm riffing on the melody.

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:00.850
Now, of course, another way
of thinking of this, which is,

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:05.340
you know, why it's a risk,
is that you could say,

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:09.580
she's just writing cliches and
disappointing us narratively.

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:12.010
Like she's writing cliches, and
then it doesn't end the way it's

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:13.310
supposed to.

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:22.640
But hey. So I just wanted to share
the epigraph of the book with you.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.100
So I took the epigraph

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:29.560
from an Elizabeth Bishop
poem called Casabianca.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:36.060
And it is, itself, a
commentary on an earlier poem,

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:42.280
a 19th century parlor poem called
Casabianca, the first lines

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.720
of which may be familiar to some.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:49.250
But a parlor poem was something
that was recited in living rooms.

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:52.450
Like all kids used to know
these poems in the 19th century

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:57.280
and when there was no TV and no
iPhones, your kids would stand up

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.010
and recite the poems for you

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:03.290
as an entertainment before
they played the piano.

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:04.990
Or maybe after they
played the piano.

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:08.600
So the original poem
is the boy stood

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.740
on the burning deck once
all but he had fled.

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:15.790
The flame that lit the battle's
wreck, shone round him or the dead.

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:17.840
Does that ring a bell to some?

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:23.790
Yeah. So it's a poem based on an
actual event about a boy who was

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:25.350
on a ship with his father.

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:26.810
His father was the captain.

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:28.110
There was a battle.

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:29.620
His father was dying.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:33.970
The boy was waiting for his dad
to say, you can abandon ship now.

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:40.110
But his dad didn't say that
because his dad was dying.

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:42.600
And so the boy went
down with the ship.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.980
And it was a sort of famous
incident because he was a child.

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:49.820
There was the British comic,
Spike Milligan did a version,

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.950
which is the boy stood
on the burning deck,

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:54.620
once all but he had fled twit.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:13:01.090
Anyway, but the Elizabeth
Bishop poem sort

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:04.450 position:56%
of takes it to a slightly metalevel.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:07.200
Loves the boy stood on
the burning deck trying

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.880
to recite the boy stood
on the burning deck.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:14.310
Loves the Sun stood stammering
elocution while the poor ship

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:16.550
in flames went down.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:18.480
Loves the obstinate boy.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:21.260
The ship, even the
swimming sailors who would

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:26.610
like a schoolroom platform too
or an excuse to stay on deck,

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:29.720
and loves the burning boy.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:34.120
And that's where the
title of the book comes

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:38.450
from is not the burning
boy, but the burning girl.

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:47.100
And the reason why is that in
the Elizabeth Bishop's poem,

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:51.080
there's both the original boy
standing on the burning deck,

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:55.320 position:56%
and there's the boy standing on the
deck that would be like this, right?

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.550
Stammering elocution,
trying to recite the poem.

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:04.550 position:56%
And for me and the book, both girls
are burning girls in different ways.

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:11.570
One is a narrator, one is
the actor or the person

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:16.460
to whom things happen
or who does things more.

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:24.510
But both are trapped in a
bond of love and of loyalty.

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:27.600
And one of the things I
wanted to raise questions

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.880
about in the book is what
does it mean to love someone?

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.420
Who does it mean to be loyal?

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:39.820
And these are questions posed in
this book about teenage girls.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.300
But they're questions
about being human.

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:49.930
It's not just-- these are questions
that we face all our lives long.

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:00.660
The inspiration for the
book, the inspiration

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:04.040
for the book was multiple.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.490
It always is.

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:08.940
I always think it's
like being a magpie.

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:13.940
You pick up, you know, I take
that handbag, I take that scarf,

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.490
I take the light on your hair
back there and I put it together

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:19.810
and I try to make something of it.

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:25.570
On the one hand, when I was
a kid, we lived in Australia.

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:28.560
And we left when I was nine.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.510
And because I'm that
old now, I kept in touch

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:34.150
with my friends by writing letters.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:37.950
And several years later
when we were all teenagers,

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:39.480
we were all still pen pals.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.550
I was still pen pals
with three or four girls.

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:48.140
And the friends wrote to me and
told me the story of something

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:52.210 position:56%
that had happened to a girl in our
class who had been a friend of mine,

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:54.330
but with whom I wasn't in touch.

00:15:54.330 --> 00:16:01.220 position:56%
And it was a story that I heard only
in fragments, and only partially.

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:08.220
And it was a story that ended in
that case with our classmate dying.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:12.020
And I was-- it's not
the story in the book.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:20.660
And I was haunted thereafter
all my life by the question,

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:25.340
not just by the story itself,
but by my sense of the sort

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:30.790
of hovering fragility of the story,
that I was putting it together

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:33.120
from these pieces that I had heard,

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.790
but I didn't ever actually
know for sure.

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:41.990
So I had a version, my friends
had versions, they were kids

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:46.480
at the time, so how much were they
really told, how much was rumor,

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:51.220
how much was, you know,
how much was invented?

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:58.160
And I went laterally and
looked at the press clippings,

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:03.220
and the story in the press
was completely different.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.180
And my first thought was, wow,

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:07.530
I totally misremembered
everything I was told.

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:12.350
And then I remembered the
ways, like I realized, no, no,

00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:13.690
I was told what I was told.

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:17.550
And then this is the official
story, this is like version 5.

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:20.940
This is a completely different,
you know, and so for me,

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:26.560 position:56%
that was a story that I had-- not
the actual story, but the experience

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.410
that I wanted to try to write about
in fiction for many, many years,

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:33.910
for like probably 20 years.

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:38.270
And when I sat down finally and
wrote The Emperor's Children,

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:43.350
which I started initially in
2000, and then began in 2002,

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:47.800
I was debating, will I try to
tell some version of this story?

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.570
So that part has been
with me a long time.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:54.820
And then the other part
is I'm a mom with kids,

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:58.360
including a daughter,
and nieces and nephews.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:02.940
And I have been living, as maybe
it's true for some other people

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:04.330
in the audience, I've
been living a number

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:07.870
of years now in teenager land.

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:12.030
Not with the same perspective that
I had when I was going through it,

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:14.940 position:56%
but with a different perspective,
which is the perspective of somebody

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:19.080
who sometimes thinks at least
I know how the story is going

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.840
to go ahead of time.

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:24.140
But I'm not in a position
where I can ever say, you know,

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.420
that's a thing parents
really can't do.

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:31.050
You really can't say don't, you
know, I can see what's going

00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:33.600
to happen, you know,
three years, you know,

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.200
you just have to sit
quiet and bear witness.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.480
That's a parent's job.

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.160
So watching what my daughter went

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:47.630
through in middle school was part
of-- was very powerful for me.

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:51.090
I saw her going through
things that I had--

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:52.430
versions of which I
had gone through.

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:56.970
And I was struck by how so much
has changed since my youth,

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:59.320
and nothing has changed, right?

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:06.340
That yes, there are cell phones
and Facebook and Snapchat and

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:11.490
but the emotions and the passions,
it is like a fellow, right?

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:13.400
A fellow was a long time ago.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.700
The world has changed a lot.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:18.580
But jealousy still looks
a lot like a fellow.

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:23.070
And by the same token,
the passion and the grief

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:27.760
and the terrible disillusionment
that teenage girls go

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:33.110
through in their friendships
hasn't changed at all.

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:40.320
The narrative is actually, is
divided into three sections.

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.950
And the first section
takes place the summer

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:47.020
after 6th grade, the
summer before 7th.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:51.290
And at that point, Cassie and
Julia are still very close.

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:52.610
I mean, they're best friends.

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:54.630
They've been best friends
since nursery school.

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:58.080
And they spend the summer,
for a number of reasons,

00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.380
they're spending the
summer together.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.300
And Cassie gets injured.

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:06.000
And then they sort of have
to change their activities.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:14.150 position:56%
And they end up going into the woods
and finding an abandoned asylum

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:19.380
that they knew was there and
playing imaginary games there.

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:22.990
For me, that section
is fully in childhood,

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:26.290
in a time when imagination
is licensed,

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:29.920
the making up of stories is
considered free and creative

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:32.390
and is sort of culturally
sanctioned.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:37.060
That's what we want kids to
do is to make up fictions.

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:42.430
And our fictions are sort of-- the
things kids play are often heroic

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:45.140
and they're influenced by fairy
tales and they're influenced

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.250
by Greek myths and they're
influenced by all of the

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:52.360
of the stories that fill our
childhoods in which animals,

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:59.070 position:56%
animals aren't just animals, animals
are actor with opinions and sort

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:02.480
of symbolic import, and, you know,

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:10.380
the way that things happen
sequentially doesn't always need

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:11.680
logical explaining.

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.350
Because when you're a
kid, you just take it.

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:14.650
Whatever happens happens.

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:17.630
And if it doesn't make sense,
you'll understand someday.

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:19.510
You're not trying to
pin a logic on it.

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:21.450
You're not trying to
put it in a context.

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:24.100
And that's the world that they're
living in at the beginning.

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:29.670
The middle section I think of
as sort of time passes is a kind

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:34.490
of transitional time in which
they're entering the world,

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:38.340
the girls are entering the
world, and things become real.

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:42.880
There's a Halloween section,
Halloween bit in there.

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:46.420
I feel like that moment, I
don't know if you remember

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:50.340
in your own lives or in lives of
people you love, the first year,

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:53.560
you don't go out trick-or-treating,
right?

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:57.320
When the magic is passing.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:01.150
And the terrible wistfulness
that you feel as a kid,

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:02.840
but you also can't do it anymore.

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:06.020
Or else you do it in
the most cynical way,

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:08.220
which is you don't dress up
at all and you just go around

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:10.850
and raid the candy
bowls of the people

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:14.910
who have left their candy outside
and come home with a huge bag

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:19.080
of candy that you don't even eat.

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:25.120
So that's a sort of middle section.

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:31.940 position:56%
And then the third section is a time
in which the girls are in 9th grade,

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:39.420
they've nominally entered a sort
of more adult, more adult time.

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:43.680
But they're making up
stories more than ever, right?

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.330
I think without realizing it.

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:50.340 position:56%
Because when we are adults, we think
we don't live in a childish world

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:54.990 position:56%
where there are knights and fairies,
and, you know, swans talk to us.

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:57.890
We live in a world that's
completely rational and orderly.

00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:00.250
And we don't make up stories.

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:04.060
And yet if you think
about every day, you know,

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:08.100
if you think about when
you're walking down the street

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:13.340
and some man you find attractive
says, "oh, hey, are you going to be

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:14.710
at that lunch thing tomorrow?"

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:18.730 position:56%
And then you walk away and you
think, I think, I think he likes me.

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:20.810
Maybe he likes me, right?

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:22.730
Well, you're just making
up a fiction

00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:24.720
because you have no idea
whether he likes you.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:27.330
He may have just been being
polite, or he may want you to be

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:29.550
at the lunch thing torso he
can borrow some money from you.

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:31.150
You have no idea, right?

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:35.620
So we move into a supposedly
logical rational world

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:39.110
in which we are actually projecting
our own version of stories

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:41.560
onto what's around
us the whole time.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:46.680
And that's what happens both
for Cassie and for Julia,

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:49.660
not least because Julia is
no longer so close to Cassie.

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:50.960
They've moved apart.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.850
They're moving in quite
different worlds.

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:57.400
And so Julia is recounting what's
happening or what's happened

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:02.200
to Cassie from afar, filling
in what she thinks she knows

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:05.970
because she thinks she
knows Cassie so well.

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:16.040
I should soon stop and open it
to the audience for questions.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:22.250
But I just, I wanted to-- I have a
couple more things I wanted to add.

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:29.450
And one is that I've described this
as a children's book for grown-ups.

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:33.220
And then people say,
well, what do you mean?

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:39.780 position:56%
And I think what I mean is that when
I talk about the children's world,

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:44.370
because another joy of being
a parent has been reading,

00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:47.270 position:56%
re-reading children's books, reading
and re-reading children's books

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:50.910
with my kids over all those years.

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:55.580 position:56%
You enter, you experience children's
books with a sort of immediacy

00:24:55.580 --> 00:25:00.800
without asking-- without asking--
immediacy, mystery and wonder.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:05.890
Just experiencing it without asking
certain analytical questions.

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:11.270
And I certainly feel
as a-- I'm now 50.

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:15.750
And I feel that if you had asked me
at 30 or at 50, I would have said,

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:18.710
life is a process in which
you know more and more

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:20.920
and things become clearer
and more orderly

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.760
and you have a better
sense of the world.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:29.900
And at 50, I can say, that
is just complete crap, right?

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:34.950
I feel as though the world is more
mysterious and more full of wonder.

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:37.110
Some of it is dark.

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:39.600
But the world is full of mystery.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.760
There are more things in
Heaven and Earth ratio

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:44.440
than are dreamed of
in our philosophy.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:49.390
And, you know, it's
something that I wanted

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:54.440
to have Julia not be telling her
story from the age of 30 or the age

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:58.200
of 40 because I wanted her
still to be close enough

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:02.560
on the childhood end, right, I feel
like I have that experience as I'm

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:06.730
at an older, but I wanted Julia
to be at the childhood end

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:09.800
where she's still, to quote
Wordsworth, trailing clouds

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:13.810
of glory, where she's still
inhabiting in some way

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:18.590
that child's logic, that way
of understanding the world,

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:21.030
even as she has passed
into an understanding

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:24.550
of herself as a grown-up.

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:36.950
And I thought, I worked hard to try
to make her language fairly simple.

00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:40.720
But, you know, some
of the people writing

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:47.610
about the book have said she's
too articulate for a 17-year-old.

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:54.840
And sometimes they say those are
all the experiences and feelings

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.430 position:56%
that I remember having at that time,

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:59.610
but I would never have
expressed them.

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:06.700
And to which I sort of feel
a little thrill of pleasure

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:10.950
because I feel isn't that
actually what art is for?

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:17.260
And what art should try to do is
express elusively the things we all

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:20.330
feel, even if we wouldn't
say them out loud.

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:27.810
And I'll finish just by
saying when I decided,

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:31.430
I had already decided I wanted to
be a writer when I was like five,

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:33.800
and my parents gave me a
little kid's typewriter

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.520
for my sixth birthday.

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:37.410
Very annoying child, I'm sure.

00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:41.700
But I thought that children
weren't taken seriously enough.

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:44.380
And I wanted to write
grown-up books for children.

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:47.060
That was my aim when I was a child.

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:51.550
And Watership Down was the sort
of symbol, that was the book

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:55.200
that I held up, was like I
want to write books like that.

00:27:55.200 --> 00:28:01.250
But now at this point, I feel
as though there's some return

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:05.510
to a sense that we, in
this moment in our culture,

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:09.650
and it's a broader conversation
for another day, but there is a ton

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:13.440
of really wonderful YA
fiction in the world

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:16.780
that didn't exist when I was young.

00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:19.880
But one of the things that we've
done as a culture is literally

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:26.240
to separate off young people
from the mainstream bookshelves.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:30.900
And we put them in a corner
where we send our teenage kids.

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.060
And then it's like
putting them behind a gate.

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:35.400
We don't think about them,
we don't talk about them,

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:43.940 position:56%
and we don't consider, we don't give
equal weight to the inner lives,

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:51.210
the doubts, fears, philosophies
and personhood of young people.

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:54.080
We just sort of shut them away.

00:28:54.080 --> 00:29:02.210
And so part of what I wanted to do
in this book is bring those girls

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:08.110
into the light, as it were,
of a grown-up readership.

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:12.290
And that's The Burning Girl.

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:13.890
So thank you.

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:18.510
And I'm happy to answer any
questions that people might have.

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:28.620
[ Applause ]

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:33.400
Or not. There must be one.

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.700
Margaret?

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:44.100
&gt;&gt; The first we is always
the icebreaker, right?

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:45.400
I'm sure there will be more.

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:51.230
Do you have a reader or a kind
of reader in mind when you write?

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:54.520
Or do you write for yourself?

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:58.090
Or do you have a sort
of ideal reader?

00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:00.430
&gt;&gt; Claire Messud: That's
a good question.

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:02.800
And one I don't really
know how to answer.

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:07.060
I think in a funny way, when
I'm working on something,

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:10.050
I'm writing in service
of the story, right?

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:14.300
It's a question of what is the best
point of view or the best voice

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:20.570
or the best vehicle for
telling the story itself?

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:28.760
In this case, exceptionally,
I did have a reader in mind.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:38.070
Not solely, but my daughter is 16,
and a very, a big reader, you know?

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:41.990
She's a lifelong, very
serious reader.

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:47.150
And she was one of the very first
readers of the manuscript for me.

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:50.880
And she gave me some great notes,

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.500
largely about the way
the kids spoke.

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:58.720 position:56%
And she said, no, no, no, nobody
would speak like that, no, no, yeah.

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:02.790
And then she, you know,
so she was a--

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:05.460
her voice was really
important to me.

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:09.240
But that's an exceptional
case, in a way.

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:12.510
It's not usually--
that's not usually so.

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:13.930
Thank you.

00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:17.770
Anybody else?

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:20.070
Don't run.

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:29.980
&gt;&gt; Your mentioning of magpie,
you think about a woman upstairs,

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:32.980
and for those who haven't read,
I'll try to be kind of vague,

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:36.300
but one artist takes the experience

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:41.590
of another person and
uses it in her art.

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:45.890
And I know that there are authors
who think anything is fair game.

00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:47.250
I can take anything and use it.

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:51.220
And I just wondered what
your perspective on that was.

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:54.350
&gt;&gt; Claire Messud: You know,
that's why that's in there is

00:31:54.350 --> 00:32:00.040 position:56%
because I think it's one of the sort
of central dilemmas for an artist

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:05.770 position:56%
of any kind, of what actually is
acceptable to use for your material.

00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:09.870 position:56%
And, you know, we think of it in
novelistic terms often of especially

00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:12.710
with young writers, and I teach,
and often with young writers,

00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:16.460
it's a real quandary if I'm going
to write stories about my parents

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:19.760
that they might someday
read, how do I go ahead?

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:23.670
And, you know, as a teacher, you
say you have to write the stories,

00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:26.590
and then we'll cross that
bridge when we come to it.

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:33.190 position:56%
And I do, I think it is about each
artist has to find their own balance

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:36.020
of what they feel okay with.

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:39.870 position:56%
And I think people-- there's a real
spectrum, and people feel, you know,

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:44.560
you think of Eugene O'Neill, who
long days journey into night,

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:48.550
he just hung onto it until the
protagonists were dead, right?

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:51.730
I mean, he just, he wrote it
and then he just hung onto it.

00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:54.110
But there are other people

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:58.810
who are much more comfortable just
having it out there come what may.

00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:01.650
So I think it's really
an individual--

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:06.350
each person has to make
their peace with it.

00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:08.090
Thank you.

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:09.660
&gt;&gt; Thank you for your discussion.

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:10.960
It was interesting.

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:15.650
How hard was it, or what was it
like going from a book about women

00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:19.450
in the middle of their
life, in that perspective,

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:25.530
to moving back toward women,
young women, those are children,

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:31.700
and was it easy or was it just
kind of what you writers do?

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:34.050
&gt;&gt; Claire Messud: Well, I think,
I mean, interestingly, in my case,

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:36.920
you know, somebody said to me,
how did you do all the research

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:38.380
about the pop songs and stuff?

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:41.300
And I was like, well, I drive my
kids everywhere, so, you know,

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:44.120
it's just what they insist
on putting on the radio.

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:50.270
So I think in some ways, it
isn't really the same, it isn't--

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:53.830
just because of the nature of
my daily life, it wasn't a move

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:56.040
like suddenly trying
to write something set

00:33:56.040 --> 00:34:00.560
in 1850 in Japan, you know?

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:02.670
I'm a woman in midlife.

00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:04.750
I have a daughter who's a teenager.

00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:08.400
They're very different experiences.

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:12.520
And the experiences of my own
and my daughter's experiences are

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:16.560
in no way those of any of the
characters in either novel.

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:23.700
But just as a sort of [inaudible]
or world, it didn't feel

00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:26.370
like such a big leap in that case.

00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:29.190
Thank you.

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:34.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you had
mentioned that the story upon

00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:39.020 position:56%
which The Burning Girl was based on,
you know, you had been carrying it

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:41.740
in your head for a long time.

00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:43.950
I'm sure you've been carrying
a lot of other stories,

00:34:43.950 --> 00:34:46.900
even before you wrote
Emperor's Children.

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:54.570 position:56%
What was it that made you say, okay,
now is the time to choose this story

00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:57.880
over everything else in your
head, now is the time to put this

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:02.400
on paper, to make that commitment?

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.840
&gt;&gt; Claire Messud: And
yes, I think it was--

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:08.950
the magpie thing works
up to a point,

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:12.880
and then it's almost more
than a composting thing.

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:16.210
So it's like you put in the
eggshells and you put in the,

00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:21.990
you know, peelings, and then
at some point, a shoot comes up

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:23.660
and something is growing.

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:27.890
And I think it was really that
sense, that I had had this,

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:30.910
and I didn't quite know
where to go with it.

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:36.390
And then watching our kids go
through this time, and as I said,

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:38.210
not just our daughter
and son, but our nieces

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:40.600
and nephews watching
these experiences,

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:44.110
it suddenly seemed
pressing and urgent in a way

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:47.520
that connected to this story.

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:53.150
And I guess it sounds sort of
abstract, but I really do believe

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:55.860
that this time and these
middle school years,

00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:59.630
it's when we're forged as people.

00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:04.380
It's when whatever happens in those
years marks us for good or ill

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:07.700
and shapes who we will
become, et cetera.

00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:10.240
I always say, if you're having
trouble with any, you know,

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:11.540
if you're having trouble
with a person,

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:13.570
just picture them in
seventh grade, right?

00:36:13.570 --> 00:36:15.970
And suddenly everything
becomes clear, right?

00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:20.600
I mean, picture say the leader of
our country, picture middle school,

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:26.200
like suddenly many things
become clear, right?

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:30.070
So I think having those
years up close in front of me

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:33.950
and feeling the urgency
of them was part of it.

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:35.250
&gt;&gt; Thanks very much.

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:37.550
&gt;&gt; Claire Messud: Thank you.

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:46.650
&gt;&gt; Yeah, with the courage born
of ignorance, I see so much.

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:52.330
I was recently at a book
sale at a thrift store,

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:56.340
and there were just
racks and racks and racks

00:36:56.340 --> 00:37:01.270
of dystopian novels aimed at--

00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:07.540
I just would like to pitch
out the idea that the universe

00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:14.540
in which we live is enough of a
dystopia, and we're robbing kids

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:17.320
of the ability to figure
out what's going on now

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:19.940
by projecting what's
going into the future.

00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:22.920
Would you care to comment on that?

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.220
&gt;&gt; Claire Messud: Yes, sir.

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:26.740
So if everybody heard the
question or the comment,

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:30.220
it was about the vast
range of dystopian fictions

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:37.510 position:56%
that are available in book form and
in other forms also for young people

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:44.700
to read, and to not be focusing
on our dystopian reality.

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:49.970
You know, I'm a reader who
always wants to be in reality.

00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:52.830
I'm not somebody for whom fantasy--

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:54.870
there are some fantasy
books that I love,

00:37:54.870 --> 00:38:00.970
but it's not my primary
mode as a reader.

00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:05.250
And so I have to take
it from people I know

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:09.150
for whom it is the primary
mode, that sometimes it's almost

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:14.850
like Glenn Gould playing the piano
and putting on the vacuum cleaner.

00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:16.150
You know, he used to do that.

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:17.450
And it helped him.

00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:18.890
He said it helped him hear better.

00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:22.440
I think there are some readers
for whom all of the issues

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:28.580 position:56%
of our actual society are set in
better relief in an imaginary world,

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:33.970
that they actually, they can
actually see them more clearly

00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:37.590
if they're set in an
imaginary time and place.

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:38.890
That's not the case for me.

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:40.730
So I'm with you.

00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:44.600 position:56%
I feel that will are so many stories
to tell right here right now.

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:46.510
So thank you, sir.

00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:47.810
And I think that will be the--

00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:50.860
this will be the last
question, I imagine.

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:52.160
Yes, sir?

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:55.010
&gt;&gt; You have written about
two middle school girls.

00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:59.810
Would you posit that their
experience and your conclusions

00:38:59.810 --> 00:39:04.950
that you draw from it are very
different from middle school boys?

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:12.400
&gt;&gt; Claire Messud: You know, it's
a really interesting question.

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:17.950
I think to which my
answer would be yes and no.

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:19.250
Unhelpfully.

00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:25.780
I think in some ways it
depends on the kids, right?

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:29.420
It depends so much on the
individual and the temperament

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:32.550
and the dynamics between
individual kids.

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:37.450
And as a rule, as a rule, you could
say maybe it's a little different

00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:38.750
for boys than girls.

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:40.740
Although I don't know if there's
anyone here who's read David

00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:42.670 position:56%
Mitchell, the author of Cloud Atlas,

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:44.630
wrote a wonderful book
called Black Swan Green,

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:50.210
which is about adolescent boys,
interactions that read very--

00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:54.690 position:56%
when I read it, it struck me as very
familiar from my girl experience.

00:39:54.690 --> 00:40:02.770
And so I think it really,
it depends.

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:09.420
I'd say as a writer, I'm a
great believer in character.

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:10.810
I have many interests.

00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:15.050
Language, the music of language,
metaphor, da da da da da.

00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:17.520
But when I'm really interested
in, the bottom line, is people,

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:19.360
and how people are in the world,

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:21.590
who makes us who we
are and how we behave.

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:26.740
And so I think the groundedness
of each person in their place,

00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:31.370
in their time, in their
dynamic, is what makes the story.

00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:37.210
And gender is some small part of
that, but not the whole thing.

00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:39.370
Thank you.

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:42.510
Okay, thank you very
much, everybody.
