1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,510
I mean when I laughed so hard when a
guy goes, my balls got hot and you go,

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,050
there was the best company. The best
thing you could have possibly said was,

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,180
I understand. Love that
guy. Oh Man. Louis is,

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,390
he's a, he's a genius. He
figured out a way to be himself.

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,640
He forgot his Instagram page. No, no.

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,900
If there's anything fucking
crazy going on in the world.

7
00:00:21,901 --> 00:00:26,280
Derek Lewis has it on his Instagram page
is Instagram page is the best people

8
00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:27,091
found out about it.

9
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:31,620
I gave him a shout out to his Instagram
page on one of the UFC broadcasts and

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,830
now it's got like, what does he have? How
many falls do you have now? 1.6 million.

11
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:39,690
1.6 million. It's not good
though. It's fucking chaos.

12
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:41,760
He always gets videos deleted and removed,

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,620
but apparently they leave him up there.
I mean,

14
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:46,850
they're not threatening to take them
down, I don't think. I hope not every,

15
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,020
it's where I go to any fucking
dummy that's trying to like,

16
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:55,650
like light a bomb under a tire and fly
through the air and smash the roof of a

17
00:00:55,651 --> 00:00:58,170
fucking garage with his face.
He's got all that shit.

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,740
Motorcycle accidents or people
trying to do wheelies and they fall.

19
00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:05,520
It lands on them. Anything fucked
up on the Internet, dairy know.

20
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:10,530
It's funny he's got it all. Anything
crazy fucking, he's a hilarious guy.

21
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,320
But the fact that he could say
something like that, you know,

22
00:01:13,321 --> 00:01:17,460
like right after a fight, why is
taking shape? So Paul's was hot.

23
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,630
He starts selling tee shirts afterwards.
My balls aside tee shirt so they don't,

24
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:26,503
I got one.

25
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:32,010
I don't think people listen to anything
that's being said about the, let's say

26
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,860
I need one. Derek, please. I
need one of those shirts I need.

27
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,750
I need one of those shirts
please. Derek. Oh my God.

28
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:49,470
He's the best. He such a
character. Fight his ass off too.

29
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:53,430
So do what the, I know it's
your show, but uh, what,

30
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,410
how many fights do you do now?
And does anybody care about a fight?

31
00:01:58,411 --> 00:02:02,460
You don't announce childhood for
sure. Care. Yeah. I do a 10 a year,

32
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,860
10 or year events a year. I'm doing
like a big paper views, like 10.

33
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,440
There's a lot of them that are overseas.
I just

34
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:15,300
want you to be the voice right time.
I just don't have the time.

35
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,230
I don't have the time with
all the podcasts with doing
stand up and, you know,

36
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,900
making Netflix specials and shit
just don't time. Right. We have,

37
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,030
fuck now I know there's not like it better
when I do it once a month, like once,

38
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:29,670
like 10 times a year is basically
once a month or I liked,

39
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,220
I liked that better because
it seems like that's, um,

40
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,510
and it's the higher profile stuff.
I don't mind the aisle.

41
00:02:35,511 --> 00:02:38,430
There's a lot of fights that are
not that high profile that I lost.

42
00:02:38,431 --> 00:02:42,330
Like their Crosby, stills and
Nash and you're young, right?

43
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,440
You just pop in and do the big shows.
And that's funny. People, you know,

44
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,240
you don't care as much. I love it, man.
I love doing it. I still do. But, um.
