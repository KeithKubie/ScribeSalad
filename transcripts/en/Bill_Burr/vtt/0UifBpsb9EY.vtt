00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.100
Hey,
what's going on it's Bill Burr and it's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:05.101 --> 00:00:09.750
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and ahhh ha,

3
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.920
Ooh.
E I'm just checking in.
All mother bugging you.
Um,

4
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.610
uh,
what's going on?
I'm in the middle of this,
this acting job over the he,

5
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.450
so I got to do this before they picked me up in the sad van.

6
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.370
The Sad van that takes you to set for the excitement.
That's the rules.

7
00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:33.210
If you're going to have that much fun pretending to be somebody else,
right.

8
00:00:33.211 --> 00:00:35.760
Winning bar fights and all the shit you get to do as an actor.

9
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.630
All the shit you can't do in real life.
Um,

10
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.350
then yeah,
they got to pick you up in a sad van.

11
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.650
The van is basically a barebones usually all white with the gray vinyl and t

12
00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:55.230
just completely like,
you know,
four wheels powertrain,
this will get you there.

13
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.470
I call it the said Finn.
I don't know why.
Um,
but that is the one thing about it.

14
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.520
Great thing about acting as you get to do all this shit that you don't get to do

15
00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:03.570
in real life.
You know,

16
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.760
which is what's kind of cracking me up lately about action movies is how,

17
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.510
um,
I don't know when exactly the action hero genre started,
but I,

18
00:01:13.511 --> 00:01:15.570
I came up in the 80s.
So you know,
you had

19
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.650
Stallone Yad Schwartzenegger,
you had
John Claude van Damme and then you had,
um,

20
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.250
Steven Seagal in each year.
They try to,
you know,

21
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.940
Chuck Norris in each year.
They just tried to fucking,

22
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.100
Chuck Norris actually walk the line from like action hero in Karate Guy,
right?

23
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.930
He was somewhere between like Bruce Lee and,

24
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.160
and uh,
I dunno what fucking Chuck Norris,
I guess,

25
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.390
sorry,
my brain is fried.
We've been walking at work and long hours here.
Um,

26
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.340
but anyways,
those movies kind of already started off ridiculous.
You know,

27
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.970
we have 40 guys with machine guns and a guy would just fucking,

28
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.720
there's one movie where I think it's Schwartzenegger,

29
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.860
there's like 20 guys with machine guns shooting at him and there's all these

30
00:02:04.861 --> 00:02:09.210
potted plants and he just runs and kind of puts his hand up,
you know,

31
00:02:09.211 --> 00:02:13.410
to guard his face from all the thousands of bullets that are coming at them.

32
00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:14.560
And somehow they missed some

33
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.290
runs across this fucking foyer.

34
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.310
I mean they just kept getting more and more ridiculous,
you know,

35
00:02:23.311 --> 00:02:26.280
all the way up to like a Steven Seagal where he would,

36
00:02:26.281 --> 00:02:29.970
she would barely be moving and just beat the shit out of an entire bar.

37
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.750
I love when they would throw a punch at his face and he would just sort of lean

38
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.820
and just actually watched the fiscal passed his face.
Um,

39
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.990
so now just when you think that,
you know,
and the dialogue was always really bad.

40
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.930
So then what they did,
you know what?

41
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.450
They all went away because they just got so ridiculous.

42
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.240
They kind of just start making action movies for a long fucking time.

43
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.050
I think they did anyways.
Um,

44
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.720
I guess the born identities and those were action movies,
whatever.

45
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.750
All I know is that now they got the lady starring in a and m for some reason,

46
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:08.740
like I think just because people are so educated to how fucking stupid they
were,

47
00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:12.820
they actually finally decided to start writing decent dialogue,
you know,

48
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.900
as opposed to all this shit.
They gave a Stallone to be a a go for it,

49
00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.740
uh,
is a right,
oh,
what's his face?

50
00:03:20.741 --> 00:03:24.760
Schwartzenegger would rip off a steam pipe and throw it through somebody's chest

51
00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:29.080
and then be like,
let off some steam.
I mean,
it was literally that bad

52
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.820
both week.
My friend,
he's dead tired this really bad.

53
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.430
Um,
then they started actually writing scripts and uh,
I guess the,
yeah,

54
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.160
like the Bourne identity.
And then you had the,
uh,

55
00:03:44.161 --> 00:03:49.150
the other guy lock stock and for fucking who's amanuensis.
And uh,

56
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.430
so now they've got the ladies are doing them and they're actually writing good

57
00:03:53.431 --> 00:03:55.380
scripts.
But you know,

58
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.430
it is kind of funny to watch a woman like beating the shit out of two fucking

59
00:03:59.431 --> 00:04:03.510
400 pound guys.
I mean,
doesn't it get to the point where it's like,

60
00:04:03.511 --> 00:04:07.260
I don't give a fuck how much karate,
you know,
like I could just sit on you.

61
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.010
Cause that's the latest one.
The latest ones like atomic blonde and uh,

62
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.903
they just got off.

63
00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:22.960
They kind of pick smaller guys because it immediately takes me out of the movie

64
00:04:22.981 --> 00:04:27.720
like,
Jesus,
what the fuck?
Come on.
Really.
You know what I mean?

65
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.360
It's bad ass.
It's those women are in the UFC.

66
00:04:30.361 --> 00:04:32.910
They still fight other women because you know,

67
00:04:32.911 --> 00:04:36.450
and there's still weight classes because at the end of the day,

68
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.530
if you're tall enough in your fat enough,
you can eat a lot of those punches.

69
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.310
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

70
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.530
<v 0>Then you just,
you just smother.</v>

71
00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.770
I remember that like when you're old brother,

72
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.040
your older brother would sit on your chest and you be getting claustrophobia.

73
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.820
Huh?
Mom?
Like that they could just do that to you and they would,

74
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.730
they would win the,
I gotta keep my voicemail.
Um,
yeah,

75
00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.800
they would just win the fucking fight.
So,
um,

76
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.160
I'm not trying to be a party pooper here.
I'm going to go see atomic blonde.

77
00:05:03.161 --> 00:05:05.830
But it is getting to,
it's a comedy.
You know what it is.

78
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.730
It's a combination of those kinds of movies and then all those feminist tee

79
00:05:09.731 --> 00:05:13.630
shirts that I saw this week that's really started to fucking annoy me.
It's like,

80
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.330
do they think they're dumb enough that they're going to get into my fucking head

81
00:05:16.331 --> 00:05:20.480
with this shit?
You know,
I told you guys about that t shirt I saw,
right?

82
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.500
This woman was walking around with this t shirt.
It said,
um,
uh,

83
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.810
what is it said?
A a a little boy.
Oh,

84
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.550
you're a strong woman.
Scares a little boy,
but excites a man.

85
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.673
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

86
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.030
<v 0>Like what kind of guy would fall for that page?
One horseshit psychology.</v>

87
00:05:43.031 --> 00:05:47.050
Like I'm going to be all I want to be.
I wouldn't be considered a strong man.

88
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:48.970
It's like,
Hey lady,

89
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.970
how about you say something fucking impressive that I already talked about this

90
00:05:51.971 --> 00:05:54.900
already on Monday.
I can't remember anyways.
And said,

91
00:05:54.901 --> 00:05:58.160
why don't you fucking say something impressive?
You know,

92
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.970
instead of having your tee shirt warm up the crowd.
Um,

93
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.060
I can't remember if I told you guys this already,

94
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.210
but I wanted to make a t shirt that says a real woman isn't afraid to make her

95
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.980
Amanda Sandwich every once in awhile just to get the looks.

96
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.240
See that right there ladies.
That's exactly what we're talking about.

97
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.880
What are you smiling about?
Nia.
You liked that one

98
00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.170
<v 2>in the same little song again?
Huh?
You sit in the same song again.</v>

99
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:25.760
<v 0>I was thinking what's same old song again?</v>

100
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.873
<v 2>You're saying</v>

101
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.250
<v 0>what is my same old song yet?</v>

102
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.450
<v 2>You're saying mold fucking song.
You Sang.</v>

103
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:37.570
<v 0>Ooh.</v>

104
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:41.390
Like when women do stove and see things and have feeling you still singing that

105
00:06:41.391 --> 00:06:44.510
same old?
No,
I don't know that.
So what I'm saying old man,

106
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.560
that's not what I'm saying.
Prehistoric cave man.

107
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.940
Have you evolved at all in the time we've been together or are you just singing

108
00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.420
the same old song?
Oh,
if you'd let me finish,
I heard everything that you said.

109
00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:57.650
All right.
I heard this.

110
00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.550
A drastic tee shirt isn't a tee shirt a little ridiculous.
I mean,

111
00:07:01.551 --> 00:07:05.630
if I had the male version of like,
you know,
a real woman would blah,
blah,
blah,

112
00:07:05.631 --> 00:07:08.580
blah,
blah,
a little,
your take on it is actually very funny,
but

113
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.550
it's still,
what were you talking to?
You were talking about how,

114
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.560
oh,
the,
the women in the action films like beating up like big guys,

115
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:23.000
but you're willing to suspend your disbelief that vin diesel can drive a car

116
00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:27.950
through.
Not One,
but two or three buildings in fact.
Oh No,
I'm not.

117
00:07:27.951 --> 00:07:31.820
It'd be fine.
No,
I'm not.
And be like,
Whoa,

118
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:35.690
that was quite a ride.
Or whatever it is that he didn't know.
It's stupid.
No,

119
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.920
it's absolutely stupid.

120
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:40.960
They drive from one building to another fish tail before that.

121
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.490
It's completely stupid.
I don't watch those movies.
Right.

122
00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.610
So I'm just saying it was all action films.

123
00:07:46.611 --> 00:07:48.680
You guys suspend your disbelief a little bit.

124
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:53.480
Daniel Craig can't beat up like 20 guys at one time.
No,
I've been to the movie.

125
00:07:53.481 --> 00:07:56.300
He does know.
Yeah.
But here's the thing.
What they did was,

126
00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:01.540
what they did was they started in the 80s and it was immediately ridiculous in

127
00:08:02.091 --> 00:08:03.380
the dialogue was horrific.

128
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:08.540
So then what they did was they started to may have better dialogue and it

129
00:08:08.541 --> 00:08:11.060
actually had the guys get hurt a little bit with like,
you know,

130
00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:15.980
fucking Bruce Willis had his bloody foot on the glass and his wife Peter just

131
00:08:15.981 --> 00:08:20.720
kept getting dirtier and dirtier.
So they tried to make them real.

132
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.600
But I'm just saying when I was watching that atomic blood,

133
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:27.770
she's like beating the shit out of these two guys.
They're like 260 pounds each.

134
00:08:27.771 --> 00:08:31.510
So skies.
Yeah,
once they get their paws on you,
I don't give a f if you,

135
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.280
if somebody outweighs you by a hundred pounds,
once they get their hands on,

136
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:39.080
he is fucking over and there's two of them,
but it's a movie,
so we go with it.

137
00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:43.340
Right.
I know,
but it just gets too,
there is a certain level,

138
00:08:43.341 --> 00:08:44.570
like there's a bunch of them.
Like,

139
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.440
I never used to watch the Bourne identity just because the way they would edit

140
00:08:48.441 --> 00:08:51.770
it.
I went to one of them.
I swear to God I almost had a seizure.
Yeah.

141
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:56.210
The editing was like,
uh,
uh,
that was that,
that,
that one done.

142
00:08:56.270 --> 00:09:00.780
A Woody Harrelson did,
uh,
the murderers of the boyfriend,
girlfriend,

143
00:09:00.781 --> 00:09:04.830
murderers.
Natural born killers.
Yeah.
The way that was edited,
it just,

144
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.400
it was just like,
you know,
this is fucking,
I can't,
I can't watch this.
Right.

145
00:09:08.401 --> 00:09:10.740
Then the quick cuts.
Yeah,
but that's what you're talking about.

146
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:15.090
You're so bombarded with images.
I get it.
Slow the edits down please.

147
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.460
Right?
Yeah.
There was one,

148
00:09:17.461 --> 00:09:21.480
Matt Damon was like fighting a guy inside a bathroom in like his elbow would go

149
00:09:21.481 --> 00:09:24.840
back.
They follow that through the wall and then back to the guys head.

150
00:09:24.841 --> 00:09:27.360
It's like cheese.
It's fucking Christ.
You know,

151
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:31.260
if these NFL running backs are like,
can't even move until Tuesday.

152
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.670
The level of fighting that this guy would do on just like every six hours.

153
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.090
<v 3>Oh my God.
Wait,
did you see that video?</v>

154
00:09:38.091 --> 00:09:43.040
Speaking of NFL running backs of the ex NFL player who ran through that plate

155
00:09:43.041 --> 00:09:43.700
glass,

156
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.900
that glass door and his wife thinks he's suffering from some like you know,

157
00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.260
post traumatic stress in his brain.
It's called something CTE.

158
00:09:51.261 --> 00:09:54.320
Did you see that video?
He know,
but I'm trying not to laugh.

159
00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:58.570
He had literary sprints through a glass or when he doesn't remember doing it.

160
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:01.570
Don't love itself.

161
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:03.050
<v 0>It is definitely sad,</v>

162
00:10:03.051 --> 00:10:07.070
but that is fucking hilarious that he's just like walking into a dental office

163
00:10:07.071 --> 00:10:11.570
and all of a sudden he just,
he is 60 49 woo woo.

164
00:10:11.571 --> 00:10:14.890
Said,
Huh?
I'm just fucking fun.

165
00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:19.580
I can run through it.
No,
that should there it's ruining their brains.

166
00:10:19.581 --> 00:10:22.060
Like isn't that like what are they going to do?
What are they going to do with,

167
00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:24.320
did he spike his wallet after he went through the window?

168
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:29.450
<v 3>No,
because he fell down after he crafted the glass.</v>

169
00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:33.640
As long as he just walked in with his wife and all of a sudden he just fucking

170
00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:34.840
mid conversation.

171
00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:38.890
He was talking to police or something about something.

172
00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:43.450
Maybe he was having some sort of episode and then he just took off and he ran

173
00:10:43.451 --> 00:10:45.830
right through this.
Like Glassdoor.
I got it.
Okay.

174
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:49.300
<v 0>Grocery store.
Was he black or white?
Black.
All right.
He's talking to the cops.</v>

175
00:10:49.301 --> 00:10:52.150
Yeah,
there's probably some shit from his childhood.
You can't blame the NFL Dick.

176
00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:53.680
I thought the cops don't treat you guys well.

177
00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:54.613
<v 3>He</v>

178
00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.370
ran through a glass door and he doesn't remember doing it.

179
00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.710
So his wife was like,
I think he's got,

180
00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:05.890
his brain is all fucked up from playing football.

181
00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:07.270
So where are they going to do about that?

182
00:11:07.271 --> 00:11:10.320
Can they put more padding in the helmet or like how?

183
00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:11.300
<v 0>No,
cause what Hap,</v>

184
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:16.330
what it is is your brain sits in fluid so it's going to take some fucking like

185
00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:21.640
crazy brainiac to have like something that somehow keeps your brain stationary.

186
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:24.490
The helmet fucking moves,
but you had,

187
00:11:24.491 --> 00:11:27.490
doesn't see your brain doesn't smash against it.
I mean,
personally,

188
00:11:27.491 --> 00:11:32.290
if I was Oj Simpson's lawyers back in 1994 that's what I would've said.

189
00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:36.490
I would've said Oj suffers from CTE.

190
00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:41.380
He had been watching the cooking channel or this Ginsu knife commercial and he

191
00:11:41.381 --> 00:11:43.990
just got a little confused.
Well,

192
00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:46.570
whatever you want to Ron Goldman,

193
00:11:46.571 --> 00:11:48.880
look like Vince Ferragamo and he never liked the ramps.

194
00:11:48.881 --> 00:11:52.090
I mean that's the best I could have come up with.
Sure,
sure.
Well,

195
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.990
it's a comedy podcast.
If you bring something up,
what am I supposed to do?
No,

196
00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:01.450
I'm laughing.
Okay.
On the inside.
It's an inner cry Bitch.

197
00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:06.400
Um,
yeah.
Did you see that?
You want to see,
okay,

198
00:12:06.401 --> 00:12:09.100
now if we're going to just talk about horrible fucking things,
did you see that,

199
00:12:09.101 --> 00:12:10.000
that fear,

200
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:15.360
that carnival out there and I'm in Ohio with somebody went on where like one of

201
00:12:15.641 --> 00:12:20.110
those tilt the world rides in the fucking thing snapped and all these poor

202
00:12:20.111 --> 00:12:22.720
people went flying through the air.
One person died.

203
00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:26.440
This little girl was laying on the ground is one of the most horrific things

204
00:12:26.441 --> 00:12:27.274
I've ever seen.

205
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:31.420
And then like investigators are looking into to see what the problem is.

206
00:12:31.421 --> 00:12:34.600
It's like,
you know what the fucking problem is?
They don't maintain those things.

207
00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:40.720
I used to,
uh,
I used to go to that a,
I don't want to,
I don't get in trouble here.

208
00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:43.023
<v 4>Uh,</v>

209
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:46.250
<v 0>it rhymes with seven in a homophobic slur.</v>

210
00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.393
<v 4>No,
no.</v>

211
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.980
<v 0>I should say I'm going to do one,
six homophobic slur.</v>

212
00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:00.160
You don't know that one.
You used to go to a wet,
what do you weigh?
What does it,

213
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:03.280
what is a,
was a country wave flag.
Yeah.

214
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:07.240
Oh yes,
yes.
So I went there and

215
00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:14.320
so I went there,
seven banners,

216
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:17.530
banners for seven brothers.

217
00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.520
Why can't you say where it was you think they're going to like,

218
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:24.220
not want to?
I made it happened.

219
00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:29.370
I was at the ones in that rhymes with a ring wield massive two sets and um,

220
00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:35.780
I go to,
I was,
I was on the roller coaster,
right.
And uh,

221
00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:40.800
we got off it and the time it took us to stand in line and the ride next to us,

222
00:13:41.021 --> 00:13:44.800
we lined up,
you know,
the line moved twice.
We just heard Bam.

223
00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:47.260
And the rollercoaster that was ending,

224
00:13:47.261 --> 00:13:51.340
the ride did not stop and rear ended the ride in front of it.

225
00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:52.780
And this woman broke her cheekbone.

226
00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:55.840
You remember the time we went to that other one that rhymes with the six

227
00:13:55.841 --> 00:13:57.750
homophobic slurs,
um,

228
00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.850
out in a new war Z and we were,

229
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:04.180
we were in that superman roller coaster and we got like,

230
00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.810
we were waiting to get off it and then it would move and then we were stuck in

231
00:14:07.811 --> 00:14:11.980
those things.
Yeah,
it was really horrific.
How many minutes?
30 minutes.
No,

232
00:14:11.981 --> 00:14:15.670
it wasn't 30 it was probably like four minutes.
Five minutes.
30 minutes.

233
00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:16.751
Might've been like 10.

234
00:14:16.751 --> 00:14:21.400
But I was sitting there and I felt you started to freak out.
And I was like,
well,

235
00:14:21.401 --> 00:14:24.310
if I want it to,
I could wiggle my way out of it.
And the second I couldn't move.

236
00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.830
All of a sudden I started feeling shortness of breath and I was like,

237
00:14:26.831 --> 00:14:29.140
hold it together.
Bill holds it together.
Definitely.

238
00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:32.770
We actually went to that place.
I assume that was my idea.

239
00:14:32.771 --> 00:14:36.760
I don't think he would ever suggest going to a theme park as a date.

240
00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:38.800
And you didn't,
you weren't you?

241
00:14:38.801 --> 00:14:43.530
The one that taught me that a macaroni and cheese is not a main dish.
Yes,
I was.

242
00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:47.020
I'm,
I'm this weird combination of,
you know,

243
00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:51.950
professional white collars and white trash.
Oh yeah.

244
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.660
We weren't good with money.
That was a period we were not good at money,

245
00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:01.610
so we used to have a tray.
A macaroni cheese would toast.
Yeah.

246
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:07.100
It's fucking delicious.
The craft frozen.
You just throw it in there.
God,

247
00:15:07.101 --> 00:15:11.540
how dare you.
You know that white people are the enemy.
Agel really cheese.

248
00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:16.580
It's pasta.
It's from Italians so you can only take 50% of the credit.

249
00:15:16.581 --> 00:15:21.350
Stallions will be offended that you use Kraft macaroni and cheese.
Wait a minute.

250
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.640
I times do they make macaroni and cheese.

251
00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:26.430
That's not their thing yet is macaroni and cheese.

252
00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.740
That's one of the immediate Italian,

253
00:15:27.741 --> 00:15:29.780
that's one of the first things that they say when they meet them.
No,

254
00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:34.880
you want some macaroni and cheese?
Maybe beef on toast.

255
00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.420
Now remember we can allocating,

256
00:15:38.421 --> 00:15:41.900
I made fun of me because I was like making a jet and we went out to dinner the

257
00:15:41.901 --> 00:15:45.080
other night and I was sort of like lovingly doing this kind of like,

258
00:15:45.081 --> 00:15:48.680
no you weren't.
It was because,
because we were in,
okay.
First of all,

259
00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:51.710
when I'm on my podcast and I'm just being silly now,

260
00:15:51.711 --> 00:15:54.370
if you did what you did in little Italy the other night in the,

261
00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:57.800
in this apartment,
I would have laughed.
We were sitting there,
right?

262
00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:02.660
I took Nia to we,
we got this restaurant when I first met my lovely wife,

263
00:16:02.661 --> 00:16:07.610
I took her to like 10 years ago.
Right?
So I'm trying like all day go.
Yeah.

264
00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:11.750
Saying let's whatever saint,
let's fucking go there.
She's like,
oh,

265
00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.170
I want to go to the stone cold creamery and fucking uh,

266
00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:19.100
what's that other stupid burger place that everybody eats?
Like it's crack.

267
00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.790
Let shake shack shake shack like this and say,

268
00:16:22.791 --> 00:16:26.990
I want to go to shake shack over this.
Anyway,
whatever.
Just tell the story.
We go,

269
00:16:26.991 --> 00:16:27.361
you want to,

270
00:16:27.361 --> 00:16:31.690
she wanted to go to some shiny place and I wanted to go to the fucking old

271
00:16:31.691 --> 00:16:35.750
school.
Homestyle you know,
in order like chicken Palmer's Sean.
It's like,

272
00:16:35.751 --> 00:16:38.210
is that it does that,
how long did you hammer this?

273
00:16:38.211 --> 00:16:40.010
That this is only one chicken processes,

274
00:16:40.011 --> 00:16:43.790
like nine chicken breasts and then you fucking plow your way through it.

275
00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.470
You wish you didn't need it,
but it was delicious.

276
00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:49.550
So we'd go there and they're playing all this Italian music,
right?

277
00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:52.700
They got Dana One when the moon hits your eye,

278
00:16:52.701 --> 00:16:57.590
like a big pizza applied at so more.
And then Nia does,

279
00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:01.310
you know that thing that you know in Hollywood movies,
one of the Italian,

280
00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:05.140
like something when he puts his thumb between his index in his middle finger,

281
00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.990
brings them together with both hands,
like Glenn back and forth,

282
00:17:08.991 --> 00:17:11.510
back and forth like that.
So good a pizza sauce.

283
00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.660
So the songs on and Nia starts doing that at the table,

284
00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:20.420
sticking a bottom that Butler g you book a book book in a fun wigs and bounce in

285
00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:25.020
louder the music.
They were playing
[inaudible] Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah.
And I was like,

286
00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:27.630
you know,
I was just doing the whole,
and I said,
nick,

287
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:31.100
what if we were up in Harlem and some soul food restaurant?
Okay.

288
00:17:31.101 --> 00:17:34.450
And they started playing some fucking RB or whatever the fuck you guys are

289
00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:38.290
listening to.
And I started to doing a bad version of some break dance and shit.

290
00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:40.850
Stick at my bottom lip out.
You'd be like,

291
00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:44.300
if you don't stop fucking doing that and you're sitting there with a white man,

292
00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:48.500
Nia.
Huh?
What,
what do you think,
what do you think would happen?
Saying just show,

293
00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:52.950
hey,
it was out of respect.
So with culturally insensitive of me to do that,

294
00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.890
I didn't give a shit.
I thought it was funny,
but I didn't need the waiters.

295
00:17:55.891 --> 00:17:57.350
We still hadn't gotten all of our foods,

296
00:17:57.351 --> 00:17:59.070
so I didn't need you fucking with our food.

297
00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:03.060
They had the whole rack of glasses and stuff like right by the window,

298
00:18:03.061 --> 00:18:05.130
like rent behind.
We were sitting,
I mean,
come on,

299
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.640
can I ask you a question if I took you to Chinatown was delicious though by the

300
00:18:08.641 --> 00:18:13.050
way.
Deletional ish.
Delish now if I took you to Binga leash,

301
00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:17.430
if I took you to Chinatown.
Okay.
And they would play in the,

302
00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.750
you know what did did that,
that,
that,

303
00:18:18.751 --> 00:18:22.110
that that day we went in because apparently that's offensive.
Okay.

304
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:27.020
Have you started playing high ya Ya,
Ya,
Ya,
Ya,
Ya,
Ya know,
if fewer,

305
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:31.080
if they started playing some,
everybody was Kung Fu fighting.
Yeah.
What would you,

306
00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:35.350
would you be doing?
Hey girl.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Start doing.

307
00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:44.430
Everybody was counting who find it there will be offensive.
Abby.
Yeah.
All right.

308
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.980
I mean,
I don't know.
I wasn't,
I really wasn't,

309
00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:48.780
I'm not trying to be political correct guy.

310
00:18:48.781 --> 00:18:50.640
I'm just trying to get people not to spit in my food.

311
00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:55.870
That's all I'm trying to do.

312
00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:00.910
Talking to the waiter like a by that I'm bringing some aid fucking Vinny

313
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:05.340
[inaudible] like I was thrown into that shit.
Like I was on the fucking Sopranos.

314
00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:10.820
I wasn't doing that.
All right.
I mean,
your,
your point is a maid.
Yeah.

315
00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:13.080
My point is not about being culturally sensitive.

316
00:19:13.081 --> 00:19:15.420
It's about having people not fuck with your food.
Okay.

317
00:19:15.421 --> 00:19:18.600
You want to do that on your own.
Okay.
Your own time.

318
00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:22.710
You want to go on and get a Bagel and be like,
Oh hey,
they with a lady,

319
00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.640
you gotta get an everything Bagel like you never had before,

320
00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:31.530
if you know what I mean.
They're not,
I mean everything.

321
00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:36.870
[inaudible]
is that a month's of boulder?
Um,

322
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:40.860
anyways,
uh,

323
00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.320
well I don't have to wrap it up cause I don't,

324
00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:49.930
I like the way we've been doing 20 minutes.
Oh,
I got to read some.
Ah,

325
00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:54.470
I gotta read some,
uh,
advertising advertising sometime,

326
00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.530
but I know I'm not supposed to because why aren't you supposed to?

327
00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.360
Because they want you to read the advertise.

328
00:19:59.361 --> 00:20:03.530
No one's no one's paying for me to read it.
They want you to read it.
Yeah.

329
00:20:03.531 --> 00:20:05.780
Everybody knows that.
When did she have to bring that up?
I know,

330
00:20:05.781 --> 00:20:09.020
but I'm just saying I want some weird woman thing trying to mind.

331
00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:12.320
Fuck mean to get,
yes.
That's it.
You can put it on a tee shirt.
Yep.

332
00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:14.560
<v 5>[inaudible] Yup.</v>

333
00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:16.600
<v 0>It's a great one.
The chief hold on me.</v>

334
00:20:16.601 --> 00:20:19.900
The other night we were laying in bed and all the lights were out and we both

335
00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:22.690
tired and there's a lamp like across the room sitting there.
She's like,

336
00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:27.720
how do you turn that lamp off?
And I'm like,
I don't know.

337
00:20:27.721 --> 00:20:30.750
Nia,
you get up,
you walk over and you turn it off.

338
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:38.850
Like,
Oh,
I'll show you.
How dumb do you think I am?
I am dumb.
I'm not that dumb.

339
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:44.280
Pena.
Go take some karate classes and beat up all my tall friends.

340
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:48.070
I want to see that.
All right,
the Tux.
Everybody.

341
00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:53.380
Um,
see you see this idea.
This is another progression for your people.

342
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:56.260
What are you talking about?
He used to just back in the day.

343
00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:01.210
He's just be the white Tux.
No,
no.
This isn't one of those things.

344
00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.630
Let's see how you can get through this.
This read.
Okay.

345
00:21:04.631 --> 00:21:07.980
Nice and slow so you don't mess up.
Oh,

346
00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:10.750
you can make fun of me all you want.
But you married me.

347
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:15.180
You pitched your wagon to this wasn't listened to what you finished your,
yeah.

348
00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:19.840
Listen to what you hitched your wagon to the Black Tux.
You know,

349
00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:23.980
there's only so many opportunities in life to wear a Tuxedo.

350
00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:26.770
That's true at chunks.
A tux.

351
00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:31.900
So when your big day or special event rolls around or you'd have to go to court,

352
00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:36.830
you got to go to court.
That's a good move.
Show up in a Tuxedo.
Your honor.

353
00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:39.710
May I approach the bench with my Cumber Bun?

354
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:43.900
So when your big day or special event rolls around this summer,
look,

355
00:21:43.901 --> 00:21:48.901
just as great as you feel with suits from the black tux.com with high quality

356
00:21:49.091 --> 00:21:54.091

357
00:21:54.191 --> 00:21:56.200
doorstep.
Sorry,
that was all in capital letters.

358
00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:59.080
The Black Tux gives you a new way to rent.

359
00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.790
Why do you keep putting the emphasis on the cause?

360
00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.130
I always watched football and they go the Ohio State University.
Okay,

361
00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:09.730
all only the capital letter once and I'll yell at capital level noise,
right?

362
00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:12.220
Plus with their frame home.
Try on's.

363
00:22:12.221 --> 00:22:17.221
You get to saying the fit and feel the quality of your suits months before your

364
00:22:18.431 --> 00:22:22.870
event and the best part is it's completely done online.

365
00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.970
What fucking coke had wrote this shit?
Now this is the best word now.

366
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:36.490
That's the best word.
All right,
the black Tux dark.

369

The white one in the gray one suits like these.

370
00:22:49.811 --> 00:22:52.570
Usually retail for $1,200 really?

371
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:57.580
But at the black Tux they start at just $95.
Why does this itch?

People are just going to stop it until enough of or looking.

382
00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:39.310
Addiction is smelly socks.
All wadded up.
Chicken Marsala stains all over

383
00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:44.710
dose.
What else,
Amy?
I guess what?

384
00:23:44.711 --> 00:23:46.760

Sometimes how my time is here.
That means it's time for family vacations,

395
00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:35.780
sunscreen and barbecues.
Uh,

396
00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:39.530
but the most important thing to do this summer is prepare for your family's

397
00:24:39.531 --> 00:24:42.410
future with an estate plan from legal zoom.
Exactly.

398
00:24:42.411 --> 00:24:44.900
But if the Hibachi blows up in your face there,

399
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:49.640
and next thing you know somebody doesn't have a flat,
sorry,

national make a will month is right around the corner.

401
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.760
And that's the perfect time to make sure you're prepared for the future.

402
00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:59.750
How do you,
who do you have to pay off to have the month be about you?
You know,

403
00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:05.480
when they're like,
today is national pancake day.
Somebody lobbies for that.

404
00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:07.730
And how relieved are those senators?
You know,

405
00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:10.940
usually there's some sort of pill that's literally going to fucking kill

406
00:25:10.941 --> 00:25:13.340
children in some God forsaken place.

407
00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:18.770
This is this next bill's about pancakes and for once people with red ties and

408
00:25:18.771 --> 00:25:23.120
blue ties can all get along because who doesn't like pancakes?
Um,

409
00:25:23.121 --> 00:25:26.810
it helps to know what your options are.

That means you go in a sec.

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:03.900
If you transitioned from woman to a man,

454
00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:30.080

That's one arena I'm willing to step into.
I'm not,

455
00:28:30.081 --> 00:28:32.570
I'm not willing to step into that conversation cause I don't,

456
00:28:32.571 --> 00:28:37.100
I don't know anything about why because I'm not saying they can't join the coast

457
00:28:37.101 --> 00:28:41.900
guard.
Well,
Trump did.

00:28:41.901 --> 00:28:46.430
Okay.
Sorry.
Um,

No.

459
00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:49.880
Who the fuck cares?
I wish he banned red heads from going to war.
I'd be like,

460
00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:54.800
Whoa,

462
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:03.141
Oh good.

463
00:29:03.141 --> 00:29:07.340
I don't have to go down to some godforsaken bootcamp and get screamed at by some

464
00:29:07.341 --> 00:29:11.990
fucking guy whose mom never hugged him.
I get it.
Where I'm from.

465
00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:16.580
Livestock into homosexuals are from,
I understand sir.
Wow.

466
00:29:16.581 --> 00:29:19.730
Look at all the extra stripes you have on your shirt versus mine.

467
00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:22.430
Why in God's name I want to go do that

468
00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:28.520
to get a free pair of timberlands.
I would definitely be that guy.

469
00:29:28.521 --> 00:29:32.120
If I was in the military,
who at the end of my hitch,

470
00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:33.530
whatever the terminology would be,

471
00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:36.530
I would definitely be the guy who takes apart his weapon.

472
00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:39.650
It starts to mail it home,
bolt by bolt.

473
00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:45.640
That's why I didn't join.
I would do some dumb shit like that.

474
00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:49.720
I try to figure out how to take apart a grenade so I could be the hit at the,

475
00:29:49.721 --> 00:29:53.200
at the 4th of July party.
Um,

476
00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:56.650
What do we got here at 29 minutes and 54 seconds.
All right.

477
00:29:56.651 --> 00:30:01.000
I'm contractually obligated to do 30 seconds.
I mean 30 minutes.
Um,

478
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:06.250
so,

Uh Huh.
Contract.
I have a contract with the people.

479
00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:09.310
Oh yes.
I have a contract.

480
00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:13.570
I told them back in 2007 that I was going to make podcasts and great again.

481
00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:18.370
Hey,

We should think about how much money you think Obama is making tonight.

482
00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:21.380
Let's see.
Oh Dude,

He's,

483
00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:25.720

Actually.
I don't think he is.

484
00:30:25.721 --> 00:30:29.500
I think Kevin's still make it more,
he is a $69 million toward,

485
00:30:29.501 --> 00:30:33.760

486
00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:37.240
you know,
thousand points of light.

487
00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:43.480
He's getting his bribe money near him.
And what's his wife's name?
Penelope.

488
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:48.520
How dare you?
Her name is Michelle.
Michelle.
I know she tweeted so much.

489
00:30:48.521 --> 00:30:52.240
I should have known what her name was.
Don't ever disrespect Michelle Obama.
Yeah.

490
00:30:52.241 --> 00:30:55.150
Why do they try to act like the wife or the guy who was actually doing the job

491
00:30:55.151 --> 00:30:57.160
is so God damn important.
No,

it doesn't.
You know what I've,

555
00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:36.420
I've had enough arguments that people,
God bless him and his Roger Moore Tuxedo.

556
00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:41.460
Did you talk the,
the elevator fight?
Have you come?
I'll talk about it.

557
00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:43.780
Oh,
I'll talk about it.
Right.
That hotdog,

558
00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:47.910
I thought Jay Z,

559
00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:52.940
regardless of whatever the fuck he said that set her off showed unbelievable

560
00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:56.370
restraint.
Okay.

561
00:35:57.090 --> 00:36:01.020
Getting kicked by a woman in high heel shoes.
I've been there.
Okay.
That fight,

562
00:36:01.021 --> 00:36:01.950
it fucking hurts.

563
00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:06.570
And he kept taking it to the hands and there was a moment at one,

564
00:36:06.571 --> 00:36:10.800
I only watched it once.
There was a time,
like one of the last times she hit him,

565
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:13.500
she even flinched cause she was like,
yeah,

566
00:36:13.501 --> 00:36:16.800
at this point he decided to deserve to get punched in the face.

567
00:36:16.801 --> 00:36:19.590
You see her flinch,
she spit at him.

568
00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:23.190
That was what was really awful.

569
00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:25.470
That's what I forgot to do to that driver this morning.

570
00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:30.000
That would have been going at him.
Browning bitch moved.
I never do that.
No,
no,
no.

571
00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:34.230
But you know,
their family has problems like anybody else's family.

572
00:36:34.231 --> 00:36:36.480
I feel like if anything,
it just,
you know,

573
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:41.220
it just goes to show you that you shouldn't feel bad when you know your uncles

574
00:36:41.221 --> 00:36:43.770
or whatever starts screaming at each other over thanksgiving.

575
00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:44.911
That is funny though,

576
00:36:44.911 --> 00:36:47.670
when you really think about how many people are toured judging them.

577
00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:52.590
Actually there's footage that exists somewhere of their family fighting in an

578
00:36:52.591 --> 00:36:57.080
elevator.
It's just they're not famous and nobody cares.
Yes.
So it's,

579
00:36:57.390 --> 00:37:00.770
it just gets taped over.
Yeah.
I feel like a lot,

580
00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:04.080
there are a lot more like physical fights that happen in families between

581
00:37:04.081 --> 00:37:08.730
siblings and stuff that most people wouldn't want to admit.
You know?
So it's,
I,

582
00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:11.760
it's,
I,
I really don't think it's that big of a deal.
I will watching it,

583
00:37:11.761 --> 00:37:13.350
like salons stop.

584
00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:18.330
He definitely said something fucked up because Beyonce did do anything.
Yes.

585
00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:21.900
She was with her sister.
She was probably like bio.

586
00:37:21.901 --> 00:37:25.860
That's what happens when you say x,
Y,
and z.
That was her vibe.

587
00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:34.530
Uh,
yeah.
So,
but I,
it's not that big of a deal.
I don't feel like,
you know.
No,

588
00:37:34.531 --> 00:37:37.020
that's kind of a big no,
that's a def that's,
that's over.

589
00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:41.370
Their relationship is fucking over.
Eh.
If money wasn't involved,

590
00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:45.810
whose relationship?
Jaycees and uh,
the fucking large.
Yeah.

591
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:50.880
No side kick there.
She's not as she is.
Come on.

592
00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:56.430
She's frank.
Frank Stallone.
No,
no.
She has a really good album.

593
00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.980
I love her music and she has great style.
No,

594
00:37:58.981 --> 00:38:01.470
she does famous as Beyonce obviously,

595
00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:04.270
and all these dumb ass Internet people on Twitter.

596
00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:06.090
Like I've never even heard of her until knows.

597
00:38:06.091 --> 00:38:09.160
You should be thankful she got any consistent,
this is my,

598
00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:13.920
my theory because you don't know music beyond what's on your top 40 radio

599
00:38:13.921 --> 00:38:16.230
station.
Hey,
play in the morning while you're going to work.

600
00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:18.720
Doesn't mean that this person isn't talented.
No,

601
00:38:18.721 --> 00:38:21.840
I just get annoyed with cheese first.
The vegans down the music lovers,

602
00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:25.163
this is the deal.

603
00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:30.500
The only way she can make it is if she's in the same group is Beyonce because

604
00:38:30.961 --> 00:38:33.240
that's the way it fucking works.
There's no way.

605
00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:38.300
Never in the history of two people in the same family trying to be as solo

606
00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:42.640
artists.
Have they ever made it.
They always,
you got to be together.

607
00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:47.410
The Everly brothers,
the Jackson five,
the Osmonds.

608
00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:51.340
And then what happens is if somebody breaks out of it and then the rest of them

609
00:38:51.341 --> 00:38:55.330
go back to the dinner table going,
I have an album out to whenever he's like,

610
00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:59.740
yeah,
we don't care.
I know I'm your mother.
I don't care.

611
00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:05.200
Michael is special.
Donny and Marie are the best.

612
00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:10.960
They're younger than you.
They're cuter than you.
And Jesus likes them better.

613
00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:12.700
And that's what happens and you're fucked.

614
00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:17.740
So the only move she had was when Beyonce was on the way up.

615
00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:20.200
She should have been in Destiny's child.
Look at me,

616
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:24.600
look at me on the other side of the fence.
Just calling off groups here.
Bill.

617
00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:27.970
She was well machine.
That group.
She was like a bad,

618
00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:32.370
it was Tim with holes and a that chick from a call from uh,
uh,

619
00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:34.860
the one on the roller skates.
Tootie wasn't sure that

620
00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:40.900
it is his name and black people now.
Yeah.
Um,
no,

621
00:39:40.901 --> 00:39:44.380
she was like a backup dancer.
She went on tour with them when she was younger.

622
00:39:44.381 --> 00:39:48.660
She had an album when she was younger.
She got pregnant.
She moved on to like,

623
00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:53.750
I was in Oklahoma,
somebody as a backup dancer.
I was remember that ACDC,

624
00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:58.030
that ACDC video.
Who made who when I add all the Angus is up there.
I was,

625
00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:01.990
I was one of the Angus.
She also,
she also didn't really people I didn't know.

626
00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:06.850
I wish I did.
Hey,
she also wrote quite a few of Beyonce songs.
I'm like call road.

627
00:40:06.851 --> 00:40:11.290
Some of destiny trots on it too,
so you know she's,
she's got other talents,

628
00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:14.740
things,
you know.
Yeah.
She doesn't need to be as famous like that.

629
00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:18.070
She's like that chick and I say,

630
00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:22.010
Hey Linda Berry.
No,

631
00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:25.510
her name is Linda.
Power isn't,

632
00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:30.540
no it isn't she the leads is it Jessica [inaudible] you know I'm right.

633
00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:33.130
I don't know what her name is.
Four non blondes.
Yeah.

634
00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:36.850
Lead singer Linda Perry recently married to Sarah Gilbert from Roseanne.

635
00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:41.500
Did you know that you could play Darlene?
They're either married.

636
00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:45.640
The last time I saw her at Linda Perry,
not the last time like I see her,

637
00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:48.580
but I saw her four non blondes chick.

638
00:40:48.581 --> 00:40:51.520
Isn't she like fuck she's gotta be my age probably.

639
00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:54.280
What's she going around at that little girl for?
What are you talking about?

640
00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:58.000
Sarah Gilbert's older than I am.
I saw the show the other day.
She's like 12.

641
00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:01.150
That's cause she looks great.
She's joking.

642
00:41:01.151 --> 00:41:04.470
Like I was watching the fucking TV show here.

643
00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:06.910
I'm just bombing all over the place.

644
00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:24.343
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

645
00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:32.403
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

646
00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:33.843
<v 1>wow.</v>

647
00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:53.113
[inaudible]

648
00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:54.300
<v 9>Hey,
what's going on?</v>

649
00:41:54.301 --> 00:41:58.860
It's bill bar and it is the Monday morning podcast for a Monday,

650
00:41:58.861 --> 00:42:00.120
July 27th,

651
00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:05.750
two south 2009 2000 2009 and uh,

652
00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:10.260
uh,
the year of the content,

653
00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:17.720
I can never remember what year it is.
And the Chinese knew it's,

654
00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:22.200
is it the year of the pig?
I think it is the year of the pig,
isn't it?

655
00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:26.610
I saw a thing the other night where,
you know those shows where they have people,

656
00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:28.140
they flip houses,

657
00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:33.630
they buy some dilapidated Hunka shipped from some old lady who just died when

658
00:42:33.631 --> 00:42:38.260
she fucking passed out face first and her fucking dog food cause it got damn

659
00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:41.340
backers killed her formal referral.
One K.
Right.

660
00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:45.470
Do all people have 401ks do they have that back in the day when they were buying

661
00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:50.160
war bonds and my dog sleeping over there,
look at her fucking adorable.

662
00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:55.320
Um,
anyways,
um,
yeah,
I was watching this thing.
We know they flipped.

663
00:42:55.321 --> 00:42:59.400
I hate those shows where they flip the houses because uh,

664
00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:02.040
you just see people getting completely fucked over.

665
00:43:02.041 --> 00:43:04.620
You get a couple of shitheads,
they don't even know what they're doing.

666
00:43:04.621 --> 00:43:06.990
And then they go in there and they,
uh,

667
00:43:06.991 --> 00:43:11.820
they go to Grossman's all around with some awful hardware store,
home depot.

668
00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:15.630
They go down there and they buy a bunch of cheap tiles and then everybody walks

669
00:43:15.631 --> 00:43:20.310
in like,
oh my God,
it's beautiful.
Look,
look at the tile work.

670
00:43:20.311 --> 00:43:24.740
And it was like done by this fucking accountant,
you know?
Hey,

671
00:43:24.910 --> 00:43:26.010
do they know this old house?

672
00:43:26.011 --> 00:43:29.610
Like it's the guy gave a shit about the house now that they should just,

673
00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:32.730
they just showing people getting fucked over.

674
00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:36.600
I can't stand that when people walk in and then they think that the place looks

675
00:43:36.601 --> 00:43:41.601
amazing because they changed the brown paint to read and that opens the room up

676
00:43:41.911 --> 00:43:42.360
or whatever.

677
00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:46.320
Fucking mind trick they used and it's still the exact same piece of shit house.

678
00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:51.150
And these guys sell it to these fucking morons for an extra 40 grand when all

679
00:43:51.151 --> 00:43:53.910
they had to do was buy a bucket of paint,
you know?

680
00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:56.490
You know what that reminds me of?

681
00:43:56.491 --> 00:44:01.491
I hate those commercials now where they're trying to make it seem like fast food

682
00:44:01.861 --> 00:44:06.861
is at the level of a five star restaurant and they get these white trash fucking

683
00:44:07.621 --> 00:44:11.760
idiots and they just see a tablecloth and some cloth napkin.

684
00:44:11.761 --> 00:44:15.330
And then they bring in some pizza hut and they're eating their pasta.

685
00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:20.340
Have you seen that commercial?
And that girl was like,
oh my God,
it's so decadent.

686
00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:25.260
Who the fuck uses that word when they're talking about pasta?

687
00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:30.870
It's decorated.
You know?
It's like,
did you just want to use that word?

688
00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:36.260
You dumb fuck.
And then they come in,
they're like,
Oh,
it's pizza hut.
It's pates.

689
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:40.670
Uh Oh my God,
I can't believe.
And I eat that shit every week,
you know,

690
00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:44.400
always tasted like shit.
But now these fucking,
and he had kids.
Oh my God,

691
00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:49.200
he's so fucking jacketed.
And they're breeding and they're breathing.

692
00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:53.940
They're not using condoms and they're eating pasta.
I mean,

693
00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:56.550
how do you know the,
and I like how,
um,

694
00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:01.410
all these other fucking fast food places are acting like they in day invented

695
00:45:01.411 --> 00:45:04.700
these mini burgers.
You know what I mean?

696
00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:07.280
Like white castle doesn't exist.

697
00:45:07.281 --> 00:45:12.281
I'm really waiting for white castle to sue a jack in the box or any one of these

698
00:45:13.461 --> 00:45:14.360
other places.
These,

699
00:45:14.361 --> 00:45:18.730
these guys who come up and they call them sliders and evidently it's,

700
00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:22.580
it's not as fattening because rather than than eating one burger,

701
00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:25.850
they take a burger and they cut it into three little ones.

702
00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:28.130
But because their little,

703
00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:31.910
even though you're eating the exact same amount of fucking Burger,
you know,

704
00:45:31.911 --> 00:45:36.740
somehow it's,
it's,
it's less fattening.
I Dunno.
Yeah,
man.

705
00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:39.900
So much.
What I just said is,
you know,
obviously just not even research,

706
00:45:39.901 --> 00:45:42.630
but you know,
I,
you know,
I just,
it I,

707
00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:46.590
that fucking lady using the word decadent just really annoys me.
You know,

708
00:45:46.591 --> 00:45:49.430
what annoys me even more,
I can't even give you a fucking definition for it.

709
00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:54.420
What does it extravagant.
Is that what it means or is that Latin for,

710
00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:55.021
oh my God,

711
00:45:55.021 --> 00:45:58.520
I can't believe this shitty pasta tastes much better with cloth napkins.

712
00:45:58.650 --> 00:46:01.320
Is that what the fuck it means?
You know what?
I'm going to look it up right now.

713
00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:04.140
I'm looking up right now because I'm gonna set you guys up with what this,
this,

714
00:46:04.141 --> 00:46:06.360
this week is going to be all about.
This is going to be,

715
00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:11.320
there's a lot of information,
not information this week.
Um,

716
00:46:11.830 --> 00:46:16.430
that's going to becoming a,
how the fuck you spelled decadent.
D C.
Deca a,

717
00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:21.430
another.
A deca.
No.
D.
E.
C.
A dent.

718
00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:27.610
Deka Dent.
Ah,
Jesus Christ.
That wasn't even close.

719
00:46:27.611 --> 00:46:32.560
Was a d.
E.
C.
A.
D.
E.
N.
T.
Wow.

720
00:46:32.561 --> 00:46:37.120
Fuck.
I got it.
Holy Shit.
All right,
decadence.
Let's go to Wikipedia.

721
00:46:37.121 --> 00:46:40.390
God knows they're fucking credible.
Um,

722
00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:45.480
decadence can refer to a personal trade or to the state of society or a segment

723
00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:50.800
of it
used to describe a person's lifestyle.

724
00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:53.423
<v 10>MMM.</v>

725
00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:57.600
<v 9>It describes the fuck happened just in,</v>

726
00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:00.530
but goddamn computer users grab a person's lifestyle.

727
00:47:00.531 --> 00:47:04.880
It describes a lack of moral and intellectual discipline.

728
00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:09.820
Well there's a fucking left turn
on our way.
Yeah.
Wait a second now.
That's,

729
00:47:10.270 --> 00:47:13.210
I guess gotta be right night.
Am I going to question these people?
I'm a moron.

730
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:16.780
Bill.
Why don't you just read it and shut the fuck out.
All right.
I will.

731
00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:19.210
All right.
Used to describe a person's lifestyle.

732
00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:24.240
It describes a lack of moral and intellectual discipline or in the Oxford

733
00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:28.330
Dictionary,
a luxurious self indulgence.

734
00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:30.540
<v 10>Okay.</v>

735
00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:34.200
<v 9>Yeah.
You know who the fuck describes pasta is a luxurious self indulgent,</v>

736
00:47:34.201 --> 00:47:35.040
you know some,

737
00:47:35.070 --> 00:47:39.090
you know who does some stupid white trash conduit fuckin macaroni and cheese six

738
00:47:39.091 --> 00:47:42.900
days a week and all of a sudden you bring her a little fucking Ziti and you know

739
00:47:42.901 --> 00:47:47.280
she can't,
she can't believe it.
Oh my God,
it's so deck.
And she was actually,

740
00:47:47.550 --> 00:47:49.140
that was an insecure comment.

741
00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:52.920
They probably had an extra couple of forks there and she started to panic.

742
00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:57.460
You know what I mean?
Just like Jodie foster when,
when he,

743
00:47:57.461 --> 00:48:01.060
she's talking to that dude and silence of the lambs and he can tell that she,

744
00:48:01.061 --> 00:48:05.730
she grew up dirt poor because of her shoes.
Right.
You know,

745
00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:09.780
that's all the end of that commercial needed.
Was somebody saying,

746
00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:14.070
I can smell your comment.
That would've,
that would've been all right.
You know,

747
00:48:14.071 --> 00:48:18.000
I'm really being crude right now and I apologize,
especially after last week,

748
00:48:18.001 --> 00:48:20.130
that video that I told all you guys to see,
I've got a lot of,

749
00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.390
I've got a lot of feedback about that one,

750
00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:25.480
about what a ignorant more on I am and uh,

751
00:48:25.481 --> 00:48:28.140
I'll be reading those a little bit later.
Look at me foreshadowing here.

752
00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:32.790
He like that.
Like I'm on a God damn radio station.
Um,
all right,

753
00:48:32.791 --> 00:48:36.000
let's get to some,
um,
if you new to this podcast,

754
00:48:36.001 --> 00:48:38.670
I do one of these every week and this is basically what it is.
All right.

755
00:48:38.671 --> 00:48:42.090
If you think it's going to get better,
like I'm building to something,
I'm not,

756
00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:42.871
this is pretty much,

757
00:48:42.871 --> 00:48:47.070
I'm going to flat line the whole week and I feel like I have internal hiccups

758
00:48:47.071 --> 00:48:50.400
right now.
You know those hiccups where you start to hiccup but then you don't.

759
00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:53.100
Huh?
Am I doing an eighties bit again?

760
00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:55.780
<v 11>What's the deal?
Wound here goes,</v>

761
00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:58.160
<v 9>um,
great.</v>

762
00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:00.750
<v 11>It's like a fork.
Does it know where to go?</v>

763
00:49:02.110 --> 00:49:06.100
<v 9>Oh God,
I'd love to fucking do stand up in the 80s was so much easier,
wasn't it?</v>

764
00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:08.270
One week you're an accountant.

765
00:49:08.290 --> 00:49:12.790
The next minute you're on comic strip live wearing in the same blazer that you

766
00:49:12.791 --> 00:49:14.620
wore when you were doing somebody's taxes,

767
00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:20.010
except you just fucking pull the sleeves up and everything was funny back then.

768
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:25.900
All right.
Uh,
let's get onto some shit here.
Uh,
Bill,
just for your information,

769
00:49:25.901 --> 00:49:29.320
the guy,
the wrap you were trying to talk about last neat,
nice week.

770
00:49:29.590 --> 00:49:30.490
[inaudible] it's pronounced.

771
00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:35.650
I still can't say his Quali I'd never heard somebody say it to live.

772
00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:41.020
Quali coyly I don't fucking know what his name is.
Quietly.
I mean,

773
00:49:41.021 --> 00:49:42.070
I listen to someone's rap,
you know,

774
00:49:42.071 --> 00:49:44.980
I like about the guy who doesn't say his fucking name every three seconds and

775
00:49:44.981 --> 00:49:48.270
the one time when I need somebody to do it,
he doesn't do it.

776
00:49:48.290 --> 00:49:51.940
I still don't know how to say it.
This guy spelled the Q u a how do you say?

777
00:49:51.941 --> 00:49:56.200
Is that choir?
Quasi,
right?
That's how you said,
so

778
00:49:58.030 --> 00:50:02.530
Kuala Quali to live quietly.
Ah,
this is fucking pathetic.

779
00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:06.080
When do I do alright,
you know.
Alright,
plowing ahead here.
Um,

780
00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:10.120
here's one that somebody actually was going to have,
uh,
for another segment,

781
00:50:10.121 --> 00:50:12.730
but this seemed more like a ask bill.
Uh,

782
00:50:12.830 --> 00:50:16.660
here's two things I'd love to hear your opinion on drugs and double dates.

783
00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:21.340
Um,
yes.
This guy wants to hear my opinions on double dates and this,
actually,

784
00:50:21.341 --> 00:50:24.670
I think this is more of an ask bill kind of question.
So he says,

785
00:50:24.671 --> 00:50:28.910
long story short,
I met the hottest chick ever at a club.
Dude.

786
00:50:28.911 --> 00:50:32.840
I met though hottest fucking chick ever.
Her name's fucking Stacy.

787
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:33.951
Um,

788
00:50:33.951 --> 00:50:38.951
I get a number when gonna read this all like I'm a fucking knasis's back in the

789
00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:41.090
day in Kenmore square tools.

790
00:50:41.250 --> 00:50:45.380
Go down a fucking knasis's with our fucking z cavalry cheese.
Dude.

791
00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:49.040
Fuck it.
Go around there.
Get a couple of rule fees.

792
00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:51.350
Drop them in a fucking Zima dude.

793
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:56.150
Fucking cock sucker.
All right.
Ah,
long story short.

794
00:50:56.151 --> 00:51:00.950
Me In the hottest chick ever at a club.
I get her number,
we talk,
we,

795
00:51:01.010 --> 00:51:03.470
I ask her out,
she changes it.
Okay.

796
00:51:03.471 --> 00:51:07.340
Ask her out and then she changes it to a double date with their sister.

797
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:12.080
So I go out on this double day to an extremely expensive restaurant.

798
00:51:12.110 --> 00:51:14.750
I'm 22 in college broke.

799
00:51:15.110 --> 00:51:19.210
I drop $140 on her.
Uh,
the,

800
00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:24.620
the sister wouldn't let me out of our sight and all I got was one small kiss

801
00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:30.260
later on.
I did not even get a kiss goodnight because the sister was watching.

802
00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:32.613
All right,
dude.

803
00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:36.980
Now you really shouldn't be asking my opinion on double dating.

804
00:51:36.981 --> 00:51:41.750
What this is really about is how did you as a young man,

805
00:51:41.751 --> 00:51:46.220
22,
I'm going to cut you some slack here.
End Up in that situation.
Okay?

806
00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:49.430
Don't walk away from this.
Just go in like,
you know what you wanted to do.

807
00:51:49.431 --> 00:51:53.810
Overrated.
Underrated,
overrated.
Fucking,
you know,
double dating.
It sucks.

808
00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:58.490
Now you should have right there to do when when she tried to turn it into a

809
00:51:58.491 --> 00:52:01.760
double date right there,
you just have to be now I don't want to do that.

810
00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:05.660
And she'll be like,
why don't you want to do that?
And you'd just be like,

811
00:52:05.661 --> 00:52:08.720
I don't like going on double dates.
Why not?

812
00:52:09.110 --> 00:52:12.260
Because one person ends up not having a good time,

813
00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:16.840
and it's usually the other con that you bring.
You can clean this up.
This is

814
00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:22.040
no,
you know what I mean?
You get your,
you just just say it.

815
00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:27.100
I swear to God that we know when you're 22 you don't realize the power of no.

816
00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:28.371
All right.

817
00:52:28.371 --> 00:52:33.200
It actually seems like maybe you have some shit going on because at 22 most guys

818
00:52:33.201 --> 00:52:36.530
don't know how to talk to women.
So all women here is yes,
yes,
yes.

819
00:52:36.531 --> 00:52:40.760
Especially if they're hot.
They just keep fucking agreeing with them.

820
00:52:40.761 --> 00:52:44.600
So if you say no,
all of a sudden it's,
it's,
it's kind of different.
I mean,

821
00:52:44.601 --> 00:52:46.670
you could fuck it up,
but at the end of the day,
dude,

822
00:52:46.671 --> 00:52:50.330
you didn't get laid and you're out 150 bucks.
All right?

823
00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:54.050
Think about that moment when she said,
let's turn.
You were,
you know,

824
00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:58.250
going to turn this into a double date.
What did your internal voice say?

825
00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:03.740
Oh Great.
Or did it say,
fuck,
this is going to suck.

826
00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:07.570
This is going to suck.
I'm not going to be able to get along with this girl.
Uh,

827
00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:11.870
you know Joe Pesci,
I'm trying to fucking bang this brought over here.
You know,

828
00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:15.050
it's not going to go good.
So right there you just got to work.

829
00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:17.750
You just got to say no,
I don't want to do a double day.
And she'll say,
why?

830
00:53:17.830 --> 00:53:22.520
And just say,
cause I'm 22,
what am I potsy we unhappy days.

831
00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:25.710
We're going to go to inspiration point.
You want to go out on a date with me?

832
00:53:25.890 --> 00:53:29.550
I don't show at that point you bring a little anger into it and you kind of just

833
00:53:29.551 --> 00:53:32.610
show the side of your head and you don't really look at her.
That'll get you.

834
00:53:32.850 --> 00:53:36.090
That'll get you a second tape.
All right.
That was fucking brutal.

835
00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:38.430
That was bad advice.
I'm trying to tell you,
dude,

836
00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:43.470
just don't fucking go on a double date.
All right.
They suck.

837
00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:45.390
You knew they suck.
You knew before I even went on it,

838
00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:48.750
you knew it was going to suck.
And if you're broke,

839
00:53:48.751 --> 00:53:53.430
don't take a girl to someplace where you've got to drop 140 bucks.
You know,

840
00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:58.080
what did she do to deserve $140 meal?
What?

841
00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:02.490
Cause she's hot like that some sort of accomplishment.
She was born that way.

842
00:54:03.570 --> 00:54:08.190
You know what you did is you basically took probably a nice girl and you just

843
00:54:08.191 --> 00:54:11.850
added another layer to the foundation of her.

844
00:54:11.851 --> 00:54:14.820
Just being an incredibly stuck up human being who doesn't have,

845
00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:18.210
who doesn't have to develop a personality.
You know,

846
00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:20.550
look at me making all these judgments.
But I think it's true.

847
00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:26.180
Just because your heart doesn't mean you deserve $140 meal if you're broke,

848
00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:33.120
to be honest with yourself with that chick was like a seven.
You know,

849
00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:36.090
you'd probably take it a pizza hut for some fucking decade in Pasta.

850
00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:39.060
So I don't know.
Did I help you there?

851
00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:42.870
I got to stop doing these podcasts on Sunday cause I'm fucking jet lag from

852
00:54:42.871 --> 00:54:44.640
flying back to wherever the fuck I came from.

853
00:54:44.641 --> 00:54:47.730
I was actually working in Denver this weekend.
I was at the comedy works.

854
00:54:47.731 --> 00:54:52.110
So I should take some time here to,
uh,
um,

855
00:54:52.890 --> 00:54:54.480
thank everyone who came out to see me.

856
00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:58.740
The turnout in Denver was ridiculous and I actually flew in a day early and I

857
00:54:58.741 --> 00:55:02.130
got to do five minutes out at red rocks.

858
00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:07.950
And,
um,
if you're not from Denver and a,
you're not a fan of youtube,

859
00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:11.050
just go on youtube and just Google red rocks.
It's fucking,

860
00:55:11.130 --> 00:55:16.050
it's one of the most amazing venues is basically an outdoor venue built into the

861
00:55:16.051 --> 00:55:19.650
side of a mountain and that youtube video,
speaking to that.
Yeah,

862
00:55:19.651 --> 00:55:21.210
that's what I was trying to say.
That youtube video.

863
00:55:21.211 --> 00:55:25.500
I don't what the fuck was called unforgettable fire.
I don't know.

864
00:55:25.501 --> 00:55:28.320
What was it about?
What was it about me?
What do,
what does youtube sing about?

865
00:55:28.321 --> 00:55:32.160
They sing about breaking up with girls,
Martin Luther King.

866
00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:37.890
And uh,
then they went through their irony stage,
didn't they?

867
00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:43.080
Where you were the big glasses and he just ain't just acted like everything was

868
00:55:43.081 --> 00:55:44.550
fucking surreal.
I don't know.
Whatever it did.

869
00:55:44.551 --> 00:55:47.450
There's a video that they did way back in the day and he marches around like,

870
00:55:47.770 --> 00:55:51.690
what the what the fucking flag?
Like he's in a,
I don't know,

871
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:56.590
like they're doing something.
He playing like this military be get 10,
10,

872
00:55:56.591 --> 00:55:59.930
30 to 10 and did that.
And he comes my,

873
00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:04.080
I'll say it all fucking David spade bit.
He starts chatting.
No War.

874
00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:08.730
There you go.
It's that video.
Yeah,
no,
we got it.

875
00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:10.680
It's not like they're a small fucking indie band.

876
00:56:10.681 --> 00:56:14.460
We knew 10 minutes ago when you started describing and I right.
I right.

877
00:56:14.550 --> 00:56:17.460
Sometimes they get a little carried away.
I,
uh,

878
00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:20.190
just reminds me of something.

879
00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:23.620
Can I had a falling out with somebody like two months ago.
You have somebody,

880
00:56:23.621 --> 00:56:24.131
a friend of yours,

881
00:56:24.131 --> 00:56:29.131
just say something so fucking stupid that you don't even get angry and you just,

882
00:56:29.411 --> 00:56:30.910
you just have that moment like,
wow,

883
00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:34.510
I can't be friends with this person anymore because they're a fucking moron.

884
00:56:36.490 --> 00:56:37.323
<v 10>You know?</v>

885
00:56:39.210 --> 00:56:43.850
<v 9>You know what happens?
Somebody,
somebody that's happened to me twice.</v>

886
00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:49.760
One time somebody said,
uh,
they were talking about secretary at that horse

887
00:56:51.770 --> 00:56:53.960
and they were talking about all the,
all the races,

888
00:56:53.961 --> 00:56:56.690
the horse one and in the end they went,
what an athlete

889
00:56:57.870 --> 00:56:58.730
<v 10>and uh,</v>

890
00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:03.300
<v 9>I dunno if that was it.
I just could never look at them the same way.</v>

891
00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:05.080
<v 10>What an athlete,</v>

892
00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:11.240
<v 9>you know,
I,
I just do,
I have,
you need to fucking go off on that.</v>

893
00:57:11.241 --> 00:57:13.160
Do I need to explore?
Can you tell them actually scrolling down,

894
00:57:13.161 --> 00:57:17.240
I'm trying to find something else.
Somebody wrote a fucking question about that.

895
00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:21.380
This whole fucking podcast,
it's just falling apart.
This is what you get.

896
00:57:21.410 --> 00:57:23.510
You know what?
Maybe if I started charging for these things,

897
00:57:23.511 --> 00:57:28.380
I take them a little more seriously and we wouldn't have these long lulls and my

898
00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:31.940
dog's fast asleep from my monotone voice is no,

899
00:57:32.770 --> 00:57:35.930
there's no passion in this.
What am I doing here with a fuck?
Is it,

900
00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:42.460
you know what?
Fuck this podcast.
Am I going to start over?
I'm not gonna Start,

901
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:44.960
you know,
I want to plow through.
I can't,
I can't start over.
This is it.

902
00:57:44.961 --> 00:57:47.120
I got one take.
This is like live television here.

903
00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:50.690
I'm just going to read everything in front of me.
How about that?
All right.
Uh,

904
00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:55.070
Bill is,
listen to your podcast on a July 20th.
You said,
uh,
the,

905
00:57:55.071 --> 00:57:56.330
that the youtube video,

906
00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:59.780
tough talking college girl was a must see a surge forward.
Oh yeah.

907
00:57:59.781 --> 00:58:04.730
That people kind of took it down.
People took that one down.
Um,

908
00:58:05.330 --> 00:58:08.150
and if you didn't see it,
that people keep putting it back up.

909
00:58:08.151 --> 00:58:11.360
So just check every couple of days.
Just look up search,

910
00:58:11.361 --> 00:58:13.250
tough talk and college girl,
t,
u,

911
00:58:13.251 --> 00:58:17.300
F F and it's talking with the Ge even though I don't pronounce my gs.

912
00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:20.300
Um,
anyways,
uh,
here's one for your ps.

913
00:58:20.301 --> 00:58:23.930
My girlfriend and I were at the grocery store last night and all that they had

914
00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:25.460
opened where those self checkouts,

915
00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:28.820
this is the first time I was put in that situation because they usually always

916
00:58:28.821 --> 00:58:31.520
have at least one real lane open.
Anyways,

917
00:58:31.521 --> 00:58:35.240
the place was fucking swamped and go into a real person to pay for the shit

918
00:58:35.241 --> 00:58:37.190
wasn't even an option.
Uh,

919
00:58:37.191 --> 00:58:41.920
there were three fucking employees who's just three fucking employees.
Uh,

920
00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:45.320
standing there.
I went up to the three Fox and I asked him if,
uh,

921
00:58:45.321 --> 00:58:48.560
if they would open a real lane and they just told me that they were too short

922
00:58:48.561 --> 00:58:53.450
staffed,
um,
fucking horse shit.
This guy says,

923
00:58:53.451 --> 00:58:58.400
he said,
I thought to myself,
uh,
where is bill burr when you need them to do,

924
00:58:58.401 --> 00:59:01.790
what would I do other than just sit there and curse under my breath now next to

925
00:59:01.791 --> 00:59:06.740
some fucking candy.
Like you did fucking bullshit.
That's fucking bullshit.

926
00:59:07.490 --> 00:59:10.750
Um,
so I got in line and I rang up my own shit,
like a little pitch.
Uh,

927
00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:15.130
I had no other option.
What,
what you done in that situation?
Um,

928
00:59:15.131 --> 00:59:16.520
I would have done exactly what you did.

929
00:59:17.390 --> 00:59:19.880
I would have been hostile towards the three people there.

930
00:59:19.881 --> 00:59:24.170
I would have cursed under my breath and then I probably just would've fucking,

931
00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:26.840
you know,
depending on how much I needed the shit,

932
00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:29.150
if I really didn't need this stuff,
what I,

933
00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:33.350
what I would've done a what I would like to,
you know what I'm doing right now,

934
00:59:33.351 --> 00:59:34.460
I'm doing that shit.
You know,

935
00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:37.610
we're after something goes down and the guy tells you the story.

936
00:59:37.611 --> 00:59:40.550
Then there's always that Douche bag.
He goes,
dude,
you know what I would've done?

937
00:59:41.330 --> 00:59:45.800
You know what I would've done?
Now that I have all the fucking information,
um,

938
00:59:45.830 --> 00:59:47.990
you know what you could do in the future is just say,
oh,

939
00:59:47.991 --> 00:59:50.720
well then I'm going to come back during the day when you have some people and

940
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:55.760
then just leave your food there and let them put it back.
You know,

941
00:59:56.050 --> 00:59:59.300
do it.
I told you this was going to fucking happen.
They're understaffed.

942
00:59:59.330 --> 01:00:03.320
They're understaffed on purpose.
That's phase two.

943
01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:08.090
Phase one was just to have like five or six fucking registers and gave you three

944
01:00:08.091 --> 01:00:13.070
others.
So all the fucking sheep look over the curiosity factor,
what's going on.

945
01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:16.310
And then you had the other cashiers over there teaching them how to fucking use

946
01:00:16.311 --> 01:00:20.330
it.
Now they've gotten beyond that.
Now they're going into phase two.

947
01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:25.520
Okay?
Phase two of the experiment.
What happens if there's no,

948
01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:30.560
if there are no cashier people,
how will the herd handle this?

949
01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:33.710
When should we do it?
Well,
we can't do it during the day.

950
01:00:33.711 --> 01:00:36.530
There's fucking old people and their little motorcars riding around.

951
01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:40.790
Let's do it later on at night.
Let's see how the drunk crowd handles it.

952
01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:43.700
Even if they don't like it,
they won't fucking remember.
At the very least.

953
01:00:43.701 --> 01:00:46.520
They won't send any angry letters.
I'm telling you,

954
01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:48.530
this is how the whole fucking thing's going to go.

955
01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:52.280
And somebody actually asked me in this,
uh,

956
01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:57.710
this week asked me,
they were curious as to what I thought about htms.
Um,

957
01:00:58.550 --> 01:00:58.791
yeah,

958
01:00:58.791 --> 01:01:03.791
I'm not against technology is if it makes my life like easier,

959
01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:07.790
like ATM at banks before,

960
01:01:07.791 --> 01:01:10.190
I don't know if you guys remember this ship to back in the day when there was no

961
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.250
ATS,
you know,
Friday five o'clock.

962
01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:16.310
If you didn't grab the cash you needed for the weekend,
you are fucked.

963
01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:18.530
You couldn't get to you my IC,

964
01:01:18.590 --> 01:01:22.610
they will be open for like 20 minutes on a Saturday.
But uh,
yeah,

965
01:01:22.611 --> 01:01:25.910
that was just be that,
that their expression,
the guys work in banker hours.

966
01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:27.560
He used to be open like nine to five.

967
01:01:27.561 --> 01:01:29.090
He can never even get your fucking money out.

968
01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:32.570
So what I like about the ATM as at least I have access to my money.

969
01:01:33.110 --> 01:01:34.010
I don't mind that.

970
01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:38.150
And a lot of times it is easier to just throw it in there so I don't give a
fuck.

971
01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:43.190
You know that one doesn't bug me and I understand the technology does replace

972
01:01:43.191 --> 01:01:43.791
some jobs.

973
01:01:43.791 --> 01:01:48.791
The reason why I can't stand this latest brand of automated shit is it's not an

974
01:01:49.401 --> 01:01:52.130
advancement.
It doesn't make it easier.

975
01:01:52.131 --> 01:01:56.420
I just go up and do exactly what the cashier did and the bag person did,

976
01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:01.340
except I'm doing it for free.
Now.
If I walked up to the cashier machine,

977
01:02:01.341 --> 01:02:06.341
the automated thing and magically the fucking thing figured out what I owed and

978
01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:11.660
then suddenly it was all in a bag,
I wouldn't give a shit.
All right.

979
01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.840
I Dunno.
People just hear what they want to hear.

980
01:02:14.841 --> 01:02:16.910
Like you make one comment about something,
it's good.

981
01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:20.310
I don't like technologies against penicillin.
Now I'm not,

982
01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:22.200
I'm not at vent gets advancements.

983
01:02:22.590 --> 01:02:27.590
I'm against fuck overs and those automated things in the grocery store and at

984
01:02:27.901 --> 01:02:31.680
the f,
the the parking garage,
the automated park or fuck overs.

985
01:02:32.610 --> 01:02:36.540
It doesn't make it quicker.
It actually makes it longer and a lot of instances.

986
01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:40.620
And uh,
I'm just working for free.

987
01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:44.340
I'm working for free and I don't fucking like it.
Okay.

988
01:02:44.341 --> 01:02:47.460
And that's the last time I'm fucking explaining it and I don't need any,

989
01:02:47.461 --> 01:02:51.120
you douchebags Oui.
They wing in my origins.
The other Gainey winch quicker.

990
01:02:51.121 --> 01:02:54.480
You're a moron.
Just fucking work for free.
All right,
here we go.

991
01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:59.400
Um,
what are we going on to?
Somebody sent me an email,
said,
hey bill,

992
01:02:59.401 --> 01:03:03.870
I just want to thank you.
Uh,
thanks a bunch for teaching me about tinnitus.

993
01:03:04.010 --> 01:03:07.230
That's that ringing in the ear stuff I was talking about.
I just turned 21.

994
01:03:07.231 --> 01:03:11.550
I had that shit as long as I can remember.
Didn't know what it was a thought.

995
01:03:11.551 --> 01:03:13.680
It was just me,
um,

996
01:03:13.681 --> 01:03:17.460
for anyone that has the problem and not sure what to do when I was younger,

997
01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:22.220
I used,
uh,
I left the TV on.
That was a bad idea.
After that I played,
uh,

998
01:03:22.290 --> 01:03:27.290
mostly chill music and my music collection and a seven minute album or something

999
01:03:28.051 --> 01:03:28.441
like that.

1000
01:03:28.441 --> 01:03:32.670
Now I just sort of put a fan on low speed and it keeps the ringing your way for

1001
01:03:32.671 --> 01:03:35.220
those of you who don't have tonight is what he's saying is,

1002
01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:37.370
is you put some sort of smaller,

1003
01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:42.440
quieter noise in the background that drowns out the ringing in your ear and uh,

1004
01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:46.580
actually do what you really should do is go see a doctor is what you're supposed

1005
01:03:46.581 --> 01:03:51.540
to do.
And um,
I don't know.
Um,
that's,

1006
01:03:51.570 --> 01:03:56.570
I think the cases of Tinnitus is going to go way up just because of like iPods.

1007
01:03:56.881 --> 01:04:01.200
And when you go to clubs,
how loud they play that fucking music.
Um,

1008
01:04:02.730 --> 01:04:04.320
actually,
you know,
I,

1009
01:04:04.321 --> 01:04:07.380
I actually bring earplugs everywhere I go because I have such fucked up ears,

1010
01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:08.730
at least I try to remember.

1011
01:04:08.731 --> 01:04:13.731
But basically how it works is anything up to about 60 or 65 decibels,

1012
01:04:15.450 --> 01:04:17.280
you're pretty much cool.
And you can listen.

1013
01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:21.540
Your ear can handle like a right around 60 decibels that say,
ah,

1014
01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:26.270
that's like how I'm talking right now.
Regular conversation and you,

1015
01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:29.550
you don't do any damage to your ears.
Your ears can listen to it for,
you know,

1016
01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:32.400
all day and you don't do any damage.
But what happens,

1017
01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:36.330
I forget how the math works,
but every time you move up 10 decibels,

1018
01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:41.870
like 60 to 70 the timeframe that your ears can listen to that level of noise

1019
01:04:43.110 --> 01:04:47.250
without doing permanent damage goes down really quickly.

1020
01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:50.760
And I know some worry where when you start getting around 80 that starts getting

1021
01:04:50.761 --> 01:04:53.640
dangerous and anything above 90 um,

1022
01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:58.140
I mean I think like 90 listening to something at 90 minutes.

1023
01:04:58.141 --> 01:04:59.970
Don't quote me on this.
I forget.
I used,

1024
01:05:00.090 --> 01:05:02.730
I used to have this chart and only shit I tried to find on the Internet but I

1025
01:05:02.731 --> 01:05:03.300
couldn't.

1026
01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:08.300
But anything around 90 decibels after like 15 minutes.

1027
01:05:09.090 --> 01:05:13.920
And you can easily with an iPod go up to about a buck 10 15 minutes of listening

1028
01:05:13.921 --> 01:05:16.950
to music.
You do permanent damage to your hearing.

1029
01:05:17.170 --> 01:05:21.730
And I know that sounds fucked up.
It's just incremental.
And you can't tell,

1030
01:05:22.930 --> 01:05:24.130
I forget,
I read all this shit.

1031
01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:26.410
There's little hairs in there and when you blow it out,

1032
01:05:26.570 --> 01:05:30.280
the things get knocked down and then they slowly stand back up again.

1033
01:05:30.281 --> 01:05:32.200
And after a while they just don't get back up again.

1034
01:05:33.070 --> 01:05:36.760
They just fucking like a boxer.
They just lay in there and you go into clubs man.

1035
01:05:36.810 --> 01:05:40.540
And they have,
they have those dead fucking music up to like a buck 15,
a buck 20.

1036
01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:44.230
If he noticed the bouncers who worked there always have ear plugs for the most

1037
01:05:44.231 --> 01:05:48.670
part.
Um,
I dunno,
I suffer from tonight is you don't want it.

1038
01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:51.850
It's horrific.
But um,
if you have it,

1039
01:05:51.851 --> 01:05:56.530
you should definitely go see a doctor and I would always have earplugs on you

1040
01:05:56.531 --> 01:05:59.570
just in case,
you know,
you're hanging out bay,

1041
01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:02.500
it's check out this bar and you go in there and I don't know why they play the

1042
01:06:02.501 --> 01:06:05.800
music that fucking loud.
I can tell if the,

1043
01:06:05.801 --> 01:06:07.570
I guess if there's a Dj and there's dancing,

1044
01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:10.730
but when you just walk into a bar and you having a couple beers and he got to

1045
01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:14.050
scream,
I can't fucking stand that.
I don't know.
Maybe because I'm,

1046
01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:16.510
maybe because I'm old.
Who knows.
All right,

1047
01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:19.780
let's move on to the next section here.
I'm just,
I'm just reading shit this week.

1048
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:22.960
All right.
I Dunno why I forget what this is,

1049
01:06:22.961 --> 01:06:27.520
but this section is named the accidental racist.
All right.

1050
01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:29.261
Uh,
hey bill,

1051
01:06:29.261 --> 01:06:34.261
I just downloaded a bunch of your uninformed shows on mini mini Nova and just

1052
01:06:34.841 --> 01:06:39.220
began listening to the first one,
a show from February 10th,

1053
01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:44.220
2007 I stopped at three minutes in to write you to thank you for delivering

1054
01:06:44.231 --> 01:06:49.090
already the accidental racism to the Asian guy.
Oh,
that's why this name is,

1055
01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:51.610
I'm in the elevator story.

1056
01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:55.450
It kind of reminded me of a sending semi funny thing that happened to me.

1057
01:06:55.451 --> 01:06:56.860
All right.
Just to get you guys caught up,

1058
01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:59.690
I was going up in the elevator at the old,
uh,

1059
01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:04.240
XM building evidently on February 10th,

1060
01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:07.150
2007 and it was me and Joe de Rosa who do the show.

1061
01:07:07.330 --> 01:07:11.530
And there was this Asian guy in the elevator and I can't remember what,

1062
01:07:11.531 --> 01:07:16.230
but he seemed confused.
And,
uh,
he was,
I,

1063
01:07:16.231 --> 01:07:18.760
I sometime I didn't know what floor he was on.

1064
01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:23.880
Somehow I made the assumption that he was delivering food and I conveyed that to

1065
01:07:25.841 --> 01:07:30.040
him and I was,
yeah.
Said something like,
Oh,
what are you delivering food?

1066
01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:33.070
And he just put his head down and he goes,
I work here.

1067
01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:40.510
And I felt like such a fucking asshole.

1068
01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:45.220
But he just looked,
he looked disheveled and he was dressed down.

1069
01:07:45.221 --> 01:07:48.490
We did the show on a Saturday,
so he wasn't dressed like he was going to work.

1070
01:07:48.670 --> 01:07:52.630
It was just one of those things.
Uh,
if I could find the guy,

1071
01:07:52.631 --> 01:07:55.510
I would apologize to them.
But you know what I mean?

1072
01:07:56.470 --> 01:08:00.730
There are a lot of Asian guys delivering food in,
uh,

1073
01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:05.020
in New York,
you know,
so,

1074
01:08:05.290 --> 01:08:08.080
and they're always going up elevators and they always have that local,
like,

1075
01:08:08.081 --> 01:08:11.340
what fucking floor am I going to?
I don't know.
The Guy,
I don't know.
I don't,

1076
01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:14.290
what happened,
they began to argue with his girlfriend.
It's how I read it.

1077
01:08:14.291 --> 01:08:18.620
So anyways,
I felt like an asshole and I apologize,
uh,

1078
01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:21.890
if for some reason he's listening to this podcast to be funny,

1079
01:08:21.891 --> 01:08:25.930
if he actually was a listener of my podcast and didn't realize that was me and

1080
01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:30.330
now realizes it's me and now I've lost another listener.
Um,
anyway,

1081
01:08:30.331 --> 01:08:34.130
so this guy I guess has a story just like it.
Um,
so when he says anyways,
um,

1082
01:08:34.670 --> 01:08:37.730
my junior year in college I was looking for a roommate because some previous

1083
01:08:37.731 --> 01:08:40.130
people I had lined up dropped out on me in the last minute.

1084
01:08:40.670 --> 01:08:44.000
A girl I was friends with put me in touch with the guy she was friends with

1085
01:08:44.001 --> 01:08:45.950
because,
uh,
he was looking for a place to,

1086
01:08:46.190 --> 01:08:49.640
despite both of us having this girl's a mutual friend,
we never met each other.

1087
01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:53.810
Uh,
we set everything up over the phone and came to terms we could both live with

1088
01:08:53.811 --> 01:08:57.050
without ever even a meeting in person.
Um,

1089
01:08:57.320 --> 01:09:01.300
thus the first time we would meet was at the place we would both be living in

1090
01:09:01.610 --> 01:09:04.730
Jesus.
Dude,
you're really taking a risk there.
Um,

1091
01:09:04.731 --> 01:09:08.060
there are some things about me that are vital pieces of information in order for

1092
01:09:08.061 --> 01:09:10.880
this story to make sense.
First of all on black.
However,

1093
01:09:10.881 --> 01:09:12.830
due to the tone and the pitch of my voice,

1094
01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:17.150
my usage of correct grammar most of the time,
um,
you know,
do it.

1095
01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:20.000
If I said that I would really be in trouble,
but you can trash around people.

1096
01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:23.510
Okay.
So everything's good.
Um,
you said I was an English major,

1097
01:09:23.511 --> 01:09:26.220
but I'm not an asshole about it.
I promise.
Uh,
correct grammar.

1098
01:09:26.221 --> 01:09:31.070
I use correct grammar most of the time and the semi racist nature of most people

1099
01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:31.930
,
uh,

1100
01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:36.140
many people have told me that I sound white or could be mistaken for a white

1101
01:09:36.141 --> 01:09:40.010
person over the phone.
I'm going to address that point a little bit later.

1102
01:09:40.011 --> 01:09:43.550
All right,
so getting back to the story.
When I talked to this kid over the phone,

1103
01:09:43.551 --> 01:09:47.720
we found out we had both gone to the same high school for a year.
Again,

1104
01:09:47.721 --> 01:09:50.750
despite that this,
we didn't know each other.
Um,

1105
01:09:50.751 --> 01:09:55.751
the fact that this school was mostly white combined with the sound of his voice,

1106
01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:59.180
I thought he was white in my mind.
Um,

1107
01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:01.490
which set up this awesome situation.

1108
01:10:01.730 --> 01:10:06.080
I figured he was guessing I was white for the same reason I was guessing.
He was,

1109
01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:09.650
I was really looking forward to seeing this white kids squirm when he pulled up

1110
01:10:09.651 --> 01:10:10.910
and realized that was black.

1111
01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:16.240
Of course a black kid pulled up to the house looking for me and it was a,

1112
01:10:16.341 --> 01:10:17.600
my prospective roommate.

1113
01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:21.320
I remember seeing a little bit of surprise look on his face and I said to him,

1114
01:10:21.730 --> 01:10:25.250
he thought I was white,
didn't you?
And then of course my computer craps out.

1115
01:10:25.550 --> 01:10:28.310
He smiled and admitted he did.
Uh,

1116
01:10:28.311 --> 01:10:30.260
I told them that I thought he was white as well.

1117
01:10:30.261 --> 01:10:34.160
We both ended up having a great laugh about it and became pretty good friends

1118
01:10:34.161 --> 01:10:39.110
afterwards.
Um,
anyways,
thanks for the podcast.
Okay,
let me,
let me,

1119
01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:43.880
uh,
let me get back to that.
Um,
the salmon racist nature of most people.

1120
01:10:43.881 --> 01:10:47.780
Many of people have told me that I sound white or it could be mistaken for a

1121
01:10:47.781 --> 01:10:50.420
white person over the phone for the life of me.

1122
01:10:50.450 --> 01:10:53.780
I don't know why that is considered racist.

1123
01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:55.813
<v 10>Okay.</v>

1124
01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:00.240
<v 9>I Dunno if you've noticed,
but like white people kind of talk in a certain way.</v>

1125
01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:05.250
I mean if you watch def def jam,
we just talk in one way,
but like you know,

1126
01:11:06.490 --> 01:11:07.520
there are,
there is

1127
01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:09.280
<v 10>okay.</v>

1128
01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:12.550
<v 9>You know,
if,
I mean if I was on here and all of a sudden I was like,
Yo,</v>

1129
01:11:12.551 --> 01:11:15.780
you know what I'm saying?
Doing more fucking podcast is shit.
He'd be like,

1130
01:11:15.781 --> 01:11:19.530
why is bill trying to talk like he's some black dude from the ghetto?

1131
01:11:19.531 --> 01:11:23.280
Wouldn't you?
Would that be racist or you know,
there's,

1132
01:11:23.670 --> 01:11:25.320
there's nothing wrong with a,

1133
01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:31.590
what the fuck am I trying to say here?
If you just say somebody sounds white,

1134
01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:32.280
you're not,

1135
01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:36.870
you're not saying they're a a moron.

1136
01:11:38.130 --> 01:11:42.240
Right.
Am I a fucking idiot here?
I don't understand why I was saying,
you know,

1137
01:11:42.241 --> 01:11:44.670
over the phone.
Yeah.
You sounded like a black guy or hey,

1138
01:11:44.671 --> 01:11:47.010
you sounded white over the phone,
is it,

1139
01:11:47.011 --> 01:11:51.300
does it go back to that correct grammar thing that the black person that assumes

1140
01:11:51.301 --> 01:11:54.870
like,
Oh,
why?
Because I didn't say motherfucker every five seconds.

1141
01:11:54.871 --> 01:11:58.950
I know I do a brutal fucking impression.
Um,
but it,

1142
01:11:58.951 --> 01:12:02.070
is that why it is,
that's actually an interesting question to say,

1143
01:12:02.071 --> 01:12:05.730
is this a great fucking podcast through my,
my stupidity.

1144
01:12:05.731 --> 01:12:08.790
You guys learn shit unless you already know it and you're rolling your fucking

1145
01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:12.360
eyes at that place and you have to,
if that's the case,
go fuck yourself.

1146
01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:17.210
All right.
And then this guy also ends this email.
He says,
uh,

1147
01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:21.330
what did he say here?
Anyways,
thanks for the podcast.
They're awesome.

1148
01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:22.980
And as a New York Yankees Fan,

1149
01:12:23.190 --> 01:12:26.280
I want to thank the red sox for keeping first place warm for us.

1150
01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:29.030
Good luck with David.
I can't hit anymore.

1151
01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:32.970
Now that steroids are banned or teas and Jason,

1152
01:12:32.971 --> 01:12:36.630
we had to trade one of the best right handed hitters of all time for this

1153
01:12:36.631 --> 01:12:40.320
nonthreatening white guide bay for the rest of the summer.

1154
01:12:41.610 --> 01:12:45.660
We know you got a lot of balls as a Yankee fan bringing up steroids.

1155
01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:50.400
Okay?
Half your fucking team got busted.

1156
01:12:51.210 --> 01:12:56.070
Do I really need to go through the names?
A Rod,
Sheffield,
GMB,

1157
01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:57.750
Clemens,
Pettitte.

1158
01:12:57.990 --> 01:13:02.580
You're a fucking $200 million team and you're on steroids.
Okay.

1159
01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:06.570
At least our steroid guys are fucking winning championships.
Your bunch of cons.

1160
01:13:06.850 --> 01:13:10.440
No,
I'm sorry.
You want it 99 in 2000 with your steroid guys.

1161
01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:16.050
You know I love how a Yankee fans are talking.
You got a $200 million team.

1162
01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:19.050
If you're barely play in 600 baseball,

1163
01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:24.150
you know that's like having a fucking Lamborghini and your psych that's going 70

1164
01:13:24.151 --> 01:13:24.984
miles an hour.

1165
01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:29.700
You guys should be playing like seven 20 ball with all those fucking guys you

1166
01:13:29.701 --> 01:13:33.450
have.
And you know what the funny thing is?
You still don't have a bullpen,

1167
01:13:33.570 --> 01:13:37.440
so you're not gonna win shit this year to joke.
You know what?

1168
01:13:37.441 --> 01:13:39.960
You guys get like a super group.
You know,

1169
01:13:39.961 --> 01:13:44.130
why don't you just signed fucking Ted Nugent to place play center field?

1170
01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:48.810
You know,
hey,
we're just
$122 billion team that could,

1171
01:13:50.030 --> 01:13:54.360
that's the best thing about Manny Ramirez going out to La is that it knocked our

1172
01:13:54.361 --> 01:13:57.480
payroll way the fuck down.
Now we're down to like 122 million.

1173
01:13:57.570 --> 01:14:00.930
We're actually number four this year.
People were behind the Yankees,

1174
01:14:00.931 --> 01:14:05.910
the mets and uh,
who was at the cubs or the Dodgers?
I,
I came.
Not the Dodgers.

1175
01:14:05.911 --> 01:14:10.080
Who the fuck was it?
Maybe the cubs.
I don't know who it is.

1176
01:14:10.170 --> 01:14:13.480
All I know is when number,
we're like 80 million less.

1177
01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:16.390
And this guy's all excited cause they're two or three games ahead of us.

1178
01:14:16.810 --> 01:14:21.470
Even though you're ona against the red sox and he got swept by the angels.
How,

1179
01:14:21.850 --> 01:14:22.511
what are y'all excited?

1180
01:14:22.511 --> 01:14:26.380
Cause your feast and on the royals in the rangers and all that Shit.

1181
01:14:27.250 --> 01:14:31.780
And Jason Bay is a great fucking baseball player and uh,
he's done,

1182
01:14:31.781 --> 01:14:34.990
been doing a great job for us and that we've barely missed Manny.

1183
01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:39.220
I hate to say it,
I love the guy.
And uh,
just for the record,

1184
01:14:39.221 --> 01:14:42.310
he didn't do steroids till he got to La.
You know,

1185
01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:46.390
dude,
when did he get caught?

1186
01:14:46.391 --> 01:14:49.630
He didn't got caught when he was in Boston that whole fucking time.

1187
01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:53.530
All of a sudden he comes out to la.
He starts running with the wrong crowd.

1188
01:14:53.770 --> 01:14:56.700
You know,
happens to the best of them when they come out here.

1189
01:14:56.730 --> 01:15:01.240
Look at Red River Phoenix.
He came out here.
He did some roids.

1190
01:15:01.241 --> 01:15:04.900
He fucking never got up again.
Cute little actor.

1191
01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:07.330
You was all right.
Here we go.
Here's another thing.

1192
01:15:07.331 --> 01:15:09.190
I don't even why I'm reading this and I'm just going to read it.
Dude.

1193
01:15:09.191 --> 01:15:14.180
I can't believe.
Um,
you didn't notice that she,
okay,
wait a minute.

1194
01:15:14.181 --> 01:15:18.350
Wait.
Okay.
Here we go.
Wait a minute.

1195
01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:22.580
All right.
What am I doing here?
All right,
this is,
this is the response.

1196
01:15:22.581 --> 01:15:26.270
One of the responses I got from that leg sweep video last week.

1197
01:15:26.330 --> 01:15:30.170
If you're new to my podcast,
there's a video up on youtube.

1198
01:15:30.171 --> 01:15:34.670
I guess it got taken down where a,
this,
this guy hits on this girl.

1199
01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:39.230
She doesn't,
you know,
she's not having it,
so he gives a shit.

1200
01:15:39.231 --> 01:15:40.940
She gives him the finger,
he calls her a bitch.

1201
01:15:40.941 --> 01:15:43.670
She throws a drink in his face and he goes up,
you think he,

1202
01:15:44.050 --> 01:15:47.780
he's going to bless her in the face and he just gives a leg or her fucking leg

1203
01:15:47.781 --> 01:15:49.700
sweep that I,

1204
01:15:49.701 --> 01:15:53.570
I it should have been done in Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas was fucking tremendous.

1205
01:15:53.650 --> 01:15:57.980
All right,
here we go.
So,
uh,
this,
this woman wrote me,
she goes,
uh,
Bill,

1206
01:15:57.981 --> 01:16:02.030
I can't believe he didn't notice that she was visited with violent behavior

1207
01:16:02.031 --> 01:16:06.320
first.
This is the girl in the video.
Um,
cause I was sitting there saying,

1208
01:16:06.321 --> 01:16:10.100
I thought the video was funny because the girl threw the drink in his face and

1209
01:16:10.101 --> 01:16:11.660
even though you should never hit a woman,

1210
01:16:11.690 --> 01:16:15.260
I just think that's outrageous in life to think that you can throw a drink in

1211
01:16:15.620 --> 01:16:18.680
somebody's face.
I just know if I did it within two seconds,

1212
01:16:18.681 --> 01:16:23.240
I would be on the ground getting fucking pummeled.
And uh,
I dunno,

1213
01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:25.760
there was just something funny about it.
So anyways,
she goes,

1214
01:16:25.761 --> 01:16:29.030
I can't believe he didn't notice that she was visited with violent behavior

1215
01:16:29.031 --> 01:16:33.320
first.
Watch it again and you'll see him violently poke at her.

1216
01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:37.250
All right.
First of all,
how fucking hilarious is that violently.

1217
01:16:37.350 --> 01:16:40.940
Have you ever heard that expression in your life?
Violently poked.

1218
01:16:41.210 --> 01:16:45.980
There's no such thing as being violently poked.
All right.
It's called stab.

1219
01:16:46.460 --> 01:16:48.770
That's,
you know,
that's fine.
I actually,

1220
01:16:48.771 --> 01:16:53.440
my gym teacher used to violently poked me in the chest fucking cock sucker.
Um,

1221
01:16:53.441 --> 01:16:55.540
he did and he gave her,
he gave her a little fucking poke.

1222
01:16:55.690 --> 01:16:58.480
He get her at one time there were fucking shoulder.
That was it.

1223
01:16:58.510 --> 01:17:01.570
He was just trying to annoy her.
But anyway,
she says,
by the way,

1224
01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:06.730
it's not very complimentary to a grown woman to be shown that he has a crush on

1225
01:17:06.731 --> 01:17:11.360
her by punching her.
He didn't punch.
He didn't punch her.

1226
01:17:11.690 --> 01:17:12.740
Anyway,
she goes,

1227
01:17:12.741 --> 01:17:16.910
I can't believe you're not allowing her to do the only thing she can toss a

1228
01:17:16.911 --> 01:17:19.610
drink.
Adam,
since she can't beat him up,

1229
01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:24.470
do you honestly believe that her throwing the drink equals his,
um,

1230
01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:29.120
kick slash knocked to her on the skull?
Shame on you.
You bastard.

1231
01:17:32.570 --> 01:17:35.900
So I wrote her back.
I said,
I knew this would a spark,
some debate.

1232
01:17:35.930 --> 01:17:37.520
I respect your point of view on it.

1233
01:17:37.521 --> 01:17:42.170
So here's mine violently poked 41 years on this planet and I have never heard

1234
01:17:42.171 --> 01:17:44.660
someone being violently poked.
Um,

1235
01:17:44.661 --> 01:17:48.230
she threw the drink in his face because he called her a bitch and then she goes

1236
01:17:48.231 --> 01:17:50.450
that cause she goes,
that's right,
I am a bitch.

1237
01:17:50.451 --> 01:17:53.840
And then the drink his throne and throw in the drink in his face was not the

1238
01:17:53.841 --> 01:17:56.540
only thing she could have done.
She could have walked away.

1239
01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:59.450
She could have talked to whoever was in charge at the pool.

1240
01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:03.710
She could have talked to some of the guys who are over there,
um,
by her friends.

1241
01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:07.710
There were a bunch of things she could have done,
but she lost her.
Cool.
Um,

1242
01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:08.590
and if you're going to,
um,

1243
01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:12.680
define the action by the guy in the video as violently poking her,

1244
01:18:13.010 --> 01:18:14.750
then you could also address,

1245
01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:18.950
could you also address the racial undertones of her giving the man the finger

1246
01:18:18.951 --> 01:18:21.770
and stating,
do you understand this in English?

1247
01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:25.460
The reason why the video is so funny is because the unexpected happened.

1248
01:18:25.610 --> 01:18:27.290
He actually treated her the same way.

1249
01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:29.780
He would have treated a man that threw a drink in his face.

1250
01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:34.190
So the reason men find the video funny I think is because the amount of times

1251
01:18:34.191 --> 01:18:38.360
women get physical with us and there's nothing we can do except get punched,

1252
01:18:38.510 --> 01:18:42.350
slap or have a drink thrown in our face because we're never going to hit a woman

1253
01:18:42.351 --> 01:18:43.184
and they know it.

1254
01:18:43.490 --> 01:18:46.880
I had a girl tried to punch me in the face and a bar and as I'm trying,

1255
01:18:46.881 --> 01:18:50.540
as carefully as possible to defend against getting punched in the face.

1256
01:18:50.780 --> 01:18:54.170
Basically I'm turning my back and covering up.
Was this girl wailed away?

1257
01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:57.200
The bouncer comes flying over.
And what do you think?

1258
01:18:57.470 --> 01:19:01.100
Who Do you think they grabbed and tossed up?
Um,

1259
01:19:01.101 --> 01:19:02.780
I was in an argument with the female,

1260
01:19:02.781 --> 01:19:06.110
but so what people are you but because of the way things are,

1261
01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:09.890
she can take it to a physical level while I have to try and defend myself

1262
01:19:09.891 --> 01:19:14.450
without getting physical with her at all,
only to be dragged out by the neck.
Uh,

1263
01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:17.360
you know,
if they tossed her out too,
I would've been fine with it.

1264
01:19:17.630 --> 01:19:21.830
But because she's a female,
she gets to throw punches,
have me kicked out,

1265
01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:25.820
and she gets to stay in the bar while they continue to serve or more drinks.

1266
01:19:26.270 --> 01:19:30.950
So to go back to the video,
um,
that is the world.
This warm woman is living in.

1267
01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:33.020
I'm a girl,
I can do this and nothing will happen.

1268
01:19:33.021 --> 01:19:36.320
I could throw a full drink in someone's face and nothing will happen.
Well,

1269
01:19:36.321 --> 01:19:38.660
guess what?
Something did the exact thing,

1270
01:19:38.690 --> 01:19:42.410
same thing that would have happened to me.
And then I go on to say,

1271
01:19:42.411 --> 01:19:46.310
actually I would have been fucking punched repeatedly in the face and the dude's

1272
01:19:46.311 --> 01:19:47.870
friends probably would have jumped into.

1273
01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:50.540
And you know what the reaction from the others people at the pool would have

1274
01:19:50.541 --> 01:19:53.870
been?
Well,
you threw a drink at his face.
What did you think was gonna Happen?

1275
01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:59.720
And then I guess my excuse would have been,
but he poked me violently.
Um,

1276
01:19:59.721 --> 01:20:02.690
anyways,
I've never had a woman aid on advocate a that game.

1277
01:20:02.691 --> 01:20:06.260
The video is an animal and I wouldn't want any woman I cared about to ever date

1278
01:20:06.261 --> 01:20:08.250
him.
But the leg,
the fucking

1279
01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:11.370
leg sweep was genius and undeniably funny to me.

1280
01:20:12.690 --> 01:20:15.210
I'm just gonna read you all these back and forth.
So then she goes,

1281
01:20:15.211 --> 01:20:18.870
you have no idea of what women have women have to put up with.
All right,

1282
01:20:18.871 --> 01:20:20.160
this is where I guess I'm a moron.

1283
01:20:20.490 --> 01:20:24.180
These guys take such personal offense when they're turned down,

1284
01:20:24.270 --> 01:20:25.770
he should have walked away.

1285
01:20:26.250 --> 01:20:29.550
I will not tolerate being touched by a stranger in that way.

1286
01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:32.880
And it is re a really vulnerable feeling as a woman.

1287
01:20:33.330 --> 01:20:36.450
It makes us angry and fearful of men.
Besides,

1288
01:20:36.451 --> 01:20:39.480
you didn't hear the things he was saying,
guys like that.

1289
01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:44.540
Parentheses in hip hop style clothing are the sleaziest of scumbags licking

1290
01:20:45.391 --> 01:20:49.560
their lips.
Nasty.
Who's hitting on you?
Ll Cool J,

1291
01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:53.790
why don't you fucking go to a nicer place anyways?
Uh,

1292
01:20:54.090 --> 01:20:57.840
as for the argument you had in the bar,
you didn't specify.

1293
01:20:57.870 --> 01:21:00.600
Now she's talking to me.
This is classic line.
Here she goes.

1294
01:21:00.601 --> 01:21:03.240
As for the argument you had with that woman in the bar.

1295
01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:07.800
You didn't specify what it was about,
what,
what it was about,

1296
01:21:07.950 --> 01:21:12.270
and if you are yelling in her face,
as you know,
you probably were.

1297
01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:15.870
Dot Dot,
dot.
More violent behavior.
You see that?

1298
01:21:17.450 --> 01:21:21.470
Let's stop right here.
This is what I love about this type of shit.

1299
01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:26.030
Anytime there's a group of people bitching about their situation,

1300
01:21:26.031 --> 01:21:29.030
nine times out of 10 when they're bitching,

1301
01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:33.230
they end up doing the exact same thing to the person that they're bitching at,

1302
01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:35.240
that they don't want done to them.

1303
01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:40.020
Look how you assume that immediately I'm getting hit.

1304
01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:42.960
I'm not hitting her back.
I'm getting hit and you're blaming me.

1305
01:21:42.961 --> 01:21:46.500
I'm surprised you didn't ask me what I was wearing.
Was I asking for

1306
01:21:48.190 --> 01:21:51.880
anyways,
you want to hear the story,
sweetheart?
This,
this is basically,

1307
01:21:51.910 --> 01:21:55.150
this is why this girl was punching me in the bar.
All right,

1308
01:21:56.230 --> 01:21:58.750
we're going back here about 10 years.
I'm standing up now.

1309
01:21:59.050 --> 01:22:01.840
I'm going to tell this story.
My dog's looking at me.
What's up Cleo?

1310
01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:06.190
How you doing?
Huh?
You're a female.
You can defend yourself.
You fucking psycho.

1311
01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:08.860
Um,
this,
this is what happened.
I was in,

1312
01:22:08.861 --> 01:22:11.950
I was in a bar and I was with somebody in mind.

1313
01:22:11.951 --> 01:22:14.560
This group of girls is next to us.
We're hitting on them.
You know,

1314
01:22:15.190 --> 01:22:18.070
we'll make jokes with joking around,
you know,
he tried to get women to laugh.

1315
01:22:18.071 --> 01:22:20.310
That's what the fuck you have to do.
Women,
I know you don't,

1316
01:22:20.350 --> 01:22:22.990
you don't understand that because you don't have to make somebody want to fuck

1317
01:22:22.991 --> 01:22:25.600
you.
Okay.
The same way,

1318
01:22:25.601 --> 01:22:29.530
I don't know what it's like to have to carry a fucking living thing inside of me

1319
01:22:29.531 --> 01:22:34.360
for nine months.
I understand.
We all have our advantages,
so whatever,

1320
01:22:34.361 --> 01:22:36.700
I'm not trying to be a Douche here,
but this is basically,
it's,

1321
01:22:36.701 --> 01:22:38.800
so we're trying to,
you know,
we're joking around or whatever.

1322
01:22:38.801 --> 01:22:39.670
I had a couple of drinks,

1323
01:22:39.671 --> 01:22:42.460
they had a couple of drinks and one of them was dressed like,

1324
01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:46.030
she looked like Rhoda on Mary Tyler Moore.
Right.

1325
01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:50.230
So at one point that girl goes up and uh,
she goes to go to the bathroom.

1326
01:22:50.231 --> 01:22:52.040
So I say to a friend and go,
Jesus Christ was she,

1327
01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:54.430
she a big fan of Mary Tyler Moore or what?
Right.

1328
01:22:54.431 --> 01:22:58.870
Made a joke about what she was wearing.
So another 20 minutes goes by,

1329
01:22:58.871 --> 01:23:01.950
those girls Kinda peeled off,
you know,
we weren't really talking to them anymore.

1330
01:23:01.990 --> 01:23:04.960
We were,
uh,
well maybe we kind of were,
I don't know what was going,

1331
01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:08.290
sort of that type of shit.
You're talking to a girl for a couple seconds,

1332
01:23:08.291 --> 01:23:09.640
then it's not working out.
So I went back,

1333
01:23:09.641 --> 01:23:14.641
I was talking to my friend and I guess when the girl came back from the,

1334
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:18.880
from the bathroom,
her friend told her what I said.

1335
01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:22.480
So unbeknownst to me,
so I'm sitting there talking to my buddy.

1336
01:23:22.481 --> 01:23:26.230
Then all of a sudden I just hear this,
this,
this woman yelling,

1337
01:23:26.410 --> 01:23:30.760
hey bitch,
hey bitch.
Right.

1338
01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:36.310
So I look over and she's looking at me.
She's going,
hey bitch.

1339
01:23:36.311 --> 01:23:40.420
And I'm,
and I'm,
I'm trying to process cause I,
you know,
typical may,

1340
01:23:40.421 --> 01:23:44.890
I said some shit,
I don't even remember what the fuck I said.
And then she goes,

1341
01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:49.840
you know,
you're going to talk shit about me when I'm not around.
And then I,

1342
01:23:49.841 --> 01:23:51.760
then I kind of was right as I'm putting it together.

1343
01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:56.230
Then she stood up and she fucking put her hand over it.
You ever see like a,

1344
01:23:56.290 --> 01:23:57.111
you ever see like a,

1345
01:23:57.111 --> 01:24:01.390
a center in the NBA how they fight or they can't throw fake fucking throw

1346
01:24:01.391 --> 01:24:06.160
punches like that?
They're trying to fucking throw somebody out at second base.

1347
01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:07.240
That's what she did.

1348
01:24:07.330 --> 01:24:11.380
She winds up and she's about ready to come down on the top of my head.

1349
01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:15.880
So you know,
because she wound up,
I mean,
if she fucking threw a jab,

1350
01:24:15.881 --> 01:24:17.710
she would've fucking blessed to me right in the face.

1351
01:24:17.711 --> 01:24:19.330
And I gotta admit that would've been fucking hilarious.

1352
01:24:19.510 --> 01:24:20.980
But because she went up and over,

1353
01:24:21.250 --> 01:24:24.570
I was able to get my arm up in time and I sought,

1354
01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:29.590
I sorta like cut her wrist.
So now I instantly,
I recognized the situation.

1355
01:24:29.591 --> 01:24:31.720
I'm like,
Oh fuck.
Okay,

1356
01:24:31.990 --> 01:24:35.890
this girl is not going to stop and I don't want to get hit in the face.

1357
01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:39.220
I can't squeeze her risk too hard.
All this shit's going through my head.

1358
01:24:39.221 --> 01:24:41.110
And I know,
even though I can't see it,

1359
01:24:41.111 --> 01:24:44.050
I know the bouncers are on their way over and I know what the fuck's going to

1360
01:24:44.051 --> 01:24:44.530
happen.

1361
01:24:44.530 --> 01:24:49.420
So all I'm doing is holding her wrist as she's fucking Klein at my side.

1362
01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:53.350
I'm sort of turned to the side and of course my buddies aren't doing anything

1363
01:24:53.490 --> 01:24:55.000
that's sort of just looking at this point,

1364
01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:58.750
cause it happened so fast and I'm going,
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.
I was going,
hey,
hey,
hey.

1365
01:24:59.470 --> 01:25:03.480
I can't remember.
I was saying I was just,
just too much shit was going on.
I,

1366
01:25:03.490 --> 01:25:07.480
I couldn't,
I couldn't formulate anything to say to get this girl to stop,

1367
01:25:07.481 --> 01:25:09.670
but she just kept fucking bitch.
You fucking bitch.

1368
01:25:09.870 --> 01:25:13.810
It was like punching me in the side and then the fucking bouncers come over and

1369
01:25:13.811 --> 01:25:18.730
they fucking grabbed me.
Of course,
because I'm the guy.
I just blew my mind.

1370
01:25:18.790 --> 01:25:20.710
I,
I'm fucking,

1371
01:25:21.070 --> 01:25:25.330
I almost have my back turned to this girl with my hand up and she's wailing away

1372
01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:29.440
and they immediately go to me and I get fucking tossed out.

1373
01:25:30.220 --> 01:25:32.980
You know?
So let me ask you this.
In her world,

1374
01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:37.120
was she justified for taking it to a physical level?

1375
01:25:37.121 --> 01:25:40.750
Because I fucking made fun of her outfit.
You know,

1376
01:25:41.350 --> 01:25:44.650
that was my point about that video.
I don't think that you should hit a woman.

1377
01:25:45.850 --> 01:25:49.000
Really.
The reality of that video that I,
that I watched,
they're on youtube,

1378
01:25:49.180 --> 01:25:52.000
is that they're both assholes and they're both stubborn.

1379
01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:56.380
And what happened there is what you saw when you get two stubborn people who

1380
01:25:56.381 --> 01:26:01.270
want to get the last word in.
Okay?
He had Sonor,
she tells him to go fuck himself.

1381
01:26:01.271 --> 01:26:03.530
Not since she literally said that,
but she basically says now,

1382
01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:07.170
so he couldn't handle it.
So he probably,
he starts it.
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna,

1383
01:26:07.190 --> 01:26:09.710
I'll go,
I'll give you that.
He starts it.
Okay.

1384
01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:15.260
And he wants to get the last word in so she can't let him.
Right.

1385
01:26:15.890 --> 01:26:18.600
He should have walked away,
but he didn't.
That's,
you know,

1386
01:26:18.770 --> 01:26:20.750
right in the beginning he didn't.
So he gives her shit.

1387
01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:24.500
Then she should've walked away,
realized he was a psycho.
She doesn't,

1388
01:26:24.530 --> 01:26:26.960
she fucking gives them the finger than he should have walked away.

1389
01:26:26.961 --> 01:26:30.560
But he doesn't,
he pokes her.
She should've walked away then,
but she doesn't,

1390
01:26:31.250 --> 01:26:34.220
she fucking throws a drink in his face.
He should have fucking walked away.

1391
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:35.090
He doesn't,

1392
01:26:35.090 --> 01:26:38.300
he fucking goes up and he likes sweeps or it's just one of those deals,

1393
01:26:38.450 --> 01:26:42.710
two fucking assholes who probably should be breeding and make a little fucking

1394
01:26:42.711 --> 01:26:45.970
asshole kid and then we'll have another dog.
The bounty hunter.
Huh?

1395
01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:50.390
You see how that math works out?
So anyways,
um,
I,
you know,
I don't know.

1396
01:26:50.630 --> 01:26:53.360
Sometimes I feel like I'm saying shit and people don't get what the fuck I'm

1397
01:26:53.361 --> 01:26:55.490
talking about.
I'm not saying that you should go around hitting a woman.

1398
01:26:55.491 --> 01:26:57.710
I'm just saying,
you know,
guys should never hit women,

1399
01:26:57.711 --> 01:27:00.950
but women shouldn't take advantage of that by doing outrageous shit.

1400
01:27:01.370 --> 01:27:06.370
Like throwing a drink in somebody's face that is fucking outrageous behavior.

1401
01:27:07.071 --> 01:27:08.510
And be honest.
As a female,

1402
01:27:08.570 --> 01:27:11.300
if another female walked up to you and threw a drink in your face,

1403
01:27:11.301 --> 01:27:16.220
what would you do?
Huh?
What would you do?
Would you just go,
oh,
that was mature?

1404
01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:18.440
Do you feel better about yourself?

1405
01:27:18.441 --> 01:27:22.580
Is sprite is dripping down the fucking your bangs?
Whatever fucking

1406
01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:27.440
you got that Rachel Bob Haircut from friends.
Huh?
Look at me.

1407
01:27:27.710 --> 01:27:32.160
Look at me with that fucking check reference.
Um,
whatever.
Uh,

1408
01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:35.060
it gives a fuck.
Anyways.
All right,
here's,
here's some videos.
So I actually was,

1409
01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:39.110
I nominated that video for a video of the year and a,

1410
01:27:39.111 --> 01:27:42.980
so people sent me some other videos and I'm really upset at myself because

1411
01:27:42.981 --> 01:27:47.060
somebody sent me a great video of these two bullies attacking this guy with his

1412
01:27:47.061 --> 01:27:48.800
girlfriend and his,

1413
01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:53.240
the guy's girlfriend jumps in and she fucking blast this guy in the face in the

1414
01:27:53.241 --> 01:27:56.780
end.
It's a fucking awesome video.
Um,
so I,

1415
01:27:56.781 --> 01:27:59.930
I really need that video so I can balance it out.
So,
you know,

1416
01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:04.850
so I don't just have videos of guys knocking women down because,
uh,

1417
01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:07.070
that's not what I'm trying to do here.
You know what I mean?

1418
01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:09.500
This is supposed to be a fun thing for everybody.
And,
uh,

1419
01:28:11.940 --> 01:28:14.790
all right,
so here you go.
Here's some nominees.
Uh,
somebody,
uh,

1420
01:28:15.020 --> 01:28:17.610
oh and a fan said a ace freely was in,
uh,

1421
01:28:17.611 --> 01:28:21.890
I was on the show this week celebrating Jim Norton's birthday.
Um,

1422
01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:25.420
and he recommended a video called Winnebago man.
I watched it.

1423
01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:29.450
It's fucking hilarious.
Um,
Google how to spell Winham Winnebago.

1424
01:28:29.451 --> 01:28:32.090
I'm just going to tell you what the name of the videos are.
Uh,

1425
01:28:32.091 --> 01:28:35.870
there's another one,
a guy with gun confronts skateboarder,

1426
01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:41.660
and there's another one that says,
uh,
this is the last one.

1427
01:28:41.661 --> 01:28:46.280
And I deliberately put this one last because this is more in the vein of last

1428
01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:49.730
week's video.
It says,
guy gets revenge on girlfriend for headache.

1429
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:55.000
This one's really more silly and I'm actually jealous of like how perfectly this

1430
01:28:58.580 --> 01:29:03.480
guy's prank works out.
It's just,
it's,
it really is a work of art.
And,
uh,

1431
01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:07.230
most females won't like it,
but it's,
you know,
no one gets hurt in this one.
Okay?

1432
01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:12.000
Nobody's head hits concrete.
Um,
yeah,
that's it.

1433
01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:14.850
Okay.
And if you're sick of those kinds of videos,
there's one on there.

1434
01:29:14.970 --> 01:29:18.900
Have a little fucking golden retriever.
Puppy howling.
All right,

1435
01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:22.290
go Google that one.
Okay.
That'll make you fucking smile.
All right,

1436
01:29:22.770 --> 01:29:26.070
I'm going to have to wind this.
Jesus Christ.
47 fucking minutes.
All right,

1437
01:29:26.071 --> 01:29:28.830
let me wind this up real quick.
We're talking about grenades again,

1438
01:29:28.831 --> 01:29:32.940
people the subject that just won't die.
Uh,

1439
01:29:33.510 --> 01:29:37.080
anyways,
uh,
Bill,
I missed the last couple of podcasts.
This is from a marine,

1440
01:29:37.081 --> 01:29:38.610
so we can all hang out here,
right?

1441
01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:42.810
47 minutes and let's support the troops and listened to the last few minutes of

1442
01:29:42.811 --> 01:29:46.920
the podcast here.
I missed the last few podcasts,
but there was,
um,

1443
01:29:47.850 --> 01:29:50.880
there was a lot about the military.
You seem to be interested in the military,

1444
01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:51.930
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1445
01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:57.150
And I was a marine for four years and did my tour in the sandbox.

1446
01:29:57.210 --> 01:29:58.560
Parentheses,
Iraq.

1447
01:29:58.950 --> 01:30:02.670
Go on Wikipedia and type in operation Phantom fury.

1448
01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:04.530
Those are my credentials.

1449
01:30:05.010 --> 01:30:08.610
That kid you talked about on six 29 was kind of a joke.

1450
01:30:09.090 --> 01:30:10.350
I can tell by what he says.

1451
01:30:10.351 --> 01:30:14.250
So he's basically saying the other are there other military person who gave me

1452
01:30:14.251 --> 01:30:18.030
my grenade information is,
uh,
you know,

1453
01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:22.380
I guess working in a mess hall.
Look at me trying to start some shit.
Look at me.

1454
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:26.490
Huh?
Hey Guy from our June 29th,
you're going to take that shit.

1455
01:30:26.730 --> 01:30:29.400
He's saying you don't know about grenades.
So anyways,

1456
01:30:29.401 --> 01:30:32.640
he says frag grenades have a kill radius of five meters.

1457
01:30:33.210 --> 01:30:38.210
A casualty is 15 meters casualty.

1458
01:30:39.571 --> 01:30:42.150
I guess that's the shrapnel.
Okay.
Marines defined,

1459
01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:45.210
definitely use frags when necessary.

1460
01:30:45.450 --> 01:30:48.210
They use flash bangs when doing raids.

1461
01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:52.770
If you're using a flash bang and entering a room and you shoot blindly

1462
01:30:52.771 --> 01:30:54.780
everywhere,
it is totally contrary.

1463
01:30:54.900 --> 01:30:57.840
It's a total contradiction to what you're doing in the first price.

1464
01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:01.800
Trying not to kill everyone in the room.
If there's bad guys in there,

1465
01:31:01.980 --> 01:31:05.010
you frag the fucks,
I guess that she throw the grenade in there.

1466
01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:06.270
And if you throw in one,

1467
01:31:06.271 --> 01:31:11.271
you might as well throw in five grenades aren't that lethal while they are,

1468
01:31:11.610 --> 01:31:15.780
but it just kinda depends.
Two guys in another company tossed grenades into the,

1469
01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:19.800
into a house from different directions only to have the grenades roll across the

1470
01:31:19.801 --> 01:31:24.540
house,
cross paths and in front of the other marine respectively.
Jesus Christ,

1471
01:31:24.541 --> 01:31:26.940
I think I saw this on the three stooges.
Uh,

1472
01:31:27.090 --> 01:31:31.680
they both dove away and Eileen and only received a minor shrapnel to the legs.

1473
01:31:32.610 --> 01:31:35.700
I'm more of something to laugh about more than anything.
All right,

1474
01:31:35.701 --> 01:31:38.220
so there's your grenade information.
Here we go with earplugs.

1475
01:31:38.221 --> 01:31:42.570
Getting back to the tonight is shit.
Um,
when in some nasty shit,

1476
01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:47.580
basically when you're in battle,
you have one ear plug in and one out.
Uh,

1477
01:31:47.610 --> 01:31:52.560
due to the sound resistance created by plugs in only allows you to hear a

1478
01:31:52.561 --> 01:31:55.260
certain range of noise.
Take one out.

1479
01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:59.470
And it allows you to hear the larger range of noise even after you can barely

1480
01:31:59.471 --> 01:32:02.170
hear out of one ear.
Do.
That's fucking insane.

1481
01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:04.750
That's what I did and it always worked.

1482
01:32:05.740 --> 01:32:09.970
So basically you sacrifice one year.
Did you switch off every other battle?

1483
01:32:10.690 --> 01:32:14.200
You know,
or did you just say,
fuck my left ear?
Um,

1484
01:32:14.201 --> 01:32:16.370
I guess you need to do that because what if you have the earplugs into

1485
01:32:16.690 --> 01:32:20.080
somebody's sneaking up behind you?
Good God,
thank God.

1486
01:32:20.140 --> 01:32:23.170
Thank God I didn't have to do that.
God bless Ya.
Anyways,

1487
01:32:23.210 --> 01:32:26.650
a machine gun next to an unprotected ear isn't that bad at all.

1488
01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:30.340
Loud is explosions.
Loud is airstrikes.

1489
01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:34.640
Loud rockets loud is standing next to a tank in an alley and not having an ear

1490
01:32:35.140 --> 01:32:37.540
plugs.
The concussion river reverberates.

1491
01:32:37.541 --> 01:32:41.890
And Record Shay's along the walls in the of the buildings.
Um,

1492
01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:46.300
I know because it happened to me when in my ears started to leak clear fluid,

1493
01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:50.770
presumably,
presumably from perforated eardrums.

1494
01:32:51.310 --> 01:32:53.380
The sound was beyond sound.

1495
01:32:54.370 --> 01:32:56.410
That's one of the greatest sentences I've ever read.

1496
01:32:56.411 --> 01:33:01.090
As far as like fucking description.
The sound was beyond sound.
It was an impact.

1497
01:33:01.091 --> 01:33:05.890
It felt like I was hit with a two by four across my entire body all at once.

1498
01:33:06.250 --> 01:33:11.000
My face and my balls hurt.
She says,

1499
01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:15.490
right.
That's from sound,
I guess.
I don't fucking know.

1500
01:33:15.491 --> 01:33:18.570
Just shut up and read a bill.
All right.
Um,
I had my one,

1501
01:33:18.610 --> 01:33:21.150
I had my wind knocked out.
Basically I was,

1502
01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:23.230
I was almost even with the barrel of them,

1503
01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:26.260
of the main tank gun and the fucking tankers,

1504
01:33:26.590 --> 01:33:30.070
fucking guys in the tank never gave us a signal that they were going to shoot.

1505
01:33:31.510 --> 01:33:36.280
Um,
that's what it can cost of a concussion blast feels like and it gets worse.

1506
01:33:36.281 --> 01:33:40.420
The closer you get and the bigger the explosion is throwing some shrapnel and

1507
01:33:40.421 --> 01:33:42.390
you get the idea.
Jesus Christ.
Dude,

1508
01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:46.240
this is better than the fucking history channel.
I'm really enjoying this.

1509
01:33:46.270 --> 01:33:50.620
All right.
Um,
and you talked about the stress of battle.

1510
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:55.950
There was one dude who was about to get out of an Aa v big armored vehicle and

1511
01:33:56.351 --> 01:34:00.970
he went blind,
I guess he's saying from the stress.

1512
01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:05.170
And then he writes,
just went blind.
He regained his sight a few days later,

1513
01:34:05.470 --> 01:34:09.490
but right before he got out,
he literally had to turn around and say,
ah,

1514
01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:13.960
I can't fucking see Jesus Christ.

1515
01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:17.890
Um,
as for a funny store.
Oh,
you know what that reminds me.

1516
01:34:18.070 --> 01:34:21.130
Have you guys seen that movie?
Uh,
the fuck was that.

1517
01:34:21.131 --> 01:34:25.490
I was going to tell you to watch that last week.
It was that,

1518
01:34:25.491 --> 01:34:28.600
it was an animated movie about war.

1519
01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:33.880
The fuck was it called?
I just rented it walls with walls with Bryshere.

1520
01:34:35.020 --> 01:34:38.200
You guys see that?
I def,
I highly recommend that.

1521
01:34:38.890 --> 01:34:43.780
That's about a guy who went to war and when he came back he couldn't fucking

1522
01:34:43.781 --> 01:34:44.620
remember anything.

1523
01:34:44.621 --> 01:34:48.310
So then he goes around and he talks to his former army buddies.
You know,

1524
01:34:48.340 --> 01:34:51.580
that's the whole hook.
A guy who can't remember,

1525
01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:54.220
goes around and talks to those who can't forget.

1526
01:34:54.250 --> 01:34:58.400
It's pretty fucking pretty fucking amazing.
So anyways,
let me continue here.

1527
01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:03.530
Um,
and as far as for a funny story,
um,

1528
01:35:04.430 --> 01:35:06.350
in war the stories are all fucked up.

1529
01:35:06.351 --> 01:35:10.580
It's all fucked up humor when you're over there like really sadistic fucked up

1530
01:35:10.581 --> 01:35:15.410
shit.
Even the nicest evangelists stick person or a Mormon,
uh,

1531
01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:17.600
we'll have the same humor over there.
Personally,

1532
01:35:17.601 --> 01:35:21.170
I found it hilarious when insurgents were so drugged up,

1533
01:35:21.740 --> 01:35:26.030
they would literally step out of an alley in front of a tank about 50 feet away

1534
01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:29.120
and just start shooting an AK 47 at the thing.

1535
01:35:29.570 --> 01:35:33.530
The machine gun on the tank would slowly point towards the dude and just shred

1536
01:35:33.531 --> 01:35:37.580
them.
That's funny when you're over there.
Wow.

1537
01:35:37.970 --> 01:35:42.410
This is like time life books presents the Iraq war as it's going on.

1538
01:35:42.411 --> 01:35:47.360
So let me ask you this.
You saying the dude,
so like hopped up on drugs,

1539
01:35:47.361 --> 01:35:51.920
like are a lot of the insurgents over there on drugs and why are they on drugs?

1540
01:35:52.130 --> 01:35:55.340
Cause they're scared from the stress of the battle.
I mean,
I can't,

1541
01:35:55.341 --> 01:35:57.310
I can't imagine that anyway.

1542
01:35:57.580 --> 01:36:02.480
It's probably the best story that normal people can relate to was when we first

1543
01:36:02.481 --> 01:36:06.710
took over a centrally located compound within the city of Fallujah,

1544
01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:12.080
um,
referred to above his operation Phantom fury.
Dude,
you were in Fallujah.

1545
01:36:12.081 --> 01:36:15.770
Holy Shit.
All right,
this is a great story by the way.
So hang in there guys.

1546
01:36:15.771 --> 01:36:20.570
I know this is long.
Um,
this was the third day of the assault on the city.

1547
01:36:20.900 --> 01:36:24.360
Obviously after three days,
a bunch of dudes,
um,

1548
01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:28.460
are going to have to take a shit at some point.
So we had to dig some trenches,

1549
01:36:29.210 --> 01:36:29.930
the trenches.

1550
01:36:29.930 --> 01:36:32.900
We're in the middle of a large courtyard about the size of a football field,

1551
01:36:32.901 --> 01:36:36.290
and instead of just standing over the trench like a dog and squatting to shit,

1552
01:36:36.620 --> 01:36:40.880
we knew we had to find something to assist us when we dropped guts.

1553
01:36:41.660 --> 01:36:44.240
Good Lord.
Okay.
I mean,
fuck it.
We're going to have to,

1554
01:36:44.241 --> 01:36:47.900
if we're going to get popped while taking a shit,
we better be comfortable.

1555
01:36:48.170 --> 01:36:51.710
We started searching around and inside some of the side buildings,

1556
01:36:51.711 --> 01:36:53.870
we found some chairs and some wooden boxes.

1557
01:36:54.140 --> 01:36:58.670
We cut holes in them and position them over the trenches.
Um,
the area wasn't,

1558
01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:03.950
uh,
what the military would deem as a,
would not consider a secure at the time.

1559
01:37:03.951 --> 01:37:08.210
But after eating the instant dehydrated shit meals called Mras,

1560
01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:11.180
which constipate you,
uh,

1561
01:37:11.210 --> 01:37:14.930
you having constant op operations for three days,
we hadn't,

1562
01:37:15.230 --> 01:37:20.230
Shah had a satisfying shit for three days after the new shitters were set up.

1563
01:37:20.990 --> 01:37:25.910
Guys were a little apprehensive to go out there as there were still RPGs mortars

1564
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:28.640
in gunfires directed towards our compound.

1565
01:37:29.450 --> 01:37:34.340
You have to understand that marines and the marine corps,
all right,
this is,

1566
01:37:34.341 --> 01:37:36.620
this is,
this is him saying this shit,
not me.

1567
01:37:36.621 --> 01:37:39.200
You have to understand that the marines in the Marine Corps,
uh,

1568
01:37:39.201 --> 01:37:42.380
like are retarded.
Many individuals are very,

1569
01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:44.900
actually are very intelligent within the marines,

1570
01:37:44.901 --> 01:37:47.720
but the Marine Corps just makes you into a retard.

1571
01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:51.800
And therefore the policies within the marine corps are retarded as well.

1572
01:37:51.950 --> 01:37:54.770
The only thing the marine corps doesn't fuck up his combat.

1573
01:37:55.290 --> 01:37:59.820
This retardation is why most people realis less with the Marine Corps than any

1574
01:37:59.821 --> 01:38:03.370
other branch.
Well,
you have to expand on that.
So anyway,

1575
01:38:03.371 --> 01:38:07.110
so being the rete retarded marines,
we were,
we said fuck it.

1576
01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:11.880
A bunch of US strolled out and took off our kavlaars,
our helmets and flax,

1577
01:38:11.881 --> 01:38:15.360
bulletproof vests as well as our blouses shirts.

1578
01:38:15.630 --> 01:38:20.190
Within two minutes there were 10 or 12 marine sitting in the middle of a bay,
uh,

1579
01:38:20.220 --> 01:38:23.250
middle of this field,
bear his bones court yard,

1580
01:38:23.251 --> 01:38:26.820
the size of a football field with only t shirts and trousers at the ankles,

1581
01:38:26.821 --> 01:38:28.620
smoking butts,
chewing dip,

1582
01:38:28.621 --> 01:38:32.760
joking around like where we had a fucking Applebee's while there were explosions

1583
01:38:32.761 --> 01:38:36.270
and gunfire going off 150 meters away.
Jesus Christ,

1584
01:38:36.271 --> 01:38:40.890
it was Robert Duvall will fucking surfing in the background.
Actually,

1585
01:38:40.950 --> 01:38:42.750
he didn't surf.
He was on the beach anyways.
Um,

1586
01:38:42.751 --> 01:38:45.780
as we were sitting there are few civilian reporters poke their heads out of the

1587
01:38:45.781 --> 01:38:47.700
compound and went back in.

1588
01:38:48.540 --> 01:38:52.830
They were looking to see in the proverbial coast to see if the proverbial coast

1589
01:38:52.831 --> 01:38:56.460
was clear to the armored vehicle they were using for transport.

1590
01:38:56.640 --> 01:39:00.750
So basically there was a bunch of reporters poking their heads out trying to get

1591
01:39:00.751 --> 01:39:03.240
over to their fucking armored transport.
Mind you,

1592
01:39:03.241 --> 01:39:07.890
this was the typical type of vehicle with the type of armor that our unit

1593
01:39:07.891 --> 01:39:12.060
couldn't get at the time because ours kept getting fucked up and it was too much

1594
01:39:12.061 --> 01:39:16.950
of a monetary drain to give us the proper protection because our big vehicles

1595
01:39:17.230 --> 01:39:19.530
will get blown up every couple of weeks.
Sorry,

1596
01:39:19.590 --> 01:39:22.910
I'm paraphrasing cause this is a really fucking long,
um,
these business,

1597
01:39:22.930 --> 01:39:25.140
these people had no business being there and they knew it.

1598
01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:28.620
This was evidenced by the fact that they continue to poke their heads out of

1599
01:39:29.180 --> 01:39:30.540
doorways several more times.

1600
01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:34.170
Apparently they got the carer courage up because all at once,

1601
01:39:34.171 --> 01:39:37.980
the group of about 10 people who look like my seventh grade,

1602
01:39:38.220 --> 01:39:42.600
a gym class started making their way to the armor armored vehicle in there.

1603
01:39:42.601 --> 01:39:46.170
Gay Little Blue Helmets and vests that read press in big,

1604
01:39:46.171 --> 01:39:51.171
bold white letters there were visibly nervous jogging mechanically and looking

1605
01:39:51.781 --> 01:39:56.130
spastically in every direction as if they would somehow be able to change their

1606
01:39:56.131 --> 01:39:56.941
fate.
Infants,

1607
01:39:56.941 --> 01:40:01.260
if an insurgent decided to lean out a window and opened fire at them as they

1608
01:40:01.261 --> 01:40:02.041
jogged along,

1609
01:40:02.041 --> 01:40:06.420
we sat there half naked from the bottom down and stared at them in utter

1610
01:40:06.421 --> 01:40:09.450
amusement.
After a few seconds of silence,

1611
01:40:09.451 --> 01:40:13.130
someone shitting next to me screamed and comment.

1612
01:40:13.470 --> 01:40:16.920
It was like a kick to the fucking nuts.
Uh,

1613
01:40:16.921 --> 01:40:20.550
something snapped or reporters absolutely lost their shit.

1614
01:40:21.210 --> 01:40:24.870
There was one of the most beautiful examples of Darwinism in action that I've

1615
01:40:24.871 --> 01:40:25.561
ever witnessed.

1616
01:40:25.561 --> 01:40:29.340
The strongest and fastest males threw themselves into the truck first,

1617
01:40:29.670 --> 01:40:32.040
not far behind where there's smaller males.

1618
01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:36.210
They were then followed by the most attractive females who were polled almost

1619
01:40:36.211 --> 01:40:39.750
instantly into the end of the truck.
Um,

1620
01:40:39.810 --> 01:40:41.220
in last where the wingman,

1621
01:40:43.410 --> 01:40:47.730
wingman grenades helped in only by their own,
their own large legs.

1622
01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:51.420
I don't get that last sentence.
Uh,
after they realized that they were actually,

1623
01:40:51.421 --> 01:40:55.660
there was no actually incoming
really butchering this,
sorry,

1624
01:40:55.661 --> 01:40:57.160
I'm seeing double at this point.
Uh,

1625
01:40:57.161 --> 01:41:00.100
after they realize that there actually was no incoming,

1626
01:41:00.101 --> 01:41:04.880
they slowly sheepishly turned to look over at us as we were sitting there with

1627
01:41:05.020 --> 01:41:08.710
their balls flapping in the wind dirty as fuck while pushing out three days

1628
01:41:08.711 --> 01:41:13.711
worth of compacted tar and having no business being happy in any way whatsoever.

1629
01:41:13.870 --> 01:41:16.270
But we were absolutely all dying with laughter.

1630
01:41:16.540 --> 01:41:20.530
We continue laughing as they drove by and we sat there smiling and waving at

1631
01:41:20.531 --> 01:41:25.090
them wildly like what people do when a cruise ship leaves port.

1632
01:41:25.630 --> 01:41:30.370
They stared at us and complete bewilderment and just simply started shaking

1633
01:41:30.371 --> 01:41:34.750
their heads in a way of parent does when a small child gets a pair of new

1634
01:41:34.751 --> 01:41:37.840
clothes covered in spaghetti and meat sauce.

1635
01:41:38.710 --> 01:41:41.830
But we weren't kids and we definitely weren't dirty from eating spaghetti.

1636
01:41:41.831 --> 01:41:43.270
Fucking classic.
Dude,

1637
01:41:43.271 --> 01:41:45.730
that's a great story and I apologize for butchering that thing.

1638
01:41:45.731 --> 01:41:48.420
I suck at reading out loud.
Um,
anyways,

1639
01:41:48.430 --> 01:41:50.980
this podcast has to be over a fucking hour at this point.
Yeah,

1640
01:41:51.070 --> 01:41:52.750
it just turned an hour.
All right.

1641
01:41:52.830 --> 01:41:57.100
This has been a really long podcast with a lot of information.
Um,

1642
01:41:57.310 --> 01:42:00.820
this has been the encyclopedia Britannica version of the Monday morning podcast.

1643
01:42:00.821 --> 01:42:03.670
You guys all have a good week.
I hope you enjoyed the stories.

1644
01:42:03.671 --> 01:42:05.170
Forgive me for my awful reading.
Yeah.

1645
01:42:05.770 --> 01:42:09.490

01:42:12.881 --> 01:42:17.881
Rhode Island in August and the next week I will be at the punchline in Atlanta,

1648
01:42:19.481 --> 01:42:24.070
Georgia.
And after that,
the final day,
August 29th,

1649
01:42:24.071 --> 01:42:27.630
I'm going to be in Stockholm,
Sweden.
So,

1650
01:42:28.070 --> 01:42:29.410

1651

1656
01:42:43.950 --> 01:42:47.430
<v 0>um,
my faith in my space.
There's just nobody left on there.</v>

1657
01:42:47.431 --> 01:42:50.850
Like nobody fucking emails me anymore.
So,
um,

1658
01:42:51.660 --> 01:42:54.630
and I don't want to join Facebook and I don't want to tweet.

1659
01:42:55.110 --> 01:42:59.760
So I think I'm just going to basically maybe phase out my myspace page and I'm

1660
01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:04.680
going to,
wow.
Just start doing shit on my,
uh,
my website.
Mainly.

1661
01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:07.330
That's the plan.
All right.
You guys all have a great week.

1662
01:43:51.890 --> 01:43:52.723
<v 8>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

1663
01:44:00.410 --> 01:44:01.243
<v 1>nope.</v>

1664
01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:33.000
Cool.
