We have actually come across the notion of frames earlier,

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.550
when we were talking about production systems.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.700
You may recall we had a diagram like this, where we had procedural, semantic and

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.240
episodic knowledge, and the working memory container structure like this.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.570
You can see this is really a frame, here are the slots, here are the values for

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.150
the slots. We can think of these frames as capturing conceptual knowledge,

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.650
that is stored in the semantic memory. So let's take an example.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.250
Suppose an input is a shark ate a frog. Remember the word ate there, and

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.160
that verb ate gets returned to working memory, and the entire frame for

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.750
ate gets pulled out. Once this frame is pulled out of semantic memory,

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.520
it immediately generates expectations. So we now know, that ate is likely to

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.210
have a subject, an object and location, perhaps time utensils and so

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.400
on. So we can ask ourselves the question, well what will go, under subject here?

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.480
What will go under object here? And in the sentence a shark ate a frog.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.950
This frame tells us, what to look for. As a result of which, the processing is

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.420
not just bottom up, coming from natural language or the world in general, and

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.750
going into mind. Also, mind provides knowledge structures like frames,

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.830
which, structured knowledge representations, which generate expectations and

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.480
make the processing, partially top down.
