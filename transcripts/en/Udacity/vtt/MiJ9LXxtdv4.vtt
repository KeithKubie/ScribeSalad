00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.490
Now let's summarize what we've
shown about the all-pairs

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.430
shortest path problem.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.850
The Floyd-Warshall algorithm,

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.790
which is based on dynamic programming,
finds the shortest path for all pairs of

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.800
vertices in a weighted graph in time
cubic in the number of vertices.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.480
Recall that we have to
fill out that whole table,

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.890
which has size v squared v times.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.350
The key optimal similar substructure
came from considering optimal paths

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.210
by a restricted set of vertices,
1 through k.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.881
And that gave us the recurrence, where
the shortest path between two vertices

00:00:33.881 --> 00:00:37.220
either used the new intermediate
vertex or it didn't.
