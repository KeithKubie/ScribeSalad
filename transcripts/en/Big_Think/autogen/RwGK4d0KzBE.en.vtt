i think that's that would lead to

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680
i think that's that would lead to
 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.860
i think that's that would lead to
optimism but i'm not going to be blindly

optimistic we need to have activists and

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539
optimistic we need to have activists and
 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.830
optimistic we need to have activists and
people who get inspired by activists

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840
 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.760

things that makes humans fairly amazing
is that they do live for a long time

but it's very hard to predict exactly

but it's very hard to predict exactly

that time it's not inevitable because

that time it's not inevitable because

that time it's not inevitable because
right now it's it's a trade-off between

right now it's it's a trade-off between
 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.290

expensive space missions out there and I

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610
expensive space missions out there and I

trade off we will probably do both as we

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130
trade off we will probably do both as we
 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.390
trade off we will probably do both as we
have but it would be great if we cured

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400
have but it would be great if we cured
 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.770

poverty and then used all those

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780
poverty and then used all those
 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.930
poverty and then used all those
resources those additional minds and so

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940
resources those additional minds and so
 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.090

I think sub / orbital is is very far

stretch from where we need to go because

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360
stretch from where we need to go because
 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.470

out there is a lot of radiation and a

know space elevators build very thin

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620

us that would not be affected by space

because like the Earth's atmosphere they

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380
because like the Earth's atmosphere they

protection from cosmic radiation so I

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340
protection from cosmic radiation so I

think these are things are not commonly

discussed even getting to Mars is

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990

extraordinarily expensive undertaking

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320

solar system is almost beyond fastening
 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.260
solar system is almost beyond fastening
from an economic standpoint and it

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270
from an economic standpoint and it
 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.300
from an economic standpoint and it
really requires we have all the rest of

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310
really requires we have all the rest of
 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.139
really requires we have all the rest of
our economics I think in good shape
