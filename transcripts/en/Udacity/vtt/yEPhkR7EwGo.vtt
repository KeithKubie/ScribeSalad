00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.059
Now that we've found the distribution that results in our observed data, what

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:07.920
confidence can we have that the data parameter we captured is the true value.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.500
The answer is it turns out it depends on how much data we have.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.210
To understand why this is, let's consider the following.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.870
Imagine that the graph on the left and

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.480
the right are going to show the PDF for a random variable x.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.150
Let's suppose the one on the left looks like this, and

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.880
the one on the right looks like this.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.110
We can ask the question what's the probability that the random variable x will

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.980
be greater than a value t.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.080
For the graph on the right, more of the probability mass is over on

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.940
the right side, so it's not surprising that the probability that x is

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.320
greater than t is larger for the graph on the right, than the one on the left.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.870
There is an inequality called Markov's Inequality, which quantifies this notion.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.540
Specifically, Markov's Inequality says that, for any random variable, x,

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.760
the probability that it is greater than t is less than or

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.760
equal to, its expectation divided by the number t.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.070
Now, for the derivation of this, please see a link in the instructor's notes.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.450
Now, this becomes really interesting when you substitute x with x minus mu.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.730
Meaning the mean value of x.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.630
That is you can think of this quantity here on the right.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.040
As x's deviation from its mean value.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.140
When you take this and substitute it into Markov's equality.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.450
It then becomes something called Chebyshev's inequality.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.500
Chebyshev's inequality says that,

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.930
the probability that x deviates from it's mean value by an amount,

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.100
t, is bounded by an expression described by it's variants and t.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.890
This is actually really amazing, and

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.090
quantifies exactly the concepts that we have intuitively talking about.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.010
It says the probability that x deviates from its mean is directly related to

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.530
its variance and its true for any random variable at all.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.970
Now here's where we get back into thinking about our beta parameter from our

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.200
exponential fit.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.310
Recall that if you have a bunch of data points x1 through xn,

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.220
and you suspect that they might be fit by an exponential distribution.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.000
The maximum likelihood estimation method says,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.750
the way we get the beta parameter for that exponential distribution is to

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.420
take the average of the values you have collected.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.640
Now, x bar itself is a random variable, and so we can reason about how

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.540
much does the X bar that we've calculated deviate from the true beta value.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.180
And let's note the actual beta value with a beta star.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.620
Now to calculate this we can just directly use Chebyshev's inequality.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.660
Now all we're doing is we're substituting x bar minus beta star with x.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.380
If we do that, we have this expression,

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.090
the probability of x bar minus beta star is greater than epsilon is less than or

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.140
equal to the variance of x bar divided by epsilon squared.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.690
And that number turns out to be less than 1 divided by 4n epsilon squared.
