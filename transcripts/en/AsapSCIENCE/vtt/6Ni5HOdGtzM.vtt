00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.032
So you have heard many of life's curiosities,
but did you know that cashews grow on apples?

00:00:05.032 --> 00:00:09.299
In this case the apple is simple an accessory fruit,
with the cashew growing on top.

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:13.688
Or how about the fact that mushrooms are more closely
related to animals than plants.

00:00:13.688 --> 00:00:18.952
The most common ancestor between humans and mushrooms
is more recent than that of mushrooms and plants.

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:22.150
Trees, they actually grow out of the air, not the ground.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:29.353
Though they recieve some minerals from the soil, the carbon dioxide
from air goes into the tree and with the help of the sun removes the oxygen.

00:00:29.353 --> 00:00:33.008
This carbon is left with water to create the substance
of the tree.

00:00:33.008 --> 00:00:38.818
And did you know that there is enough water in Lake Superior
to cover all of North and South America with one foot of water.

00:00:38.818 --> 00:00:44.266
Or that there are more stars in the visible universe,
than all the grains of sand on all the beaches of the Earth.

00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:48.121
And yet the number of synapses in your brains'
cerebral cortex alone,

00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:50.139
about one hundred and twenty five trillion,

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:54.702
is the amount of stars that would fill 1500 milky way galaxies.

00:00:54.702 --> 00:00:58.458
But an atom is about 99.99% empty space

00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:01.233
making everything in the universe mostly nothing.

00:01:01.233 --> 00:01:05.279
Including your body, which by the way, is constantly replacing its cells.

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:09.131
So much so, that every 10 years your entire body has
replaced itself.

00:01:09.131 --> 00:01:11.364
Every atom in your body is different now,

00:01:11.364 --> 00:01:16.716
meaning you have no more in common with your previous self than 
any other human being that has lived or will ever live.

00:01:16.716 --> 00:01:21.801
All the while, there are more bacteria cells in your body
than actual somatic body cells.

00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:28.577
And if you've made it to age 18, you have on average 3200 - 3500 weekends
left in your lifetime.

00:01:28.577 --> 00:01:32.071
More importantly, you only have about 57 summers left.

00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:35.916
And did you know while dragon flies have legs, 
they cannot walk, only land.

00:01:35.916 --> 00:01:41.516
Or that in a population of clown fish, if the female dies or is removed
the most dominant male will become a female.

00:01:41.516 --> 00:01:46.854
The Tyrannosaurus in terms of time, is closer to today than to when the
Stegosaurus roamed the Earth.

00:01:46.854 --> 00:01:52.732
To the same token, Cleopatra lived closer to the
first moon landing than to the construction of the pyramids.

00:01:52.732 --> 00:01:56.551
And just for fun, when I say it, you are now breathing manually.

00:01:56.551 --> 00:02:01.399
