00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.600
SMITHA HANEEF: We want you to
feel like you're in a place

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.620
that you would refer to
as a home away from home,

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.230
and eventually
becomes your home.

00:00:20.834 --> 00:00:23.490
MICHAEL GATTIS: Our
mission is to tie

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.530
into what is going
on here at Princeton,

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.920
and that's education.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.180
And we have that gift, to be
able to do that through food.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.120
Students that haven't
tried something can try it,

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.310
and it's opening up
their world as well.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.520
SMITHA HANEEF: Right now
for the Class of 2020,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.860
it's the largest percentage
of diverse student

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.860
body we have seen in the
history of Princeton.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.700
So it's a beautiful confluence
of such a wide range

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.850
of diverse communities
coming together.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.990
And through food, we are able
to not only educate and nourish

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.270
them, but also inform them
about cultural sensitivities,

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.420
about diverse ethnic
cuisine types.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.320
We celebrate five heritage
months across campus.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.870
And student groups
engage with us

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.970
in designing menus and events.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.000
During the Native
American Heritage Month,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.270
one of our students,
Emery, came to us

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.430
and partnered with
our team members.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.140
In fact, he is leaving
a legacy for Princeton

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.400
in educating about Native
American heritage through food

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.460
and through food culture.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.920
EMERY REAL BIRD: One
of our main events

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.710
was the Night of Native Foods.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.840
And basically it was a
time to highlight food that

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.650
originated from the Americas.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.340
So you're thinking of
corn, beans, tomatoes.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.230
And we also look to
Native suppliers.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.940
So there was actual wild
rice, not cultivated

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:59.790
in the large fields.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.630
So there are recipes that are
derived from foods that people

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.542
who are American Indian, but
of a certain tribal group, that

00:02:06.542 --> 00:02:07.500
is what they would eat.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.900
MAYEE CHEN: Asian
Pacific Heritage Month

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.630
is a month long of
different events

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.880
celebrating all
aspects of the culture,

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.250
for Asian and Pacific Islanders.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.920
We have Whitman having
a Hawaiian theme,

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.860
Wilson having a Chinese
theme, and Rocky

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.250
having an Indian theme.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.840
Oftentimes it's like we get our
plates of food, we sit down,

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.080
and the food itself is a very
common ground for discussion.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.850
It'll be like oh,
this is really good,

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.590
and oh, I've never
tried this before.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.810
The different types
of cuisines definitely

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.802
bring about a sense
of community in that.

00:02:38.802 --> 00:02:40.510
CHAD ROVNER: When I
started working here,

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.020
I noticed that every
dining hall really

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.780
didn't have much to
offer in Indian food.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.530
And I started seeing
the clientele really

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.370
started to change.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.740
And there was a lot of
students from India.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.570
And a lot of them
would talk to me

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.480
and were a little
homesick for the food.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.370
They would send me
emails with dishes

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.710
they wanted me to start making.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.530
I would look into it, I would
start practicing making it.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.140
I really want them to have
the experience of what

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.150
Indian food really would be.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.820
BINITA GUPTA: I feel the food
is really authentic, especially

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:12.820
when they do vegetables.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.860
Like the lentil curry,
for example today,

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.670
was something that my
mom could have made.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.010
Honestly if you gave me my
mom's dish and this dish,

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.770
I might not have been able
to tell the difference.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.269
Anytime there's Indian food,
I'll take a picture and text it

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.030
to them and be like look, this
is what I'm having for today.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.280
And it makes them really
happy, because sometimes they

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.960
worry about me
being here and not

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.666
adjusting or being uncomfortable
with the food choices.

00:03:33.666 --> 00:03:35.040
But whenever
there's Indian food,

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.340
they know that I feel at home
and I feel really welcome here.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.410
And I like learning
about other cultures too.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.459
And I really hope
that other people

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.750
learn about Indian culture
through the dining hall food

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:45.270
too.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.250
SMITHA HANEEF: I am
an immigrant myself.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.080
I'm a naturalized citizen.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.210
I've lived in Boston,
Birmingham, Alabama, Mountain

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.790
View, California.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.850
And living in these places has
taught me some really powerful

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:00.840
lessons.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.000
Being a chef myself, I have
learned American culture

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.875
through the cuisines.

00:04:11.571 --> 00:04:13.820
RICK PIANCONE: I grew up in
a little Italian specialty

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.195
shop and bakery that my parents
had in Bradley Beach, New

00:04:16.195 --> 00:04:18.430
Jersey, making
mozzarella as a child,

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.970
learning how to bake bread.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.220
Last year we met with
the Italian table,

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.870
and we asked them
if they would like

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.030
to see a demonstration
of fresh mozzarella being

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.410
made in the evening.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.660
So we had about 10
students in the kitchen.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.130
And we got a real wow out of it.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.980
We say, hey, this is something
we can add to the menu.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.620
We try to hear their
home type foods, what's

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.120
really close to their heart.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.950
And it's so good to
hear areas of food

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.190
that I'm not familiar with of
other regions, other countries.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.910
All the chefs here
in the operation

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.200
are really trying to learn
these different ethnic dishes.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.350
We're never going to make it
100% like Mom or Grandma did,

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.360
but we try to get it
as close as possible.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.960
MICHAEL GATTIS: When we prepare
food, we share a piece of us

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.000
with the person who's eating it.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.040
And that's where the
passion comes from.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.920
When a student gets to do
that from what they brought

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.670
from home to share with their
fellows, a piece of them

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.360
and their heritage, that's
the community that we're

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.050
trying to build here
at Princeton and just

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.880
captures everything
we're all about.
