00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:01.191
- [Tutor] So let's say you wanted to know

00:00:01.191 --> 00:00:03.530
where the center of mass was between

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.484
this two kilogram mass and
this six kilogram mass,

00:00:06.484 --> 00:00:08.690
now they're separated by 10 centimeters,

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.670
so it's somewhere in between them

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.030
and we know it's gonna be
closer to the larger mass,

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.250
'cause the center of mass is always closer

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.820
to the larger mass, but
exactly where is it gonna be?

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.410
We need a formula to figure this out

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.600
and the formula for the center
of mass looks like this,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.962
it says the location
of the center of mass,

00:00:27.962 --> 00:00:29.810
that's what this is,

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.730
this Xcm is just the location
of the center of mass,

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.790
it's the position of the
center of mass is gonna equal,

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.270
you take all the masses
that you're trying to find

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.050
the center of mass between,

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.630
you take all those masses
times their positions

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.690
and you add up all of these M times Xs,

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.440
until you've accounted
for every single M times X

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.273
there is in your system

00:00:51.273 --> 00:00:54.837
and then you just divide by all
of the masses added together

00:00:54.837 --> 00:00:56.590
and what you get out of this

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.210
is the location of the center of mass.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.691
So let's use this, let's use
this for this example problem

00:01:01.691 --> 00:01:03.470
right here and let's see what we get,

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.050
we'll have the center of mass,

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.668
the position of the center
of mass is gonna be equal to,

00:01:08.668 --> 00:01:10.850
alright, so we'll take M1,

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.090
which you could take either one as M1,

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.273
but I already colored this one red,

00:01:14.273 --> 00:01:17.041
so we'll just say the
two kilogram mass is M1

00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:20.340
and we're gonna have to multiply by X1,

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.970
the position of mass
one and at this point,

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.733
you might be confused, you
might be like the position,

00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:27.370
I don't know what the position is,

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.670
there's no coordinate system up here,

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.976
well, you get to pick,
so you get to decide

00:01:31.976 --> 00:01:34.870
where you're measuring
these positions from

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.150
and wherever you decide
to measure them from

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.016
will also be the point,

00:01:38.016 --> 00:01:40.445
where the center of mass is measured from,

00:01:40.445 --> 00:01:44.050
in other words, you get to
choose where X equals zero.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.519
Let's just say for the sake of argument,

00:01:45.519 --> 00:01:48.720
the left-hand side over
here is X equals zero,

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.014
let's say right here is X
equals zero on our number line

00:01:52.014 --> 00:01:54.530
and then it goes this way,
it's positive this way,

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.152
so if this is X equals zero,
halfway would be X equals five

00:01:58.152 --> 00:02:00.940
and then over here, it
would be X equals 10,

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.540
we're free to choose that,
in fact, it's kind of cool,

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.650
because if this is X equals zero,

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.710
the position of mass one is zero meters,

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.440
so it's gonna be, this
term's just gonna go away,

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.380
which is okay, we're gonna
have to add to that M2,

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.220
which is six kilograms
times the position of M2,

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.940
again we can choose
whatever point we want,

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.710
but we have to be consistent,
we already chose this

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.483
as X equals zero for mass one,

00:02:24.483 --> 00:02:27.465
so that still has to be X
equals zero for mass two,

00:02:27.465 --> 00:02:30.317
that means this has to
be 10 centimeters now

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:32.586
and then those are our only
two masses, so we stop there

00:02:32.586 --> 00:02:35.445
and we just divide by all
the masses added together,

00:02:35.445 --> 00:02:38.500
which is gonna be two kilograms for M1

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.970
plus six kilograms for M2
and what we get out of this

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.560
is two times zero, zero plus six times 10

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.946
is 60 kilogram centimeters
divided by two plus six

00:02:50.946 --> 00:02:53.380
is gonna be eight kilograms,

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.742
which gives us 7.5 centimeters,

00:02:56.742 --> 00:03:00.570
so it's gonna be 7.5
centimeters from the point

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.490
we called X equals zero,
which is right here,

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.776
that's the location of the center of mass,

00:03:05.776 --> 00:03:08.940
so in other words, if you
connected these two spheres

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.560
by a rod, a light rod and
you put a pivot right here,

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.090
they would balance at
that point right there

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.397
and just to show you, you might be like,

00:03:16.397 --> 00:03:19.347
"Wait, we can choose any
point as X equals zero,

00:03:19.347 --> 00:03:21.050
"won't we get a different number?"

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.070
You will, so let's say you did this,

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.000
instead of picking that as X equals zero,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.155
let's say we pick this
side as X equals zero,

00:03:28.155 --> 00:03:30.730
let's say we say X equals zero

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.238
is this six kilogram mass's position,

00:03:33.238 --> 00:03:34.980
what are we gonna get then?

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.710
We'll get that the location
of the center of mass

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:38.949
for this calculation is gonna be,

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:40.960
well, we'll have two kilograms,

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.770
but now the location of the
two kilogram mass is not zero,

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:45.920
it's gonna be if this is zero

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.410
and we're considering
this way is positive,

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.096
it's gonna be negative 10 centimeters,

00:03:50.096 --> 00:03:51.931
'cause it's 10 centimeters to the left,

00:03:51.931 --> 00:03:54.500
so this is gonna be
negative 10 centimeters

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.380
plus six kilograms times,

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.370
now the location of the
six kilogram mass is zero,

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.130
using this convention and we divide

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.690
by both of the masses added up,

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.835
so that's still two
kilograms plus six kilograms

00:04:06.835 --> 00:04:07.726
and what are we gonna get?

00:04:07.726 --> 00:04:10.430
We're gonna get two times negative 10

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.165
plus six times zero,
well, that's just zero,

00:04:12.165 --> 00:04:16.140
so it's gonna be negative
20 kilogram centimeters

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.360
divided by eight kilograms

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.059
gives us negative 2.5 centimeters,

00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:23.247
so you might be worried,
you might be like, "What?

00:04:23.247 --> 00:04:24.667
"We got a different answer.

00:04:24.667 --> 00:04:26.177
"The location can't change,

00:04:26.177 --> 00:04:28.400
"based on where we're measuring from,"

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.160
and it didn't change, it's still
in the exact same position,

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.200
because now this negative 2.5 centimeters

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.129
is measured relative
to this X equals zero,

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:40.050
so what's negative 2.5
centimeters from here?

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.680
It's 2.5 centimeters to the left,

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.240
which lo and behold is
exactly at the same point,

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.580
since this was 7.5 and
this is negative 2.5

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.960
and the whole thing is 10 centimeters,

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.980
it gives you the exact same
location for the center of mass,

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.570
it has to, it can't change based on

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.586
whether you're calling this
point zero or this point zero,

00:05:00.586 --> 00:05:03.850
but you have to be careful and
consistent with your choice,

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.438
any choice will work, but you
have to be consistent with it

00:05:06.438 --> 00:05:08.300
and you have to know at the end

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.470
where is this answer measured from,

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.520
otherwise you won't be able to interpret

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.310
what this number means at the end.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.000
So recapping, you can use
the center of mass formula

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.640
to find the exact location
of the center of mass

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.100
between a system of objects,

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.020
you add all the masses
times their positions

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.010
and divide by the total mass,

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.440
the position can be measured

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.748
relative to any point
you call X equals zero

00:05:29.748 --> 00:05:32.550
and the number you get
out of that calculation

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.370
will be the distance from X equals zero

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.163
to the center of mass of that system.
