climate change is one of the most
 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.990
climate change is one of the most
obvious examples of that that we've had

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000
obvious examples of that that we've had
 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.570
obvious examples of that that we've had
the scientists warning about climate

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580
the scientists warning about climate
 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.720
the scientists warning about climate
change for so long time

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730
change for so long time
 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.830
change for so long time
but it took it took us more than 25

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840
but it took it took us more than 25
 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.380
but it took it took us more than 25
years of climate negotiations before we

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390
years of climate negotiations before we
 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.950
years of climate negotiations before we
had the climate agreement so I think

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960
had the climate agreement so I think
 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.550
had the climate agreement so I think
it's good that we have scientists and

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560
it's good that we have scientists and
 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.280
it's good that we have scientists and
people also from the outside coming into

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290
people also from the outside coming into
 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.790
people also from the outside coming into
politics because we need also people on

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800
politics because we need also people on
 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.570

the inside to try to transform the
knowledge into action and that needs to

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820
knowledge into action and that needs to
 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.820
knowledge into action and that needs to
be in legislation it needs to be an

impractical agreements such as the Paris

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150
impractical agreements such as the Paris
 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.470
impractical agreements such as the Paris
agreement can I ask the whole theme for

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480

back to now we can actually see what's

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:07.640
back to now we can actually see what's
 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.600
back to now we can actually see what's
happening with climate change and the

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610
happening with climate change and the
 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.390
happening with climate change and the

are no now at a historical low level not

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.060
are no now at a historical low level not

only at its surface but also in its
 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.250
only at its surface but also in its
depths or it so I guess that's one of

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:24.260
depths or it so I guess that's one of
 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.800
depths or it so I guess that's one of
your applications what is I think one of

about the risks of climate change I
 

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.660
about the risks of climate change I
don't think it's a legitimate debate to

don't think it's a legitimate debate to
 

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:13.660
don't think it's a legitimate debate to
say whether it's happening or not or or

I I when I was a journalist and I was

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:52.160
I I when I was a journalist and I was
 

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.310
I I when I was a journalist and I was
doing research on overfishing and the

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:54.320
doing research on overfishing and the
 

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.900
doing research on overfishing and the
state of our oceans I was very

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:55.910
state of our oceans I was very
 

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.150
state of our oceans I was very
frustrated with the scientist because I

00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:58.160
frustrated with the scientist because I
 

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.670
frustrated with the scientist because I
tried to interview people saying what is

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:00.680
tried to interview people saying what is
 

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.030
tried to interview people saying what is
the overall view and all I could have a

the overall view and all I could have a
 

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.890
the overall view and all I could have a
fine where scientists are saying well I

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:05.900
fine where scientists are saying well I
 

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.960

actually I can't tell you that but i can

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:07.970
actually I can't tell you that but i can
 

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:10.090
actually I can't tell you that but i can
tell you something about acidification i

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:10.100
tell you something about acidification i
 

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.580
tell you something about acidification i
can tell you something about cod i can

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:12.590
can tell you something about cod i can
 

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:14.500
can tell you something about cod i can
tell you not all but all the code but

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:14.510
tell you not all but all the code but
 

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.450
tell you not all but all the code but
the chord in the baltic sea or actually

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:16.460
the chord in the baltic sea or actually
 

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.730
the chord in the baltic sea or actually
the code the code in the eastern Baltic

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:18.740
the code the code in the eastern Baltic
 

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.450
the code the code in the eastern Baltic
Sea so I mean scientists are very very

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:21.460
Sea so I mean scientists are very very
 

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:25.600
Sea so I mean scientists are very very
niche and they don't find very many of

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:25.610
niche and they don't find very many of
 

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.700
niche and they don't find very many of
them are not very comfortable with kind

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:27.710
them are not very comfortable with kind
 

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:29.470
them are not very comfortable with kind
of making an overall assumption of

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:29.480
of making an overall assumption of
 

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.170
of making an overall assumption of
something that also could be interpreted

00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:32.180
something that also could be interpreted
 

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:34.510
something that also could be interpreted
as as political or an advice for

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:34.520
as as political or an advice for
 

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.780
as as political or an advice for
politicians so the ones that I find that

of food and there I just want to say

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:32.070
of food and there I just want to say
 

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:34.700
of food and there I just want to say
that also wars and conflicts are the

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:34.710
that also wars and conflicts are the
 

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:40.580

major causes of food scarcity in the
 

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:43.550
major causes of food scarcity in the
world and starvation so I think we can

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:43.560
world and starvation so I think we can
 

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.350

under neutral I mean on starvation so I
 

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.840
under neutral I mean on starvation so I
mean we could eat a lot less and it's

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:26.850
mean we could eat a lot less and it's

answered by the audience maybe we should
 

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:03.470
answered by the audience maybe we should
have a quick look at the the result what

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:03.480
have a quick look at the the result what
 

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.660
have a quick look at the the result what
is the most important area for

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:05.670
is the most important area for
 

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:09.129
is the most important area for
policymakers need

00:13:09.129 --> 00:13:09.139
policymakers need
 

00:13:09.139 --> 00:13:13.900
policymakers need
to focus on food waste reduction good

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:13.910
to focus on food waste reduction good
 

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:17.199
to focus on food waste reduction good
work Tristan earlier here forty five

00:13:17.199 --> 00:13:17.209
work Tristan earlier here forty five
 

00:13:17.209 --> 00:13:20.079
work Tristan earlier here forty five
percent do you agree is it food waste

00:13:20.079 --> 00:13:20.089
percent do you agree is it food waste
 

00:13:20.089 --> 00:13:22.829
percent do you agree is it food waste
that is the most important area for

00:13:22.829 --> 00:13:22.839
that is the most important area for
 

00:13:22.839 --> 00:13:26.590
that is the most important area for
policymakers I mean we're producing

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:26.600
policymakers I mean we're producing
 

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.929
policymakers I mean we're producing
around twenty-five percent for the for

00:13:28.929 --> 00:13:28.939
around twenty-five percent for the for
 

00:13:28.939 --> 00:13:30.879
around twenty-five percent for the for
the waste bin and that is really not

00:13:30.879 --> 00:13:30.889
the waste bin and that is really not
 

00:13:30.889 --> 00:13:32.530
the waste bin and that is really not
sustainable so I think there's a lot

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:32.540
sustainable so I think there's a lot
 

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:34.119
sustainable so I think there's a lot
that can be done when it comes to

00:13:34.119 --> 00:13:34.129
that can be done when it comes to
 

00:13:34.129 --> 00:13:36.069
that can be done when it comes to
efficiency both in the food production

00:13:36.069 --> 00:13:36.079
efficiency both in the food production
 

00:13:36.079 --> 00:13:39.849
efficiency both in the food production
but also how we as consumers are acting

00:13:39.849 --> 00:13:39.859
but also how we as consumers are acting
 

00:13:39.859 --> 00:13:42.669
but also how we as consumers are acting
at home because a lot of waste is done

00:13:42.669 --> 00:13:42.679
at home because a lot of waste is done
 

00:13:42.679 --> 00:13:44.349
at home because a lot of waste is done
at home so we need a lot more

00:13:44.349 --> 00:13:44.359
at home so we need a lot more
 

00:13:44.359 --> 00:13:46.960
at home so we need a lot more
information and education on that bit

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:46.970
information and education on that bit
 

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:49.229
information and education on that bit
but I liked very much the animal welfare

00:13:49.229 --> 00:13:49.239
but I liked very much the animal welfare
 

00:13:49.239 --> 00:13:52.419
but I liked very much the animal welfare
also that because I think if we really

00:13:52.419 --> 00:13:52.429
also that because I think if we really
 

00:13:52.429 --> 00:13:54.849
also that because I think if we really
care about our animals then meet would

00:13:54.849 --> 00:13:54.859
care about our animals then meet would
 

00:13:54.859 --> 00:13:57.879
care about our animals then meet would
not be as cheap as it is now still in

00:13:57.879 --> 00:13:57.889
not be as cheap as it is now still in
 

00:13:57.889 --> 00:13:59.679
not be as cheap as it is now still in
short answer very quickly i would say

00:13:59.679 --> 00:13:59.689
short answer very quickly i would say
 

00:13:59.689 --> 00:14:02.919
short answer very quickly i would say
more on the nutritional side that it's

00:14:02.919 --> 00:14:02.929
more on the nutritional side that it's
 

00:14:02.929 --> 00:14:05.470
more on the nutritional side that it's
not just calories because empty calories

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:05.480
not just calories because empty calories
 

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.840

in developing countries lead to

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:07.850
in developing countries lead to
 

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:10.239
in developing countries lead to
remarkable rates of obesity I think it's

00:14:10.239 --> 00:14:10.249
remarkable rates of obesity I think it's
 

00:14:10.249 --> 00:14:12.819
remarkable rates of obesity I think it's
the richest food and how you do this and

00:14:12.819 --> 00:14:12.829
the richest food and how you do this and
 

00:14:12.829 --> 00:14:14.979

that Apple that I used to think was good
 

00:14:17.629 --> 00:14:20.829
that Apple that I used to think was good
food was something else was that they

00:14:20.829 --> 00:14:20.839
food was something else was that they
 

00:14:20.839 --> 00:14:22.419
food was something else was that they
have been on the shelf so long so but

00:14:22.419 --> 00:14:22.429
have been on the shelf so long so but
 

00:14:22.429 --> 00:14:25.749
have been on the shelf so long so but
nutrition and food is a big deal and and

nutrition and food is a big deal and and
 

00:14:25.759 --> 00:14:27.639
nutrition and food is a big deal and and
it should be balanced in that you know

so how we go forward with science can

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:43.730
so how we go forward with science can
 

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:45.940
so how we go forward with science can
inform politicians science can also

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:45.950
inform politicians science can also
 

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:48.370
inform politicians science can also
develop new technologies to make better

what science can do stephen tomb is a
 

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:03.970
what science can do stephen tomb is a
bit of living thank you so much for

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:03.980
bit of living thank you so much for
