Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I am Robert Krulwich today on radio lab blame

Speaker 2:          00:05          in the story we just heard, Lee, we're wrestling with a very difficult question. When somebody has a brain injury, then commits a crime. Just how much do we blame them and how much do we blame the brain?

Speaker 1:          00:17          Yeah, and as it turns out, this question, hi. Hi, this is Chad. Hi Chad. It's Nita. That question is popping up more and more in court cases were increasingly, you will find defendants like Kevin Arguing, okay, you've convicted me of a crime, but you should go easier on me because I have these neurological problems. So this is neat. A fairy honney professor of law and philosophy and professor of genome scientists and policy at Duke University. She's been following this whole sort of emerging field of neuro law for quite a while. And back in 2006 it occurred to her, okay, lots of people are interested in this field, but nobody has any good data. So I started counting cases, try to see, to try to see how many times does brain science come up in court. Now, the only data that she'd get her hands on were written opinions, which turns out it doesn't happen that often.

Speaker 1:          01:04          Like yours really only happens in like 1% of court cases, but, but in that 1% of cases she saw a steady increase and you know, relatively dramatic. You, you have a couple of years, 2005 and six that had about a hundred cases in (200) 078-9200 some cases. And then 1112 year in the three hundreds all told between 2005 and 2012 it's about 1600 cases at 1600 cases that are kind of like the Kevin Case where someone maybe argues, look, it's not entirely my fault. My brain made me do it at least a little bit. Yeah. And by the way, that number was just in the 1% she had access to. So the other 99% of cases may actually have a whole lot more. Yup.

Speaker 2:          01:51          Well, wait a second. Is this a new development? What do you mean? Like, you know, in west side story, there's this character officer crunchy and he goes and there's these juvenile delinquents. This is back in the 50s and they're saying everything is someone else's fault. So they have bad parents and they have poverty and they have passion and they have [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          02:11          youth and they plead all these kinds of Sargent crop geek yet gotta understand it's just our bringing up that gets us Outta hand. Our mothers solid junkies, our fathers all are.

Speaker 1:          02:22          Have you just added to the list tumor? That's pretty much the same thing. Well maybe, no, there seems to be something more compelling for both judges and juries when you are able to have actual brain scans, you know, or EEG or whatever because now you can say, look to officer Crunchy, look, I know this might sound like an excuse, but check out this spot right here. Here's the proof. I don't have a normal brain, you know, and I didn't choose not to have a normal brain. So how can it be completely my fault? Well, doesn't that sound a little bit like a little too easy? Here we go. Maybe. I mean, I guess it depends on the specific case, but just in the abstract. Let me give you the version that I've ever heard of this argument. This is what made me really stop and take. It comes from the, uh, from my psychologist Kevin Dutton. He was interviewed on the scientific American podcasts and he gave this hypothetical.

Speaker 4:          03:11          I imagine if you've got a deaf person, okay, and you've got a child in a burning building and you've got that child screaming out, but the deaf person can't hear the screams to, you wouldn't necessarily blame. You wouldn't hold that deaf person culpable for that child's death if the child died you nuclear. So far. By the same token, if you are emotionally death, if you can physically hear the screams, but emotionally you just don't have that kind of neural kick up the backside to go in and save that child. Isn't that the same thing? And when you start thinking about that as a whole kind of moral conundrum that starts coming out of that, because damage to the ear is damaged with physical structure, damage to the brain is also damaged

Speaker 1:          03:55          physical structure. So here's the moral conundrum I think he's referring to. If we go along with this idea that we can use brain abnormalities to defend ourselves in court. Well that's going to lead us into some pretty weird places as a society, things may get very, very complicated cause we learned, we got into a little tussle. All right with this guy, sorry, so you put this on. This is a little chilly in here. This is David Eagleman. I'm a neuroscientist. He's a regular on our show. Is that what I supposed to say or that spirited regularly? Yeah. No. Here's one of the most interesting parts. Here's his argument. Think about it. Technologically at the moment, our best technologies in neuroscience are very crude. We can see when someone has a tumor or damage from traumatic brain injury or neurodegenerative disease, but it is quite crude still.

Speaker 1:          04:44          The way he puts it. Looking for those brain abnormalities now is sort of like being up in space and looking down at the earth. You can't really see what's going on down there, but you can see the big shapes and the colors and every so often you notice something that's not supposed to be there. Like, Whoa, what does that creator over there? If you see something that's big enough to see you take a picture, you're back in court, you show it to the judge and maybe she gives the guy a break, but then say you're up there and

Speaker 5:          05:11          um, mission control, everything looks normal up here.

Speaker 1:          05:14          You don't see anything. Well then back in court, the judge is going to take a look at your apparently normal brain and say, sorry, well that's your fault. It's not a biological problem. So we're just going to say you're blameworthy. So that's where we are now. We draw the line of what we can see and what we can see is only the big stuff. But he says, imagine forward, we'll have new technologies, we'll have x MRI instead fri and suddenly it's going to be like Google maps where instead of being up in space, you can, you can zoom in and now you can see everything. We'll have new names for disorders of the microcircuitry and so on. We'll certainly never get all the way to the end, but one day we may be able to say like see that little bit of mangled wiring right over there.

Speaker 1:          05:57          That is because his mom didn't love him enough. Maybe he got bullied like we will be able to see all that stuff almost as well as we can see brain tumors now cause there is nothing special about brain tumors except for their visibility. Really what he's saying when you get down to it, his core belief is that you are your biology which is on some level kind of like whatever, Duh, but he takes it much farther. He says that almost everything that you go through in your life, all of your experiences, your culture, your history, your neighborhood, all of it is etched into the tissue of your brain, right? There's nothing separate. Nothing. Descartes famously suggested you've got the body, you know the physical stuff, and then you've got this extra bit, the sole, the ghost in the machine.

Speaker 6:          06:36          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          06:36          but sort of the, you know the inside word on that neuroscience is that ag? No, no, no. It's all the same thing.

Speaker 7:          06:44          And now that we're beginning to see that, he says, actually see it, we are on a slippery slope because if you start letting people off the hook when you see a tumor, well then you're going to have to keep letting him off the hook. When you see something smaller or smaller or smaller, still

Speaker 1:          06:59          the point is it cannot be a just legal system that in one decade says, well you're blame worthy cause for the moment we can't see anything in your brain. And then the next decades is, oh, you have SJ medleys disease. Hey, we can see it now. And we didn't realize that. So now you were lumping you over here with the people with the brain tumors. So they want, does that mean like we have to let everybody off the hook? You know, blame worthiness is the wrong question for a legal system to ask. That's the point is that this whole notion about blame worthiness and saying, okay, if we have a biological mitigator then we'll bring that up in court and we'll say, well, it's not exactly his fault and if we don't have a biological mitigator, we'll say it is his fault. The reason none of this makes sense nowadays is because saying was it the person's fault or was it something about his biology doesn't make sense as a question.

Speaker 1:          07:48          They are inseparable. Why I got, I have a version of that question. How about everybody should know that his brain isn't completely normal in this regard. And now the question is proportion, how much do you want to put on the brain and how much do you want to put on his and what else is there behavior which comes from where ability to choose from the brain is choosy part of his brain as the most [inaudible] and choosy part. Well that's okay. I don't, I mean you're forcing me. I'm glad. I'm glad you're phrasing it this way because that's exactly the problem with our intuitions. We have this intuition that yeah, your brain might look like this. You have these genes, you have these experiences that makes your biology like this. Oh, but in the end, that doesn't matter because you've got this other thing that's independent of the biology, but we don't.

Speaker 1:          08:33          You aren't your brain, your brain, however nevertheless helps you decide things. Brains help you choose. So the question I'm asking you that they're helping, who's the you that you're helping the bearer of the brain, the owner of the brain, the the, the brain. And that's separate from the brain. Oh, do you own, I need to keep doing this to me. I know that if I have a tootsie roll in front of me in an m and, m, I can choose the M and m. So I assume my is doing something and the question I want to ask is like how much am I choosing and how much am I really outside of choosing? Because some something irregular in my brain is choosing for me. And that seems to me to be a way to, so, so this, but this is fascinating because the way you're phrasing it suggests that there's, um, there's you and then there's your brain and there's things in your brain that might be telling you what you don't want to do, but it's all one system is the thing. So when you're faced with the tootsie roll versus the whatever else, m and m, every thing in your life leading up to that moment from your genetic history written on invisibly small strands of nucleic acids, all the way up to every experience you've ever had leads to that choice. What would it even mean to make a choice? Completely independent of your brain. Okay. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          09:45          what about like the 10 Commandments? Those are like the, those were, those were, okay. I'm just gonna jump in for a second. At this point, things kind of slid off the rails. We ended up talking about the 10 commandments, debating the question of freewill if free will exists at all. It's a really small part of this system. I'm going back and forth about whether you can overcome your upbringing, which obviously you can. Oh Gosh, no, you can't share. You can't. No, you can't. I can go to the library and I, it's only if you're that type of person. Anyhow, after an hour, we finally got back around to David's main point, which is that the legal system would be a hell of a lot better off. He says, if, uh, if we forgot about blame altogether, forget if it's someone's fault. That's a dead end. He would say the better way to do it, he thinks is to focus on this probability of future recidivism.

Speaker 1:          10:33          You mean like will they do it again? That's right. That's exactly it. Well, how would you ever know? So here's how you crunch the numbers. So this has already happened in the world of sex offenders where there've been a longterm studies following out. Here's the way it already works. He says, which he thinks is model. When a sex offender comes up for parole, someone at the corrections office will grab their record and ask a bunch of questions. What was the victim choice? Was it somebody they knew or was it somebody outside of their family? Was it a a minor, specific to male or female? Was it somebody their age? What was the crime type? All these different questions. Then the evaluator will take some of the answers and give them points. Three zero two that psychologist Amy Phoenix, she says, researchers developed this point system based on years of studies of criminal behavior, massive amounts of data and once you have all these points down, you can add up a total score and that score is supposed to tell you is this guy likely to do it again or not? And here's the bottom line. Amy says, if you were to ask a parole officer with decades of experience to just use their gut, no numbers, we call that unguided clinical judgment. If you were to ask them for their unguided, but expert clinical judgment, will Fred here recidivate or not? What's your prediction? According to studies, those experts are correct about 50% of the time, so you may as well flip a coin. On the other hand, she says if you have just use the point system, no gut involved, the predictive accuracy would be about 70%

Speaker 2:          11:58          wow. 70 years and no humans involved.

Speaker 1:          12:02          Yeah. But here's the thing that sort of gives me pause. Like in order to get that accurate, you kind of have to turn people into data, you know? Yeah. Into types. I know it seems like, Oh, where's the humanity in that? But, but the question we have to ask is, compared to what? So the way it currently goes, ugly people get much longer sentences than attractive people in courts. This is a well known bias from juries. Is that somehow better than having a scientifically informed legal system? I have no response to that. Well, but elaborate Willie [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          12:46          yes. It's okay that pretty people get better sentences than ugly people because I'm, I don't know, I'm going out on the limb, see what happens when I finished this in one go. But because what we're describing here is humans judging humans, not tables judging humans, not data judging humans, but humans judging humans. So you went to do that with certain amount of humanness and maybe it's not very rational and maybe sometimes it's wrong-headed or unfair, but if you take the judgment away from the humans and you give it to a table, then you invite a different set of problems, which is the chance for mercy, which is a very big part of justice is off the table because statistics don't have mercy. They just have statistics.

Speaker 1:          13:37          Amen. I that was nicely done, but let me say, let me see, Campbell, the question that, that is a beautiful question. So the notion of we should be merciful and so on. Of course, that's all true. But the question is, are we good at it? Are we good at knowing who is the right person to be merciful with? It ends up usually being the attractive person, right? And the person who's ugly in his missing teeth, we're usually not as merciful for, I wish this morning. Let me just throw in one more objection to this. Uh, I mean obviously as a point, I guess. So this whole thing that he's advocating for and he's not the only one of throwing out blame, focusing instead on what someone might do. Is that a world you would want to really live in, need a fair honey, that law professor, put it this way, imagine you do something small.

Speaker 1:          14:22          So if I, you know, forge a check, minor offense and in the process of arresting me and convicting me, maybe the courts do a brain scan or they do that number crunching thing. Exactly. And they determine, actually she has a predilection for far more serious crimes than check forging. I mean, she hasn't done any of those things yet, but she could rob a bank, she could commit a violent crime. That's what the data shows. If all you're worried about is what she might do, then you can keep me in prison forever. Because, um, what you've discovered is that I pose a real and future danger to society. I mean, you could basically convict someone of a crime that hasn't happened yet. Exactly. And not only that, if you think about this whole thing from a slightly higher altitude, according to Anita, when you blame somebody for something, there's a power to that act that goes beyond that one individual. There is value to society holding people morally accountable for wrongdoing. Your you're upholding this code that is important to all of us. It's what we've lived by and clung to for thousands of years. Yeah, so you could argue that the act of assigning blame is sort of like reinforcing the scaffolding of society. It creates norms for people to follow. That makes perfect sense to me. Otherwise we would be,

Speaker 1:          15:40          well, it'd be like, I don't know what we'd be

Speaker 8:          15:46          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          15:46          so hey, so you're coming out for the 10 commandments at the end of the day. Wait, hold on. No shot. Let's just say he went there and he can't take it back. Don't draft me onto that team. By the way, speaking about us. Not that we were, but now I am. We are going to be on stage in 21 cities in the United States and Canada. We're just about to start our live tour. The show is called apocalyptical, which is a lot of syllables, but it's a, it can be fun. It's got a lot of performances. Yes. Check our listings at radiolab.org/live you'll see where we are and when we're going to be there. And you can get your tickets now. Yeah. radiolab.org/live and we'll be right back.

Speaker 9:          16:29          Uh.
