00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.780
We'll start things off here in lesson
one where you'll brain storm ideas for

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.650
your app, and
you'll also build a skeleton UI, and

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.530
kind of start looking at some APIs and
libraries.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.540
Now, if you are in the iOS
developer nano degree and

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.530
you were following along with
the intersperse lessons,

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.490
you can skip this lesson and
move on to lesson two.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.680
Because in lesson two, is where were
going to start choosing an idea for

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.710
our app, thinking through features,
building through a paper prototype, and

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.460
then actually building and
testing our app.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.370
We'll do lots of user testing in
this phase, to help us find bugs and

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.030
also make sure that people
want to actually use your app.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.590
Then, in lesson three,
you'll reflect on the process.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.465
And you'll think about those things
that maybe you'd do differently, or

00:00:44.465 --> 00:00:45.295
you could do better.

00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:48.159
Because as developers,
if we're going to get better,

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:51.922
we have to think about those things
that we're kind of not so great at.

00:00:51.922 --> 00:00:56.001
Now, also this course is only
going to teach you to build an app.

00:00:56.001 --> 00:00:59.817
We're not going to talk about
monetizing it or building a business.

00:00:59.817 --> 00:01:01.450
If you're interested in that,

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.700
Udasity has an entrepreneurship
management nanodegree.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.030
Which is a great option,
if you're a budding entrepreneur and

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.420
you want to make a business
out of an iPhone app.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.870
There's a link to it in the instructor
notes, if you want to go check that out.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.530
Now as we continue, this is going
to be a wonderfully messy and

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.960
creative and awesome, but
sometimes frustrating journey.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.860
And, it's often said that the journey
of a hundred miles begins with

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.090
a single step.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.546
So, let's take that step now.
