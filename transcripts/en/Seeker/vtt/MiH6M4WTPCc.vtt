00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.580
New studies show that babies are
sinister, conniving villains.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.570
They absolutely do not say that.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.980
Oh Laci, so eager to believe
what the international baby

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.575
conspiracy spoon feeds you,
like just another baby.

00:00:12.575 --> 00:00:13.559
Mmm, OK.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.672
Laci and Anthony here for DNews,
and over the last couple years,

00:00:21.672 --> 00:00:24.005
studies have shown that babies
are much more emotionally

00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:26.250
and intellectually aware
than we previously thought.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.235
They are almost too smart.

00:00:28.235 --> 00:00:29.855
Or just the right
amount of smart.

00:00:29.855 --> 00:00:31.230
Research released
this week shows

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.938
that babies can figure
out whether people

00:00:32.938 --> 00:00:35.549
are friends or foes based on
shared likes and dislikes.

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:37.090
If a baby as young
as nine months old

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.250
sees two people eating and
enjoying the same food,

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.870
for instance, they'll assume
that common interests will

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.620
make them act friendly
toward one another.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.940
And if those two people don't
seem to like each other,

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.980
the baby will
stare more intently

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.290
at them trying to
figure out why,

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.530
sizing us up, looking for
alliances and weaknesses,

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.530
trying to play us
against each other.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.740
Or maybe they're just learning.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.700
Ha!

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.760
Also, according to Concordia
University research,

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.670
babies as young as
18 months old can

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.460
tell when your actions
don't match your feelings.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.010
If you and another
adult are smiling

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.787
but arguing trying not to
let the baby know, it knows.

00:01:11.787 --> 00:01:13.620
And if you hurt yourself
but try not to yell

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.382
or scream so the baby
doesn't get upset,

00:01:15.382 --> 00:01:17.090
it can still tell that
you're distressed.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.710
They can see through all
of our lies and tricks.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.980
Or I think they're
just sympathetic to us.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:22.720
Do you?

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.054
Because they fool us constantly.

00:01:24.054 --> 00:01:25.970
We used to think that
children couldn't really

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.295
lie until the age of four.

00:01:27.295 --> 00:01:29.090
But a University
of Portsmouth study

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.370
showed that babies
start manipulating us

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.080
at six months old, OK?

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.611
They fake cry, and they
fake laugh to get attention.

00:01:35.611 --> 00:01:37.610
And they even know when
they do something wrong,

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.870
and they will fake
pain or distress

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.700
to distract you from it.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.870
They're not laughing
at that silly face

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.524
you've made 50 times in a row.

00:01:45.524 --> 00:01:46.690
They don't think it's funny.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.110
They are distracting
you from the fact

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.140
that their baby accomplice is
right behind you on your iPhone

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.950
stealing your identity.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.010
Well, there was
that study recently

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.960
that showed that
40% of toddlers can

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.240
use touch screens before
they can even talk.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.782
Yeah, welcome to the truth.

00:02:02.782 --> 00:02:07.020
Anthony, you know, babies,
they're not evil hackers.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.130
No, no, of course not.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.880
They're just innocent
little sweethearts.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.910
We are absolutely
not onto their game.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.230
And we do not want them to
know that our intellects are

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.060
superior to theirs and
that they will never

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.974
get the upper hand on us.

00:02:18.974 --> 00:02:20.140
Do you think they bought it?

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.410
No.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.550
Change all your passwords.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.100
On it.
