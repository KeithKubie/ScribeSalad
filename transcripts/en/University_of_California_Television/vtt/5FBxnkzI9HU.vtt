(mouse clicking)
(computer beeping)

00:00:05.751 --> 00:00:09.460
(bright piano music)

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.460
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.923
Bipedal, naked, large brained,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.321
long the master of fire,
tools and language,

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:24.023
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.644
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:28.644 --> 00:00:30.863
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.243
We grow up slowly, we hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.283
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:41.697
(soft piano music)

00:00:41.697 --> 00:00:43.820
We shape the future from
our shared understanding

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:44.693
of the past.

00:00:45.835 --> 00:00:50.160
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.210
to exchange insights on who we are

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.703
and how we got here,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.950
an exploration made
possible by the generosity

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.115
of humans like you.

00:01:01.115 --> 00:01:03.698
(bright music)

00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:24.266
(imaginative music)

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.547
- I will, I'll show the work that we do,

00:01:38.547 --> 00:01:41.420
and in a way, is quite similar
to the Kennis brothers,

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.950
we try to reconstruct
parts of the Neanderthal,

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.050
but instead of body parts,

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.740
what we try to do is to
reconstruct their minds.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.800
And one day, I imagine
that would be possible,

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.710
and I don't have a
brother to challenge me,

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.660
keep it going, but I have a whole team,

00:01:56.585 --> 00:01:58.557
and these whole team
help me to achieve that,

00:01:58.557 --> 00:02:01.130
and that's what I'm gonna
share with you guys.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.230
Shall we start with the idea that perhaps

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.290
we should study human imaginations

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.400
by comparing to other humans, perhaps,

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.355
humans that have a different
kind of imagination,

00:02:11.355 --> 00:02:14.730
either worse or better, just different.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.050
And we thought about the Neanderthals,

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.480
and part of the reason
is because we know more

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.410
about the Neanderthals than
the other extinct hominins,

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.290
and we also share our world
with them for a long time.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.100
And becomes clear, and I think you guys

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.390
all learned about that,
that during the time period

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.980
that the Neanderthals, they stay on earth,

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.250
I mean, they developed these stones tools

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.910
and definitely make it
better, but technology

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.010
didn't go as far as that, and in contrast,

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.920
we modern humans, in a
very short period of time,

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.730
we could create not only stone tools,

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.410
but a whole set of new technology, art,

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.370
and sophisticated ways to
communicate to each other,

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.730
which points out that perhaps our brains

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.880
are somehow different from them.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.040
So, how do we study the Neanderthals,

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.850
and how we can start
tracking these questions?

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.220
So we have bones, we have endocast,

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.063
if we can predict how their brains

00:03:16.063 --> 00:03:19.025
would have a different shape or volume.

00:03:19.025 --> 00:03:22.310
We have DNA, we can extract DNA from bones

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.800
of Neanderthals, and we have impressions,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.550
and someone might call that art,

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.310
others might not think that this is art,

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.870
but they definitely left
some impressions for us

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.080
to try to understand.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.780
So from the endocast, this
is the work from the group

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.660
from Leipzig, in Germany,
they have confirmed

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.490
that their brains, at
least in terms of volume,

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.420
is not so different than us.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.820
They actually have a
little bit larger brain

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.660
compared to what we have, but, I mean,

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.980
the endocast doesn't offer too much

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.683
in terms of how that
brain actually functioned.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.270
So, and Svante Paabo, also from Leipzig

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.970
is a pioneer on isolating the DNA

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.330
from the Neanderthals and sequence them

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.930
so we can actually compare
the Neanderthal genome

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.900
to the modern humans, so this is all nice,

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.050
but actually, how do we
understand the Neanderthal brain

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.300
or the Neanderthal mind in a dish?

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.310
So I come from the stem cell background,

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.510
and in stem cells, we
have something called

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.900
brain organoid, also called a mini-brain

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.299
because we can recreate those

00:04:29.299 --> 00:04:31.130
using human pluripotent stem cells,

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.700
and they don't look like that,
(audience laughs)

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.510
they are actually a simplify,
miniaturized version

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.130
of the human brain, and we have a recipe

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.850
that we develop in the lab

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.620
that is quite good to make
a functional mini-brains

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.290
or brain organoids, and it always starts

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.700
from single cells, these
are single to embryonic

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.050
stem cells or pluripotent stem cells

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.830
that we can reprogram from people.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.208
It can do it from my cells,
from your cells as well.

00:04:59.208 --> 00:05:01.627
So from these single cells, we grow them

00:05:01.627 --> 00:05:05.330
in different media,
changing the grow factors,

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.810
specific grow factors at different stages

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.420
and see what we can mature them

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.860
in these networks, we just form and become

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.270
more and more sophisticated.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.400
Another thing is that, I mean,

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.450
they can grow up to a half centimeter

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.300
and we can keep them
alive for up to two years.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.370
So these are quite robust protocols,

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.862
because not only you create a single one,

00:05:26.862 --> 00:05:29.590
but you can create
thousands of brain organoids

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.850
in this same batch, so that allows you

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.260
to do some experiments with them.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.210
And if you cut one of those spheres,

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.340
what you can see is that they maintain

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.410
or they mimic some of the
embryonic brain structures

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.050
in humans by having a ventricular zone

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.850
in the center that sends
out, that migrate out

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.340
and form what we call the cortical plate.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.595
As these organoids age,
these cortical layers

00:05:54.595 --> 00:05:57.718
will become more and more well defined.

00:05:57.718 --> 00:06:01.680
So this is a snapshot
of all the cell types

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.150
that we have if we just
age these brain organoids

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.430
for about four month, we
have mostly glutamatergic,

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.570
these are excitatory
neurons, and you start

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.940
to see two populations in there,

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.620
so these would be upper
and lower cortical layers,

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.630
but we also have
inhibitory neurons as well.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.590
A small population of GABAergic neurons.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.740
There are presenter cells
that continue to produce,

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.270
and at that stage we start
to see some glial cells

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.570
or astrocyte, these are the cell types

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.480
that helps on the formation
of these complex networks

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.280
that we gonna, I'm gonna show you

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.240
how they behave later on.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.890
So this is all good, but I can,

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:44.180
I need live cells to recreate
those brain organoids

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.860
in a dish, and the problem
is there is no live cells

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.240
from the Neanderthals, so
that poses a big problem.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.000
How can we recreate the Neanderthal mind

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.770
if we don't have the
raw material for that?

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.640
So we turned to genetics,
since we have their genome,

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.600
one thing that is possible to do

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.350
is to compare the genome
of the Neanderthals

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:09.120
to modern humans, and we
have thousands of them,

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.220
and ask, what are the differences
between those genomes?

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.690
What is specific to modern humans

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:20.690
that were positive selected
in us, compared to them?

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.226
So, if we look across all the genes,

00:07:24.226 --> 00:07:26.960
we end up with about 200 genes,

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.150
and this is, many people have been mining

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.760
these dataset, and these are the genes

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:37.060
that are different between
modern humans and Neanderthals.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.610
And instead of looking
for all these genes,

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:42.453
we decided to narrow done this list

00:07:42.453 --> 00:07:44.270
to three genes, because we had asked

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.410
what are the ones that
are highly expressed

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.480
during early stages of neural development

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.010
and what are the ones that we know

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.560
that if they are mutated in modern humans

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.950
will lead to a neurological disorder?

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:57.320
And these are the three genes,

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.780
these two here are synaptic genes,

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.410
they will help how the
synaptic or the connections

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:04.540
between neurons are formed, and that one

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.560
is a very interesting one,
because it starts very early

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.630
and it's a master regulator of all,

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:14.890
of several down string genes,
it's a splicing regulator,

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.870
a splicing protein.

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.780
So the way we do that
is using genome editing,

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:22.930
and we use CRISPRs where we can go back

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:25.440
to one of our modern human cell lines

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:30.000
and we can change or swap
the genetic information

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
from the modern humans
to the Neanderthals.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.230
So we Neanderthalize the cell lines,

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.570
targeting those specific genes,

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:39.800
and at the end of the
day, we have Neanderthal

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.270
brain organoids or Neanderthoids,

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:45.560
how we call them, and we can compare.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:49.670
So, I mean, we done
that, we recreate that,

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:52.290
and I will show you
some of the differences

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:55.930
that we observe by comparing
them with the modern humans.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:58.810
So the first big difference is
at the gene expression level.

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:01.280
What are the genes that
are up or down regulated

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.140
compared to us, and we
have a couple of them.

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.780
The interesting part is
that they are all connected

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.830
to brain development, and
several pathways that leads

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:13.422
to brain formation, now I'll
point to some of them here.

00:09:13.422 --> 00:09:15.090
This is just a list of interesting genes

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:19.066
that we are trying to
understand, there are genes

00:09:19.066 --> 00:09:20.820
such as nesting, which
is a progenitor cell,

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.450
early stages of neuro brain formations.

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:27.280
There are genes such
as TPR1, this is a gene

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.417
that has been implicated
in autism, for example,

00:09:30.417 --> 00:09:32.473
and they are down
regulated in Neanderthals.

00:09:32.473 --> 00:09:35.453
And there are genes like
OTX, that when up regulated

00:09:35.453 --> 00:09:38.339
might prone you to have
seizures or epilepsy.

00:09:38.339 --> 00:09:42.110
So this all happens with
down genetic modification,

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:44.660
I mean, it's just by
changing those early genes

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.880
that you affect downstream
genetic signature

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.950
that might lead to problems
such as autism or epilepsy.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:54.203
So, I told you about one of the genes

00:09:54.203 --> 00:09:56.150
that are actually a master regulator

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.804
and controls how gene expression

00:09:58.804 --> 00:10:03.160
or splicing is regulated,
and this is a gene called

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.790
NOVA1, and this is a reconstruction

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:10.473
of the protein attached to the RNA

00:10:10.473 --> 00:10:14.050
in exactly that the base pair from the DNA

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:17.160
that changes, altered that conformation

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.700
and as a consequence the RNA splicing

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.140
would be affected as well,
and we are looking into these

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.800
altered splicing factors,
and we realize that

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.120
there's a lot of information in there.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:32.579
Some genes like HOMER1, this
is another synaptic gene,

00:10:32.579 --> 00:10:35.540
have different isoforms between humans

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:38.360
and Neanderthals during development.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:42.696
All the genes, and these
are actual target of NOVA1,

00:10:42.696 --> 00:10:46.690
they, such as GNAS or BiN1, so these are

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:50.620
genes involving the epigenetic
regulation, for example.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.410
They create a new
isoform that only present

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:56.620
in Neanderthals, modern
humans lost that isoform

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.810
from that specific protein,
so these are quite interesting

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:03.260
observations at the gene expression level.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.240
What happens to these brain organoids

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.800
if they have that?

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.160
So, the morphology is quite interesting.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.430
They start quite similar,
but as they progress in time,

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:14.980
you can tell that the
morphology changes a lot.

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:18.420
So, while the modern
humans brain organoids

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.960
become sphere, increasing size,

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.750
and start to mature, the
Neanderthal brain organoids

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:26.011
have these kind of popcorn shape,

00:11:26.011 --> 00:11:29.450
and, well, you can measure
the diameter of them,

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:32.020
I mean, how they grow,
and already we can see

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:35.455
that the Neanderthal
organoids probably have

00:11:35.455 --> 00:11:38.220
some kind of cell death,
or some problems to develop

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:41.060
compared to modern humans.

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.360
Also, the size of the sphere is different,

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:47.009
but also, I mean, the way those spheres

00:11:47.009 --> 00:11:51.040
are shaped, which might point it out

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.900
to some differences, as I said,

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:57.620
in cell death or apoptosis,
but also in migration,

00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.490
the way the cells migrate.

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:01.240
So just by looking at these pictures,

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.320
we can tell that there
is migration defects

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.680
and there is a way to test that,

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.530
you can plate some of these cells

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:09.080
and let them migrate by themselves,

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.636
and what we observe is
that the Neanderthal cells,

00:12:11.636 --> 00:12:14.920
they have a defect in migration,

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.790
they migrate is slower,
but they go farther

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:22.571
than human cells, so it's,
even a small migration

00:12:22.571 --> 00:12:25.431
might affect your entire brain's

00:12:25.431 --> 00:12:27.703
trajectory during development.

00:12:27.703 --> 00:12:29.780
So if you look at the neurons,

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:32.760
I mean, we also see
differences in specific subtype

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:36.070
of populations from
the cortex, this is one

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:39.580
of the cortical layers,
and we observe that SATB2,

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.400
it's a neuron that participates

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.290
on intra-cortical communication,

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:46.590
as well as intra
communications between layers.

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:51.040
It is dramatically reduced
in Neanderthal cell lines

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.150
compared to controls.

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:56.227
So, everything is all about morphology

00:12:56.227 --> 00:12:59.380
and how the cells behave, or
the shape of these organoids.

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:00.520
What about the function?

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.520
Can we actually measure
how the communication

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.110
or the network is being affected?

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:08.510
So to do that we use a tool that is called

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:09.670
a multi electrode array,

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:11.430
where we plate these brain organoids

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:14.070
into multi electrode, in
the bottom of those dishes,

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:18.530
and we can record, we gain an activity map

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:22.270
as well as a raster plot
in every trace here,

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:24.590
it's when a neuron spikes, and if you have

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:29.090
several spikes at the same
time, we call that a burst,

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:31.790
and when bursts spikes
in the same channel,

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:33.790
we call a synchrony event.

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:36.160
And since we can keep them alive,

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.130
we can see that they
evolve, and we did that.

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:42.860
And when we start, we actually
didn't have what to compare,

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:45.390
so I'm showing you here,
just some of the work

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:47.580
that we did in 2D, this is without

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.520
the two dimension restructure,

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:54.380
and most of the data,
it is below five hertz,

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:58.190
so this is just a average
measure of the brain activity,

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:01.140
so what is the ideal, what is our goal?

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:04.200
So, a mouse brain is about 18 hertz,

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.130
and a monkey brain is about 20 hertz.

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:09.850
So other people have also
created different protocols

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:12.860
for brain organoids, and
although they can also keep them

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:16.044
alive for a long period of time,

00:14:16.044 --> 00:14:19.830
they were not able to see
an increase in activity,

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:23.107
suggesting that there is some
problems with maturation.

00:14:23.107 --> 00:14:26.620
But we are glad that the protocol we have,

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:28.980
we were able, not only to keep them alive,

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:31.660
but to reach a level of activity

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.832
that's much higher than was ever

00:14:33.832 --> 00:14:38.710
recorded before in vitro,
so if you have that much

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:41.960
level of activity in
synaptogenesis going on,

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.600
it means that you can
record something else,

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:48.250
and this is what we call brain
oscillations or brain waves,

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:51.600
the activity that can actually
measure through the skulls

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.610
using electro encephalogram or EEG.

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:59.100
So, we can actually
measure those EEG waves

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:02.958
from these brain organoids,
and we can compare

00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:06.160
them to pre-term babies, so we created

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.800
these machine learning
algorithm and we trained that

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.060
in an unsupervised way, by exposing them

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:16.100
to different EEGs from preterm babies,

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.840
and asking the machine to tell the age

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.160
of the person, so once
the machine has done that,

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.340
we feed them with our
brain organoid's EEG,

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:29.203
and we ask, what are the
predicted age of the organoids?

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:33.360
So, this is how the machine will do,

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.140
in a perfect condition in the red trace,

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:40.880
the data is actually on
the black trace as well,

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.895
where you can see that we
have a very good prediction

00:15:42.895 --> 00:15:47.720
to above 25 weeks, and the reason why

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.450
the machine is not good to predict

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:52.130
below that, is because
we simply don't have

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:56.610
any data from human
pre-term babies below that.

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:59.300
The babies will die,
and we don't have a way

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:02.570
to record in uterus that is not invasive,

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:04.760
so that's why we don't
have a good prediction.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.450
But what is the prediction
that we can have,

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:09.550
and I will show you just one example

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:11.730
of one of the parameters from the EEG,

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:14.920
which is the space between the interval

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:19.462
of activities, so if you
just look an adult EEG here,

00:16:19.462 --> 00:16:21.260
so it's quite complex.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.950
This is a pre-term baby,
you see these spontaneous

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:28.400
activity transient followed
by quiescent period,

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.840
where the brain's just silent,

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:34.340
when you're super young, and
here is in our brain organoid.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:37.060
So the brain organoid's much
similar to a pre-term baby

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:39.154
than to adult brain, so
that's what we are modeling.

00:16:39.154 --> 00:16:41.060
We are modeling early
stages of neuro development,

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:43.678
so as we grow older, the interval

00:16:43.678 --> 00:16:48.678
between those activity
becomes shorter and shorter,

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:53.650
that's why we have this
complex EEG in adult.

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:56.520
So the organoid, as we age the organoid,

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.160
the interval also reduces, and reduces

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.110
to a level that gets close to that red bar

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:05.200
about 40 weeks, or nine month,

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:10.200
that's equivalent to a
newborn healthy human baby.

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:14.631
So that's what we can get
with these human organoids.

00:17:14.631 --> 00:17:18.180
So now that we have lots
of activity to compare,

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:21.844
I mean, how does the
Neanderthal brain organoids

00:17:21.844 --> 00:17:23.170
compare to modern humans?

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:26.390
So we have been studying
that from different angles,

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:28.870
and I'll first start by showing

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:31.010
what is the level of synaptogenesis,

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:34.110
how many brain cell connections

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:36.537
the Neanderthals can make
compared to modern humans.

00:17:36.537 --> 00:17:39.640
And we see that there
is almost 50% reduction,

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:43.830
which is similar to someone
with autism, for example.

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:45.410
So, definitely a lower level

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:47.710
of synapsis compared to controls.

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:50.160
We also measured them on
the multi electrode arrays,

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.270
and what we have here in these parts

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:57.100
is just the raster plot, the activity map,

00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:00.130
and then, some of the
quantifications that we have.

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:02.980
The number of spikes,
the level of activity

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:06.040
per neuron per minute is way reduced

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:09.460
to what we would expect
for an isogenic control.

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:11.410
The same is true for the firing rate,

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:13.700
for these neurons is also reduced

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.660
compared to isogenic controls,

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.390
which, again, points to the fact

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:20.810
that these networks are
just not good enough

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:22.620
or not mature enough, to the level

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.893
that we would expect from modern humans.

00:18:24.893 --> 00:18:29.710
So, I hope I could tell
you that by recreating

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:31.720
these Neanderthal brain in a dish

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:34.610
we could say that they have differences

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:37.040
in morphology, in synaptogenesis,

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:40.350
even at the network
level, but the question is

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:43.470
are those differences better or worse

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:45.230
than the modern humans?

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:47.970
And I made some analogies with autism

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:49.370
and other neurological disorders,

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:51.410
but the truth is that we don't know.

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:54.730
So we have been looking
that, using different

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:56.860
experimental models and I'll just show you

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.400
one thing that we are excited about,

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.870
and this came from this
idea that if you have

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:04.330
brain oscillations from
people working together,

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:06.870
they might actually synchronize,

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:09.250
or they are more prone to work

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:13.380
if your friend is with
you than a stranger,

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.364
which suggests that, to achieve something,

00:19:15.364 --> 00:19:19.410
to achieve a specific
goal, it's better to work

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:21.340
with someone that you like.

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:26.020
So we have been tagging
these human brain organoids

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.690
into robots, so that's a way for the robot

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:32.053
to experiment the world,
and we are doing that

00:19:32.053 --> 00:19:35.800
in two ways, the first step
is just teaching the organoid

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.960
how to move a robot, and that's what

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.767
you're gonna be seeing this video.

00:19:39.767 --> 00:19:43.340
So this is a robot that has been moving

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.540
all the legs just by the frequency

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.240
of oscillations coming from
the human brain organoid.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:52.230
So the idea is now, to do the second step,

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:53.970
which is to create the feedback loop,

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:56.480
so the organoid can
actually learn something

00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:00.300
and the robot can tell by
experiencing the world.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:02.820
So soon, we gonna be
doing the same experiments

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:04.660
using Neanderthal brain organoids,

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:08.420
we can see if the robot can
actually learn something

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:11.250
better or not than humans.

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:14.090
So, I'll finish here by summarizing

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:17.770
that we have a model,
a brain organoid model

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:20.737
coming from stem cells
that can recapitulate

00:20:20.737 --> 00:20:24.380
human development, we can
reconstruct evolutionary steps

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:29.326
that recapitulate key
features of the Neanderthal

00:20:29.326 --> 00:20:33.250
development, we think
so, and these might be

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:37.160
a paradigm for learning, if you put them

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.270
back to a robot or something.

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:42.000
So these are Cleber and Priscilla,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.810
these are the brain masters in the lab,

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:46.660
they are the ones who
develop these nice protocol

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.030
that everybody's excited about,

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:52.250
and these are my collaborators
for this project,

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:55.030
both Katerina Semendeferi, Yeo Lab,

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:57.580
the Voytek Lab, and Eric Green,

00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:00.480
who help us on the genomic
analysis of Neanderthals.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.110
And these are my funding agencies,

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:05.307
and I will stop here, thank you very much.

00:21:05.307 --> 00:21:08.307
(audience applauds)

00:21:10.157 --> 00:21:12.740
(bright music)
