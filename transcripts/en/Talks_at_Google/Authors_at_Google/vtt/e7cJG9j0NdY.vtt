00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.415
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:10.920
DANIEL ELLSBERG: Is
this mic working?

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.885
Can you hear me in the back?

00:00:11.885 --> 00:00:12.590
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.423
DANIEL ELLSBERG: OK.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.000
I feel overdressed.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.951
[LAUGHTER] Usually I only wear
all this when I get arrested.

00:00:21.951 --> 00:00:24.200
I always tell people, if
you're about to get arrested,

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.980
if you have a suit
and tie, wear it,

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.580
showing that that
doesn't exempt you

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.740
from the obligations
of citizenship,

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.550
and that people like
you can get and should

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.480
get arrested at times.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.160
It's funny.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.130
Being here, you always
hear speakers say,

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.580
it's an honor to be here.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.970
It's not actually a formula
I use, particularly.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.530
I don't go into it.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.970
And yet it's
occurring to me here,

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.344
people who stand
here, of course,

00:00:48.344 --> 00:00:51.230
know they're at the center
of the universe exactly,

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.970
and speaking to--

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.310
This is, by the way, a
much younger audience

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.080
than I'm used to speaking to.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.060
Generally, they're all
gray hair or [INAUDIBLE]..

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.970
I see one here.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:11.330
OK, the scroll overhead
is a long, long time

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.020
ago in a galaxy far, far away.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.650
Except that in the "Star Wars"
movie, the galaxy we're in,

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.200
the same bullshit is going
on as in far, far away.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.310
It's been going on all along.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.685
I was just talking to
people from the bookstore.

00:01:27.685 --> 00:01:29.060
They tell me they
actually have--

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.330
I was surprised-- copies of
my earlier book, "Secrets:

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.000
A Memoir of Vietnam and
the Pentagon Papers."

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.555
Good book.

00:01:35.555 --> 00:01:36.680
I encourage you to read it.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.540
It should be coming out now.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.570
It would explain how we
got into Afghanistan, why

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.330
we stayed in Afghanistan,
why we're not getting out

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.980
of Afghanistan.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.010
The movie, "The Post," which
is coming out shortly--

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.650
and I've seen it
a couple times--

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.890
is set in 1971.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.620
And that was at a
time when America

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.410
thought it had been going on
for a very long time in war,

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.660
in Vietnam, six years.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.490
That was longer than any
American war prior to that.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.920
People then, your age and
twice your age and three times

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.300
your age, had not
experienced a war

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.210
that had gone on 16 years that
was likely to go on another 10

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:21.770
or 16.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.900
That wasn't in our experience.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.710
And yet the question was just as
sharp then, of course, as now.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:28.860
What's going on?

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:29.900
Why are we here?

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.970
What is this?

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.740
The movie, a documentary
that was made from "Secrets"

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.100
is called "The Most Dangerous
Man in America, Daniel Ellsberg

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.485
and the Pentagon Papers."

00:02:41.485 --> 00:02:46.880
It got an Academy Award for
the longest title, actually.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.320
But really, the movie, "The
Post", now, in which I figure,

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.900
played by somebody who looks
a lot better than I did then,

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.430
Matthew Rhys of
"The Americans--"

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.280
so it's a good movie,
in other words--

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.320
really doesn't give a clue
as to answering the question,

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.370
why was Daniel Ellsberg
dangerous to anybody,

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.210
to Kissinger, to Nixon?

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.670
It was Kissinger who called me
that, the most dangerous man

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.020
in America.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.560
Why did I copy the
Pentagon Papers?

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.840
Using the then cutting-edge
technology of the time, Xerox,

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.600
without which I couldn't
have copied 7,000 pages

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.250
and made a number
of copies, which

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.160
took a long time, one copy
at a time in those days,

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.890
bar goes back and forth.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.880
And to make several
copies took a long time.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.000
I couldn't have done it in the
electric typewriter days that

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.560
just preceded that, or manual
before that, just as Ed Snowden

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.860
and Chelsea Manning
could not have put out

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.985
hundreds of thousands of files.

00:03:52.985 --> 00:03:54.860
If I talk a little
softer, could you hear me?

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.510
Can you hear this?

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.340
I've had a bad
cold for six weeks

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.280
and my voice is always
on the edge of going.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.190
So it's better I don't
talk louder than I have to.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.910
If you can't hear me,
please wave your arms.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.980
OK, I'll try not
to talk so loud.

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:12.190
They couldn't put out
hundreds of thousands

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.340
of files or millions of
pages except, of course,

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.769
in the digital
era, which they now

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.560
can with this new technology.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.520
But what made that dangerous
at any time, then or now?

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.880
And the answer was that the
government secrets that they

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.490
were holding onto were secrets
about criminal activity,

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.330
actions that would be extremely
embarrassing to a president,

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.980
because they were illegal or
unconstitutional or simply

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:48.250
incredibly reckless, dangerous,
horrible priorities, unlikely

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.450
ever to succeed in
any sense or to end.

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.430
The public would
not have applauded

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.890
if they understood
the actual strategy

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.750
and the actual prospects.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.540
And the prospects generally
were pretty well-known

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.970
inside the government.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.020
It's wrong to say, as you
often would see on the Pentagon

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.170
Papers, that what they showed
was that the presidents were

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.300
told the war was unwinnable.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.480
Anybody here ever
heard that expression?

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.710
Let me see more hands.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:19.527
Don't be shy.

00:05:19.527 --> 00:05:20.360
There's quite a few.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.980
Right, that's simply false.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.070
It's not what the Pentagon
Papers say any time.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:31.260
The president is never told on
writing the war is unwinnable.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.410
He's always told
by the Joint Chiefs

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.800
in the papers it is winnable.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.380
Just do it the way we say.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.100
It is not winnable
the way you are doing,

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.289
the only way you'll do it.

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:46.580
But if you're willing to risk
war with China, if you're

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.770
willing to hit every
target in the north,

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.560
if you're willing to put
at least 500,000 troops

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.710
in Vietnam--

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.890
which we eventually did have--

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.990
up to a million, which the
president was told in 1965

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.680
was also a real possibility,
a million troops in Vietnam,

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.270
then we'd win.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.440
Well, why would we win?

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.970
Would the other side give up?

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.942
Well, if not then, with more.

00:06:10.942 --> 00:06:12.900
They've got to give up
eventually, aren't they?

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.632
We're the U-S of A. We're
the greatest and so forth.

00:06:16.632 --> 00:06:18.090
Everybody's got to
bend eventually.

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:19.631
They've got to have
a breaking point.

00:06:19.631 --> 00:06:23.210
Let us find it and we'll
give you your victory.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.910
No one said quickly.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.540
Five years, 10 years, 15
years, that's what they said.

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:32.390
In 1965, the president
asked the Joint Chiefs,

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:34.871
how long will it take
and how many troops?

00:06:34.871 --> 00:06:37.370
And he gets the word from the
commandant of the Marine Corps

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.280
troop, five years, 500,000 men.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.510
Now, that's not low
balling it exactly, is it?

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.260
It wasn't right.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.400
Because three years later,
we had 500,000 troops there

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.380
and we weren't near winning it.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.022
And we weren't any nearer than
we were three years earlier.

00:06:55.022 --> 00:06:57.230
But still, you can't say
the Joint Chiefs are saying,

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:58.230
oh, this will be a snap.

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:59.670
Don't worry about it.

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:01.740
The president chose that.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.870
Do I have to explain
why the president chose

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:06.840
not to tell the public
that's where we were going?

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.800
No.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.190
He was able to do it because he
didn't have to tell the public.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.570
Because he could count on
people to keep secrets.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:17.600
They'd signed a promise,
often described as an oath.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.110
But actually, it's not an oath.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:20.400
It's not, so help me God.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.790
It's not a I swear
this and that.

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:23.715
It's an employment promise.

00:07:23.715 --> 00:07:25.590
I don't know what you
sign when you come here

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:27.480
in the way of
non-disclosure agreements.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.610
But most organizations
of any kind,

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.740
whether it's a PTA or union
or whatever the hell, you sign

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.250
something, what I hear here
stays here and so forth,

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:40.560
can't use it outside, or I can
be fired or I can be demoted.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.330
I can be punished
in various ways.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:43.920
It's not a crime.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.480
Corporation can't
make it a crime.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.276
Google can't make
it a crime for you

00:07:47.276 --> 00:07:49.050
to reveal Google's
secrets unless they're

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:50.280
some kind of trade secrets.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.380
There probably are some
narrow, little areas

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.090
where they could
get away with it,

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:55.740
but not just general
how decisions

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.270
got made and so forth.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:58.458
Just a second.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:06.040
I had taken an oath many
times, as had every member

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.140
of the armed services.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:11.552
I'd been a lieutenant in the
Marine Corps, platoon leader

00:08:11.552 --> 00:08:13.510
and company commander,
rifle company commander.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:15.940
I was very proud of the
fact I was the only First

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.670
Lieutenant in the
2nd Marine Division

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:21.340
who had a rifle
company, usually.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.260
I succeeded a major, actually.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.230
And other majors wanted
that job away from me

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.665
and they couldn't get it.

00:08:27.665 --> 00:08:28.540
I took the oath then.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:33.030
I took the oath in the Pentagon,
in the State Department.

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:36.880
And the oath was to protect
and defend the United States,

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.270
support and defend the
Constitution of the United

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:44.740
States against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:49.269
Now, how that might
affect my behavior

00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:51.310
I certainly didn't spend
any time thinking about,

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:53.230
nor did anybody else.

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:55.854
Every member of Congress
has taken that oath.

00:08:55.854 --> 00:08:57.520
Every member of the
Executive Department

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.930
has taken that same oath.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:01.300
The president's wording
is a little bit different,

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.049
protect, preserve and
defend or something.

00:09:03.049 --> 00:09:06.740
But support and defend,
everybody else takes it.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.260
And all of us
violated it every day

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.750
we heard the president
lying to Congress

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:13.919
and lying to the public
about what he intended,

00:09:13.919 --> 00:09:15.710
where the prospects
were, what he was going

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:18.200
to do in Vietnam, elsewhere.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.764
We all heard the president
lying the public into a war,

00:09:21.764 --> 00:09:23.180
keeping the war
going, letting him

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:26.300
know the costs would be much
less than internal estimates

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.210
all indicated.

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:30.370
And no one broke.

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:34.240
There were no
leaks, including me.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.150
So was I observing that
oath or violating it,

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:41.080
when I knew that Congress, which
has the exclusive authority

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.790
to take us to war,
at least that's

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.980
the best
interpretation, I think,

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:50.860
controverted by president's men,
was entirely delegating that

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:54.390
secretly to a president who was
determined to enlarge the war.

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:03.410
That's how you get wars that
go on 10 years or 11 years,

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:04.070
whatever.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:07.190
The truth is the United States,
as I learned from the Pentagon

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:11.150
Papers, when I read
all of them, had

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:15.380
begun the war in 1945 and '46,
supporting a French effort

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:19.940
to reconquer a colony
which had declared

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:24.700
its independence in August
and September of 1945.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.810
And actually Ho Chi
Minh had been recognized

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:28.850
as a head of state,
at least of the north,

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:32.840
in Paris when they were
negotiating in '45, '46.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.780
But when the French,
starting with a shelling that

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:40.970
killed at least 3,000
civilians in Haiphong in 1946,

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:46.070
went into a war to
reconquer that colony,

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:49.160
the United States was
financing that war, eventually

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.190
up to the point of view of 80%.

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:54.860
It was perceived
by the Vietnamese,

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:59.360
correctly, as an
American-French war,

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.690
perceived by Americans then
and later as a French war.

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:06.950
I don't think there was one
American in 10,000, 100,000

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:08.501
who knew what I've just said.

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:10.250
But the presence in
Vietnam, it turns out,

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:14.060
knew it because the communist
cadres told them, correctly,

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.910
that the US was
financing this war.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:21.650
In short, it had been a war
against Vietnamese independence

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:27.130
from 1945 to 1975, when it
finally ended 30 years later.

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:30.740
The big part, the US
part, 10 years war,

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:35.900
in 1971, it had
four years to go.

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:37.379
If you see the
movie, "The Post,"

00:11:37.379 --> 00:11:39.920
which I recommend you seeing--
and I don't say this publicly,

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.480
generally, because it
sounds as though I'm

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.210
putting down the movie, and I
have no interest in doing that.

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:46.760
But talking about the
history, I will just

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.530
say some questions it
just doesn't answer.

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:52.640
It ends with the triumph of
the Supreme Court saying,

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.980
the First Amendment
does not allow

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:58.940
us to grant you
injunctive relief

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:02.930
from this information coming
out, its history coming out.

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:08.030
We can't do prior constraint,
prior restraint in this country

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:09.090
as we could in England.

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:12.350
We don't have an Official
Secrets Act the way they do.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:16.910
Obama, by the way, used the
Espionage Act nine times,

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:20.480
at least, or 10, if
you count Petraeus,

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:24.980
against leakers like me, but
had been used only three times

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:27.920
before that under all
presidents put together.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.560
I was the first under Nixon.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.925
The movie, by the way, doesn't
mention that I'm put on trial.

00:12:33.925 --> 00:12:35.300
It's a big triumph
for the press.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.400
And it was a triumph
for the press.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.235
They can go on printing.

00:12:39.235 --> 00:12:40.610
And although the
movie is started

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:44.600
with me giving the papers,
copying them and eventually

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.940
giving them to The
Post, it doesn't

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.520
mention that, although
they are permitted

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.460
to read, on the same week, the
president, the Supreme Court,

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:55.070
decides that I'm put
on trial, eventually

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:59.990
facing 12 felony counts,
115 years possible sentence.

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:02.660
And Pete Williamson, who
was bringing me up here,

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:04.700
said he was 11
when this happened.

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:07.790
He thought I was obviously
guilty of putting out secrets

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:10.900
and that I should be on
trial, when he was 11.

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.400
And he said he was
amazed when I somehow

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.560
was let off two years later.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.480
I said, well, it was amazing.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.540
It was like a miracle.

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.310
Essentially, no
trial has ever been

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:25.520
ended the way that was on
the basis of a findings

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:29.210
of government misconduct,
criminal misconduct,

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:32.890
which led to the criminal
proceedings against Ehrlichman,

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:34.880
Haldeman, a number
of others called,

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.950
put a dozen or so White
House aides in jail,

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:40.880
and made the president, facing
conviction and impeachment,

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.260
resign.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:47.240
Without Nixon resigning
in 1974, the war

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.910
would have continued
until he left office,

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:52.670
at least through 1976.

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:54.320
With him out, it became endable.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.140
With him in, not possible.

00:13:56.140 --> 00:14:00.080
Let me give you one hint that
goes right to the present.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:03.770
It's not in my book,
but to show, as I say,

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:06.310
how similar the galaxies are.

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:09.530
Galaxy Trump here,
who is accused

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:12.350
of having colluded
with a foreign power

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:16.365
to affect his election
as a challenger, right,

00:14:16.365 --> 00:14:18.125
not proven yet.

00:14:18.125 --> 00:14:20.114
It may never be proven,
strictly speaking,

00:14:20.114 --> 00:14:21.030
in terms of documents.

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:22.490
We'll see.

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:26.630
In the case of Nixon, it was
last year that a document--

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:27.740
last year now--

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.750
that a document just surfaced
from Haldeman's notes,

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:36.080
his Chief of Staff, saying that
it was Nixon who gave orders

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.830
to derail the arrangements of
going to Paris for negotiations

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:44.210
in November and
December of 1969.

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:46.040
Humphrey was on the
verge of winning

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.679
with the thought in
the public's mind

00:14:47.679 --> 00:14:49.970
that there were about to be
negotiations that would end

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:54.380
this war, which was then,
they thought, four years old,

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:55.250
since '65.

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:57.800
They didn't know about
the earlier period.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.240
Pentagon Papers
hadn't come out yet.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.870
And so he was talking.

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:06.140
Nixon was dealing with Thieu
through intermediaries,

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:10.940
President Thieu,
not to go to Paris,

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:14.810
to abort the negotiations,
the prospect of which

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:17.780
was leading Humphrey
higher, higher every day

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:20.240
and ready to overtake Nixon.

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.860
That prospect stopped
immediately flat

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:27.020
when Thieu announced,
I will not go to Paris,

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:29.990
where he had agreed to go
earlier with President Johnson.

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:31.850
And Nixon won.

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:37.330
Thieu said to aides
later, I elected Nixon.

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:39.550
He was right.

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:42.730
Without him, Nixon would
not have come into office.

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:47.860
The war would have
ended in '69, not '75.

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.630
I don't think there's
one American in,

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:53.140
what, 100,000 who
would recognize

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:54.640
what I'm just telling you now.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:55.692
And it's not very easy.

00:15:55.692 --> 00:15:56.900
You don't have to believe it.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:58.480
But look it up on Google.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.600
You'll find stuff about it.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:06.400
In short, the help of a foreign
puppet, really, in that case--

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.640
Putin is no puppet,
needless to say--

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.960
in that case, a puppet
who relied entirely

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:16.090
on American financing
ensured that there

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:19.840
would be regime change from the
Democrats to the Republicans.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.330
He brought about
regime change in this

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:26.650
and enabled himself, Thieu,
to stay in office another--

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:27.880
he left in '75--

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.200
six years.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.780
And that explains
something that you just

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:34.880
won't get from history books.

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:39.770
Why did Nixon so doggedly
demand in negotiations

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:43.250
that whatever happened,
Thieu must remain in office?

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:46.700
And if you've seen the
Burns and Novick series,

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:49.550
I think you'll gather that the
Vietnamese, North Vietnamese,

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:53.030
always said, we will negotiate
a coalition government,

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:55.250
but not with Thieu in office.

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:59.020
And I think their reason,
which I can only conjecture,

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.730
for not wanting him is that they
were sure Nixon would continue

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:05.750
the bombing if Thieu were
still in office and might not

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:08.210
if he weren't, if there
weren't that continuity.

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:10.140
That's conjecture on their side.

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.619
What hardly is much less
conjectural on our side

00:17:12.619 --> 00:17:16.310
is why Nixon could not
afford a deal in which Thieu

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:17.990
felt betrayed.

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:22.760
Because Thieu could reveal,
probably with tapes,

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:26.510
with tapes, that Nixon and
Kissinger and Richard Allen,

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:31.390
and other intermediaries, had
stolen an election in 1968

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:33.470
by direct collusion.

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:36.110
Whether this happened at all
or not in this recent election,

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:37.890
I don't know.

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:39.470
Did it happen in '68?

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:40.190
It did happen.

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:41.630
I do know that.

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:43.380
And Nixon could not
afford to let that go.

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.170
So another 20,000
Americans had to die

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:49.550
and probably a million
or more Vietnamese.

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:52.220
And it would have gone on
except for an extraordinary set

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:54.860
of circumstances that came
together that I really don't

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:57.710
have time to go into here.

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:01.610
A lot of it is in the book,
"Secrets," toward the end

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:02.940
about the Vietnam part.

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.060
And as I say, it's
not in the movie.

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:09.710
So, in short, why was
Ellsberg dangerous?

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:12.530
Because I might reveal
his secret plans.

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:13.550
Why was that dangerous?

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:18.050
Because the secret plans were
for nuclear war in Vietnam.

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:21.046
The threats were made
rather explicitly.

00:18:21.046 --> 00:18:22.670
For example, as you'll
see in the book,

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:25.010
in 1972, when there
was an offensive,

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:28.040
a year after the
Pentagon Papers came out,

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.590
the war was still going
on and getting larger.

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:34.230
And Nixon is saying,
oh, I'd rather

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:35.400
use a nuclear weapon, Henry.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.500
You got that?

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:39.770
Oh, I think that would be
just too much, on the tape,

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:40.820
says Kissinger.

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:42.191
And Nixon says, nuclear bomb?

00:18:42.191 --> 00:18:43.440
That's too big for you, Henry?

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.680
I just want you to think
big, for Christ's sake.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.570
OK, so they didn't
have to use it.

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:50.940
They used the B52s and so forth.

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:55.630
What this book is about is,
in a way, the back story,

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:58.000
of secrets, of what was
going on there, again,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.130
not hinted at in the
movie, understandably--

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:01.882
they didn't know it--

00:19:01.882 --> 00:19:11.680
is that at the same time I was
copying the Pentagon Papers,

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:17.380
a 7,000-page, top secret,
47-volume study of American

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:22.410
decision making
from 1945 to '68--

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:23.920
and the title was
secret, actually,

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.790
in part because most
Americans would have said, 45?

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:29.080
What could that mean?

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:31.187
What decisions were we
doing, the US, in '45?

00:19:31.187 --> 00:19:32.770
Well, we were deciding
for the French,

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:34.820
to help the French
reconquer their colony.

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:38.500
That's when our decision making
started, which was not exactly

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:41.680
a legitimate goal for the US.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:44.500
It was not illegal for
the UN, because the UN

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:49.060
did allow the possession of
colonial powers and trusteeship

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:50.530
and didn't really
rule out trying

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:55.599
to reconquer a colony that had
the obstreperousness to declare

00:19:55.599 --> 00:19:57.640
its independence, which
is what France was doing.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:01.360
That was not clearly illegal at
that point, strangely enough.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:03.740
But in terms of
American traditions,

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:05.200
we thought of ourselves as--

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.540
we didn't think-- of
having run the first war

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:08.560
of national liberation.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:10.601
But it could have been
called that, the first war

00:20:10.601 --> 00:20:12.700
of separation for an empire.

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.390
And we thought of
ourselves as anti-imperial.

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:17.470
And we still think of
ourselves that way,

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:20.590
as not an empire
like the others.

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:21.820
That's false.

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:23.980
That's very clear from
the Pentagon Papers

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.680
where we're deciding who
should run Vietnam this year

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:30.940
or next year or how they should
stay in power, what criminal

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:33.695
acts they're entitled
to take, how much we

00:20:33.695 --> 00:20:34.570
need to support them.

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:39.695
And so it's very obviously
the documents of an empire.

00:20:39.695 --> 00:20:41.320
In fact, that's what
I said to my wife,

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:44.244
when she said, at one
point, before they came out,

00:20:44.244 --> 00:20:46.160
does it really matter
to get this history out?

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.610
And I said, well,
among other things,

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:51.880
it's the first real history
of imperial operations

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.160
since the Nuremberg
documents were discovered,

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.070
covered after the
Second World War.

00:20:57.070 --> 00:21:01.300
And before that, it probably
goes back to Punic times,

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.401
to the Syrian empire,
to Sumerian empire,

00:21:03.401 --> 00:21:04.900
and so probably all
the same, but we

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.460
don't have the documents for it.

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:07.460
And here they are.

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:11.990
And yet, even so, I managed to
think of it as an aberration.

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:16.510
We had somehow gotten ourselves
into acting like an empire.

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:19.299
Let me say just
very briefly now--

00:21:19.299 --> 00:21:20.840
I could spend the
whole time on this.

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:22.870
But I'll just say,
I've come recently

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:28.630
to see what we are
as a covert empire.

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:34.051
And covert refers to plausibly
denial covert operations.

00:21:34.051 --> 00:21:35.550
Covert operations,
I should say, are

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:38.750
defined as operations that are
not just secret, that you're

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:44.080
not just keeping it safe, but
that you lie about plausibly.

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:48.630
And to make it plausible, you
provide in advance evidence,

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:50.789
false evidence,
misleading evidence

00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:52.830
as to what's really going
on and who's running it

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:54.390
and why it's happening
and who did it

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:58.590
and so forth, a false flag
in some cases, whatever.

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:02.220
But you provide
several layers of cover

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:05.820
for what's being done to protect
the president from the notion

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:07.530
that he is murdering,
overthrowing

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:10.230
governments, installing coup
governments in democracies

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:16.091
and so forth, as so often in
the third world then and now, up

00:22:16.091 --> 00:22:16.590
until now.

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:19.160
Well, you don't want the US
to be associated with that.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.980
It's happening over there.

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:23.640
And if somehow a
US hand surfaces,

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.340
he or she wasn't
working for any agency.

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:29.250
And if you find the
agency, it wasn't the CIA.

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:33.470
And if it was the CIA,
it wasn't the president.

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:36.420
So you have layer after layer
of cover stories with documents.

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:37.290
I didn't know this.

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:38.820
It didn't come to my attention.

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:41.250
This so-and-so did
it and so forth.

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:43.800
The Vietnam War was run from
beginning to end like that.

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.690
That's how we run our empire.

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:47.570
We deny that we are an empire.

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:49.170
And what is an empire?

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:52.920
A country that determines the
regime of other countries,

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.110
decides who the police
chief was, who shall live

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:58.350
and who shall die, what the
basic foreign policies are.

00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:00.180
We do that throughout
Central America

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:03.300
and always have, often many
other parts of the world

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:06.330
as far apart as Indonesia,
now the Middle East.

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:08.680
In general, we decide.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:09.380
Who do we want?

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:10.920
Is this guy OK?

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.560
We don't decide every
detail but any more

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.990
than you decide every detail
of a military commander's

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:17.130
operations.

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:20.090
But generally, they work.

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:23.430
If they don't do what
we want, we replace them

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:24.532
with somebody else.

00:23:24.532 --> 00:23:25.740
We deny that we're an empire.

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:26.970
We're against empire.

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:29.720
When other people do the same
sort of thing, they're empires.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.230
They're acting imperially.

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:33.930
First level of denial
on the American part.

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:37.170
And then second, how
do they get in power?

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:39.130
Who has to be killed?

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:42.000
What paramilitary forces
have to be paid and go in,

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.310
as into Nicaragua, for
example, and other places?

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:49.320
So the efforts are
also plausibly denied.

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:55.410
OK, I could spend time.

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:57.730
And I don't know if
people have it in mind.

00:23:57.730 --> 00:23:58.870
Why wasn't I convicted?

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:01.480
I was the first person
prosecuted for a leak.

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.700
That's because our
first amendment

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:06.210
precludes prior restraint.

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:09.310
And it also actually precludes
an Official Secrets Act

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:12.644
of the kind the British
have, the mother country.

00:24:12.644 --> 00:24:14.560
And most other countries
in the world have it.

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:17.380
We don't have an act
that simply criminalizes

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:22.180
any revelation of classified,
protected, stamped information.

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.070
We don't have it.

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:28.359
In fact, what was
I just reading?

00:24:28.359 --> 00:24:28.900
I don't know.

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:33.940
I was, just yesterday, reading
something that mentioned--

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:37.600
I guess it was on The
Post or something--

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:42.140
why there had been
so few prosecutions.

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:44.910
But the article didn't
mention the fact

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:47.980
that we didn't have a law
that they were breaking.

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:49.780
And the first
person to experiment

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:53.590
with going with the Espionage
Act, which was meant for spies,

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:55.100
was Nixon against me.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:57.760
And then there were two
others after me, before Obama.

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:02.740
Obama four-- nine, nine instead
of three altogether before.

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:07.900
Trump almost surely will
prosecute more people

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.600
than the nine but
probably will also

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.630
prosecute journalists, which
is so clearly against the First

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:17.382
Amendment that no administration
has yet tried to do that,

00:25:17.382 --> 00:25:19.090
with the exception of
the Pentagon Papers

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:21.070
where Nixon did,
in fact, set out

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:23.686
to indict some of the New York
Times people who put it out.

00:25:23.686 --> 00:25:25.810
But that fell apart when
they discovered the crimes

00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:28.250
against me, which
is what brought--

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:29.950
and undoubtedly
against them, too--

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:33.100
when it was found out that
I had been wiretapped--

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:34.580
I should say overheard--

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:36.742
warrantlessly,
which was criminal.

00:25:36.742 --> 00:25:38.450
It was certainly true
of the other people

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:41.800
they were investigating in
Boston, like Noam Chomsky

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:45.190
and Howard Zinn obviously
had also been wiretapped.

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:48.040
And so they dropped that
indictment for the same way.

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.620
So no journalist has
yet been indicted.

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:55.240
That will probably
happen before long.

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:59.330
Now, we get to the
subject of this book.

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:01.792
And I've been
thinking about how--

00:26:01.792 --> 00:26:03.250
I was talking to
some of the people

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:05.860
here how young everybody was.

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:08.350
But the following, now, is
not really a matter if you--

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:12.550
it applies to the older
people just as much.

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:15.370
I kind of analogize myself
to the position of a guy--

00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:18.690
not to put on airs,
but James Hansen,

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:21.960
who tries to tell people--
what was it, in 1979, I think.

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:22.860
Or was it '89?

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:28.000
'79, I think-- climate change
is on the way, not just

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.070
hotter and not just colder.

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:31.780
Both of those dry--

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:34.270
tremendous change from
CO2 in the atmosphere,

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:35.800
man-made climate.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.770
We have a party in power
right now that almost,

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:41.950
to a man and woman,
simply denies

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:45.040
that there is man-made
climate change,

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.960
despite the fact
that it is no longer

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.570
a scientific
controversy, as it might

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:53.800
have been 30 and 40 years
ago, or even 20 years ago.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:58.510
It is no more a controversy
now than evolution.

00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:01.990
But that, too, is rejected by
about a third of the country,

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:07.750
OK, the third that were core
to the president right now.

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:09.680
Well, I'm not talking
here about a problem

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:13.390
that started with Donald
Trump, by any means.

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:16.620
But it should-- and it's going
to be very hard to even make

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:19.800
a dent in it under
Trump or his successor,

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.650
unless they're significantly
different from Hillary

00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:26.670
Clinton or his past predecessors
in the Democratic Party.

00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:29.670
When I say I feel like
James Hansen saying,

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:33.870
climate change is real
and it really is coming,

00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:35.760
and if we put more
CO2 in the atmosphere,

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.920
it's going to come
all the closer

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:43.050
and bring civilization
down before long,

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:45.280
how many people hear it
or do anything about it?

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:48.350
Well, actually in this case,
a lot of people have heard it.

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:50.250
They know that
controversy, even though it

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:53.110
didn't figure for a moment
in the presidential debates

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:57.420
of last year, if I recall,
not a moment, climate.

00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:00.360
Not even Bernie Sanders raised
it, that I can remember.

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:04.200
So, nevertheless, there it is.

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.809
I'm talking about
a doomsday machine.

00:28:06.809 --> 00:28:08.100
And let me put that in context.

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:09.480
How many people here have seen--

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.490
I imagine most of you--

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:12.380
"Dr. Strangelove?"

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:14.730
OK, very good.

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:20.100
I saw that for professional
reasons in 1964.

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:22.660
In fact, I'll just mention--
it isn't in the book--

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:27.600
but if Sammy Kubrick
had decided to let

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.900
the Pentagon view his rushes--

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.510
I was asked by the Secretary
of Defense's office

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:36.000
to be the person to
review it for them because

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.390
of my expertise, young as
I was, like you, on command

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:40.440
and control at that time.

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.390
And he didn't
allow us to see it.

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:46.020
But when it finally came out,
my boss and I in the Pentagon

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:49.530
did go over in the
afternoon to see it.

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:53.280
And we came out saying,
that was a documentary.

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:56.160
[LAUGHTER] There was
nothing in that movie

00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:00.464
that could not have occurred
exactly the way it did occur.

00:29:00.464 --> 00:29:02.880
Now, let me mention just--
there were a number of details.

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:03.921
We'll see if I have time.

00:29:03.921 --> 00:29:06.880
But the key one is this--

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.790
or a key one.

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:10.330
The central idea
is one that Kubrick

00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:13.240
got from a colleague
of ours, Herman Khan,

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.850
at the RAND Corporation,
called a doomsday machine.

00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:19.510
It was a conceptual device
to make certain points about

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:22.960
the nature of deterrence that
would, on being triggered--

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:26.120
and you could preset it to be
triggered by whatever you want,

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.810
one nuclear explosion,
10 nuclear explosions--

00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:31.890
the wrong person getting
elected somewhere, something

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:36.670
would, by computer, be
recognized as triggering this

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:38.720
and it would end life on Earth.

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:43.060
Now, why would you want to
threaten or prepare ending life

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:44.230
on earth?

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:47.440
One reason, it would
be much, much cheaper

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:50.080
than our current
Strategic Air Command that

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:56.290
depends on deterrence by
building thousands of weapons,

00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:57.775
training pilots.

00:29:57.775 --> 00:30:01.630
But, in a word, carrying
across the globe with missiles

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:04.510
or planes, dumping them
on targets over there

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:07.750
and so forth, very expensive.

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:11.170
Fairly cheaply, you could
assure that the Russians would

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:14.410
die, for a tiny
fraction of that cost,

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:16.510
if they transgressed
in certain forms.

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:17.665
That's the advantage.

00:30:17.665 --> 00:30:21.340
The disadvantage,
everybody else dies, also.

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:22.180
We die.

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:25.960
Now, strictly speaking, in
an actual World War III,

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:29.980
then or now, we
would die anyway.

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:32.080
But the southern
hemisphere would not.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:36.230
We'd get it from the
Russians' retaliation.

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:40.000
So it is a suicide,
mutual suicide, machine.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.237
But we did think, not
a doomsday machine.

00:30:43.237 --> 00:30:44.320
Why would we believe that?

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:45.486
Hit the southern hemisphere.

00:30:45.486 --> 00:30:47.050
It's better to have half left.

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:50.380
And Edward Teller, the
inventor of the H-bomb,

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:52.780
the father of the H-bomb,
said a number of times,

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:57.730
once in my presence when I asked
a question, it is impossible--

00:30:57.730 --> 00:30:59.760
I can't do a Hungarian accent--

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:03.720
it is impossible, I remember,
to destroy more than a quarter

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:07.560
of the Earth's
population with H-bombs.

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:11.370
And strictly speaking,
the Joint Chiefs

00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:13.830
had answered a
question I drafted

00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:16.860
which President Kennedy
sent to the Joint Chiefs,

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:18.390
a little more than that.

00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:21.180
The question was, if your
plans were carried out

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:24.090
as planned, meaning
as first strike,

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:28.170
because the Air Force has never
accepted the idea that it was

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:31.050
acceptable to wait for
other enemy warheads

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:32.980
to hit before you
launched your warheads--

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:36.090
they have always had a launch
on warning predisposition--

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:38.370
or an escalation of
a war in Europe--

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:40.710
that was the basis
of our NATO policy.

00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:43.400
So if you carried out this first
strike for a Russian warhead

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:47.400
to come up, how many people
would be killed in the,

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.177
I said, first of all,
in the USSR and China?

00:31:50.177 --> 00:31:52.010
I won't go into why I
narrowed it like that,

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:55.620
but I wanted to make it as
hard to evade as possible, just

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:56.870
that.

00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:59.807
And they immediately came back
with an answer, to my surprise.

00:31:59.807 --> 00:32:01.265
I thought they were
going to dither

00:32:01.265 --> 00:32:03.365
and wouldn't want to
tell the President.

00:32:03.365 --> 00:32:06.646
And, well, what do you
think the answer was?

00:32:06.646 --> 00:32:07.897
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:07.897 --> 00:32:09.230
DANIEL ELLSBERG: Let me have it.

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:11.104
What do you think?

00:32:11.104 --> 00:32:12.020
AUDIENCE: All of them?

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:12.292
DANIEL ELLSBERG: What?

00:32:12.292 --> 00:32:13.640
AUDIENCE: All of them?

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:14.620
All of them?

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:16.724
DANIEL ELLSBERG: Say?

00:32:16.724 --> 00:32:19.015
No answer, no guess as to
what the joint chiefs-- what?

00:32:19.015 --> 00:32:19.261
AUDIENCE: 100%?

00:32:19.261 --> 00:32:20.177
DANIEL ELLSBERG: What?

00:32:20.177 --> 00:32:21.287
AUDIENCE: 100%.

00:32:21.287 --> 00:32:22.370
DANIEL ELLSBERG: Well, no.

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:22.890
No.

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:23.389
Wrong.

00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:26.500
OK, 100%, no, you're
thinking big there.

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:29.820
[LAUGHTER] But that
would be very expensive,

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:33.280
with radioactivity
alone and so forth.

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.520
Hard to kill everybody.

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:42.170
But the answer was
325 million people.

00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:44.770
And then-- I'll just make
a short comment on this--

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:46.810
since they clearly had
a little model here,

00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:48.740
a little linear
model, I said, OK,

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:51.540
how many altogether
then after all?

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:58.120
They gave another 100 million
in a week to East Europe,

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:02.160
another 100 million in
West Europe, our allies,

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:04.340
not with a single
warhead falling on them

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:08.570
from us but from the
fallout from our attacks,

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:11.620
and a third 100
million additional

00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:14.700
to areas mostly neutral
contiguous to the USSR

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:15.480
and China.

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:18.139
For example, plucky
little Finland--

00:33:18.139 --> 00:33:20.180
you won't recognize that
term, or how many people

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:22.050
here do recognize that term?

00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:23.520
I see one hand.

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:27.410
But Americans my age and
older grew up with the memory

00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:31.820
that Finland alone had paid its
war debts after World War II--

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:33.290
I, after World War I--

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:35.950
and that in the prior
stages of World War II,

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:37.430
they had fought
off the Russians.

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:38.840
We had movies about it.

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:41.600
So Finland was thought of
in very courageous terms

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.430
against the Red
Army at that point,

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:44.960
before Russia became our ally.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:50.210
That was actually, it was
under the Hitler-Stalin pact.

00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:53.780
And so Finland was particularly
sentimentally thought of.

00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:56.080
As I said, in
Finland at the time,

00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:02.210
our plans called for us to
annihilate Finland by fallout

00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:04.880
from our attacks,
underground attacks,

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:09.020
on Russian submarine
pens in Leningrad.

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:11.330
So our attacks on those
which could not be airburst

00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:14.210
would create fallout
that would unfortunately

00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:18.079
make collateral damage of
all Finns, but also Japan

00:34:18.079 --> 00:34:18.620
and so forth.

00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:26.679
The total was 600 million,
or 100 holocausts,

00:34:26.679 --> 00:34:32.800
from our strikes accomplished
in a week or maybe six months

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.800
with the fallout.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:38.010
Now, it's funny, last
night it occurred to me--

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:39.480
I even looked it up--

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:42.150
and I won't go into that now,
but the origins of the company

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:45.120
model here, which has
always intrigued me.

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.980
Don't be evil.

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:48.659
And exactly what
was meant by that?

00:34:48.659 --> 00:34:49.617
And it was interesting.

00:34:49.617 --> 00:34:51.960
I read some commentaries on it.

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.870
Well, evil is a
controversial term.

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:55.710
It's used promiscuously.

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:57.060
It's used all the time.

00:34:57.060 --> 00:35:00.090
Ask Trump what's
evil and you'll get

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:05.010
a list of things that many of
which would not coordinate.

00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:07.260
Ask other people, it
could be masturbation.

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:09.390
It could be any kind of thing.

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:11.040
The word is used.

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:14.280
Is it entirely useless
a term then after all?

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:17.890
Well, let me just suggest
to you that if there

00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:23.920
is some meaning to the word
evil that could be agreed on,

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:29.200
destroying 600 million people
would seem to qualify as evil.

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.490
That's evil.

00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:32.340
This is an evil plan.

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:32.890
It's evil.

00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:35.170
Does that mean it's
done by evil people?

00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:36.910
Well, I knew the
people it was done by.

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:38.500
They were my colleagues.

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:41.800
I had beer with him in
the evening, colonels

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:43.297
who worked on war plans.

00:35:43.297 --> 00:35:45.130
They were my colleagues
at RAND and whatnot.

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:46.171
They were like everybody.

00:35:46.171 --> 00:35:49.240
There were like you and
me, I would have to say.

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:49.760
Am I evil?

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:52.090
Well, I was part
of this, you know?

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:55.630
So the question of
whether you are evil

00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:58.020
is a more problematic question.

00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:01.320
Suppose you cut it
down to doing evil.

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.190
Again, a lot of
room for controversy

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:06.780
there and gray
areas and so forth.

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:10.250
But there were some areas
that are not that gray.

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:13.780
And I'll tell you when we get
to where it is, unfortunately,

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:16.340
very gray and may do us in.

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:20.250
Actually doing this would
seem to qualify as evil.

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:22.470
If this isn't evil, what is it?

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:27.530
As Lincoln said of slavery,
if slavery is not wrong,

00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:30.200
then nothing is wrong.

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:32.750
That statement which
he made again and again

00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:34.970
meant that a third of
our nation could not

00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:37.650
live under him as president.

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:42.810
It could not accept a president
who said slavery was wrong.

00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:44.730
What he did say was it's
here and I'm not here

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:46.530
to interfere with
it where it exists.

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:47.970
That's what he said.

00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:49.750
But it is wrong.

00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:53.010
So a third of the country
seceded, Confederacy.

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:55.800
I'll just say-- let me
see the clock here--

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:59.590
something I've learned
about my country at 86 now,

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:02.550
since Charlottesville,
I have learned more

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:06.830
about the Civil War than I knew
in the rest of my 86 years,

00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:09.030
about what it was about
and what was going on.

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:12.690
But the new perception
is simply this,

00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:15.450
that the Confederacy
never accepted

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:17.550
that slavery had been wrong.

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:21.210
That is my current
belief, very new to me.

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:23.940
It was not that it took a
war, it took a long time.

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:25.840
Lincoln himself, of
course, certainly evolved

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:28.390
in his attitudes, which
started quite racist,

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:31.660
wanted to get the US out, the
Negroes out of the country.

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:34.227
But he evolved and the country
evolved and it was different.

00:37:34.227 --> 00:37:36.060
Well, and then we had
Jim Crow and so forth.

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:38.910
What I'm saying is it's
a new perception of mine

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:42.000
open to debate, and it's
not the subject today,

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.130
that the South, in their grade
school and their mother's knee

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:50.130
and their high school education
and their college education,

00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:52.950
has never accepted that
slavery was not just

00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:58.026
the policy of a defeated nation,
which it was, it was wrong

00:37:58.026 --> 00:37:59.400
and it deserved
to be eliminated.

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:05.420
Second, more to the point,
legalized segregation,

00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:11.030
Jim Crow legalized segregation,
apartheid, was not wrong.

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:12.860
It was right.

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:14.780
And although, when
it was overturned

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:18.185
by force majeure, legally, by
the Supreme Court and so forth,

00:38:18.185 --> 00:38:19.560
that wasn't because
it was wrong.

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:22.112
It was because the
South was weaker.

00:38:22.112 --> 00:38:22.820
They were poorer.

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:24.320
There were fewer of them.

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:25.370
It was not wrong.

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:28.610
I believe we have an attorney
general right now who,

00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:32.480
if he could, would
re-legalize segregation

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:34.570
from one day to the next.

00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:36.570
That's our attorney
general, I think, right now.

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:38.420
That's part of our situation.

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:42.096
OK, coming back-- yeah, I'm
getting a signal back there.

00:38:42.096 --> 00:38:43.970
But nevertheless, I've
wandered so much here.

00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:45.553
I'm going to go on
a little on longer.

00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:53.060
600 million, that didn't
include fire, it so happened,

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:54.657
too hard to calculate.

00:38:54.657 --> 00:38:56.240
So the Joint Chiefs
were not including

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:59.840
the main casualty-producing
effect of thermonuclear weapons

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:02.220
when they said 600 million.

00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:05.660
Fire not included, just
prompt radiation, blast,

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:06.900
immediate heat and so forth.

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:11.100
Put the fire in and put
the Russian retaliation in

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:12.630
and you quickly
get over a billion.

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:17.040
There were three billion then
at that time, two billion

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:19.740
when I was born, by the
way, in 1931, three billion

00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:24.120
in 1961 when I was working
on the war plans, OK?

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:26.030
One billion, one third.

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:27.610
So Teller was wrong.

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:30.730
Yes, you can get over a quarter
of the US population, a third.

00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:31.590
Let's say a third.

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:35.830
You know, let's not
argue about a sixth here.

00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:37.510
But that's all.

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:39.850
And Herman said in his book--
and he was a close friend

00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:40.900
of mine--

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:44.050
he said no one would ever
build a doomsday machine.

00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:48.130
We don't have one now and
no one would build one

00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:49.420
for the following reasons.

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:50.945
And he gave a number of reasons.

00:39:50.945 --> 00:39:51.820
You know, it's cheap.

00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:56.740
Yes, but, it has some defects.

00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:58.420
They were both wrong.

00:39:58.420 --> 00:39:59.830
Teller was wrong.

00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:00.710
Herman was wrong.

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:02.750
Nobody's perfect.

00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:05.650
In fact, we had a
doomsday machine then.

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:08.150
We'd had it for
10 years at least.

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:10.570
And we have it today.

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:13.350
If our current war
plan, the larger ones

00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:16.430
for war with Russia,
not with North Korea,

00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:18.160
but if plans for
Russia [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:22.850
are carried out as
planned, then firestorms

00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:27.900
will be caused on hundreds
of cities, the smoke, which

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:31.327
was not calculated until
1983, in terms of hundreds

00:40:31.327 --> 00:40:32.910
of millions of tons
of smoke-- and all

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:36.540
the references in my book
or easy to get on Google.

00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:42.600
Alan Robock, R-O-B-O-C-K,
and Brian Toon, T-O-O-N.

00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:46.410
Look up their papers, especially
since 2007, confirming that,

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:51.150
even a war between India
and Pakistan using A-bombs,

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:54.420
Nagasaki-type bombs-- that's
all they have, like North Korea,

00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:57.480
not thermonuclear
bombs, not H-bombs--

00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:01.380
using a hundred, of which
they have many more than that,

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:03.810
would cause firestorms
that would put enough smoke

00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:06.300
in the atmosphere
to blot out about 7%

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:09.820
of the Earth's
sunlight globally,

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:14.050
stop harvest, curtail harvest,
shorten growing seasons

00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:16.900
[INAUDIBLE] one, shortening
world food supply

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:19.660
to kill what was first
estimated within a year

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:23.110
to be about a billion
people by starvation

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:25.161
of the most malnourished
people in the world.

00:41:25.161 --> 00:41:26.910
A year later, when
they put in the effects

00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:30.700
of Chinese soybeans, production
and some others, two billion,

00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:37.140
about 1.9 billion people, India
and Pakistan over Kashmir.

00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:40.260
But if US and Russia went
to war, the firestorms here,

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:44.670
which I didn't explain, will
loft smoke and toxic soot,

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:47.490
black soot, into
the stratosphere.

00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:50.950
It takes the updraft of
a special kind of fire

00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:55.800
called a firestorm to cause this
updraft to push the smoke up

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:59.280
into the stratosphere
where it doesn't rain out

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.650
and where it would quickly
go around the globe

00:42:01.650 --> 00:42:05.100
and reduce sunlight
by about 70%,

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:08.880
causing winter-like conditions,
ice age conditions on the Earth

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:14.620
below, ending all harvest
and starving nearly everyone.

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:19.150
Almost, surely, not extinction
because we're so adaptable.

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:22.090
We humans are so clever with
our clothing and our fire

00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:25.510
and our houses, we can
survive this stuff,

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:28.575
some of us, maybe 1%,
maybe less than 1%.

00:42:28.575 --> 00:42:32.260
Well, 1% is 70 million
people, a lot of people.

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:37.210
In Australia, eating fish
and mollusks and whatnot,

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:37.840
it goes on.

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:39.320
We do it all over again.

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:43.030
But 99% of the people would
starve if we carried out

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:46.184
our current war plan.

00:42:46.184 --> 00:42:47.850
And I was just asking
somebody at lunch,

00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:51.480
what is the chance that
we could use little bunker

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:56.610
buster, the bombs, against
a nuclear state like Russia

00:42:56.610 --> 00:43:01.290
or North Korea, being
considered this week,

00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:06.210
and keep it localized
and limited to that?

00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:08.700
Well, the answer
was, not likely.

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:12.230
I asked, if I may, how unlikely?

00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:14.300
Quite unlikely.

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:17.150
And I'm right, about
very, very close to zero.

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:18.740
Nothing is zero.

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:20.600
We've seen, enough
things have happened

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:22.460
that I thought were impossible.

00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:23.180
Nothing is zero.

00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:25.190
But that's very close to zero.

00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:29.320
Now, with North Korea, you
don't get nuclear winter.

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:31.840
There's just not enough
cities there to burn.

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:34.900
And they have only maybe
20 to 60 fission weapons.

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:38.620
Fission weapons will
do the job over there,

00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:40.480
but it's not enough
for nuclear winter.

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:44.260
It's not even enough to
starve one billion people.

00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:47.800
North Korea war is the one war
between two nuclear weapons

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:50.230
states now that doesn't
have the capability

00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:53.770
to starve two billion
people or more, OK?

00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:55.100
But everyone else does.

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:58.120
War over the Ukraine or
Syria, war with Russia,

00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:00.566
if it possibly
escalated to that,

00:44:00.566 --> 00:44:01.690
we have a doomsday machine.

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:03.170
And they do, too.

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:06.650
They are on hair
trigger alert, meaning

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:09.950
that both sides believe that
if there is about to be a war

00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:14.090
or if our tactical warning,
which has often been wrong,

00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:16.580
tells us that an attack
is underway or tells them

00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:21.020
that an attack is underway,
we plan to preempt,

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:23.120
to launch on warning.

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:25.880
That's what Kim Jong
Un proposes to do

00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:27.260
if he's about to be attacked.

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:29.540
That's been open
in his exercises.

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:33.230
Today's news is that we are
contemplating a bloody nose

00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:36.770
for North Korea, an attack
on them which will hopefully

00:44:36.770 --> 00:44:37.340
be limited.

00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:39.410
We hit their missile
base, we hit their safes.

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:40.960
We show them we are determined.

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:42.470
We show them what the risks are.

00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:45.440
And they back off.

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.990
That's what is being
considered by H.R. McMaster,

00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:52.370
supposedly recommended
by him now.

00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:56.330
Now, if I had access
to that document,

00:44:56.330 --> 00:45:01.104
I would put it out now
with the expectation

00:45:01.104 --> 00:45:02.520
that I would go
to prison for life

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:05.570
or that I might be assassinated.

00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:07.910
But to avert that
war seems to be

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:12.350
unquestionably worth my life,
even if my prospective life was

00:45:12.350 --> 00:45:14.000
a lot longer than it is now.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.200
It's the decision I made 40
years ago that I thought even

00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:20.180
to have a very small chance
of shortening that war,

00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:23.150
it was worth getting the
sentence I expected to get,

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:27.010
which was 115 years in prison.

00:45:27.010 --> 00:45:31.480
It's always seemed to me,
obviously, that was worth it.

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:33.832
I'm getting a signal here.

00:45:33.832 --> 00:45:36.940
I've got to end.

00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:38.480
Don't worry. l got you.

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:39.300
I saw you.

00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:45.250
If we had a Snowden or a Chelsea
Manning now at a high level,

00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:47.458
I assume we'd get the-- we
are getting leaks, though,

00:45:47.458 --> 00:45:48.880
more than before.

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:50.522
Why would I want that out?

00:45:50.522 --> 00:45:52.480
Because I think that a
lot of people would say,

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:54.410
that's not a good idea.

00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:55.900
What would we do about it?

00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:57.790
I don't really know.

00:45:57.790 --> 00:46:02.645
With this Congress, if it was a
Democratic Congress confronting

00:46:02.645 --> 00:46:06.280
from, even a Congress as bad as
the Democratic Congress we've

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:08.860
had over the last
10 years or so,

00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:10.750
we'd have a chance
of stopping this.

00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:14.060
I would want to see the public
saying, this must not happen.

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:15.610
It will restart testing.

00:46:15.610 --> 00:46:17.530
It will mean that
India and Pakistan--

00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:19.030
even if North
Korea is wiped out,

00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:20.821
we don't have to worry
about them anymore--

00:46:20.821 --> 00:46:22.690
India and Pakistan,
maybe they start testing

00:46:22.690 --> 00:46:25.090
and have an H-bomb
within a year or two,

00:46:25.090 --> 00:46:30.430
which magnifies their explosive
yield by a factor of 1,000,

00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:33.560
and not good for the world.

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:38.230
France and China increase
their MIRVs and so forth.

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:41.110
The world, I think the chance of
getting back from the doomsday

00:46:41.110 --> 00:46:44.380
machines we have now,
after a war with Korea,

00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:50.370
is, I think, again, close to
zero, not going to happen.

00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:52.230
Why is there so
little opposition?

00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:55.110
Senator Lindsey Graham has
been saying repeatedly now

00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:58.780
on "Meet the Press" and others,
I've told the president,

00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:00.580
and he has said this
to me face-to-face,

00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:04.940
says Lindsey Graham, that,
remember, the casualties will

00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:10.860
all be over there, as
if Kim Jong Un did not

00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:15.780
have any boats with which to put
a nuclear warhead in and send

00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:19.950
them to Los Angeles or San
Francisco harbors as revenge.

00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:22.680
Which I'm, from my experience
on command and control,

00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:24.780
I am virtually
certain that it is not

00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:28.620
possible to paralyze North
Korean nuclear response

00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:31.270
by hitting their
command and control.

00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:33.160
And if the president
doesn't know that,

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:36.060
I hope that my book
gets on "Fox &amp; Friends"

00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:39.950
and just conceivably get
that words through to him.

00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:44.260
So we're facing, in other
words, a terrible crisis

00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:46.420
right away with North
Korea, though it's not

00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:47.900
the end of the world.

00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:50.430
It's just the beginning
of the end of the world.

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:52.444
Because what we have here--

00:47:52.444 --> 00:47:53.860
I'll just close
with this thought.

00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:58.600
It hasn't happened yet.

00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:00.520
So people can look
at the last 70 years

00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:02.590
and say, well, it
wasn't certain.

00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:03.550
That's for sure.

00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:05.220
It was even highly likely.

00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:06.490
That gets to be hard to say.

00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:09.460
I personally think, in fact,
that it was highly likely

00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:12.690
that this blow up and that we've
had something like a miracle.

00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:14.760
And miracles do happen.

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:17.970
It's a miracle that I'm
not in jail right now.

00:48:17.970 --> 00:48:19.050
That's another story.

00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:20.310
But it was not likely.

00:48:20.310 --> 00:48:23.340
It was extremely unlikely
that I would not be in jail.

00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:25.812
It was a miracle that
Nelson Mandela made it

00:48:25.812 --> 00:48:27.020
without a violent revolution.

00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:30.990
It was a miracle that the
Berlin Wall came down,

00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:32.700
all of this before your time.

00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:38.100
Almost even hard to imagine
how impossible that was.

00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:40.860
I don't think I've
ever met a person in,

00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:45.480
let's say, who in 1980, if
asked that the Berlin Wall would

00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:52.054
be down in 1989, that would not
have said, that's impossible.

00:48:52.054 --> 00:48:53.970
If anybody knows of any
contradiction of that,

00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:55.410
it did happen.

00:48:55.410 --> 00:48:57.270
So we can change.

00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:59.170
Change like that can happen.

00:48:59.170 --> 00:49:02.490
I think it has to be as dramatic
as happened in the Soviet

00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:03.840
Union.

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:05.820
It has to be a
change of attitudes,

00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:11.200
as happened in terms of white
majority rule being allowable

00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:13.050
in South Africa.

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:13.950
Is that likely?

00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:15.620
No.

00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:16.490
It's unlikely.

00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:19.210
It's very unlikely.

00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:21.734
But it's not impossible.

00:49:21.734 --> 00:49:23.400
And I think what we're
talking about now

00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:25.771
is the future of
civilization, of humanity.

00:49:25.771 --> 00:49:27.270
It's the kind of
subject that I know

00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:31.670
people here do, think big
about, rightly so, all the time.

00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:34.100
But if you haven't been thinking
about this, which is also

00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:37.280
very possible,
I'd say this, too,

00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:41.450
has to be added to the list
of existential dangers.

00:49:41.450 --> 00:49:44.960
As for climate, somebody
asked me last night

00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:49.720
about artificial intelligence,
germ warfare, whatever.

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:53.000
Our current ready
doomsday machines,

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.660
which are about
to be refurbished

00:49:56.660 --> 00:50:00.680
at the expense of
$1.5 trillion--

00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:03.770
strictly $1.2 trillion, but
they say, with inflation,

00:50:03.770 --> 00:50:07.850
really $1.6 trillion
over the next 30 years--

00:50:07.850 --> 00:50:11.000
and in Russia,
where using it would

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.990
be just as insane as here--

00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:16.580
and it would have
been and almost came

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:18.920
close to happening
several times in the past.

00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:22.030
And you would not be here
and I would not be here.

00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:25.730
I participated in the
Cuban Missile Crisis.

00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:27.890
I was wrong about nearly
everything involved,

00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:30.650
as was everybody
dealing with me.

00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:32.210
And if my own
instincts, like those

00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:35.690
of JFK's initial instincts
to attack those missiles--

00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:39.590
I wasn't precisely on that, but
I was ready to see it happen--

00:50:39.590 --> 00:50:43.900
had been followed,
we would not be here.

00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:46.370
Doomsday would have
resulted from any time

00:50:46.370 --> 00:50:50.300
since about 1950, when
Harry Truman left Eisenhower

00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:54.080
with 1,000 fission weapons.

00:50:54.080 --> 00:51:00.140
Eisenhower left office and left
Kennedy 23,000 thermonuclear

00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:05.260
weapons, which Kennedy and
Johnson raised to 37,000,

00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:08.410
at a time when Herb York, the
director of Livermore Labs,

00:51:08.410 --> 00:51:10.450
used to say, how
many weapons does it

00:51:10.450 --> 00:51:14.320
take to deter a nuclear
attack against an enemy

00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:16.760
rational enough to be deterred?

00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:18.070
One.

00:51:18.070 --> 00:51:26.166
Or if that's not enough, 10,
but closer to 10 or 1 than 100.

00:51:26.166 --> 00:51:27.770
37,000.

00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:31.340
We've cut that way down
now, to about 4,000 each.

00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:35.470
It takes several hundred
to cause nuclear winter.

00:51:35.470 --> 00:51:38.470
So we're in a galaxy
now that may not

00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:42.280
have a very long history
as far as human habitation

00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:45.700
is concerned, except for
a very small remnant.

00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:49.810
And that's the
challenge here that I

00:51:49.810 --> 00:51:55.630
add to your global ambitions,
to try to dismantle the doomsday

00:51:55.630 --> 00:52:00.220
machines on earth and to
move toward what Trump calls

00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:02.460
the world coming to its senses.

00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:03.814
Thank you.

00:52:03.814 --> 00:52:06.299
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:14.251
I've used up the time here.

00:52:14.251 --> 00:52:16.260
I know a lot of you
have to go to work.

00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:19.710
I can stay longer,
until even 2:20 or so.

00:52:19.710 --> 00:52:23.575
And there's a few more
minutes, even formally--

00:52:23.575 --> 00:52:24.141
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:52:24.141 --> 00:52:25.140
Thank you for your talk.

00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:28.260
It was extremely cheery.

00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:31.200
Do you see anything
actionable that people

00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:34.440
who already have careers and
can't exactly immediately jump

00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:39.210
into civil service can
do to impact any of this?

00:52:39.210 --> 00:52:41.070
DANIEL ELLSBERG: Yeah,
could you hear that?

00:52:41.070 --> 00:52:43.830
I have to go up to hear it.

00:52:43.830 --> 00:52:46.070
You know, I have to say
that the first thing, you're

00:52:46.070 --> 00:52:47.861
talking to people who
already have careers,

00:52:47.861 --> 00:52:50.060
have civil service and so forth.

00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:52.930
I was asked this question
just the other day

00:52:52.930 --> 00:52:54.980
by an Italian journalist,
it so happens.

00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:59.740
And my real answer is leak.

00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:02.440
It's actually, don't
just tell your bosses

00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:05.860
what you know that you think
the public ought to know.

00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:07.870
Don't leave it to
your bosses to decide

00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:10.120
what the public should know.

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:12.490
Be prepared to
reveal that yourself.

00:53:12.490 --> 00:53:13.870
Do it anonymously.

00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:16.810
Cover your tracks, if you
can put out enough that way

00:53:16.810 --> 00:53:18.460
to make the point.

00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:20.320
Chelsea Manning
and Ed Snowden knew

00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:23.080
they couldn't put out enough
to make their point without,

00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:27.550
in effect, either revealing
themselves or pointing

00:53:27.550 --> 00:53:29.400
the finger of
suspicion at others.

00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:33.220
So like myself, they determined
they would say who had done it.

00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:33.970
That's what I did.

00:53:33.970 --> 00:53:36.050
I didn't want others
to be blamed for it.

00:53:36.050 --> 00:53:40.660
But I would say that should
not be kept within channels.

00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:43.720
We're in a situation
now where sharing

00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:47.810
that wrongly-held information
is of the highest importance.

00:53:47.810 --> 00:53:50.830
And so I'm talking to an
audience now here, unusually,

00:53:50.830 --> 00:53:54.580
which will be or is in a
chance to actually make

00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:56.920
that kind of difference,
generally not.

00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:58.900
But for many years,
I didn't talk

00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:01.570
about whistleblowing at all
when I talked about activism.

00:54:01.570 --> 00:54:05.200
For 40 years, I spent my
time not writing this book

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:07.180
but trying to build
an anti-war movement,

00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:08.740
an anti-nuclear
movement, that would

00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:11.290
be like the anti-war movement
that had helped end the Vietnam

00:54:11.290 --> 00:54:15.190
War, with some success during
the Freeze Movement, though it,

00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:19.259
in the end, didn't change
this arms race significantly.

00:54:19.259 --> 00:54:20.800
It only lowered the
number of weapons

00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:26.522
by 80%, which made no difference
at all, no difference.

00:54:26.522 --> 00:54:27.730
There would be no difference.

00:54:27.730 --> 00:54:29.104
If the war occurred,
you wouldn't

00:54:29.104 --> 00:54:32.080
tell whether it had been done
with 8,000 weapons or 40,000

00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:33.220
weapons.

00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:35.590
If there was somebody alive
to decide and try to tell,

00:54:35.590 --> 00:54:37.610
they wouldn't be able
to tell the difference.

00:54:37.610 --> 00:54:39.200
So that didn't work.

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:41.150
But I didn't talk about
whistleblowing much,

00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:42.910
mainly because people
I was talking to

00:54:42.910 --> 00:54:44.890
would not have a
chance to put that out,

00:54:44.890 --> 00:54:47.057
but also because it
seemed self-serving.

00:54:47.057 --> 00:54:48.640
And then I thought
of a way to say it,

00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:52.050
which I have been saying
and I'll say for 10 years.

00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:54.760
Don't do what I did.

00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:59.260
Don't wait till the bombs are
falling or thousands of people

00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:03.280
more have died if you
have information that

00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:07.970
could avert these catastrophes.

00:55:07.970 --> 00:55:12.110
No matter the cost
to yourself, consider

00:55:12.110 --> 00:55:13.730
paying that cost to put it out.

00:55:13.730 --> 00:55:18.950
Because a war's worth
of lives is at stake.

00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:20.290
AUDIENCE: In 1983--

00:55:20.290 --> 00:55:22.989
I think it was 1983-- there was
a movie called "The Day After"

00:55:22.989 --> 00:55:24.280
starring John Lithgow, set in--

00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:25.196
DANIEL ELLSBERG: Yeah.

00:55:25.196 --> 00:55:27.772
AUDIENCE: --Manhattan, Kansas
after nuclear war with Russia.

00:55:27.772 --> 00:55:30.230
It is said that this movie was
screened by the Joint Chiefs

00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:32.605
a day or two before it was
actually shown on broadcast TV

00:55:32.605 --> 00:55:34.880
and that, prior to this, the
Joint Chiefs had operated

00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:37.820
under the idea that nuclear
war was quote, winnable,

00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:40.390
that there is this concept
of minimal acceptable losses

00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:42.320
and that this movie
changed their mind.

00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:44.690
Do you agree with
this, disagree?

00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:48.300
Has the war planning at the
top about acceptable losses

00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:49.164
evolved over time?

00:55:49.164 --> 00:55:49.830
Or is it still--

00:55:49.830 --> 00:55:50.375
DANIEL ELLSBERG: OK.

00:55:50.375 --> 00:55:50.810
AUDIENCE: --screwed
up like it was--

00:55:50.810 --> 00:55:52.268
DANIEL ELLSBERG:
You can hear that?

00:55:52.268 --> 00:55:54.090
I hear it with difficulty.

00:55:54.090 --> 00:55:57.360
I've never heard before that
the Joint Chiefs saw it before,

00:55:57.360 --> 00:55:58.100
during, or after.

00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:00.590
I've never heard the Joint
Chiefs connected with it.

00:56:00.590 --> 00:56:02.870
Did the Joint Chiefs
believe it was winnable?

00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:05.990
Yes, the way they thought
Vietnam was winnable.

00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:09.050
In other words, in a virtually,
literally meaningless way.

00:56:09.050 --> 00:56:11.990
They always talked about
prevailing, about winning.

00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:14.330
There were years when they
didn't so much and then

00:56:14.330 --> 00:56:16.120
other years they did prevail.

00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:17.930
What does prevail mean?

00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:20.720
I think it was Weinberger
who said at one point,

00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:23.800
it's a word that sounds
better than the opposite,

00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:25.190
than not doing, not prevailing.

00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:27.260
But what does it mean?

00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:30.500
If it meant anything, it
meant reducing the damage

00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:34.160
that the other side is
capable of doing to you, OK?

00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:37.610
So if you get rid of
their land-based missiles,

00:56:37.610 --> 00:56:40.730
they still will have enough
submarine-based missiles

00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:44.180
to destroy our society, but
they won't have the land base.

00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:46.900
So that's worth doing, isn't it?

00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:50.740
Well, no, you know, it isn't.

00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:52.050
So why are you doing this?

00:56:52.050 --> 00:56:54.850
Why are you talking about
renewing our land-based ICBMs,

00:56:54.850 --> 00:56:56.710
which are totally
vulnerable to attack,

00:56:56.710 --> 00:56:59.440
in order to get their land-based
ICBMs, which are totally

00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:01.750
vulnerable to attack?

00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:04.150
Because Lockheed
Martin makes them.

00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:08.950
There's jobs, profits,
local real estate.

00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:11.710
The weapons have to be on
hot alert, not soft alert,

00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:14.680
around the clock,
so that we can sell

00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:18.910
more restaurant food or
whatever the hell else in North

00:57:18.910 --> 00:57:21.280
Dakota and Wyoming and Montana.

00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:24.190
There is no strategic
rationale for them, whatever.

00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:26.500
But that's enough.

00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:29.650
So the Joint Chiefs were not,
I think, as far as I know,

00:57:29.650 --> 00:57:31.460
not affected by that at all.

00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:33.100
And if you pressed
them as whether they

00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:35.320
could win more than what
I've just described,

00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:36.370
they would say, no.

00:57:36.370 --> 00:57:37.420
But that's something.

00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:39.710
We've got to do something,
not just nothing.

00:57:39.710 --> 00:57:44.140
And that was, in
effect, silliness.

00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:45.820
Of course, it's the
kind of silliness

00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:47.980
that may doom our species.

00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:50.330
And it's not only
in this country.

00:57:50.330 --> 00:57:53.260
However, the movie
"The Day After"

00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:56.180
was shown to Ronald Reagan.

00:57:56.180 --> 00:57:57.580
And it did have a big effect.

00:57:57.580 --> 00:58:00.280
He couldn't go into the
office at all the next day.

00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:03.100
He said he stayed in
bed and he felt sick.

00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:05.890
And that it very much
affected his mind when he went

00:58:05.890 --> 00:58:09.950
into discussions with Gorbachev
of ending all nuclear weapons,

00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:14.170
ballistic missiles of all kinds,
which didn't happen because he

00:58:14.170 --> 00:58:18.580
had the crazy belief of an
umbrella-like Strategic Defense

00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:19.540
Initiative, SDI--

00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:22.810
Star Wars-- that would
protect us entirely

00:58:22.810 --> 00:58:25.490
and he wasn't
willing to give up.

00:58:25.490 --> 00:58:27.437
He wasn't willing
to give that up

00:58:27.437 --> 00:58:28.770
and couldn't get that agreement.

00:58:28.770 --> 00:58:29.561
That's another one.

00:58:29.561 --> 00:58:31.330
So it had an effect on Reagan.

00:58:31.330 --> 00:58:32.770
Gorbachev, meanwhile,
had already

00:58:32.770 --> 00:58:34.480
been influenced by
nuclear weapons.

00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:39.460
And, by the way, "The Day After"
is just a tiny, little sliver

00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:42.190
of what the actual
consequences of a nuclear war

00:58:42.190 --> 00:58:44.080
would look like.

00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:47.350
Movies that have come
closer to that, there's one

00:58:47.350 --> 00:58:49.780
called "Threads" in England
that they've never allowed

00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:52.550
to be on BBC, to be shown.

00:58:52.550 --> 00:58:54.490
And again, it
really just focuses

00:58:54.490 --> 00:58:57.680
on the long-term degradation
and disintegration

00:58:57.680 --> 00:59:01.450
of everything, like Cormac
McCarthy's "The Road,"

00:59:01.450 --> 00:59:02.170
pretty much.

00:59:02.170 --> 00:59:06.010
So no nuclear
state has ever been

00:59:06.010 --> 00:59:08.890
willing to tell its
own people or to hold

00:59:08.890 --> 00:59:14.010
others accountable to the risks
we are posing over their head.

00:59:14.010 --> 00:59:18.910
And a movie like that today
would be very worthwhile.

00:59:18.910 --> 00:59:21.825
But I don't know what
prospect there is of it.

00:59:21.825 --> 00:59:23.200
AUDIENCE: And,
once again, please

00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:25.450
say thank you to
Mr. Daniel Ellsberg.

00:59:25.450 --> 00:59:26.950
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:28.450
DANIEL ELLSBERG: That's OK.

00:59:28.450 --> 00:59:30.300
Thank you.
