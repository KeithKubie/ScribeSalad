so maybe it's been the saving grace of
 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:08.210
so maybe it's been the saving grace of
literature to be so conservative but

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220
literature to be so conservative but
 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.030
literature to be so conservative but
maybe it it will contribute to its death

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040
maybe it it will contribute to its death
