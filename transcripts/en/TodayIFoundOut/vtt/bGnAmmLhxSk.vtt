00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.540
What if we told you that around 90 years ago
an epidemic swept across the world that killed

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.790
over a million people while affecting numerous
others, before disappearing, leaving the finest

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:32.700
scientific minds of the age absolutely stumped
. Then what if we told you that when it didn’t

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.040
kill you, this illness could instead potentially
trap you inside your body, stopping you from

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.800
having the will to move or speak.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.700
You’d say we’d have to be lying because
no disease that terrifying could stalk the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.210
Earth and have resulted in such an epidemic
without being front-page news and remembered

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.579
in the history books.

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.360
Well, it did exist and cases continue to be
brought forward even today; it remained one

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.900
of the biggest medical mysteries for nearly
a century, with scientists only very recently

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.570
getting an inkling of what causes the disease,
though none of the leading theories have been

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.960
definitively proven yet.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.119
As you might expect from this, there is still
no cure.

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.990
Ladies and gentlemen, today we’d like to
talk about von Economo disease.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.040
As you’ve probably guessed if you’re fantastically
well read, von Economo disease is named after

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.440
someone named von Economo- Constantin von
Economo- a psychiatrist, neurologist, and

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.950
one-time owner of a magnificent moustache,
who is widely credited as the first person

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.930
to thoroughly document the disease in question.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.319
Economo published his findings on the disease
in April of 1917, just a few short years before

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:42.800
it became an epidemic, but several years after
it had first come to the attention of academics

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.729
and medical professionals.

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.680
In his paper, aptly named “Die Encephalitis
lethargica“, Economo christened this new

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.500
disease, Encephalitis lethargica, which means
something along the lines of “brain illness

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.760
that makes you sleepy”.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.310
Today, the disease is mostly known as von
Economo disease, in Economo’s honor, and

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.420
Sleepy Sickness when someone doesn’t wish
to pay homage to Economo’s glorious facial

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.520
hair.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.600
As a neurologist, the disease was of particular
interest to Economo and he discovered variations

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.010
on how the disease manifests including, among
other presentations,

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.620
• Hyperkinetic form: characterised by rapid
motor movements, uncontrollable twitching,

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.060
anxiousness, insominia and general restlessness.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.340
• Amyostatic-akinetic form: leading to symptoms
remarkably similar to that of Parkinsons disease

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.370
and was characterised by dramatic reduction
in muscle strength and difficulty moving.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.500
• Somnolent-ophthalmoplegic form: by far
the most lethal and involved the patient suddenly

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.610
falling asleep at random times, even while
walking.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.250
In some, this would progress into the individual
slipping into an often fatal comatose state.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.000
However, those who didn’t die quickly could
be left with an arguably worse fate, potentially

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.530
in a state of akinetic mutism, lacking the
will to move or express themselves in any

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.890
way for the rest of their lives.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.210
A few years after Economo’s discovery and
paper, the disease was part of an epidemic

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.260
that swept across the world trapping many
thousands in their own bodies and killing

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.980
about a million total.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.370
In the end, approximately 40% of those affected
died, 20% survived but were invalids, 26%

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.610
mostly recovered but with long term issues,
and the remaining 14% made full recoveries.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.900
So with it affecting so many, why have you
never heard of it?

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.910
Well, the disease had amazing timing in that
it spread across the world around the same

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.530
time as the Spanish Flu pandemic.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.350
For those of you who aren’t familiar with
it, the Spanish flu killed between 50-100

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.120
million (yes, million) people and infected
around a half a billion around the globe (roughly

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.100
1 in 4 humans at the time and possibly killing
as many as 1 in 20); it even reached places

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.780
as remote as the Arctic in-between 1918 and
1920.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.230
So, even though Encephalitis Lethargica killed
its fair share of people and was hugely terrifying

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.370
in its own right, because it took place just
after a disease that affected a reasonably

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.530
large percentage of the world’s population,
it just wasn’t as noteworthy compared to

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.990
the super-disease that had just punched humanity
in our collective nether regions.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.740
Due to their close proximity to each other,
the Spanish flu was initially linked to the

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.350
Encephalitis Lethargica outbreak, a theory
modern medical science thinks isn’t likely

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.160
though there are still some who think there
may have been a connection, via an autoimmune

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.720
response killing certain neurons in the brain.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.600
However, given the lack of similarities between
the two in terms of systems effected, with

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.880
the only solid connection being they appeared
around the same time, most still think the

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.210
Spanish flu was not related.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.960
That said, it does appear to be an immune
system response causing the problem.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.710
In 2004, virologist John Oxford et al published
a paper on the results of their studying over

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.219
20 current patients with the disease and found
a similarity.

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:51.990
55% of them were known to have had sore throats
before the disease started more strongly presenting.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.590
They then discovered that the sore throat
in every case had been caused by a rare form

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.129
of streptococcus (for you hypochondriacs out
there, try not to dwell on that one next time

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:01.599
you get strep-throat ;-)).

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:06.330
This rare form of streptococcus resulted in
a particularly strong immune system reaction,

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.499
which in turn resulted in the patient’s
immune system attacking certain parts of the

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:13.759
their brains, with the result being von Economo
disease.

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:18.150
Once the researchers discovered this, the
Holmes-like doctors checked and, sure enough,

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.080
the records indicated that during the early
20th century epidemic many of the patients

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.910
also reported sore throats before the disease
presented.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.219
The eureka moment, though, came when they
found a reference that diplococcus microbes

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:36.000
had been documented among some of the patients-
a form of streptococcus.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.419
So while it still hasn’t been definitively
proven, evidence strongly suggests that this

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:42.509
is the cause of the disease.

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:46.840
As mentioned, there was (and still is) no
actual cure or very effective treatment for

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.939
the disease, so after its reign of terror
was largely over around 1926, the world was

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:56.460
left with a far more pressing problem- the
thousands of living paper-weights the disease

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.199
hadn’t killed, still alive across the globe
and in a catatonic state.

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:04.779
That said, in patients suffering from the
hyper-kinectic form of the disease, certain

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:09.529
steroids have proven partially effective in
small studies and have been put forward as

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:11.400
a suggested course of treatment.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.400
However, the fate of those trapped in their
own bodies is a lot less treatable, though

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.449
since the disease is similar in some ways
to Parkinsons, treatments for it have proven

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:21.439
somewhat effective in the past.

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:26.289
For example, in the 1960s, patients from the
original outbreak were granted small movement

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:30.849
for the first time in decades upon taking
the drug Levodopa; however, as a cruel twist

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:34.949
of fate, after only a few weeks of “waking
up,” the patients treated with the drug

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:39.599
developed a tolerance to it and slowly slipped
back into their paper-weight states.

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:43.059
If that sounds like a familiar plot-line,
it’s because the event was turned into a

00:06:43.059 --> 00:06:47.660
book and later a movie called “Awakenings”
which was remarkably similar to the actual

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.080
events that occurred all those years ago with
these von Economo patients.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.919
In the end, the disease is still around and
an outbreak of 1920s-like proportions is fully

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:13.870
possible today- and us still without a cure.
