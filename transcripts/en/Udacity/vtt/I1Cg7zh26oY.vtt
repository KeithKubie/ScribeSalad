00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.730
Well the first thing I'm
going to do to get two and

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.400
a half gallons of milk
is buy the two gallons.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.593
Then I still have a half
gallon left to buy.

00:00:07.593 --> 00:00:10.450
I'm going to write that as 0.5
gallons that I want to buy.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.440
And obviously I can't buy another
gallon of milk, that'd be too much,

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.840
and I said I can have any left over,
so I need to buy quarts.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.830
So I'm going to multiply
by my conversion factor,

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.730
which is four quarts over one gallon.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.710
I see an opportunity to simplify,
and then I have 0.5 x 4.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.820
My unit is quarts, and so
I should buy two quarts.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.510
Two gallons and two quarts.
