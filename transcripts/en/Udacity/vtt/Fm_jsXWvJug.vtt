00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:03.138
&gt;&gt; Hey Christian, finished.

00:00:03.138 --> 00:00:04.080
&gt;&gt; Indeed.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.495
&gt;&gt; Congratulations. You're at the end of the course.

00:00:06.495 --> 00:00:09.880
&gt;&gt; You've now learned a lot of concepts through the last

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.110
three projects, and taken the first steps to being a designer.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.750
&gt;&gt; So let me do a quick summary of what we've gone over in this course. First

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.710
of all there were six fundamental design principles, and

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.120
that lead. To the gulf of execution, the gulf

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.620
of evaluation, which led to seven questions that

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.460
people ask as they try to use something.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.620
Those seven questions, the ones that crossed the

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.140
two gulfs, illustrate the important role of designers, which

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.820
is to communicate. Communicate the conceptual model they

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.450
have to the person who's going to use

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.160
the product. How do you do the communication?

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.910
Well it's via the product itself, the system image.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.420
So how do you cross that gap? Well, the tools are very

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.040
simple. It's affordances and signifiers and

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.250
conceptual models, and that's the whole course.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.470
&gt;&gt; Through these three projects, you've learned a lot of techniques that are

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.830
really powerful. You've learned to go and observe the world, you've learned to

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.010
create invitations such as with the

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.710
queue. And with user interface, well, screens

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:12.740
are all around us. So you've

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.500
learned some powerful techniques like idea generation,

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.648
rapid prototyping and user evaluation. You can take that, you can get better at

00:01:19.648 --> 00:01:23.530
those things, you can learn more, you can build and you can change the world.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:24.410
&gt;&gt; Hey, Christian.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.190
&gt;&gt; Hey, Don. Oh thank you, you found it.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.770
&gt;&gt; Have a box.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.885
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:27.885 --> 00:01:28.410
&gt;&gt; Excellent.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.800
&gt;&gt; Congratulations.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.920
&gt;&gt; Hey, congratulations to you, too.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.100
&gt;&gt; I enjoyed making this course.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.940
&gt;&gt; I enjoyed it, too.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.860
&gt;&gt; You know, I hope you enjoyed it just as much as we did.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.370
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Is that my gift? You brought it!

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.040
&gt;&gt; Well yeah.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.270
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Thank you, now I'm going to find out what it is.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.060
Oh you shouldn't have. No seriously you shouldn't have.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.390
&gt;&gt; But I did.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:02:00.648
&gt;&gt; It's empty [LAUGH].
