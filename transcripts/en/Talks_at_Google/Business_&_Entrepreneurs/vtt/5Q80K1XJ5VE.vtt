ZAINAN ZHOU: Hi, everyone.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.440
Thank you all for coming
to today's Fireside Chat

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.510
with Craig Newmark.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.570
This event is part of a
Talks at Google program,

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.720
and today's Fireside Chat
is hosted by a Google

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.030
internal community called
Wikipedians at Google.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.530
Thank you all for being here.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.440
My name is Zainan Zhou.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.190
Today's Dory is
open at [INAUDIBLE],,

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.120
and I already added some of
the questions from the RSVP.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.560
Please feel free
to use that link

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.420
to add your questions and vote.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.130
We're super happy here to have
well-renowned entrepreneur

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.070
and philanthropist, Mr. Craig
Newmark, founder of Craigslist

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.170
and Craig Newmark Foundation.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.200
Craig is born in
1952 in New Jersey

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.140
and moved to San
Francisco around 1990.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.020
Around 1995, he
started a mailing list,

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.920
which ultimately turned
into craigslist.org,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.900
one of the world's
most successful

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.920
online classified
advertisement websites.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.130
Nowadays, he focuses more on
philanthropy efforts with Craig

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.210
Newmark Foundation and hasn't
been involved in management

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.120
since 2000.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.190
While he caught himself doing
some lightweight customer

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.130
service.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.790
Please welcome Craig.

00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:31.840
CRAIG NEWMARK: Folks, thanks.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.660
And I really do wear
kangol hats like this,

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.060
but it's too warm in here now.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.560
Yeah.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.900
What I'd like to
do is speak a bit

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.250
about founding
Craigslist, why I did it.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.560
I'll talk a little bit
more about the technology

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.100
than I normally do,
given the audience.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.760
I'm going to talk about the
philanthropic philosophy I

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.710
developed without
consciously thinking

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.540
about it along those lines.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.540
And I'm going to talk
about the philanthropy I'm

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.660
engaged with right now,
including connections

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.889
to Wikipedia, and
also to something

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:15.180
called Google News because
I'm actually highly involved

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.990
with that.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.760
In fact, I'll just
begin by saying,

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.570
so I don't forget that, Google
News folks are doing really

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.360
good, really important
work, particularly

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.450
involving the countering
of disinformation.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.630
That includes-- trying
to get the names right--

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:37.220
Richard Gingras, Steve Grove,
Erica Anderson, and Olivia Ma.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.260
I'm probably missing some
names, but those are the ones

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.850
that come to mind immediately.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.580
So I may repeat a little
bit more about that.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.970
But something I mentioned ahead
too is I spent 17 years at IBM.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.910
And I saw frequently,
especially in the field,

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:01.147
people were not given credit for
stuff they did, so I overdo it.

00:03:01.147 --> 00:03:02.980
I spent a couple of
years at Charles Schwab,

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.730
for that matter, going around
the company at lunch things,

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.640
telling people that the internet
would be a thing someday.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.920
This was '94 mostly.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.120
And the guy who started the web
at Charles Schwab, a guy named

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.570
Darius Milewski,
has been forgotten,

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.430
except that I keep bringing his
name up at things like this.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.900
Keep track of time
for me because I

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.660
don't want to go crazy with it.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.120
My deal is that I am a
nerd of the old school.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.800
Born in the early '50s, grew
up through the '50s and '60s.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.100
There's a stereotype about a
guy who wears a plastic pocket

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.490
protector, thick black
glasses taped together,

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.710
and no social skills.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.500
That was me,
completely literally.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.790
In high school,
two times, I really

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.560
had my thick black
glasses broken,

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.580
and I tried taping them together
until I got replacements.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.270
No social skills.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.600
And even now, what
you see before you is

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.570
a simulation of social skills.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.130
And I can do that for about
90 minutes, after which things

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.920
start going south.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.059
I become cranky.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.240
My deal was that I got a couple
of degrees in computer sciences

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.030
at Case Western, Case Tech
in the mid-'70s, although I

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:33.160
learned coding in high school
in 1969 using punch cards,

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.050
Fortran II, and an IBM 1620.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.770
I feel like I should make
it your homework assignment

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.490
to look up all three,
but you'll be frightened.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.340
However, I can assure
you that the 1620 was

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.230
from that generation
of computers

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.610
which had the blinkety lights.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.480
And it literally did
have the blinkety lights.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.180
And I kind of miss that.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.170
Not that I'm going to
be searching surplus

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.870
for one of those.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.260
It was about the size
of a player piano.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.590
Anyway, after some point,
I decide to leave BMI.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.210
I get myself hired by Charles
Schwab, who brings me to San

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.320
Francisco, which I appreciate.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.790
And I had a lot of help
from people around town

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.180
on the net,
newsgroups, the WELL,

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.690
helping me with
neighborhoods around town,

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.680
helping me with restaurants
and how to get around.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.350
This was pretty good.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.330
So early '95 rolls
around, and I'm

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.250
leaving Charles
Schwab at the time,

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.620
but I'm thinking I
should give back.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.170
So I start a simple
mailing list.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.150
And basically what it is is
I'm using a very advanced email

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.160
tool back in '95 called Pine.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.880
And I figure it's
just a cc list--

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.980
10, 12 people to start with.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.950
Events that involve
arts or technology.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:01.180
And then people tell
me about more stuff,

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.650
and I do more stuff.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.170
People start asking me
to do different things,

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.430
and I go along with that.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:12.820
But about the middle of
'95, the cc list stuff

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.650
had about 250 addresses, breaks.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.540
And I need to use a listserver.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.790
Somebody volunteers majordomo.

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.860
And as an old school
nerd, I'm very literal.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.250
So I'll call it San
Francisco Events.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.830
People around me, though,
are smarter than me.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.070
They say, we already
call it Craigslist.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.300
Keep calling it that.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.110
It signifies it.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.840
It will be personal and quirky.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.290
And then they explain
to me what a brand is.

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.790
Seriously.

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.050
I didn't know.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.230
Those of you in marketing
should have cause to mock me.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:49.810
But anyway, I
learned what it is.

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:52.420
I was 42 at the time.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:58.200
And that made a lot of sense
to me, so it's Craigslist.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.080
I just kept plugging away for
a few years all by myself.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.150
One interesting thing in '97
was that job posters asked me

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.120
to charge them for their ads.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.581
ZAINAN ZHOU: Why?

00:07:11.581 --> 00:07:14.080
CRAIG NEWMARK: They thought
they were getting better results

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:19.480
in the list, better results than
paying expensive headhunters

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.750
or whatever to help
them get people.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:27.910
So I figured a philosophy might
be to charge people for ads--

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:29.830
people who already
paid for ads--

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:34.660
but to charge them much less
money for more effective ads.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.390
And that's a practice
we continue to this day.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:42.430
The site is almost all free,
but we do charge for ads,

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:46.110
specifically at times
to minimize abuse.

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:48.370
Like in New York
apartment brokers--

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:50.710
in Manhattan, the New
York apartment brokers

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:53.662
can really damage people.

00:07:53.662 --> 00:07:55.370
At the very last
minute, they'll tell you

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:59.980
there's a big commission on an
apartment, and that's not OK.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:03.140
And speaking to them, we made
a little dent in the problem,

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.560
but I'm getting way
ahead of myself.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.900
And in '97 also, at that
point, we were hitting,

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:13.760
or I was hitting, about a
million page views per month,

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.560
which at the end of '97,
for a one person operation,

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.600
pretty good.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.860
And also Microsoft Sidewalk,
an obsolete city site,

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:29.360
wanted to run banner ads,
but I dislike banner ads.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.590
Many of them, I think,
are just kind of stupid.

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:38.690
So I just decided that I'm
living comfortably enough.

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:41.049
I don't need the extra income.

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:46.720
That grew into the lesson that
I was calling nerd values.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.090
If you make enough money
to live comfortably

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.580
and then to help your
family, maybe some friends

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:57.110
live comfortably, then it's more
satisfying to change the world.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:00.490
And that's our
philosophy to date.

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:04.120
But people are also
suggesting that I run

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.340
the site on a volunteer basis.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.510
That's what happened in '98.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.820
Even back then things were easy.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.690
I recently saw a credit
card bill from back then,

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:19.020
and I was running
Craigslist on something

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:23.770
called Best Internet Services,
which is all gone now.

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:24.737
But I was running the--

00:09:24.737 --> 00:09:26.320
ZAINAN ZHOU: That
was the name, right?

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:26.490
CRAIG NEWMARK: Sorry?

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:28.290
ZAINAN ZHOU: Best
Internet Services.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:28.780
That was the brand?

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.071
CRAIG NEWMARK: That's the name.

00:09:30.071 --> 00:09:34.090
They got bought by someone who
was bought by someone else.

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:40.480
But I was paying $35 a month
for hosting services back then.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.740
And sometime in
that frame, before I

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.050
used the services of
volunteers, I was thinking,

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:50.540
well, I'm using Pine.

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:58.000
I, at one point, realized Pine
can output an email into a Perl

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.760
script.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.460
Perl was hot then.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:07.230
And I figured, well, I can
write some simple code, which

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:09.540
extracts the email
headers because they're

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:13.660
pretty predictable, and I
would have instant HTML pages,

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:16.830
therefore instant
publishing, and that's

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:18.360
how our site was born.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.880
I think that was late
'96, but I don't remember.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:26.580
This was all a hobby, and
I wasn't taking notes.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:31.620
So when '98 rolls around, I try
writing things with volunteers.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:36.570
And to say a lot in a few words,
some of the job posters who

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:38.970
wanted to pay me, who
started off like a year

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:44.170
before, they approached me and
said things were not working.

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:47.530
And they said if I wanted
Craigslist to survive,

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:51.550
I had to go full time, make
it into a real company.

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:54.710
And they were right.

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:57.290
'99, I had to make
tough decisions,

00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:00.410
like, how much to monetize.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:04.670
And again, I was thinking, you
know, that nerd values thing.

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:07.130
And I was thinking even
from Sunday school,

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:13.080
Mr. And Mrs. Levin taught me
to think, how much is enough?

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.730
And in my case, not
too much is enough.

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:18.920
I do indulge myself
in some ways.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:23.420
I buy all the books I
want and things like that,

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:26.660
but I don't go
crazy with things.

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:30.050
And I just gave up my
old Prius, 15 years old,

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:36.850
to a brother-in-law who has
three kids who are driving now.

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:39.800
I have a feeling I may wind
up regretting my decision.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.190
And I have my eye on
the Chevy Volt, which

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:44.320
is a good electric
car, and it has

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.150
a lot of electronics
on it, which

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:50.530
I could fool around with
and possibly injure myself.

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:52.720
So there I am.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:57.160
These guys say I should
start my own company.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.800
And by then, even I had
lots of parties and stuff.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:05.650
I talked to bankers
and VCs in this area,

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:07.660
and they're telling
me, hey, I should

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.600
monetize the usual
Silicon Valley way,

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.160
and they will be
putting billions

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.050
of dollars on the table.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:17.310
The answer again is,
how much do you need?

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:20.140
Now that I've done a
lot of philanthropy,

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:23.320
I can see having some
billions to give away.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.590
That would be pretty cool.

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:29.430
But I also think about
the philanthropic model

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:32.730
of the robber barons
who would acquire

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:34.590
the equivalent of billions.

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:38.070
They would acquire it by
abusing their employees

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:39.870
and their customers,
and then they

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:42.960
would give back a
little bit of it,

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:46.120
you know, decades
after the fact.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.840
So instead I'm thinking,
what Craigslist

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:52.920
is about is helping people
put food on the table.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:58.140
It's helping people find a
table on which to put the food.

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:01.860
And then Craigslist is about
finding a roof under which

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.950
to put the table with the food.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:08.130
And so there's this
philanthropic motto

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:09.720
I've accidentally
come up with, which

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:14.730
is let someone try to put food
on the table, keep the money

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:17.540
they would otherwise
spend in advertising.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:21.680
And that's a much more
cost efficient model

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.450
for philanthropy.

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:27.350
And so said in fewest
words, the business model

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:30.110
is doing well by doing good.

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:33.110
And that worked out pretty well.

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:36.230
I tried running the company
myself for about a year,

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:39.710
and then some of the
same people approached me

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:44.880
and helped me understand
that as a manager I suck.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:49.460
I'm emotionally
unsuited to the hardest

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:54.470
of management activities,
like, hiring and firing people.

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:56.600
I'm just not tough.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.950
Hired a Jim Buckmaster
to do the job.

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:01.520
That's worked.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:06.110
And I figured around then
I stopped programming.

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:10.010
Because at some
point around then,

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:13.490
we had hired a whole cadre
of programmers, all of whom

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:15.530
smarter than me.

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:18.320
But I saw a need for
myself to go full time

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.050
in customer service because
another Sunday school

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:24.940
lesson was treat people
like you want to be treated.

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:30.220
And in business, that means
have serious customer service,

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.150
and you do the best you can.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:36.080
It's challenging when
your site is mostly free,

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.720
and that's probably
an unsolvable problem

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.940
in some regards.

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:45.230
But that's what we were trying--

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:49.640
and turned it over to
Jim, did customer service

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.075
for a long time.

00:14:51.075 --> 00:14:53.810
The thing is in
customer service online,

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:58.820
you may have heard that you see
some things that you can never

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.070
unsee.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:03.710
You know, I have seen a
certain amount of ugliness.

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:07.580
I've seen far more good, but
the ugliness can get to you.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.280
And that's a big problem
right now in user

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.970
generated content and
in commenting systems.

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:18.440
There is a great need for
keyword filtering kind

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:23.240
of systems that is actually
this word filtering systems that

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:28.280
can figure out bad stuff
in ways that doesn't rely

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.800
on actually seeing
specific keywords

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.380
or doing Bayesian filtering.

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.570
What's needed is software
which I don't think

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:38.480
exists, because I don't
think AI heuristics will

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.880
solve that problem.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.800
If anyone knows of anything
like that, I'd like to know.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:47.420
But I have a feeling
the only thing that

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.700
could do the full
customer service job

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:53.610
would be actual strong
AI, and I, for one,

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:56.030
welcome our machine overlords.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:58.990
Frankly, I've begun to feel
like it's time for machine

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:00.440
overlords.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:06.150
And when I say that, I'm not
sure if I'm joking anymore.

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:12.800
So that was 2000, and since
then, Craigslist just grows.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.990
We're now in a whole
bunch more cities,

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:17.240
a whole bunch more countries.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:22.610
The direction I put it in
generally remains unchanged.

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:26.150
Folks here may have noticed
that we have changed the user

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:29.570
experience but stay
consistent with the design

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:34.340
principles, which say, keep
it simple and keep it fast.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.170
Listen to what
are the real needs

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:39.680
and wants of people,
not the fancy stuff.

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:43.190
So you'll see that in our
tables of contents, which

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:45.140
used to be things you scanned.

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:48.740
There is a fairly sophisticated
database powering there.

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:53.450
And you'll be able
to see thumbnails

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:55.640
of the pictures which
are in the things.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.010
You'll be able to see
the whole pictures.

00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:01.570
You'll be able to see maps
and all the variance in that.

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:05.540
You see, the last programming
thing that I did, '99 or 2000,

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.880
I don't remember when--

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.050
well, back then, remember,
I was using Pine.

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:14.589
The data set, the
database, for Craigslist

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:19.900
back then was Pine
email folders.

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:21.380
And Pine is great.

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:23.819
Pine, forgive me,
in many respects,

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:26.819
is much easier to
use than Gmail.

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:29.850
This is actually-- forgive
me for bringing up the name.

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:33.330
I had an extensive discussion
on this with Marissa Meyer

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:35.790
about 10 years ago,
which is why there

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:38.490
are some shortcuts in Gmail.

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:40.770
But the deal is
that I was able to,

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:45.480
with a few commands,
identify and remove

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:49.620
all the old ads in a
category with Pine.

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:53.100
And when Pine email
holders started

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:58.890
proving to be unsatisfactory,
I switched to MySQL,

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:01.600
and that's when
I stopped coding.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.810
Now, and for the
last several years,

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:07.020
I do some, what I call,
lightweight or token customer

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:09.270
service to stay in
touch with what's

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:12.780
real, because you want
to find out what's

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.400
going on with everything.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.900
What do people care about?

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.530
What matters to people?

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.740
And so I get to do that.

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:23.250
Sometimes I handle customer
service email directly.

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:25.120
And also, very
frequently, people

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:28.440
will find me in social
media and come up

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.780
with requests, which
I'm embarrassed to say

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:33.360
I can't really help with.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.240
So what I do with
those is I generally

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.620
just share them with main
line customer service.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.600
And I have to
phrase it carefully,

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.410
because the Yahoo versus
Barnes case makes it very clear

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:49.200
that you can't imply you're
going to solve a problem.

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.180
And if it slips
between the cracks,

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:58.670
or you just forget, or
whatever, you have a problem.

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:00.460
So that's Craigslist there.

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.320
Doing well by doing good.

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:07.520
And again, I made that decision
to monetize minimally in '99,

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:13.000
2000, not altruistically,
but it's just

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.760
what feels right
speaking as a nerd,

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:21.280
as a person who is genuinely
dysfunctional in these regards.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:24.340
That's what happens sometimes.

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:29.670
But in the last 10-plus
years, over those years,

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.040
people from nonprofit
organizations

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:36.630
were coming to me talking
about how to build a community,

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:41.570
how to run sites, which might
be the Craigslist for something.

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:43.880
And frankly, too,
at times they were

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:47.420
hoping for cash
contributions and so on.

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:51.320
And I started getting organized
regarding that in 2011

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.680
with something called
Craigconnects and this branding

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:58.550
that kind of sucks, and it
just didn't work very well.

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:00.500
I'm more organized now.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:04.310
And I have this thing,
craignewmarkphilanthropies.org,

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:07.340
which consists of Craig
Newmark Foundation,

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:11.870
which is a 501(c)(3), and I
have a couple of donor advised

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:13.280
funds.

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.520
There's also the
Craigslist Charitable Fund.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:20.330
The idea is that I
figure I can see what's

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:23.960
going on in the world today,
and I can identify some areas

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:30.590
where help is needed, and
where I can help other people.

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:32.500
I can find smart people
who are doing things

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:36.610
that make a difference and
support them with media,

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:40.660
with cash, with convening power.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:43.150
The deal is that I
screwed up really

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:45.580
badly with Craigslist
in the sense

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:50.350
that I never told people
back in 2000 and not now

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:52.960
that I'm not in
Craigslist management,

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.350
and I've had no real role to
play in any decision making

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:58.480
since 2000.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:59.890
Stupid of me.

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:03.310
And I learned how stupid
that was around 2010.

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:08.500
So since then, I've now gotten
communications and PR religion.

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.000
I'm a zealot.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.330
That matters for technical
people because every one of us

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:17.410
have our own image, our own
brand, our own narrative,

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:20.980
and no one is going
to really watch out

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:22.990
for your own narrative.

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:27.820
That's something as tech people
we're all responsible for.

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:32.260
But I figured that out in
2010, got professional help,

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.410
and right now I need a great
deal of professional help,

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:36.670
and I have it.

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:38.740
I got an email from
some of the folks

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:40.390
right before coming up here--

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:42.570
literally.

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:44.640
So that's a big, big lesson.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:48.450
But anyway, with the help of
professional communicators,

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:51.610
I've identified four areas
where I'm helping people.

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:54.720
There is veterans
and their families.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:58.140
You know, I figure if
someone's willing to maybe go

00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:01.290
to another country and risk
taking a bullet protecting me,

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:03.360
I should do something.

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:04.890
And it never occurred
to me until I

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:08.280
was told that their families
give up and sacrifice

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.970
a lot for them.

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:12.120
So for example, I
started off today

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.670
working with the Bob
Woodruff Foundation.

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:19.980
They find, they qualify, and
vet and fund organizations

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:21.690
which support wounded
veterans wounded

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:25.780
veterans, and their families,
and their caregivers.

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:28.110
So this is a really good
set up we've got going.

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:30.270
And literally, that
was 9:00 this morning

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:32.790
that I met with them.

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:37.000
Another area in the interest
of practicing what you preach

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.330
and treating people like
you want to be treated,

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:43.620
I have a women in tech effort,
which I'm still developing.

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:46.200
I've been involved for
years with the Women Startup

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:52.200
Challenge, which is a deal where
startups run by women pitch

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:57.690
to a panel of VCs, winning
valuable cash prizes

00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:02.370
and winning valuable
time with VCs.

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:05.100
They'll usually hang around,
and help you network,

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:06.450
and give you advice.

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:09.480
So that's a big deal.

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.010
In this year, too--

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:15.810
well, if you want to protect
the country, voting rights.

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:18.240
The voting rights of lots
of people in this country

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.950
are under attack.

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:22.260
We knew they were under
attack by bad politicians

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:26.910
for some years because sometimes
the politicians will admit it--

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:28.950
sometimes under oath.

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:34.650
A week or so ago in a document
produced by Robert Mueller,

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:39.600
in part 47, he says that one
thing the Russians were doing

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:44.370
was interfering with
people actually voting.

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:47.370
They were going after people
who might vote Democratic,

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:50.850
and that may have tilted
things in some states.

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:53.490
Notice I'm not making a
political statement there.

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:57.120
I'm talking about
protecting the country.

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.040
So the deal is
that I'm doing what

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:02.000
I can to protect voting rights.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.260
That's still developing
because I'm only now

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:07.030
talking to the people doing it.

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:09.930
Most of all, though, I
have a program involved

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:12.360
with trustworthy journalism.

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.760
And I'm supporting a
number of groups that

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:17.130
are trying to do good work.

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:19.260
I'm working with the
Google News people

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:23.670
to support the Trust Project
out of Santa Clara University.

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:27.480
Speaking as a news consumer,
I just want news I can trust.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:30.690
The Trust Project is
one way of articulating

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:34.740
what a news outlet has to do
to provide trustworthy news.

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:37.570
Things like don't lie to people.

00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:41.310
Things like when you do
make a mistake, fix it.

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:44.130
Things like listen to
different kinds of people

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:47.020
so you get different
perspectives.

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:48.810
There's other things
involved, too.

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:51.180
Poynter Institute runs the
international fact checking

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:52.140
network.

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:55.320
Because if a news outlet commits
to trustworthy journalism,

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.370
they should--

00:24:56.370 --> 00:25:00.040
you need watch dogs make
sure they're doing it.

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:04.710
But as of a year ago, one guy
who actually has been here

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:07.110
and who talks to the
Google News people a lot

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:10.650
and also Facebook, guy named
Jeff Jarvis, a year ago,

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:14.730
told me for fun to read the NATO
Handbook on Russian Information

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:16.340
Warfare.

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:19.860
In that, Russian military,
and military intelligence

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:23.430
in particular, tell
us, tell the world

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:28.530
what they're going to do to
the US during the election.

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:34.840
And last week, I think, Canadian
intelligence among others says,

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:40.230
hey, here's what the Russians
did in 2016 and continue to do.

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:42.540
Now, growing up
in the '50s, I saw

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:44.520
a lot of crackpot
activity regarding

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:48.000
communists and
Russians, and so I'm

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.680
very gun shy in this regards.

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:56.700
But the intelligence
community and the people

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:58.266
investigating fake
news, the people

00:25:58.266 --> 00:25:59.640
who are looking
at networks of it

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:04.740
say there's a lot of domestic
bad actors amplifying what

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:07.810
the Russians are doing
for really bad results,

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:09.690
including a lot of harassment.

00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:11.310
This is real stuff.

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:15.330
And I figure, if I want to
help defend the country,

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:18.850
I need to find people
doing good work,

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:21.360
I need to get them
communications support,

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:24.120
and I need to fund them.

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:27.900
And honestly, I'm now
writing large checks

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:31.620
to support these groups
because they are defending

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:36.930
the country just like active
service members, and veterans,

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:40.240
and their families help
defend the country.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:44.150
Similarly, I think Wikipedia
plays a big role in this

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:46.370
because my slogan
about Wikipedia

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:50.220
is that Wikipedia is
where facts go to live.

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:53.630
So I'm involved in helping
fund their counter harassment

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:57.080
efforts, I'm talking
to them about what's

00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:00.770
the nature of reliable
sources, and I'm also

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:04.640
working with them on the
bios of living persons

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:08.450
because it's just really
hard to get those bios fixed.

00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:12.500
I had a college professor fix
mine up for the most part,

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:16.430
but I've been into some
events recently where

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:19.820
when I talk about Wikipedia,
frankly, I get a lot of crap

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:22.160
from notable people
who have bios

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.340
who have no way of fixing them.

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:29.810
So those are the kinds of things
I'm working with Wikipedia.

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:33.800
I am one of the
funders of WikiTribune,

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.930
but that's not a
Wikipedia thing.

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:39.500
Although, oddly, last week
in Miami at a conference,

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:45.770
I saw Jimmy plus Orit, who are
the co-founders of WikiTribune.

00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:49.460
So the deal here is on
the Craigslist side,

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:53.540
a business model of
doing well by doing good

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:57.670
with a lot of luck
can do pretty well.

00:27:57.670 --> 00:28:02.160
And I feel if you're
lucky enough to do well,

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:05.580
you should help the
next people do well.

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:07.980
And you should practice
what you preach,

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:13.350
which includes treating people
like you want to be treated.

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:17.800
I can go on quite a long time,
but I'm going to stop there.

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.380
ZAINAN ZHOU: Thank
you very much.

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:23.460
I think you mentioned
that in 2011

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:28.380
that you started
Craigconnects, and in 2015 you

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:32.940
decided to launch the
Craig Newmark Foundation.

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:34.830
Even based on the
name, I think there

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:38.460
are quite different approaches
behind that message.

00:28:41.354 --> 00:28:43.770
CRAIG NEWMARK: You're making
a correct inference regarding

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:44.910
the names.

00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:48.570
It just didn't
work out that way.

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:53.310
I remember 2011 I wanted
to have a brand that

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:55.390
would be catchy and effective.

00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:57.270
The best we could think of--

00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:59.610
Craigconnects-- just
failed because no one

00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:02.430
knows what Craig is.

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:05.610
Craig Newmark Foundation or
Craig Newmark Philanthropies,

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:07.920
people know what that is.

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:12.450
And interestingly, I hear
rumors that people in New York

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:15.430
may know more about who
Craig Newmark is than

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:17.040
in the Bay Area.

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.540
The advantage there
is that New York

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:22.020
is the country's
hub of news media,

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:24.210
and influence, and connection.

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:25.860
This isn't it.

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:29.580
And what I want to do are
things that contribute.

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:32.940
As I push my efforts,
I want to contribute

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:35.940
towards a new normal
of trustworthy news,

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:38.280
and that means
things that I do have

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:41.150
to be noticed to be effective.

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:46.680
ZAINAN ZHOU: I think we
have about 20 minutes left,

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:49.420
and then we can have
some questions that

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:51.260
was from the Dory.

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:55.260
And also, you're more than
welcome to use that mic

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:57.890
for live questions as well.

00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:02.160
I can ask a question that
was from Googler's RSVP.

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.440
One of that is--

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:07.310
I have been using CL for at
least 10 years and cannot pass

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:11.240
up the moment to thank you for
making a huge impact to every

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.070
day Americans like myself.

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:16.400
The question is what inspired
you to be with Craiglist

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.920
in the first place?

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:21.680
CRAIG NEWMARK: It
literally is just the sense

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:23.570
that I should give back.

00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:26.720
Because on the WELL and
usenet newsgroups, even back

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:30.260
in the early '90s with
all the craziness,

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:33.950
there were still a lot of people
who would help each other out,

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:38.420
sometimes contributing
expensive consulting time.

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:41.370
There were a couple of
dramatic cases on the WELL

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:45.290
where a doctor
helped save people.

00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:48.530
So that's the idea
is that I'm getting

00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:51.970
such good stuff from this
community, I should give back.

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:54.070
And it felt right.

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:56.530
ZAINAN ZHOU: But was it
very difficult to get--

00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:59.680
because at the time there was
not much of that services,

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:00.790
right?

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:05.760
Even 250 of the
subscribers at the time who

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:08.770
were pretty much using
maybe phone lines and modems

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:09.730
to dial, right?

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:12.260
If you think about that,
that's quite difficult.

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:15.656
What's the biggest challenge
in the earliest days?

00:31:15.656 --> 00:31:17.530
CRAIG NEWMARK: I think
I started, by the way,

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:19.508
with a 9,600--

00:31:19.508 --> 00:31:23.590
96 kilobaud modem, or
9.6 kilobaud modem.

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:28.330
And I remember when
56 was a big deal.

00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:32.840
But can you repeat that again?

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:34.460
ZAINAN ZHOU: What
was your biggest

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:35.780
challenge in the earliest days?

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:38.420
CRAIG NEWMARK: The biggest
challenge in terms of growing--

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:41.480
well, the good part was I
wasn't thinking about growing.

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.190
Things grew word of mouth.

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:46.190
If someone at a company
was getting the mailings,

00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:49.400
they would share it with other
people in the same company,

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:53.180
and then that person would
send me an email saying,

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:55.310
put me on the email list.

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:56.960
That worked pretty well.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.420
Something that helped
accelerate this

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:03.740
was that this was '95 when
the dot com boom was just

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:09.485
hitting San Francisco, and
that accelerated things.

00:32:09.485 --> 00:32:12.770
A phenomenon back there,
like, lots of launch parties,

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:15.210
some open, some closed.

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:19.730
Patty Beron did
something called SF Girl.

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:23.360
Her specialty was
finding launch parties

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:27.020
and telling people how
to get into them, even

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:29.060
if they were closed.

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:31.460
My only distinct
memory from that time

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:35.420
was that the new at that
time San Francisco Museum

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:40.430
of Modern Art, in the
entry they had lots of food

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:43.880
and there were big
mounds of fresh shrimp.

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:48.485
And that was my favorite
memory of that era.

00:32:48.485 --> 00:32:50.360
These people were spending
way too much money

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:52.010
on this kind of thing.

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:54.500
You know, if you watch
HBO's "Silicon Valley,"

00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:59.938
you'll see a lot of that
history being recapitulated.

00:32:59.938 --> 00:33:02.736
ZAINAN ZHOU: We'll
take one live question.

00:33:02.736 --> 00:33:04.670
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for joining us today.

00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:07.530
There's so many
refugees globally.

00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:09.224
Do you have things--

00:33:09.224 --> 00:33:11.390
like Craigslist is great
for-- you move to the city,

00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:14.520
and I need a free couch,
and for those people.

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:17.260
But I'm wondering,
is there other things

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:22.485
that you're looking at
or advice for helping?

00:33:22.485 --> 00:33:26.070
CRAIG NEWMARK: I am frustrated
in that I'm not smart enough

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:28.380
to think of really
good things to do.

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:31.440
What I have done, and
partly through a charity

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:36.930
called Invenio in San Francisco,
is to help get refugee centers

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:40.650
and so on and related efforts
wired up for the internet,

00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:45.510
because the aid workers say that
they need internet connectivity

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:47.430
for various purposes.

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:50.340
For example, we
did that in Haiti.

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:53.940
That is, I helped
by funding in Haiti.

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:55.560
And just yesterday
I was reminded

00:33:55.560 --> 00:34:00.670
that I helped get wired up the
Dadaab refugee camp, which may

00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:02.800
be the largest in the world.

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.340
And I think it's in
Northern Africa someplace.

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:07.470
I had forgotten all
about it until I

00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:12.030
saw a reference because of a
keyword search in Google News

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:13.300
yesterday--

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:16.830
and again, literally yesterday.

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:19.159
There's been all
other ones, too.

00:34:19.159 --> 00:34:22.380
When the Obama administration
was trying a serious outreach

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:26.670
to the Islamic world, I helped
wire up the vocational schools

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:28.170
in the West Bank.

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:33.330
Now we have something going
on an island in Lake Victoria

00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:36.690
where there we're helping
provide internet connectivity,

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:38.730
but there it's because
people need it,

00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:42.030
but it's also a
lure into a facility

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:45.150
to get people tested for HIV.

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:47.159
Because culturally
speaking, it's

00:34:47.159 --> 00:34:49.770
really hard to get
people to get tested,

00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:53.010
but they all want
to be on the net.

00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:54.889
So those are small things.

00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:57.500
Nowadays I'm thinking
I'm specializing--

00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:00.620
because in our country,
maybe we have an all hands

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:04.850
on deck situation where
things have gotten bad,

00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:09.350
and we need to do something
good, like protecting the vote,

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:13.670
like stopping bad
actors, Russians

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:17.000
or otherwise, from
contaminating the news.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.400
Because you really
can't run a democracy

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:22.310
if the normal
national conversation

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:23.780
has a lot of lying going on.

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:29.040
ZAINAN ZHOU: Thank you.

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.795
And we have another
question from Dory.

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:41.700
I think this is related to the
involvement of the management.

00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:44.120
But the question is, I
can think of many ways

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:45.950
that Craiglist can improve.

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:47.510
I'm wondering,
what's the roadmap?

00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:50.870
And why does Craiglist
seems reluctant to take it

00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:53.485
to the next level?

00:35:53.485 --> 00:35:55.610
CRAIG NEWMARK: Well, for
any of that, since I'm not

00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:58.670
involved in management,
email something to Jim

00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:00.770
at Craigslist.org.

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:04.280
Don't send any
intellectual property.

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:06.470
And hopefully, you've
gotten a lecture

00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:09.110
about protecting
that, if not here,

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:13.340
from the folks on
HBO's "Silicon Valley."

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:15.300
So please do that.

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:17.810
Bear in mind that what
people seem to need

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:21.110
is not fancy stuff
but effective stuff.

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:23.690
Fast and simple is always big.

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:25.820
Regarding the next
level, I don't

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:27.680
know what the next level is.

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:30.530
But if you're helping people
put food on the table,

00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:33.940
that's pretty good
next level to me.

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:39.370
ZAINAN ZHOU: I actually think
of a follow-up question on that.

00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:44.620
In terms of funding
from the Craiglist,

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:47.710
you have been very
conservative in turning down--

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:52.120
and turned out a lot of
investment ask, right?

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:54.310
And have you ever--

00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:57.790
wondering that with more
resource, like money,

00:36:57.790 --> 00:37:00.760
that Craiglist would be
able to have more resources

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:05.710
in fighting scams and spams?

00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:08.370
And this also really
applies to not just

00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:11.220
Craiglist, but also
maybe Wikipedia,

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:15.890
and maybe the overall
news community?

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:18.280
CRAIG NEWMARK:
Maybe what we need

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:23.900
is a crash project, a Manhattan
project in terms of software,

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:27.970
which can figure out
bad intent on the part

00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:29.520
of a posting of any sort.

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:34.090
A posting could be
an ad or a comment.

00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:36.760
That would be really,
really smart software.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:39.010
I don't think it
exists, and I don't

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:41.680
think it's going to
exist anytime soon.

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:46.690
Maybe I should offer a
really big prize for that.

00:37:46.690 --> 00:37:48.970
And maybe that would be--

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:52.940
maybe that would be useful
since I don't think it exists.

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:58.480
Yeah, but we do need
that kind of thing.

00:37:58.480 --> 00:37:59.980
There, again, those
are those people

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:06.030
who think software that smart
could achieve self-awareness.

00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:09.990
And you know, you hope it's the
nice kind of self-awareness,

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:14.550
like the AIs of Iain
Banks' culture novels

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:17.130
and not the murderous
pistol-wielding robots

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:18.830
of "Westworld."

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:22.142
Although that is a
really good show.

00:38:22.142 --> 00:38:23.100
ZAINAN ZHOU: Thank you.

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:24.365
We have another live question.

00:38:24.365 --> 00:38:26.448
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank you
for being here and sharing

00:38:26.448 --> 00:38:27.192
your story.

00:38:27.192 --> 00:38:28.680
I really appreciate it.

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:30.810
You seem like a
really humble person,

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:32.220
but I will ask this anyways.

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:35.376
When you look back, what
is the biggest mistake

00:38:35.376 --> 00:38:37.810
you think you did, and
what did you learn from it?

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:38.810
CRAIG NEWMARK: Our big--

00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:40.620
well, the big
mistake as a company

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:44.400
was not seizing control and
determining our own narrative.

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.770
When you're not
telling your own story,

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:48.570
other people can tell it.

00:38:48.570 --> 00:38:50.330
And most of them will be good.

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:54.490
Some of them will be running
scams of one sort or another.

00:38:54.490 --> 00:38:59.910
That's why in 2010 I
started doing it for myself.

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:02.280
And I've stumbled along
the way, but now I

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:05.280
have a really good
firm helping me out.

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:09.360
The thing is that you do need
good, smart people doing that.

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:13.320
Marc Benioff at Salesforce
does a great job of it.

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:17.640
There are other dot coms who
have done a terrible job of it,

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:20.160
even when people like me
are trying to help them

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:21.890
and to try to do a
little wake up call.

00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:27.201
ZAINAN ZHOU: Free to ask
another live question.

00:39:27.201 --> 00:39:29.326
AUDIENCE: Again, thank you
for creating Craigslist.

00:39:29.326 --> 00:39:31.821
I've used it throughout my life.

00:39:31.821 --> 00:39:33.820
I was wondering if you
had any advice in general

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:36.220
around creating
internet-wide communities.

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:38.800
How do you handle that scale
of people, or what advice

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.600
do you give to
companies or startups

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:45.780
or nonprofits trying to create
internet scale [INAUDIBLE]??

00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:50.640
CRAIG NEWMARK: I don't
have broad overall advice.

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:51.460
Just watch out.

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:55.590
That user-generated content
will have a moderation problem,

00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:58.022
and there's a number of
unsolved problems with it.

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:04.590
Yeah, and right now that's
in major flux right now.

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:08.010
Somewhere in Alphabet
there is Jigsaw.

00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:10.740
I think that's Jared Cohen--

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:12.750
I keep forgetting
his last name--

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:14.670
working directly
with Eric Schmidt.

00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:18.150
They think they have a
handle on the problem.

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:20.580
I don't know, but
that's something

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:22.230
which is badly needed.

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:25.620
There are folks who are doing
big work with machine learning

00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:30.130
here, and that
may lead the path.

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:35.130
But again, no one knows
how machine learning

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:36.680
is going to lead us.

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:40.080
And I am kind of excited
about it, but remember,

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:45.515
I've been reading science
fiction for over 50 years.

00:40:45.515 --> 00:40:49.720
ZAINAN ZHOU: How about I put
the question on the other way.

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:51.370
So you have been a nerd.

00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:55.180
And the Craigslist is actually
a very successful community,

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:59.230
right, if we want to learn from
how to create a wide internet

00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:00.170
community.

00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:04.120
What are things that were
not coding or technical,

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:05.770
but the things that
you've done, what

00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:08.530
are the practices and
strategy in the early days

00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:11.830
that you think is part of
the success of this creating

00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:14.126
this community?

00:41:14.126 --> 00:41:15.500
CRAIG NEWMARK:
The success factor

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:19.360
is doing one's best to
provide a customer service.

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:20.860
That's serious.

00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:25.354
Again, a challenge when
your site is mostly free.

00:41:25.354 --> 00:41:26.770
That was the big
thing right there

00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:29.740
because the initial
spirit that this site was

00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:32.490
about giving people a break--

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:34.990
and people could see that--

00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:38.350
by accident that proved
to be a good start,

00:41:38.350 --> 00:41:41.860
a good initial culture,
or as people like to say,

00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:43.430
it's in our DNA.

00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:46.742
And that's managed to succeed.

00:41:46.742 --> 00:41:48.200
ZAINAN ZHOU: Is
there any challenge

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:49.600
to work with volunteers?

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:50.475
CRAIG NEWMARK: With--

00:41:50.475 --> 00:41:52.580
ZAINAN ZHOU: With volunteers
in the early ages.

00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:55.732
That before 1980, you mentioned
a lot of them are volunteers.

00:41:55.732 --> 00:41:57.190
CRAIG NEWMARK: In
that first year--

00:41:57.190 --> 00:42:01.610
the volunteer thing failed
because you can't tell

00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:03.040
a volunteer to--

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:06.110
like, you just can't tell
them that their job depends

00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:09.560
on getting something
done at a certain time.

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:13.890
Because if they're volunteers,
you can't withdraw their pay.

00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:18.170
So companies-- I guess the
company in human history

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:21.440
is quite an invention
to make things work that

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:24.050
otherwise wouldn't work.

00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:29.044
So you normally don't think of
it as an invention, but it is.

00:42:29.044 --> 00:42:31.810
ZAINAN ZHOU: It is, and it is
an invention of the way how

00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:32.927
people can collaborate.

00:42:32.927 --> 00:42:33.760
CRAIG NEWMARK: Yeah.

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:34.510
ZAINAN ZHOU: Yeah.

00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:37.154
Let's take another
live question.

00:42:37.154 --> 00:42:39.156
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
coming here, again.

00:42:39.156 --> 00:42:42.074
I'm very interested
in your story,

00:42:42.074 --> 00:42:45.700
and that was really
good to hear from you.

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:48.910
I guess my question is, you
know, you mentioned that people

00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:50.685
come to you to say,
do you have advice

00:42:50.685 --> 00:42:54.100
for creating the
Craigslist of law?

00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:57.028
I do find the fundamental
principal of Craigslist

00:42:57.028 --> 00:42:59.650
as a product very
interesting, which

00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:01.990
is connecting people
who need things

00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:04.170
with connecting
people who want things

00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:07.040
in a single place
of exchange, right?

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:09.380
In a very fundamental
level, like maybe AirBNB

00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:12.861
is even trying to do that, which
is I have some leftover things,

00:43:12.861 --> 00:43:15.730
and some people could pay
me for some of these things.

00:43:15.730 --> 00:43:18.901
I'm curious to know, from
all the ones that you heard,

00:43:18.901 --> 00:43:20.950
can I create a
Craiglist of whatever?

00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:23.119
What are some of the
most interesting things?

00:43:23.119 --> 00:43:24.910
What are some of the
most successful things

00:43:24.910 --> 00:43:26.939
or even weirder things?

00:43:26.939 --> 00:43:29.230
CRAIG NEWMARK: I don't pay
much attention to the people

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:33.070
who make businesses
out and that because I

00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:35.570
guess I just don't care.

00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:37.270
I mean, that's a distraction.

00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:39.100
The best kind of
things are where

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:41.590
people manage to make
a little business out

00:43:41.590 --> 00:43:45.817
of finding junk stuff and then
rebuilding it and making it

00:43:45.817 --> 00:43:47.590
into something real.

00:43:47.590 --> 00:43:51.740
And until today, I couldn't
think of a good example except,

00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:52.690
again, I just gave a--

00:43:52.690 --> 00:43:55.540
I was on a panel at Stanford
Business School where

00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:59.800
a kid who must have been
20, but looked 14 to me,

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.020
but he made a
business out of going

00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:05.620
to the junkyards in
his neighborhood,

00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:10.180
finding old bikes, rebuilding
them, and selling them.

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:15.280
And that was a way that he
saved up enough for whatever he

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:15.970
needed.

00:44:15.970 --> 00:44:19.450
Maybe a little bit for a
college or something like that.

00:44:19.450 --> 00:44:21.442
That feels really good.

00:44:21.442 --> 00:44:22.900
And there's been
other things, too.

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:27.700
Because during the
recession, around 2008, 2009,

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:31.570
I could see a lot of people
who were really relying

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:35.320
on our site for advertising.

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:38.350
They were relying
on it for barter,

00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:41.110
because sometimes that's the
only way you're going to get

00:44:41.110 --> 00:44:43.570
what you need in a recession.

00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:47.170
And that lasted a couple
of years, I think.

00:44:47.170 --> 00:44:50.290
So we have all
these things happen

00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:52.390
that does feel pretty good.

00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:55.240
But meanwhile, in these
philanthropic areas I have,

00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:57.640
we have real challenges.

00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:00.192
Again, on
CraigNewmarkPhilanthropies.org,

00:45:00.192 --> 00:45:02.730
that's how I'm--

00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:07.070
that's how I'm getting this
stuff done the best I can.

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:10.000
I should mention that I'm not
restricting myself completely

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.430
to those four areas.

00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:15.700
I'm working with some
groups on food security,

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:18.760
like Meals on Wheels kinds
of things-- delivering

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:22.940
hot food to people or whatever--
like in New York in particular.

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:26.950
I support God's Love We Deliver,
which when you say it fast

00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:30.130
is "God's lovely liver."

00:45:30.130 --> 00:45:34.270
And I also support pigeon rescue
because I know how important

00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:36.070
that is to everyone.

00:45:36.070 --> 00:45:40.020
I've also learned there that
pigeon pants is a thing,

00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:41.860
and that you want the
pigeon to be wearing

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:46.030
the pants before they
fly onto your shoulder

00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:48.640
to coo lovingly at you.

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:52.990
If they coo first and
then the pants are put on,

00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:54.700
you may have a problem.

00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:57.970
And I did.

00:45:57.970 --> 00:45:59.500
Although I do like
pigeons a lot.

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:05.430
ZAINAN ZHOU: We have some
question from the Dory again.

00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:08.160
I think the live
streaming people are now

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:10.210
sending the questions.

00:46:10.210 --> 00:46:14.180
One question is, Craiglist
has notoriously not

00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:16.430
modernized its design in UX.

00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:19.580
What's the reasoning for this?

00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:21.840
CRAIG NEWMARK: I can't
speak for the whole company.

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:24.560
But if you look
at the site, we've

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:28.880
been incrementally making
improvements in it for years.

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:32.600
Both improvements that you
can see, like the database,

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:35.210
like the thumbnail
sketches and all that,

00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:39.810
and the people who use the site
say this is what they want.

00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:41.960
So we've made a lot of
improvements that way.

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:43.543
There's a lot of
improvements that you

00:46:43.543 --> 00:46:47.000
can't see, like improved
caching and efforts

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.830
to keep the site fast.

00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:53.120
Speed is a design principle, and
it's a really important design

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.140
principle.

00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:57.740
And Google does a lot of
things along those lines.

00:46:57.740 --> 00:46:59.960
Something I have to look
into is a better use

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:03.320
of Google domain service.

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:07.490
Because I have my real doubts
regarding both my ISPs,

00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:11.330
in fact, all three of my ISPs,
because something tells me

00:47:11.330 --> 00:47:14.720
their DNS lookups
are kind of sluggish.

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:18.020
I should also count the hotel
I usually stay at in New York

00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:22.310
because their ISP kind
of fails to deliver.

00:47:22.310 --> 00:47:25.611
But I'm hoping not to
be in there much longer.

00:47:25.611 --> 00:47:26.660
ZAINAN ZHOU: Thank you.

00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:31.160
I have a question that is
regarding the integration

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:32.900
of a block chain.

00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:36.230
The question says, I
personally really appreciate

00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:39.080
Wikipedia and Craiglist
as the free layers

00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:42.390
of knowledge and marketing
information in the economy.

00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:45.080
Have you considered
block chain integration

00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:48.350
in which you could create
pure, decentralized Craiglist

00:47:48.350 --> 00:47:50.560
and tokenomics around it?

00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:52.670
But what's your view
in general on that,

00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:54.590
and how can people
can collaborate?

00:47:54.590 --> 00:47:57.780
CRAIG NEWMARK: Well, a block
chain is applied to Craigslist.

00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:00.080
I just don't know what
Jim is working on.

00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:03.230
What I'm thinking is that block
chain-based identity, verified

00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:05.870
identity might be
a way that we can

00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:08.420
get a lot more
accountability on the net.

00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:12.770
And when you get a scam sent
to you or a piece of spam,

00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:15.950
you'd like to hold the
center accountable to that.

00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:17.220
That's good.

00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:19.790
But on the net,
we're always going

00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:23.150
to need places where you
can be completely anonymous,

00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:27.800
places for dissidents,
whistleblowers,

00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:30.830
people who may have been in
a really bad domestic abuse

00:48:30.830 --> 00:48:32.240
situation.

00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:34.340
We're always going
to need places

00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:40.190
where verified identity is not
good, where anonymity is good.

00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:42.900
This may also apply,
and this is a big thing,

00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:46.190
the European Union now
has this GDPR standard.

00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:49.760
It's a set of standards
which allow consumers

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:52.850
to control the data
passed between publishers

00:48:52.850 --> 00:48:55.010
and advertisers.

00:48:55.010 --> 00:49:01.760
And my gut feeling is that
block chain-based control

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:05.120
of an individual's
data will be a way

00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:10.640
to make everyone happy in terms
of the data about a consumer

00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:14.324
that an advertiser and
publisher can share.

00:49:14.324 --> 00:49:15.740
I don't know about
you, but I want

00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:19.640
control of that
kind of data, and I

00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:24.400
do want to be served ads which
actually mean something to me.

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:27.370
You know, sometimes it's mixed
because my wife and I are--

00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:31.120
my wife and I share an Amazon
account, especially when she's

00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:33.650
buying things for the
nephews and nieces,

00:49:33.650 --> 00:49:35.630
and we've got 21 of them.

00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:40.420
So odd things show up
in my Amazon profile.

00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:41.710
That's OK.

00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:44.380
But I want the ability
to control that.

00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:47.579
Block chain may be
the way to do that.

00:49:47.579 --> 00:49:49.120
ZAINAN ZHOU: And do
you think it also

00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:55.270
may help in terms of,
let's say, the true news

00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:59.080
and fighting the fake
news, for example?

00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:00.580
CRAIG NEWMARK: I
don't know honestly

00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:02.350
what role it may play in that.

00:50:02.350 --> 00:50:06.970
That's something that people
smarter than me are working on.

00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:10.810
My gut tells me that one
of the biggest things that

00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:14.260
need to happen are
the fact checkers,

00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:17.440
like at the international fact
checking network, and the tech

00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:20.170
and check people at Duke.

00:50:20.170 --> 00:50:24.880
If you-- fact checking in
real time is really hard.

00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:30.070
Because if someone lies to
the public and the newspapers

00:50:30.070 --> 00:50:32.560
and so on report
it, you know, they

00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:36.800
may only realize that
it's a lie an hour after.

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:40.150
So we're talking up
summary fact checking,

00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:43.900
meaning that a person
or a news outlet

00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:46.790
will have a track record in
terms of how honest they are

00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:47.840
or not.

00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:50.140
And I think that's
going to need a lot of--

00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:51.820
that's going to
need a lot of work.

00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:55.540
Because frankly, it's
not hard to figure out

00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:58.970
what news outlets try
to get things right

00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:02.650
and which news outlets
deliberately get things wrong.

00:51:02.650 --> 00:51:05.380
The idea is how do you
do it so that no one is

00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:07.100
an arbiter of truth.

00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:10.020
There's no one, no
single group or anything,

00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:11.680
will arbitrate truth.

00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:14.380
Instead you have a large
network of networks,

00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:17.260
and that's what's
happening right now, maybe

00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:18.920
not fast enough.

00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:22.380
And I just realized
another condition

00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:24.900
I may put on if I may make--

00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:27.210
if I'm going to make
a very large grant

00:51:27.210 --> 00:51:33.610
to a particular news
institution, because you know,

00:51:33.610 --> 00:51:37.120
I'm talking about journalism,
but I'm a news consumer.

00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:39.190
And I've learned a
lot, but unless you've

00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:42.910
been writing to get to deadline
like five times a week,

00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:45.730
you don't know journalism,
because that's really

00:51:45.730 --> 00:51:47.950
a tough kind of
creative pressure.

00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:49.600
You know, I've
been in situations

00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:52.660
where I've had to
write code to deadline.

00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:56.004
But writing stories
to deadline is tougher

00:51:56.004 --> 00:51:57.920
because you don't know
what the story is ahead

00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:00.250
of time, whereas
if you're coding,

00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:02.870
you normally know what kind
of stuff you've got to write.

00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:07.480
Presumably someone's done some
decent requirements definition

00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:11.050
of the variety, which
is not entirely stupid.

00:52:11.050 --> 00:52:14.440
I put that qualification
on just reminding people

00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:17.780
that I worked in IBM
development for six years.

00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:21.070
Not that I have anything
specific in mind.

00:52:21.070 --> 00:52:24.100
ZAINAN ZHOU: OK,
one last question.

00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:26.200
We saw the startup
trend of pursuing

00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:29.920
vertical opportunities
of what Craiglist

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:32.440
is doing for the past decade.

00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:34.630
As a horizontal
company, I'm wondering

00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:37.000
what Craiglist
think of this trend,

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.891
and how Craiglist would respond
to this trend of the future.

00:52:40.891 --> 00:52:43.140
CRAIG NEWMARK: I don't think
about it much because I'm

00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:45.640
focused on philanthropy.

00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:47.800
Jim may be thinking
about it, but you'd

00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:51.740
have to ask him, which is
not a satisfactory answer.

00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:55.580
But again, the deal is
that, and it's maybe

00:52:55.580 --> 00:53:03.360
a good thing that like, for
roughly 10 years, I focused--

00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:08.200
well, for 10 years I focused on
coding then customer service,

00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:11.020
then for a lot of that I
focused on customer service

00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:13.330
and then philanthropy.

00:53:13.330 --> 00:53:16.840
Not that I'm really, really
smart in any of that,

00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:18.470
but I'm combining the two.

00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:20.540
You know, I've been
lucky enough to do well.

00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:24.340
And I'm putting my money
where my mouth is in all this.

00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:27.460
The deal is that there's
this billionaire's pledge

00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:33.100
to give away half of what you've
made during your lifetime.

00:53:33.100 --> 00:53:36.910
I'm not being specific, but
I've already exceeded that.

00:53:36.910 --> 00:53:40.780
I'm looking to do more,
to do it in smart ways

00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:45.990
because a democracy can't
survive built on lies.

00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:49.200
And you know, we
need to fix that,

00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:52.440
and we have some runway
to fix that until things

00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:53.940
go really bad.

00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:56.460
So I'm involved in
that kind of thing.

00:53:56.460 --> 00:54:00.240
And by involved, I mean I'm
involved in it literally

00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:01.950
every day.

00:54:01.950 --> 00:54:04.929
And you know, that ain't so bad.

00:54:04.929 --> 00:54:07.470
Again, there's a lot of people
around who are smarter than me

00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:08.940
and who do more than me.

00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:11.940
My role is to
bring them together

00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:14.100
and to get some cash to them.

00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:15.802
Not bad.

00:54:15.802 --> 00:54:16.760
ZAINAN ZHOU: Thank you.

00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:19.440
I like thank Craig
Newmark for being here

00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:21.270
and have the
conversation with us.

00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:23.940
And I would like to thank
the crew and all the audience

00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:25.490
here and on the live streaming.

00:54:25.490 --> 00:54:26.760
Thank you for being here.

00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:30.397
And please follow [INAUDIBLE]
for future events.

00:54:30.397 --> 00:54:31.230
Thank you very much.

00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:32.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:34.790
Thank you very much.
