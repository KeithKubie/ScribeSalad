00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:37.690
in granitic sandy soils like Juma and
 

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:40.240
in granitic sandy soils like Juma and
essentially the top of the landscape has

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:40.250
essentially the top of the landscape has
 

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:42.280
essentially the top of the landscape has
got large leaves for pumping the water

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:42.290
got large leaves for pumping the water
 

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:44.740
got large leaves for pumping the water
from deep underneath and the mud slope

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:44.750
from deep underneath and the mud slope
 

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:46.540
from deep underneath and the mud slope
we get the silver class leaf band and

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:46.550
we get the silver class leaf band and
 

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:48.160
we get the silver class leaf band and
then it goes further down slope then you

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:48.170
then it goes further down slope then you
 

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:49.840
then it goes further down slope then you
get sort of a little bit of a mixed

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:49.850
get sort of a little bit of a mixed
 

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:52.150

quarries and the like which then

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:53.300
quarries and the like which then
 

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.420
quarries and the like which then
indicates another sea plant and so deck

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:55.430
indicates another sea plant and so deck
 

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:58.449
indicates another sea plant and so deck
areas and then you get basically the the

00:13:58.449 --> 00:13:58.459
areas and then you get basically the the
 

00:13:58.459 --> 00:14:01.300

riparian vegetation which is what we're

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:01.310
riparian vegetation which is what we're
 

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:03.069

there's lots of tambuti
so some of the trees are quite palatable

00:14:12.069 --> 00:14:12.079
so some of the trees are quite palatable

than here here in the Mara you could

it's it to the horizon I give an example
of what I'm talking about and you can

to here or one tree there now just look

00:20:58.550 --> 00:20:58.560
to here or one tree there now just look
 

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.410
to here or one tree there now just look
at that and don't worry about the clouds

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:00.420
at that and don't worry about the clouds
 

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:03.020

that doesn't mean we'll have any rains

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:03.030
that doesn't mean we'll have any rains
 

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:05.150
that doesn't mean we'll have any rains
but that is the difference and you can

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:05.160
but that is the difference and you can
 

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.270
but that is the difference and you can
see an elephant miles and miles away and

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:08.280

out that is one of the features you can
 

00:35:04.839 --> 00:35:07.319
out that is one of the features you can
use in order to distinguish between the

00:35:07.319 --> 00:35:07.329
use in order to distinguish between the
 

00:35:07.329 --> 00:35:10.380
use in order to distinguish between the
turtles and the Terrapins so the turtle

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:10.390
turtles and the Terrapins so the turtle
 

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:13.200
turtles and the Terrapins so the turtle
is the we draw their head sideways

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:13.210
is the we draw their head sideways
 

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:16.230
is the we draw their head sideways
whereas the toe toe is they will draw

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:16.240
whereas the toe toe is they will draw
 

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:19.529
whereas the toe toe is they will draw
their back straight and the turtles can

00:35:19.529 --> 00:35:19.539
their back straight and the turtles can
 

00:35:19.539 --> 00:35:21.569
their back straight and the turtles can
be able to hide it deep inside the shell

00:35:21.569 --> 00:35:21.579
be able to hide it deep inside the shell
 

00:35:21.579 --> 00:35:24.480
be able to hide it deep inside the shell
so both turtles and therapies they've

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:24.490
so both turtles and therapies they've
 

00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:28.380
so both turtles and therapies they've
got strong shares so you can see that

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:28.390
got strong shares so you can see that
 

00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:30.269
got strong shares so you can see that
only one is coming out at the moment but

judgment and they found so what it and
 

01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:05.060
judgment and they found so what it and
they didn't go for it and they must be

a warthog because in the kind of light
 

01:35:11.789 --> 01:35:13.459
a warthog because in the kind of light
we have chances are it could be

01:35:13.459 --> 01:35:13.469
we have chances are it could be
 

01:35:13.469 --> 01:35:15.410
we have chances are it could be
something bigger and it could be maybe a

have gone

01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:32.730
have gone
 

01:35:32.730 --> 01:35:34.220
have gone
they are not very far from that tree

01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:34.230
they are not very far from that tree
 

01:35:34.230 --> 01:35:37.069

either they have crouched down in the
 

01:35:37.079 --> 01:35:40.010
either they have crouched down in the

can't see them they would definitely

01:35:41.569 --> 01:35:41.579
can't see them they would definitely
 

01:35:41.579 --> 01:35:44.000
can't see them they would definitely
blend in very well they wouldn't want

01:35:47.239 --> 01:35:50.959
 
and my hope is they cut something for

01:35:50.959 --> 01:35:50.969
and my hope is they cut something for
 

01:35:50.969 --> 01:35:53.120
and my hope is they cut something for

to vibrate a little bit more for example
you get a little bit of

01:41:58.620 --> 01:41:58.630
you get a little bit of
