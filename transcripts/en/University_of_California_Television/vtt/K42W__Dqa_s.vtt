00:00:05.168 --> 00:00:08.335
(upbeat techno music)

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.529
- My name is Ann Thrupp

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.195
and I'm the Executive Director

00:00:34.195 --> 00:00:36.910
of the Berkeley Food
Institute here on campus

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.126
which is a multi-disciplinary
center at UC Berkeley

00:00:40.126 --> 00:00:43.720
that is undertaking innovative
research, education,

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.657
policy work and community
engagement activities

00:00:46.657 --> 00:00:50.858
aimed for transformative
change in food systems.

00:00:50.858 --> 00:00:52.261
Along with the graduate division

00:00:52.261 --> 00:00:55.373
and the graduate council
of the academic senate,

00:00:55.373 --> 00:00:58.155
I'm very honored and delighted to welcome

00:00:58.155 --> 00:01:01.226
Dr. Marion Nestle, this year's speaker

00:01:01.226 --> 00:01:05.963
in the Barbara Weinstock
Lectures on the Morals of Trade.

00:01:05.963 --> 00:01:07.861
Before introducing Dr. Nestle,

00:01:07.861 --> 00:01:09.444
I'd like to take a moment to tell you

00:01:09.444 --> 00:01:11.234
how the endowment
supporting these lectures

00:01:11.234 --> 00:01:13.411
came to UC Berkeley.

00:01:13.411 --> 00:01:15.578
In 1902, Harris Weinstock,

00:01:16.702 --> 00:01:19.620
a well-known businessman
based in Sacramento,

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.967
provided the University
of California with a fund

00:01:21.967 --> 00:01:25.491
in honor of his wife,
Barbara, to support an annual

00:01:25.491 --> 00:01:28.658
public lecture on the morals of trade.

00:01:29.578 --> 00:01:32.875
Weinstock explained his
motivations in an article

00:01:32.875 --> 00:01:37.487
written after the first
lecture was delivered in 1904:

00:01:37.487 --> 00:01:39.519
"Thus, hope is in the air,

00:01:39.519 --> 00:01:42.085
"and there is a better
and cleaner day in store

00:01:42.085 --> 00:01:44.198
"for all destined to spend their lives

00:01:44.198 --> 00:01:46.206
"in commercial pursuits.

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:47.785
"The thing to do at this hour

00:01:47.785 --> 00:01:49.454
"is to accelerate the movement

00:01:49.454 --> 00:01:51.614
"and to bring this hoped-for day

00:01:51.614 --> 00:01:54.238
"as near to our own as possible.

00:01:54.238 --> 00:01:56.046
"The California University Lectureship

00:01:56.046 --> 00:01:58.629
"on the Morals of Trade is a small effort

00:01:58.629 --> 00:02:00.296
"in that direction."

00:02:01.885 --> 00:02:04.456
So others who have
delivered Weinstock lectures

00:02:04.456 --> 00:02:07.974
include consumer advocate Ralph Nader,

00:02:07.974 --> 00:02:11.069
a member of the British
Parliament Neil Kinnock,

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.319
Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen,

00:02:14.204 --> 00:02:17.214
former US Secretary of Labor Robert Reich,

00:02:17.214 --> 00:02:20.084
and former Secretary of the US Department

00:02:20.084 --> 00:02:22.730
of Health and Human
Services Kathleen Sebelius,

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.581
so following a very steemed footsteps.

00:02:25.581 --> 00:02:27.686
So now I'm very pleased to say a few words

00:02:27.686 --> 00:02:30.837
about today's distinguished speaker.

00:02:30.837 --> 00:02:32.997
Dr. Marion Nestle is renowned for her work

00:02:32.997 --> 00:02:35.540
on nutrition, food
policy and public health,

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.908
as many of you probably know.

00:02:37.908 --> 00:02:40.677
Her research and writing are widely-read

00:02:40.677 --> 00:02:43.638
by both popular and academic audiences.

00:02:43.638 --> 00:02:46.285
She examines scientific and
socio-economic dimensions

00:02:46.285 --> 00:02:49.419
of food choices, obesity, and food safety

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.438
with a focus on the
role of food marketing.

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:54.894
She is a prolific writer.

00:02:54.894 --> 00:02:57.808
Several of her award-winning
publications include

00:02:57.808 --> 00:03:00.975
Food Politics, Safe Food, What to Eat,

00:03:03.055 --> 00:03:06.055
Eat, Drink, Vote, and Soda Politics.

00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:12.292
She is also the author
of two books on pet food,

00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:15.243
Feed your Pet Right,
and Pet Food Politics.

00:03:15.243 --> 00:03:17.925
I bet some of you didn't know that.

00:03:17.925 --> 00:03:22.418
From 2008 to 2013, she
contributed a monthly Food Matters

00:03:22.418 --> 00:03:25.361
column for the San Francisco
Chronicle food section,

00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:29.528
and she blogs almost daily
at www.foodpolitics.com.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.400
So, also, Marion Nestle
earned her BA in Bacteriology,

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.728
her Doctorate in Molecular Biology,

00:03:38.728 --> 00:03:40.862
and Masters in Public Health and Nutrition

00:03:40.862 --> 00:03:43.365
all from UC Berkeley.

00:03:43.365 --> 00:03:46.115
So she is undoubtedly a CAL bear,

00:03:47.721 --> 00:03:50.255
and this is a special homecoming, I think.

00:03:50.255 --> 00:03:53.726
We're also delighted that
she was able to come.

00:03:53.726 --> 00:03:55.990
She is currently the Paulette Goddard

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.858
Professor of Nutrition, Food Studies,

00:03:57.858 --> 00:04:00.213
and Public Health at New York University,

00:04:00.213 --> 00:04:04.743
the department she
chaired from 1988 to 2003.

00:04:04.743 --> 00:04:07.831
She's also professor of
Sociology at New York University

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:11.361
and Visiting Professor
at Cornell University.

00:04:11.361 --> 00:04:13.496
From 1986 through 1988,

00:04:13.496 --> 00:04:16.554
she served as a senior
nutrition policy adviser

00:04:16.554 --> 00:04:18.882
in the Department of
Health and Human Services

00:04:18.882 --> 00:04:22.834
and the editor of the 1988
Surgeon General's Report

00:04:22.834 --> 00:04:25.192
on Nutrition and Health.

00:04:25.192 --> 00:04:28.609
Dr. Nestle has received
numerous awards and honors.

00:04:28.609 --> 00:04:31.048
In 2011, Berkeley School of Public Health

00:04:31.048 --> 00:04:33.784
named her Public Health Hero.

00:04:33.784 --> 00:04:36.129
Michael Pollan ranked her the number two

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:40.343
Most Powerful Foodie in
America after Michelle Obama,

00:04:40.343 --> 00:04:44.015
and Mark Bittman ranked her number one

00:04:44.015 --> 00:04:47.205
in his list of foodies to be thankful for.

00:04:47.205 --> 00:04:48.038
Yey!

00:04:49.125 --> 00:04:53.466
In 2013, she received the
James Beard Leadership Award

00:04:53.466 --> 00:04:56.306
and in 2014, the US
Healthful Food Council's

00:04:56.306 --> 00:04:58.122
Innovator for the Year Award,

00:04:58.122 --> 00:05:02.284
and the Public Heath Association
New York City Media Award.

00:05:02.284 --> 00:05:06.116
In 2016, her book Soda
Politics won literary awards

00:05:06.116 --> 00:05:08.212
from the James Beard Foundation,

00:05:08.212 --> 00:05:12.379
and the International Association
of Culinary Professionals.

00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:15.641
I'd like to add more
personally that Marion's work

00:05:15.641 --> 00:05:18.366
is a tremendous inspiration to thousands

00:05:18.366 --> 00:05:20.775
and thousands of people.

00:05:20.775 --> 00:05:23.160
She is a great hero for many of us

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.535
affiliated with the
Berkeley Food Institute

00:05:25.535 --> 00:05:30.011
and the UC Berkeley
community far more widely.

00:05:30.011 --> 00:05:33.614
In her lecture today,
Dr. Nestle will address

00:05:33.614 --> 00:05:35.909
cultural, economic and
institutional factors

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:38.538
that influence food policies and choices

00:05:38.538 --> 00:05:40.394
and the balance between
individual, societal

00:05:40.394 --> 00:05:43.492
responsibility for these
choices, and much more.

00:05:43.492 --> 00:05:45.961
I'm sure you will be enthralled.

00:05:45.961 --> 00:05:48.585
Please join me in welcoming Marion Nestle

00:05:48.585 --> 00:05:50.089
back to UC Berkeley.

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:52.339
(clapping)

00:06:02.071 --> 00:06:03.130
- Thank you, Ann, for that

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.915
incredibly embarrassing introduction.

00:06:05.915 --> 00:06:07.392
And thank you all for coming

00:06:07.392 --> 00:06:10.006
on this absolutely beautiful day.

00:06:10.006 --> 00:06:13.503
I'm thrilled to be here
to give this lecture.

00:06:13.503 --> 00:06:16.458
I have to say that when
I was invited to give it,

00:06:16.458 --> 00:06:20.208
my initial reaction was,
"What does what I do

00:06:21.124 --> 00:06:24.707
"have to do with the morals of trade?"

00:06:24.707 --> 00:06:28.595
And I'm going to start by
trying to explain that.

00:06:28.595 --> 00:06:31.427
I think I figured it out.

00:06:31.427 --> 00:06:33.587
First of all, I had some help.

00:06:33.587 --> 00:06:37.337
Steve Lubin who was
someone who was connected

00:06:38.724 --> 00:06:41.683
to the Weinstock Lubin family

00:06:41.683 --> 00:06:43.892
sent me a whole lot of
information about it

00:06:43.892 --> 00:06:45.977
and told me that Harris Weinstock

00:06:45.977 --> 00:06:48.960
had something to do with
Industrial Relations Commission

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.116
and was Market Director in
California in the early 1900s

00:06:53.116 --> 00:06:55.957
and his half brother,
David Lubin, founded the

00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:58.996
International Institute
of Agriculture in Rome.

00:06:58.996 --> 00:07:00.715
Together they owned a vineyard,

00:07:00.715 --> 00:07:01.811
they owned wheat land,

00:07:01.811 --> 00:07:03.996
they promoted cooperatives,

00:07:03.996 --> 00:07:07.299
gave speeches about
trade and tariff issues,

00:07:07.299 --> 00:07:11.466
and did a lot of observations
of European agriculture.

00:07:12.692 --> 00:07:14.869
So, that's a connection that I couldn't

00:07:14.869 --> 00:07:18.004
find out anything about Barbara Weinstock.

00:07:18.004 --> 00:07:21.069
She apparently did not
have her own identity,

00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:22.670
and that's a worry.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:25.939
I'd like to know more about her.

00:07:25.939 --> 00:07:29.311
The morals of trade was a really big issue

00:07:29.311 --> 00:07:31.644
in the 1870s to early 1900s.

00:07:33.322 --> 00:07:37.099
There were books written
about the sins of trade

00:07:37.099 --> 00:07:40.744
and the morals of the way the trade policy

00:07:40.744 --> 00:07:43.577
affected society, and some of that

00:07:44.615 --> 00:07:46.724
comes right up to the present time.

00:07:46.724 --> 00:07:49.474
The easiest analogy is fair trade

00:07:50.471 --> 00:07:52.696
where there are now books about fair trade

00:07:52.696 --> 00:07:55.989
and lots and lots going on with that,

00:07:55.989 --> 00:07:59.087
so that the fair trade movement,

00:07:59.087 --> 00:08:02.891
which is the connection
between these old ideas

00:08:02.891 --> 00:08:05.427
about morals of trade and
the kind of work that I do

00:08:05.427 --> 00:08:08.468
about the 21st century food movement,

00:08:08.468 --> 00:08:12.280
fair trade is about making
sure that the producers

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:16.377
get sufficient money for
the work that they do,

00:08:16.377 --> 00:08:20.252
that there is no child or forced labor,

00:08:20.252 --> 00:08:23.620
that there's no discrimination
as gender equity,

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:27.445
there is capacity-building,
and there's a lot of concern

00:08:27.445 --> 00:08:31.162
about the environmental impact
of what people are doing.

00:08:31.162 --> 00:08:35.080
These are all part of
today's food movement.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.513
But I wanna start this,

00:08:37.513 --> 00:08:41.048
from work of Kate Clancy in 1982.

00:08:41.048 --> 00:08:44.548
Kate Clancy was a doctoral graduate of the

00:08:45.445 --> 00:08:49.874
I think the Nutritional
Science Program here,

00:08:49.874 --> 00:08:52.899
and in 1982, she wrote
a paper that, for me,

00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:55.737
was absolutely life-changing.

00:08:55.737 --> 00:08:57.928
She asked a question that I didn't think

00:08:57.928 --> 00:08:59.927
anybody had ever asked before.

00:08:59.927 --> 00:09:02.618
"Is it moral, is it ethical

00:09:02.618 --> 00:09:06.531
"for food companies to
make and profit from

00:09:06.531 --> 00:09:09.997
"highly processed foods
of low nutritional value,

00:09:09.997 --> 00:09:12.937
"what we rudely called junk foods?

00:09:12.937 --> 00:09:16.628
"Is it moral to urge people
to consume such foods?

00:09:16.628 --> 00:09:21.260
"Is it moral to market
such foods for children?"

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:25.742
This, I have to say, changed
the way I thought about

00:09:25.742 --> 00:09:29.248
the whole issue of food
choice and food production.

00:09:29.248 --> 00:09:32.975
And if bringing that right up to 2017,

00:09:32.975 --> 00:09:36.760
I wanna add a few questions to that.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:40.231
Is it moral to sell and market
ultra-processed junk foods?

00:09:40.231 --> 00:09:42.419
That question still exists.

00:09:42.419 --> 00:09:47.316
To support unhealthful,
inequitable food environments?

00:09:47.316 --> 00:09:50.442
To market junk foods
in developing economies

00:09:50.442 --> 00:09:53.258
where people certainly don't need them?

00:09:53.258 --> 00:09:56.514
To work as hard as they possible can

00:09:56.514 --> 00:09:59.516
to oppose any public health effort

00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:02.081
to improve dietary intake?

00:10:02.081 --> 00:10:04.823
To spy on public health advocates?

00:10:04.823 --> 00:10:08.568
To fund health organizations
to buy their silence

00:10:08.568 --> 00:10:10.151
around food issues?

00:10:11.252 --> 00:10:14.438
Or to fund research to
promote and protect sales

00:10:14.438 --> 00:10:16.911
of products, which is
the subject of the book

00:10:16.911 --> 00:10:18.787
I'm working on now.

00:10:18.787 --> 00:10:21.811
I think these questions are
really important to ask.

00:10:21.811 --> 00:10:25.084
And they're questions that
drive the food movement.

00:10:25.084 --> 00:10:28.202
And I approached these questions from

00:10:28.202 --> 00:10:31.499
what is called these days food systems.

00:10:31.499 --> 00:10:34.321
Food systems has a lot of meanings

00:10:34.321 --> 00:10:35.940
for a lot of different people.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.169
I'm gonna give you my version of it,

00:10:38.169 --> 00:10:42.686
which is everything about food
production and consumption

00:10:42.686 --> 00:10:46.019
from science to agricultural production,

00:10:47.539 --> 00:10:51.171
to nutrition, to public
health and to food advocacy

00:10:51.171 --> 00:10:54.505
for a healthier and more
sustainable food system.

00:10:54.505 --> 00:10:56.672
It's just the big picture.

00:10:58.108 --> 00:11:00.478
I'm interested in the big
picture because I think

00:11:00.478 --> 00:11:03.172
the most important public health problems

00:11:03.172 --> 00:11:06.874
that face the world today
have to do with food issues.

00:11:06.874 --> 00:11:09.109
Most important in the sense of the number

00:11:09.109 --> 00:11:11.373
of people that they affect.

00:11:11.373 --> 00:11:15.471
Food, obviously, affects
everyone, everyone eats.

00:11:15.471 --> 00:11:18.664
So, the three big problems
are food insecurity,

00:11:18.664 --> 00:11:21.931
not having enough food
to meet daily needs,

00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:26.725
obesity and its personal and
public health consequences,

00:11:26.725 --> 00:11:30.620
and the environmental
impact of our food choices.

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:33.484
Let me just say a little
bit about each of those

00:11:33.484 --> 00:11:35.380
to get us started on this.

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:38.852
The Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations

00:11:38.852 --> 00:11:42.992
says that about 800
million people in the world

00:11:42.992 --> 00:11:45.791
do not have enough food on a daily basis

00:11:45.791 --> 00:11:47.458
to meet their needs.

00:11:48.397 --> 00:11:51.960
That is great news because it represents

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.960
a decline of 200 million since 1990.

00:11:56.559 --> 00:12:00.437
If you believe the figures
and there's some question

00:12:00.437 --> 00:12:02.392
about whether these figures are accurate

00:12:02.392 --> 00:12:06.798
or whether they represent
the result of a change

00:12:06.798 --> 00:12:08.883
in the way the counting was done,

00:12:08.883 --> 00:12:10.861
whatever it is, there are a lot of people

00:12:10.861 --> 00:12:12.530
who don't have enough food.

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:14.417
There are people like
that in the United States

00:12:14.417 --> 00:12:16.342
and there are plenty of people like that

00:12:16.342 --> 00:12:17.714
throughout the world.

00:12:17.714 --> 00:12:19.642
It's a huge problem.

00:12:19.642 --> 00:12:23.307
At the same time, there are
probably two billion people

00:12:23.307 --> 00:12:25.954
who are overweight to the
point where they've developed

00:12:25.954 --> 00:12:29.756
risks or have symptoms of chronic diseases

00:12:29.756 --> 00:12:33.086
such as Type II Diabetes,
heart disease and so forth,

00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:37.157
and what is remarkable
about the obesity issue

00:12:37.157 --> 00:12:40.005
is that it's a worldwide phenomenon,

00:12:40.005 --> 00:12:43.316
and men and women all over the world,

00:12:43.316 --> 00:12:46.915
in every area of the
world, particularly Asia,

00:12:46.915 --> 00:12:50.695
Southeast Asia, southern
Europe and Latin America,

00:12:50.695 --> 00:12:55.396
are gaining weight, developing
symptoms of Type II Diabetes

00:12:55.396 --> 00:12:58.699
in countries that do not have the capacity

00:12:58.699 --> 00:13:00.969
to help them with treatment.

00:13:00.969 --> 00:13:04.040
It would be much better
if they could present it,

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.937
if they could prevent those conditions.

00:13:06.937 --> 00:13:11.538
And what joins the two has to
do with socio-economic status

00:13:11.538 --> 00:13:15.538
and inequity in income,
education and resources.

00:13:16.712 --> 00:13:18.686
This article talked about the growing

00:13:18.686 --> 00:13:22.999
socio-economic disparity
in dietary quality

00:13:22.999 --> 00:13:27.501
that leads to both under-nutrition
and over-nutrition,

00:13:27.501 --> 00:13:29.356
and this was a relatively recent article

00:13:29.356 --> 00:13:32.293
from just a few years
ago, but the first time

00:13:32.293 --> 00:13:35.173
that I saw anything about that

00:13:35.173 --> 00:13:39.340
was in the New York Times
magazine in 1996, 20 years ago,

00:13:41.377 --> 00:13:45.718
which had a cover story on
how we eat in America divided.

00:13:45.718 --> 00:13:49.341
And it talked about how
different the diets were

00:13:49.341 --> 00:13:52.077
of people who are educated and had money

00:13:52.077 --> 00:13:54.277
and people who didn't have money

00:13:54.277 --> 00:13:58.553
and didn't have resources,
so that dietary quality

00:13:58.553 --> 00:14:02.230
was not only a matter of personal choice,

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:06.397
it was also a matter of social
class and the environment.

00:14:08.111 --> 00:14:10.659
Very important concept
in trying to figure out

00:14:10.659 --> 00:14:13.025
how we're going to deal with these issues.

00:14:13.025 --> 00:14:16.358
The third aspect of the food system that

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:20.368
is a worldwide phenomenon is the effect

00:14:20.368 --> 00:14:24.535
of agricultural production
on greenhouse gas emissions,

00:14:25.459 --> 00:14:27.139
and this is one view of it.

00:14:27.139 --> 00:14:29.140
I don't wanna push this too hard

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:32.463
because I'm not sure
what the exact figure is.

00:14:32.463 --> 00:14:36.630
There are estimates from
10% of greenhouse gases

00:14:37.519 --> 00:14:40.371
to 25 or 30% of greenhouse gases

00:14:40.371 --> 00:14:42.954
due to the way we produce food.

00:14:43.845 --> 00:14:48.759
Whatever it is, it's a big chunk
of greenhouse gas emissions

00:14:48.759 --> 00:14:52.230
and if we had a better
and more sustainable way

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:56.230
of producing food, we
would be helping to prevent

00:14:56.230 --> 00:15:00.709
the climate change that seems
to be happening so rapidly.

00:15:00.709 --> 00:15:04.717
Our food choices also
affect climate change,

00:15:04.717 --> 00:15:07.811
and this is an estimation of the effect

00:15:07.811 --> 00:15:12.784
of our dietary choices on
greenhouse gas emissions

00:15:12.784 --> 00:15:16.534
and what it shows is
that red meat production

00:15:18.461 --> 00:15:21.909
and consumption are the
single greatest contributors

00:15:21.909 --> 00:15:24.757
to greenhouse gases from the foods we eat.

00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:28.924
Animal foods in general are 60%
of greenhouse gas emissions,

00:15:30.667 --> 00:15:34.084
another 25% from processed foods,

00:15:34.084 --> 00:15:36.012
and the ones that are
the lowest are fruits

00:15:36.012 --> 00:15:38.781
and vegetables and grains, just the foods

00:15:38.781 --> 00:15:42.326
that nutritionists are
always telling you to eat,

00:15:42.326 --> 00:15:44.862
a point that I will come back to.

00:15:44.862 --> 00:15:46.467
So, what do we do about this?

00:15:46.467 --> 00:15:50.134
Well, Michael Pollan,
who's on this faculty,

00:15:51.154 --> 00:15:54.019
it is so simple to tell people what to eat

00:15:54.019 --> 00:15:56.936
that he could do it in seven words.

00:15:58.613 --> 00:16:00.448
And really, they work.

00:16:00.448 --> 00:16:04.230
Eat food, not too much, mostly plants,

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:06.631
a really terrific way of putting it.

00:16:06.631 --> 00:16:08.573
By food, he means real foods

00:16:08.573 --> 00:16:10.749
that are relatively unprocessed.

00:16:10.749 --> 00:16:14.407
I have a slightly more
complicated way of putting it.

00:16:14.407 --> 00:16:16.495
If you're worried about obesity,

00:16:16.495 --> 00:16:18.340
you need to make better food choices,

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:19.774
you have to eat less,

00:16:19.774 --> 00:16:21.045
and you need to move more

00:16:21.045 --> 00:16:23.545
and, please don't eat my book.

00:16:24.438 --> 00:16:27.254
But if it seems more
complicated than this,

00:16:27.254 --> 00:16:30.130
it's because of the effect
of this kind of advice

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:31.324
on the food system.

00:16:31.324 --> 00:16:33.217
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans

00:16:33.217 --> 00:16:35.320
that came out last year
or the year before,

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.070
the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines,

00:16:39.586 --> 00:16:42.140
basically say the same
things as Michael Pollan did,

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:44.445
to eat more fruits and
vegetables and grains

00:16:44.445 --> 00:16:48.300
and whole foods, and eat
less processed foods,

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:51.684
ultra-processed junk foods,
whatever you wanna call them.

00:16:51.684 --> 00:16:54.813
But the problem is, and
it's a huge problem,

00:16:54.813 --> 00:16:57.164
is that the profits of the food industry

00:16:57.164 --> 00:16:58.749
are in the junk foods.

00:16:58.749 --> 00:17:01.477
That's where the money is.

00:17:01.477 --> 00:17:04.533
And so there are huge economic forces

00:17:04.533 --> 00:17:09.314
that are operating against
trying to eat more healthfully.

00:17:09.314 --> 00:17:13.892
And those economic forces are
very difficult to deal with.

00:17:13.892 --> 00:17:16.341
For one thing, they advertise,

00:17:16.341 --> 00:17:20.447
and there's a reason why so
much of the food industry's

00:17:20.447 --> 00:17:24.149
advertising dollars go
into processed foods

00:17:24.149 --> 00:17:26.140
rather than go into fruits and vegetable.

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:29.076
Virtually nothing goes
into fruits and vegetables

00:17:29.076 --> 00:17:32.246
but the numbers that I'm
showing on this slide

00:17:32.246 --> 00:17:36.148
are numbers that are
really hard to come by.

00:17:36.148 --> 00:17:39.804
And these are individual
advertising budgets

00:17:39.804 --> 00:17:42.825
for specific food products.

00:17:42.825 --> 00:17:46.242
I think the number $30 billion,
which is food, beverage

00:17:46.242 --> 00:17:50.787
and restaurant advertising
is too big to understand,

00:17:50.787 --> 00:17:54.556
but you can understand $30 million annual

00:17:54.556 --> 00:17:56.867
advertising budget for pop tarts

00:17:56.867 --> 00:17:59.276
just in the United States,

00:17:59.276 --> 00:18:01.109
$110 million for M&amp;Ms,

00:18:02.283 --> 00:18:05.482
$148 million for Reese's
peanut butter cups,

00:18:05.482 --> 00:18:08.244
that might have something to
do with why you like them,

00:18:08.244 --> 00:18:11.911
and $254 million just
for classic Coca-Cola,

00:18:12.881 --> 00:18:15.455
not any of the other
products that they do.

00:18:15.455 --> 00:18:18.136
These are staggering amounts of money

00:18:18.136 --> 00:18:20.342
in public health terms.

00:18:20.342 --> 00:18:22.883
No public health agency
has this kind of money

00:18:22.883 --> 00:18:26.189
to work on public
education or anything else.

00:18:26.189 --> 00:18:29.818
And the government
supports this kind of thing

00:18:29.818 --> 00:18:34.137
by allowing food marketing
to be a business expense

00:18:34.137 --> 00:18:37.647
and deductible from corporate taxes.

00:18:37.647 --> 00:18:39.946
That's something to think about.

00:18:39.946 --> 00:18:41.893
Another thing the food industry did

00:18:41.893 --> 00:18:44.760
was to make larger portions.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.257
They did that because policies

00:18:47.257 --> 00:18:50.465
that encourage farmers to grow more food,

00:18:50.465 --> 00:18:53.639
this happened in the 1970s and early '80s,

00:18:53.639 --> 00:18:58.490
but today, the restaurant
portions are four times

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:00.640
what they were in 1950,

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.688
and they're probably two
or three times higher

00:19:02.688 --> 00:19:04.784
than they were in 1980.

00:19:04.784 --> 00:19:08.219
And if I had one thing that I could teach

00:19:08.219 --> 00:19:11.622
the American public and
entire world about nutrition,

00:19:11.622 --> 00:19:16.487
it would be this: larger
portions have more calories.

00:19:16.487 --> 00:19:19.330
(audience laughing)

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:22.673
This is so not intuitively obvious

00:19:22.673 --> 00:19:26.933
that it really is born and
I think that larger portions

00:19:26.933 --> 00:19:31.016
are a sufficient explanation
for why people began

00:19:32.037 --> 00:19:35.340
to gain weight in the early 1980s.

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:38.430
Portions got bigger, bagels got bigger,

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:40.771
sodas got bigger, everything got bigger,

00:19:40.771 --> 00:19:42.238
people got bigger.

00:19:42.238 --> 00:19:44.938
Pretty easy to understand.

00:19:44.938 --> 00:19:47.714
Another critically important point

00:19:47.714 --> 00:19:51.031
that bears on the
policies and, if you like,

00:19:51.031 --> 00:19:54.384
the morals of the policies
that we're talking about

00:19:54.384 --> 00:19:57.614
and that has to do with the
relative changing prices

00:19:57.614 --> 00:20:01.440
between 1980, which is
the start of the rise

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:05.098
in the problems of obesity,
and the present time.

00:20:05.098 --> 00:20:06.675
The slide may be hard to read

00:20:06.675 --> 00:20:08.553
but the line in the middle of it

00:20:08.553 --> 00:20:13.145
is the relative increase
in price that occurred

00:20:13.145 --> 00:20:15.605
in the entire food system.

00:20:15.605 --> 00:20:18.154
What you can see is fresh
fruits and vegetables

00:20:18.154 --> 00:20:20.674
and processed foods and vegetables,

00:20:20.674 --> 00:20:24.400
their prices increased at
a much, much higher rate

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.849
than the prices of, for
example, sugars and fats

00:20:27.849 --> 00:20:29.734
which we're supposed to eat less of,

00:20:29.734 --> 00:20:34.071
and soft drinks which I wrote
a book about eating less of.

00:20:34.071 --> 00:20:38.938
So, this is, I think, the
result of federal policies

00:20:38.938 --> 00:20:41.280
that allow the prices of some foods

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.082
to be higher than others,

00:20:44.082 --> 00:20:46.264
and this is a complicated issue,

00:20:46.264 --> 00:20:48.600
but if poor people think
that fruits and vegetables

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:51.683
are expensive, it's because they are.

00:20:52.634 --> 00:20:55.833
And so we have a system
in which the government,

00:20:55.833 --> 00:20:58.067
in conjunction with the food industry,

00:20:58.067 --> 00:21:00.704
have created an environment
that encourages people

00:21:00.704 --> 00:21:05.409
to eat more, and to eat more
of the wrong kinds of foods.

00:21:05.409 --> 00:21:09.576
So if that's how our policy
has led, then we change policy.

00:21:11.476 --> 00:21:14.618
And a couple of years ago,
Mark Bittman, Michael Pollan,

00:21:14.618 --> 00:21:18.454
Ricardo Salvador and Olivier De Schutter

00:21:18.454 --> 00:21:21.246
wrote a document for the Washington Post

00:21:21.246 --> 00:21:24.746
about how a national food policy is needed

00:21:25.664 --> 00:21:28.369
and could save millions of American lives.

00:21:28.369 --> 00:21:30.007
It's a very interesting article to read

00:21:30.007 --> 00:21:33.229
and had lots and lots of
advice about things to do,

00:21:33.229 --> 00:21:35.595
but I think it missed
a very important point.

00:21:35.595 --> 00:21:37.960
And it's a point that I wanna talk about,

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.771
which is that in the United States,

00:21:39.771 --> 00:21:44.165
we have food policies
but they are divided.

00:21:44.165 --> 00:21:47.173
We have a food policy that
deals with consumption,

00:21:47.173 --> 00:21:49.083
that's nutrition policy,

00:21:49.083 --> 00:21:51.172
and a food policy that
deals with production,

00:21:51.172 --> 00:21:53.082
that's agricultural policy,

00:21:53.082 --> 00:21:55.004
the Farm Bill and so forth,

00:21:55.004 --> 00:21:59.182
and these have nothing
whatsoever to do with each other.

00:21:59.182 --> 00:22:02.150
And I think this is a
very, very serious problem

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:04.965
in our country, and one
that needs to be fixed.

00:22:04.965 --> 00:22:08.882
So, let me introduce this
by asking a question.

00:22:10.044 --> 00:22:12.772
In the United States Nutrition Policy,

00:22:12.772 --> 00:22:14.522
where is agriculture?

00:22:16.011 --> 00:22:19.083
United States Nutrition
Policy is expressed

00:22:19.083 --> 00:22:21.913
in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans,

00:22:21.913 --> 00:22:23.249
which is a document produced

00:22:23.249 --> 00:22:24.713
by the Department of Agriculture

00:22:24.713 --> 00:22:28.897
and Health and Human Services since 1980.

00:22:28.897 --> 00:22:32.305
It comes out every five
years by order of Congress

00:22:32.305 --> 00:22:36.222
and this is the panoply
of examples since 1980.

00:22:38.257 --> 00:22:41.391
The most recent one, as I
said before, came out in 2015,

00:22:41.391 --> 00:22:44.497
actually came out early in 2016.

00:22:44.497 --> 00:22:48.299
So, the dietary guidelines are organized.

00:22:48.299 --> 00:22:50.764
The way they are currently done is

00:22:50.764 --> 00:22:55.190
academic community gets together
and reviews the literature

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:58.107
and writes a research document that

00:22:59.136 --> 00:23:02.301
in the case of this one, was 600 pages.

00:23:02.301 --> 00:23:05.296
And in that document,
the Dietary Guidelines

00:23:05.296 --> 00:23:08.017
Advisory Committee made this statement

00:23:08.017 --> 00:23:11.740
that a diet that had more plant foods

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:16.157
and fewer animal foods
will promote health more

00:23:16.157 --> 00:23:20.238
and will be less
environmentally unfriendly

00:23:20.238 --> 00:23:22.488
than the current U.S. diet.

00:23:23.483 --> 00:23:26.265
Something that you would
think that everybody

00:23:26.265 --> 00:23:28.152
could pretty much agree on.

00:23:28.152 --> 00:23:30.722
The meat industry didn't like it.

00:23:30.722 --> 00:23:33.044
They didn't like it a lot.

00:23:33.044 --> 00:23:36.045
They viewed the Dietary
Guidelines Advisory Committee

00:23:36.045 --> 00:23:38.878
report as an attack on the meat industry

00:23:38.878 --> 00:23:43.233
and the reacted just the
way you would think that

00:23:43.233 --> 00:23:47.313
a meat industry that was
being attacked would react.

00:23:47.313 --> 00:23:49.642
And they went straight to Congress.

00:23:49.642 --> 00:23:51.568
That's how the food
industry works these days.

00:23:51.568 --> 00:23:53.352
If they don't like what
the agencies are doing,

00:23:53.352 --> 00:23:54.929
they go to Congress.

00:23:54.929 --> 00:23:57.479
And Congress, in its infinite wisdom,

00:23:57.479 --> 00:24:01.562
put into a House Agricultural
Appropriations Bill

00:24:03.458 --> 00:24:06.483
a statement that the Advisory Committee

00:24:06.483 --> 00:24:07.951
for the Dietary Guidelines

00:24:07.951 --> 00:24:10.486
is behaving in a very unpleasant way,

00:24:10.486 --> 00:24:13.408
it's interested in
sustainability, climate change

00:24:13.408 --> 00:24:15.218
and other things that we would rather

00:24:15.218 --> 00:24:18.226
that they did not talk about,

00:24:18.226 --> 00:24:21.338
and we expect the Secretary of Agriculture

00:24:21.338 --> 00:24:23.195
to make sure that not one word of this

00:24:23.195 --> 00:24:25.575
gets into the Dietary Guidelines.

00:24:25.575 --> 00:24:27.740
And that's, in fact, what happened.

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:30.823
Secretary Tom Vilsack, in March 2015,

00:24:32.257 --> 00:24:37.185
six months before the Dietary
Guidelines were released,

00:24:37.185 --> 00:24:39.820
made the statement that
sustainability issues

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:43.603
fall outside the scope of
the Dietary Guidelines,

00:24:43.603 --> 00:24:45.893
and when the Dietary
Guidelines were released

00:24:45.893 --> 00:24:49.269
six months later, the word sustainability

00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:52.975
does not appear anywhere in the document

00:24:52.975 --> 00:24:55.392
in its 144 pages, searchable.

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.599
You will not find that word.

00:24:58.599 --> 00:25:02.766
So, so much for agriculture
as part of nutrition policy.

00:25:04.753 --> 00:25:08.188
The Dietary Guidelines
Committee tried, they failed.

00:25:08.188 --> 00:25:12.355
What about agriculture
policy considering nutrition,

00:25:13.336 --> 00:25:17.696
obesity, over-consumption
and any of the other

00:25:17.696 --> 00:25:20.127
kinds of things that
we're concerned about?

00:25:20.127 --> 00:25:22.668
Well, this brings us to the Farm Bill

00:25:22.668 --> 00:25:25.235
and the Berkeley Food Institute

00:25:25.235 --> 00:25:28.046
is having a meeting in
Washington next week

00:25:28.046 --> 00:25:30.812
in which they're going to be
talking about the Farm Bill.

00:25:30.812 --> 00:25:34.254
It will be fascinating to
see what they talk about

00:25:34.254 --> 00:25:35.915
and what they think is going to happen

00:25:35.915 --> 00:25:37.932
in the present administration.

00:25:37.932 --> 00:25:40.373
But I can tell you what
the last administration

00:25:40.373 --> 00:25:42.397
thought about it.

00:25:42.397 --> 00:25:45.980
President Obama said
of the 2014 Farm Bill,

00:25:47.536 --> 00:25:50.119
"It's like a Swiss Army knife."

00:25:51.164 --> 00:25:53.284
I don't know exactly what he meant by that

00:25:53.284 --> 00:25:56.698
but what I think he means
is it does a lot of things

00:25:56.698 --> 00:25:59.252
but it doesn't do any of them very well.

00:25:59.252 --> 00:26:01.569
(audience laughing)

00:26:01.569 --> 00:26:04.732
So, the Farm Bill, what can
we say about the Farm Bill?

00:26:04.732 --> 00:26:07.090
U.S. agriculture policy,

00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:09.412
does it say anything about nutrition?

00:26:09.412 --> 00:26:11.102
Yes, it does.

00:26:11.102 --> 00:26:13.270
The Department of Agriculture came out

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:15.687
with the My Plate food guide,

00:26:17.208 --> 00:26:20.057
and that says very clearly,

00:26:20.057 --> 00:26:23.942
"Make half your plate
fruits and vegetables."

00:26:23.942 --> 00:26:26.090
Half you plate, fruits and vegetables.

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:31.013
Okay, so what else does the
Department of Agriculture do?

00:26:31.013 --> 00:26:34.641
Well, we have Representative
Chellie Pingree from Maine

00:26:34.641 --> 00:26:39.085
to thank for this particular
document which covered

00:26:39.085 --> 00:26:43.163
the agricultural subsidies
from the Farm Bill

00:26:43.163 --> 00:26:47.330
of 2008, from 2008 to 2012,
and what it showed was

00:26:48.892 --> 00:26:52.559
that 0.45%, less than a half of percent

00:26:53.719 --> 00:26:57.078
of the total agricultural
money that was spent

00:26:57.078 --> 00:27:00.125
on farm supports of any kind

00:27:00.125 --> 00:27:01.916
went to fruits and vegetables.

00:27:01.916 --> 00:27:04.342
The rest of it went to corn, soybeans,

00:27:04.342 --> 00:27:06.814
oils, cotton, and so forth.

00:27:06.814 --> 00:27:10.231
Even more of a percentage went to tobacco

00:27:11.331 --> 00:27:13.073
than went to fruits and vegetables.

00:27:13.073 --> 00:27:15.215
So there's a big disconnect

00:27:15.215 --> 00:27:18.865
between parts of the
Department of Agriculture

00:27:18.865 --> 00:27:23.139
and nutrition is not part
of agricultural policy.

00:27:23.139 --> 00:27:26.597
It absolutely should be, and I hope, Ann,

00:27:26.597 --> 00:27:31.144
that you will make sure that
that conference says so.

00:27:31.144 --> 00:27:35.311
So given this situation, what
is the poor consumer to do?

00:27:36.785 --> 00:27:38.301
If people are consumed about

00:27:38.301 --> 00:27:39.944
what they're supposed to be eating,

00:27:39.944 --> 00:27:42.997
it's because they're
getting very mixed messages,

00:27:42.997 --> 00:27:46.375
from government, from
nutritionists, from everybody.

00:27:46.375 --> 00:27:50.132
And trying to figure
out your way to navigate

00:27:50.132 --> 00:27:54.741
this kind of food landscape
is extremely difficult

00:27:54.741 --> 00:27:58.096
and the solution to it is,
(audience laughing)

00:27:58.096 --> 00:28:01.318
you gotta start eating out
of a different parking lot.

00:28:01.318 --> 00:28:05.538
And what that means is
changing the food environment

00:28:05.538 --> 00:28:08.085
so that it promotes healthier eating.

00:28:08.085 --> 00:28:10.798
And I wanna talk a little bit about that.

00:28:10.798 --> 00:28:13.631
There's a new advocacy organization called

00:28:13.631 --> 00:28:18.627
Plate of the Union, that
came out just a few weeks ago

00:28:18.627 --> 00:28:23.203
with a proposal for the
Farm Bill that we emphasize

00:28:23.203 --> 00:28:27.354
more organic food, we
invest in healthy farms,

00:28:27.354 --> 00:28:29.859
we fight hunger and food insecurity,

00:28:29.859 --> 00:28:33.267
and revitalize the land,
and reduce food waste.

00:28:33.267 --> 00:28:36.035
Reducing food waste is
probably the easiest of those,

00:28:36.035 --> 00:28:39.171
which is why there is
so much interest in it.

00:28:39.171 --> 00:28:42.923
But I think there are other
food movement policies as well

00:28:42.923 --> 00:28:44.699
that are important to look at.

00:28:44.699 --> 00:28:48.122
And this is a slide I've
used for a long time.

00:28:48.122 --> 00:28:52.298
Looking at the various
aspects of the food movement

00:28:52.298 --> 00:28:56.843
all done in revolutionary
terms as slow food revolution,

00:28:56.843 --> 00:29:00.848
the organic revolution, the
local (mumbles) movement,

00:29:00.848 --> 00:29:04.848
and even the occupy
movement, are all parts of a

00:29:05.887 --> 00:29:10.169
enormous collection of
groups that are working

00:29:10.169 --> 00:29:15.059
to try to make diets healthier
and more sustainable.

00:29:15.059 --> 00:29:18.588
I wrote a book about food
advocacy called Soda Politics

00:29:18.588 --> 00:29:21.909
that came out two years
ago, and a lot of it

00:29:21.909 --> 00:29:24.451
was about how you advocate
for healthier diets

00:29:24.451 --> 00:29:26.708
using sodas as an example.

00:29:26.708 --> 00:29:30.875
And I subtitled the book
Taking on Big Soda and winning

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:36.670
because I think that the
soft drinks story is one

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:39.752
where advocates have
had a very big impact.

00:29:39.752 --> 00:29:43.878
And the impact is easiest
to see in sales of sugar,

00:29:43.878 --> 00:29:48.298
sweet and beverages, which
peaked in the late 1990s

00:29:48.298 --> 00:29:50.705
and have been going down
steadily ever since.

00:29:50.705 --> 00:29:53.777
And this year was the
first year in which sales

00:29:53.777 --> 00:29:57.144
of bottled water exceeded sales of sugar,

00:29:57.144 --> 00:29:59.641
sweet and beverages Coke and Pepsi.

00:29:59.641 --> 00:30:02.425
Whether we all ought to be
drinking water in bottles

00:30:02.425 --> 00:30:04.587
is another story.

00:30:04.587 --> 00:30:07.337
Let's save that for another talk.

00:30:08.863 --> 00:30:11.093
From the standpoint of
the soft drink industry,

00:30:11.093 --> 00:30:13.821
this has been enormous disruption.

00:30:13.821 --> 00:30:16.247
They think it's due to health advocacy.

00:30:16.247 --> 00:30:19.543
I'm not going to argue
with them about that.

00:30:19.543 --> 00:30:24.066
Now, the reason for focusing
on sugar, sweet and beverages

00:30:24.066 --> 00:30:26.816
is that they provide roughly half

00:30:28.067 --> 00:30:30.555
of the sugars in the American diet.

00:30:30.555 --> 00:30:32.878
And the amount of sugar
that's in soft drinks

00:30:32.878 --> 00:30:34.909
is absolutely staggering.

00:30:34.909 --> 00:30:37.395
You can't see it, you can't taste it,

00:30:37.395 --> 00:30:41.227
you don't realize it's there
but there's really a lot.

00:30:41.227 --> 00:30:43.357
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans

00:30:43.357 --> 00:30:47.500
and the World Health
Organization both advise

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:52.384
having no more than 10%
of your daily calories

00:30:52.384 --> 00:30:54.541
from added sugars.

00:30:54.541 --> 00:30:57.694
To give you an idea of how little that is,

00:30:57.694 --> 00:31:01.694
10% of calories, I've
shown here a 16-ounce

00:31:03.254 --> 00:31:05.125
soft drink or Coca-Cola.

00:31:05.125 --> 00:31:08.834
This is the size that Mayor Bloomberg

00:31:08.834 --> 00:31:10.667
wanted to cap sodas at

00:31:11.656 --> 00:31:15.823
and it contains about 180
calories and 49 grams of sugar.

00:31:17.595 --> 00:31:20.872
If you have a 2,000-calorie a day diet,

00:31:20.872 --> 00:31:23.745
you're allowed 50 grams of sugar a day.

00:31:23.745 --> 00:31:26.328
One 16-ounce soda has 49 grams.

00:31:27.992 --> 00:31:30.903
So this is a big cut back in sugar.

00:31:30.903 --> 00:31:35.134
It's another reason why soft
drinks are such a easy target

00:31:35.134 --> 00:31:37.596
because they have so much sugar in them.

00:31:37.596 --> 00:31:40.306
Sugar has no nutrients, whatever.

00:31:40.306 --> 00:31:42.663
So the soft drink industry has been under

00:31:42.663 --> 00:31:45.519
extraordinary scrutiny lately,

00:31:45.519 --> 00:31:48.264
scrutiny for its business
practices as this

00:31:48.264 --> 00:31:52.431
Bloomberg Business Week
slightly offensive cover showed,

00:31:53.424 --> 00:31:57.591
scrutiny for its practices
in marketing to children.

00:31:59.067 --> 00:32:01.953
The major soda companies
have said that they will not

00:32:01.953 --> 00:32:04.868
market to children under the age of 12

00:32:04.868 --> 00:32:08.020
on television programs aimed at children

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:09.619
under the age of 12.

00:32:09.619 --> 00:32:13.647
This sounds great but if you
think about it for two seconds,

00:32:13.647 --> 00:32:16.358
you realize that there
are many, many loopholes

00:32:16.358 --> 00:32:19.974
in that kind of marketing,
and every group that has tried

00:32:19.974 --> 00:32:23.722
to evaluate whether soft
drinks are, in fact,

00:32:23.722 --> 00:32:25.820
marketing to children under the age of 12

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:29.330
finds that they are in many other ways

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:33.522
as this Sugary Drink FACTS
report from the Rudd Center

00:32:33.522 --> 00:32:37.076
in Connecticut came out and said.

00:32:37.076 --> 00:32:39.420
The soft drink companies
are also under scrutiny

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:42.173
for marketing to minorities,
which is something

00:32:42.173 --> 00:32:45.006
that there's a long history about,

00:32:46.078 --> 00:32:49.828
but minority groups are
the largest consumers

00:32:51.008 --> 00:32:52.759
of sugar, sweet and beverages,

00:32:52.759 --> 00:32:57.119
and that's where the
marketing effort is going.

00:32:57.119 --> 00:33:00.916
I mentioned Bloomberg's soda cap idea

00:33:00.916 --> 00:33:05.379
because it's another place
where ethical issues come in

00:33:05.379 --> 00:33:07.808
and where the question is, is it ethical

00:33:07.808 --> 00:33:12.805
for food companies to fight
public health measures?

00:33:12.805 --> 00:33:16.330
So here was Bloomberg
who wanted to put a cap

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:20.497
on the size of sodas sold in
New York City at 16 ounces,

00:33:22.483 --> 00:33:26.641
and the soda industry
went absolutely ballistic

00:33:26.641 --> 00:33:29.500
and eventually took the city to court,

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:33.766
won the suit, and ended
that whole enterprise.

00:33:33.766 --> 00:33:35.253
I'm not gonna say too much about that

00:33:35.253 --> 00:33:37.604
because I don't think that
the Bloomberg administration

00:33:37.604 --> 00:33:39.707
handled it very well.

00:33:39.707 --> 00:33:42.842
And there's a chapter
in my book that explains

00:33:42.842 --> 00:33:45.930
what they didn't do that they should have.

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:49.933
But the fact the soda
industry fought so hard

00:33:49.933 --> 00:33:54.100
and spent untold millions of
dollars to fight the soda cap

00:33:57.027 --> 00:34:01.532
is one of those questions that
raises a moral and ethical

00:34:01.532 --> 00:34:06.206
issue in the context of
what we're talking about.

00:34:06.206 --> 00:34:09.725
These issues also came up in the context

00:34:09.725 --> 00:34:14.137
of the New York Times
revelations in August 2015

00:34:14.137 --> 00:34:17.754
that Coca-Cola had been
funding a group of researchers

00:34:17.754 --> 00:34:21.533
on obesity to argue that physical activity

00:34:21.533 --> 00:34:24.509
was the problem with gaining weight,

00:34:24.509 --> 00:34:27.889
it really didn't have anything
to do with what you ate.

00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:30.534
And this was so incredible

00:34:30.534 --> 00:34:33.982
and raised such questions of incredulity

00:34:33.982 --> 00:34:37.732
that even Fox News was
shocked as shown here.

00:34:40.536 --> 00:34:43.503
It was pretty shocking
and the reaction to it

00:34:43.503 --> 00:34:47.510
was incredulous, I don't
know how else to put it.

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:51.804
And Coca-Cola got a lot of
pushback for this revelation,

00:34:51.804 --> 00:34:54.331
so much of a pushback that a week later,

00:34:54.331 --> 00:34:58.868
the head of Coca-Cola
International, Muhtar Kent

00:34:58.868 --> 00:35:01.563
wrote an Op-Ed for the Wall Street Journal

00:35:01.563 --> 00:35:05.436
in which he said, "We've
been caught in something

00:35:05.436 --> 00:35:08.452
"we didn't even realize we were doing.

00:35:08.452 --> 00:35:10.287
"We can do better than this.

00:35:10.287 --> 00:35:13.119
"This doesn't reflect our company.

00:35:13.119 --> 00:35:17.828
"We are making a commitment
to publicly disclose

00:35:17.828 --> 00:35:20.084
"everybody that we fund,

00:35:20.084 --> 00:35:22.088
"and it was gonna take a while to do that

00:35:22.088 --> 00:35:24.701
"because we're gonna ask
everybody if they mind

00:35:24.701 --> 00:35:27.719
"if we tell, and some people did."

00:35:27.719 --> 00:35:29.055
They would rather not know that,

00:35:29.055 --> 00:35:32.552
but, in fact, they did exactly
what they were going to do

00:35:32.552 --> 00:35:34.232
and they published on their website

00:35:34.232 --> 00:35:35.913
and it is still on their website

00:35:35.913 --> 00:35:38.963
and it is still fascinating reading.

00:35:38.963 --> 00:35:41.587
They published a list
of the 1,200 individuals

00:35:41.587 --> 00:35:44.837
and organizations that Coca-Cola funds,

00:35:46.612 --> 00:35:51.112
I think for the purpose of
buying silence, if nothing else.

00:35:51.112 --> 00:35:54.713
And they published a list of
individual health professionals

00:35:54.713 --> 00:35:57.945
who consulted for or
otherwise paid by Coca-Cola.

00:35:57.945 --> 00:36:01.802
And a group called the Ninjas for Health,

00:36:01.802 --> 00:36:03.790
they're quite something,

00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:08.638
did an analysis of it
and discovered that 55%

00:36:08.638 --> 00:36:10.749
of individuals who were taking money

00:36:10.749 --> 00:36:13.551
from Coca-Cola were dieticians.

00:36:13.551 --> 00:36:17.384
So, Coco knew what it
was doing in that sense.

00:36:18.371 --> 00:36:23.094
The revelations of who got
funded had a big fallout.

00:36:23.094 --> 00:36:27.437
For one thing, a lot of the
groups were very embarrassed.

00:36:27.437 --> 00:36:29.829
The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics,

00:36:29.829 --> 00:36:31.998
the American Academy of Pediatrics,

00:36:31.998 --> 00:36:34.229
and the American Academy
of Family Practice

00:36:34.229 --> 00:36:38.926
were all organizations
with substantial opposition

00:36:38.926 --> 00:36:42.243
among their membership to collaborating

00:36:42.243 --> 00:36:44.173
and partnering with Coca-Cola,

00:36:44.173 --> 00:36:48.340
and Coca-Cola pulled out of
those three organizations.

00:36:49.444 --> 00:36:52.304
Soon after that, the
University of Colorado,

00:36:52.304 --> 00:36:53.804
which was the place where this

00:36:53.804 --> 00:36:56.733
Global Energy Balance Network was located

00:36:56.733 --> 00:37:00.532
returned a million-dollar
grant to Coca-Cola.

00:37:00.532 --> 00:37:04.076
Those of you who know anything
about university funding,

00:37:04.076 --> 00:37:07.236
that should bring a
gasp, that the university

00:37:07.236 --> 00:37:10.371
would give back a million
dollars, are you kidding?

00:37:10.371 --> 00:37:13.116
But the University of
Colorado was so embarrassed

00:37:13.116 --> 00:37:17.283
by the way this money appeared
that they gave it back.

00:37:18.572 --> 00:37:20.872
And then Coca-Cola eventually pulled out

00:37:20.872 --> 00:37:22.456
of the Global Energy Balance Network

00:37:22.456 --> 00:37:24.768
and that was the end of that,

00:37:24.768 --> 00:37:28.918
or almost the end of that,
because what happened next

00:37:28.918 --> 00:37:33.800
was that reporters started
using open records requests

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:36.470
and getting emails from the researchers

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:39.553
who were taking money from Coca-Cola.

00:37:41.211 --> 00:37:44.288
I'm very happy to be working
at a private university

00:37:44.288 --> 00:37:48.978
so my email is not FOIable,
but if you're at Berkeley,

00:37:48.978 --> 00:37:52.354
yours is, be careful,
that's all I can say.

00:37:52.354 --> 00:37:56.331
So the Associated Press
was the first to publish

00:37:56.331 --> 00:37:59.735
about the emails between
Coca-Cola executives

00:37:59.735 --> 00:38:03.230
and these researchers, and
they quoted Rhona Applebaum

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:07.397
who was then the Chief
Scientific Officer at Coca-Cola,

00:38:08.327 --> 00:38:11.624
talking about how the Global
Energy Balance Network

00:38:11.624 --> 00:38:14.874
at Colorado was a weapon in their fight

00:38:16.105 --> 00:38:20.272
against radical organizations
and their proponents.

00:38:21.127 --> 00:38:24.447
I guess they mean by that, people like me

00:38:24.447 --> 00:38:26.409
who were thinking that soda taxes

00:38:26.409 --> 00:38:28.434
really weren't such a terrible idea.

00:38:28.434 --> 00:38:32.563
In any case, on the day
that the Associated Press

00:38:32.563 --> 00:38:36.730
published the article about
these emails, she resigned.

00:38:37.862 --> 00:38:39.445
What a coincidence.

00:38:40.589 --> 00:38:44.542
Then Coca-Cola, and I think not because

00:38:44.542 --> 00:38:46.843
they were trying to
hide the amount of money

00:38:46.843 --> 00:38:49.605
they were spending, but I
think they really didn't know

00:38:49.605 --> 00:38:50.958
how much money they were spending,

00:38:50.958 --> 00:38:54.708
found out that they were
spending a lot more,

00:38:55.742 --> 00:39:00.006
they now report that they've
spent about $135 million

00:39:00.006 --> 00:39:04.173
to support research and
partnerships with organizations

00:39:05.024 --> 00:39:08.284
of one kind or another,
and their partnerships

00:39:08.284 --> 00:39:11.228
tend to be with health organizations

00:39:11.228 --> 00:39:15.395
and fitness organizations,
some of them quite amazing.

00:39:17.376 --> 00:39:21.127
I don't think we've seen
the end of that yet.

00:39:21.127 --> 00:39:24.256
The Coca-Cola-sponsored
research tends to come out

00:39:24.256 --> 00:39:27.819
with results that are very
favorable to Coca-Cola.

00:39:27.819 --> 00:39:31.232
This is typical of industry-funded
research, generally.

00:39:31.232 --> 00:39:33.694
So here are three examples.

00:39:33.694 --> 00:39:38.251
The National Health and
Nutrition Examinations Survey,

00:39:38.251 --> 00:39:42.418
which is the main survey that
shows that sugary soft drinks

00:39:43.341 --> 00:39:47.457
are linked to obesity
and diabetes, that survey

00:39:47.457 --> 00:39:51.624
has no validity according to
this study funded by Coca-Cola.

00:39:53.378 --> 00:39:55.754
Any results in the
literature that indicate

00:39:55.754 --> 00:40:00.003
a link between sodas and
obesity have no validity,

00:40:00.003 --> 00:40:02.558
according to a Coca-Cola-funded study,

00:40:02.558 --> 00:40:05.245
and sugars are harmless,
according to another

00:40:05.245 --> 00:40:07.538
Coca-Cola-funded study.

00:40:07.538 --> 00:40:11.114
And in fact, this kind
of thing is so common

00:40:11.114 --> 00:40:15.148
that a group of investigators
at the end of last year

00:40:15.148 --> 00:40:16.971
published an article and an analysis

00:40:16.971 --> 00:40:19.123
in the Annals of Internal Medicine

00:40:19.123 --> 00:40:21.242
in which they asked the question,

00:40:21.242 --> 00:40:24.626
are sugary drinks related
to obesity and diabetes?

00:40:24.626 --> 00:40:26.763
And they counted up the studies

00:40:26.763 --> 00:40:28.538
that went one way or the other

00:40:28.538 --> 00:40:31.788
and they found 26 studies that said no,

00:40:32.656 --> 00:40:34.960
sugary drinks have
nothing whatsoever to do

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:36.881
with obesity and diabetes.

00:40:36.881 --> 00:40:41.094
Every single one of them was
funded either by Coca-Cola

00:40:41.094 --> 00:40:42.710
or the American Beverage Association

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:46.564
or some other industry
that they work with.

00:40:46.564 --> 00:40:50.953
On the other hand, there were
34 studies that said yes,

00:40:50.953 --> 00:40:53.714
sugary drinks are related
to obesity and diabetes,

00:40:53.714 --> 00:40:56.728
and of those, only one
was funded by industry.

00:40:56.728 --> 00:40:59.022
I bet that person never got more money.

00:40:59.022 --> 00:41:01.855
(audience laughing)

00:41:01.855 --> 00:41:05.886
So if you can't sell sodas
in the United States,

00:41:05.886 --> 00:41:07.680
sell them overseas.

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:11.367
And what's remarkable about
the effort of Coca-Cola,

00:41:11.367 --> 00:41:15.327
in particular, to sell Coca-Cola overseas

00:41:15.327 --> 00:41:18.045
is the amount of money
that it has committed,

00:41:18.045 --> 00:41:19.497
but I can tell you that Pepsi Cola

00:41:19.497 --> 00:41:21.924
has committed equivalent amounts.

00:41:21.924 --> 00:41:23.564
Center for Science in the Public Interest

00:41:23.564 --> 00:41:25.810
came out with a report last year

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:28.286
in which they added
this up in this diagram.

00:41:28.286 --> 00:41:31.322
It comes from their report,

00:41:31.322 --> 00:41:34.631
and between the numbers, refer usually to

00:41:34.631 --> 00:41:38.366
a 10-year period from 2010 to 2020,

00:41:38.366 --> 00:41:42.366
Coca-Cola is investing
$12.4 billions in Mexico.

00:41:43.358 --> 00:41:47.379
$17 billion dollars, that's a B, not an M,

00:41:47.379 --> 00:41:51.027
billion in Africa during that period.

00:41:51.027 --> 00:41:55.172
And if you just think about
what $17 billion could do

00:41:55.172 --> 00:41:57.339
for development in Africa,

00:41:58.218 --> 00:42:00.835
then the idea of building bottling plants

00:42:00.835 --> 00:42:04.361
and arranging for people
to be selling Coca-Cola

00:42:04.361 --> 00:42:07.525
seems ethically questionable.

00:42:07.525 --> 00:42:09.608
Is that a fair statement?

00:42:11.262 --> 00:42:13.782
The other thing that
came up, I'm just back

00:42:13.782 --> 00:42:17.949
from a Fulbright in Mexico at
the Institute of Public Health

00:42:19.274 --> 00:42:22.357
where these people were still reeling

00:42:24.014 --> 00:42:27.910
from having spyware
installed on their phones.

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:31.515
And this is spyware that
was invented in Israel

00:42:31.515 --> 00:42:35.682
to trace terrorists, and it
is sold only to governments,

00:42:36.568 --> 00:42:39.352
only to governments, and that must mean

00:42:39.352 --> 00:42:41.624
that somebody in the Mexican government

00:42:41.624 --> 00:42:45.207
authorized the installation
of this spyware

00:42:46.336 --> 00:42:48.419
on these people's phones.

00:42:51.012 --> 00:42:53.686
These are soda tax advocates.

00:42:53.686 --> 00:42:58.271
On the left is Simon
Barquera who works at the

00:42:58.271 --> 00:43:01.301
Institute of Public Health in Cuernavaca

00:43:01.301 --> 00:43:04.634
and is doing research on sodas in Mexico

00:43:06.127 --> 00:43:07.410
or big problem in Mexico.

00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:09.307
Mexico drinks a lot of soda

00:43:09.307 --> 00:43:12.071
and they have very high rates of obesity.

00:43:12.071 --> 00:43:15.778
And on the right is Alejandro Calvillo

00:43:15.778 --> 00:43:20.546
who's the head of the
leading advocacy organization

00:43:20.546 --> 00:43:23.379
that is fighting for the soda tax.

00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:27.360
The units with which they work

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:29.530
have Bloomberg philanthropy money

00:43:29.530 --> 00:43:32.322
so they're rather well-funded
for doing their work

00:43:32.322 --> 00:43:35.107
and they've been
extraordinarily effective,

00:43:35.107 --> 00:43:37.914
and they have spyware
installed on their phones.

00:43:37.914 --> 00:43:40.619
When you talk to them, they
collect everybody's phones

00:43:40.619 --> 00:43:44.066
and put them in the refrigerator,

00:43:44.066 --> 00:43:46.579
so that they're not being listened to.

00:43:46.579 --> 00:43:50.246
I was spied on when the
revelations came out

00:43:51.456 --> 00:43:53.873
about the leaks of the emails

00:43:57.669 --> 00:44:00.442
that came out from Hillary CLinton's,

00:44:00.442 --> 00:44:03.501
people that worked on
Hillary Clinton's campaign,

00:44:03.501 --> 00:44:06.108
there was a separate set of emails

00:44:06.108 --> 00:44:09.138
that was posted on DC Leaks
and they're still there,

00:44:09.138 --> 00:44:11.657
you can go look at them, because somebody

00:44:11.657 --> 00:44:13.595
who worked on the Hillary Clinton campaign

00:44:13.595 --> 00:44:17.478
also was consulting for
Coca-Cola at the same time.

00:44:17.478 --> 00:44:20.561
So by coincidence, when the Russians,

00:44:21.982 --> 00:44:23.243
I guess it was the Russians,

00:44:23.243 --> 00:44:27.003
picked up all these
emails and posted them,

00:44:27.003 --> 00:44:29.742
there was a collection
of Coca-Cola emails, too.

00:44:29.742 --> 00:44:33.475
And I got very quick
messages from people saying,

00:44:33.475 --> 00:44:35.537
"Marion, you're in the emails."

00:44:35.537 --> 00:44:37.586
(audience laughing)

00:44:37.586 --> 00:44:39.003
I was so excited.

00:44:41.205 --> 00:44:44.788
I was in Australia in
the winter a year ago

00:44:48.005 --> 00:44:51.113
in the early 2016, and
Coca-Cola sent somebody

00:44:51.113 --> 00:44:55.376
to a lecture that I gave at
the University of Sydney.

00:44:55.376 --> 00:44:58.825
I was talking about soda
politics which had just come out

00:44:58.825 --> 00:45:01.907
and took notes, and those
notes were passed up

00:45:01.907 --> 00:45:04.641
the chain of command and ended up

00:45:04.641 --> 00:45:07.994
in Capricia Marshall's email cache

00:45:07.994 --> 00:45:10.474
and are now posted for everybody to see.

00:45:10.474 --> 00:45:13.465
And what they recommended was that my

00:45:13.465 --> 00:45:16.187
activities in Australia be monitored.

00:45:16.187 --> 00:45:18.618
I knew that somebody at my
talk was from Coca-Cola.

00:45:18.618 --> 00:45:20.262
I assume that there's
somebody from Coca-Cola

00:45:20.262 --> 00:45:21.562
at every talk I give.

00:45:21.562 --> 00:45:24.812
Hi.
(audience laughing)

00:45:25.887 --> 00:45:28.279
So I wasn't particularly
concerned about it.

00:45:28.279 --> 00:45:33.057
I was just amused by this,
but the Sydney Morning Herald

00:45:33.057 --> 00:45:36.696
did a big article about
Coca-Cola's secret plan

00:45:36.696 --> 00:45:39.963
to monitor the woman whose
group I was working with

00:45:39.963 --> 00:45:43.825
in Australia, Lisa Bero, who
works on conflicts of interest.

00:45:43.825 --> 00:45:45.978
So that was kind of exciting,

00:45:45.978 --> 00:45:50.866
not as exciting as spyware
but exciting, nevertheless.

00:45:50.866 --> 00:45:54.244
So this is the kind of thing
that the food industry does,

00:45:54.244 --> 00:45:57.102
it's just that Coca-Cola got exposed.

00:45:57.102 --> 00:45:58.454
But my assumption is that

00:45:58.454 --> 00:46:01.370
this is what big food companies do.

00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:04.934
And Michael Pollan wrote last year

00:46:04.934 --> 00:46:08.719
in The New York Times
magazine about the Obamas,

00:46:08.719 --> 00:46:12.270
that whenever they did anything
serious about big food,

00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:14.977
they were quickly outlobbied and outgunned

00:46:14.977 --> 00:46:17.786
and then he said, "The food
movement still barely exists

00:46:17.786 --> 00:46:19.383
"as a political force."

00:46:19.383 --> 00:46:21.327
I'm not sure that's true.

00:46:21.327 --> 00:46:25.063
I tend to be maybe more
optimistic than he is.

00:46:25.063 --> 00:46:28.235
And so I wanna talk about
why I think the food movement

00:46:28.235 --> 00:46:32.316
is really making progress,
and I'll just say personally

00:46:32.316 --> 00:46:36.699
I measure it by food studies
programs at universities.

00:46:36.699 --> 00:46:41.412
When we at NYU started our
Food Studies Program in 1996,

00:46:41.412 --> 00:46:45.067
we were it and everybody
thought we were crazy.

00:46:45.067 --> 00:46:48.593
Who would ever wanna study about food?

00:46:48.593 --> 00:46:52.529
20 years later, we have
all of you in the audience,

00:46:52.529 --> 00:46:54.929
the Berkeley Food Institute,

00:46:54.929 --> 00:46:59.497
Jen and your chancellor's
enormous food program,

00:46:59.497 --> 00:47:02.165
and almost every university that I visit

00:47:02.165 --> 00:47:04.973
has a food studies program
of one kind or other.

00:47:04.973 --> 00:47:07.441
So that's my personal measure of it.

00:47:07.441 --> 00:47:09.416
But there are other
ways to measure it, too.

00:47:09.416 --> 00:47:11.645
The increase in the
number of farmers market

00:47:11.645 --> 00:47:13.120
shown on the left,

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:16.474
and the increase in organic
sales shown on the right.

00:47:16.474 --> 00:47:19.952
These are measurable,
quantifiable demonstrations

00:47:19.952 --> 00:47:23.238
of the effectiveness of the food movement.

00:47:23.238 --> 00:47:27.493
The fight for a minimum
wage, the fight for 15,

00:47:27.493 --> 00:47:30.622
(mumbles) is on the faculty
of the Goldman School

00:47:30.622 --> 00:47:33.203
has been heading up this,
and is one of the leaders

00:47:33.203 --> 00:47:34.036
in this movement.

00:47:34.036 --> 00:47:37.387
It, too, is having enormous success,

00:47:37.387 --> 00:47:41.148
not as much as we'd
like, but still success,

00:47:41.148 --> 00:47:42.396
and there are many, many people

00:47:42.396 --> 00:47:44.451
who are participating in that.

00:47:44.451 --> 00:47:46.762
The food industry is listening.

00:47:46.762 --> 00:47:50.651
Sometimes they listen in
superficial and cosmetic ways,

00:47:50.651 --> 00:47:53.116
like taking aspartame or additives,

00:47:53.116 --> 00:47:56.420
or artificial colors or dyes out of foods.

00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:59.060
That's nice but it's not world-shaking.

00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:02.267
Sometimes it's in more
important ways, like sourcing

00:48:02.267 --> 00:48:04.653
animals that were not
treated with antibiotics.

00:48:04.653 --> 00:48:06.660
That one is much more important.

00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:09.773
So the food industry is listening.

00:48:09.773 --> 00:48:12.803
And, of course, there are soda taxes.

00:48:12.803 --> 00:48:15.077
With Berkeley leading the way,

00:48:15.077 --> 00:48:17.522
with an advocacy campaign for soda tax

00:48:17.522 --> 00:48:19.751
that was absolutely exemplary,

00:48:19.751 --> 00:48:21.736
done advocacy by the book

00:48:21.736 --> 00:48:24.034
exactly the way it's supposed to be done,

00:48:24.034 --> 00:48:28.201
and it was no wonder that
it passed with a 76% vote,

00:48:29.603 --> 00:48:33.852
and set an example for
lots of other cities

00:48:33.852 --> 00:48:36.189
that are following this example,

00:48:36.189 --> 00:48:37.942
and there's a soda tax movement

00:48:37.942 --> 00:48:40.789
that is now taking place
throughout the United States.

00:48:40.789 --> 00:48:42.588
Here's the current list.

00:48:42.588 --> 00:48:46.732
The one that's in play
right now is Santa Fe,

00:48:46.732 --> 00:48:49.299
but all of these others have passed taxes

00:48:49.299 --> 00:48:52.966
and often with really
impressive majorities.

00:48:54.654 --> 00:48:57.646
It's also one of the things
about the tax movement

00:48:57.646 --> 00:48:59.405
that I think is really important

00:48:59.405 --> 00:49:03.672
is its being framed as
a social justice issue,

00:49:03.672 --> 00:49:05.385
that people will be healthier

00:49:05.385 --> 00:49:07.507
if they're not drinking these things,

00:49:07.507 --> 00:49:09.963
if they don't have corporations running

00:49:09.963 --> 00:49:12.618
what they're supposed to
be eating in their life.

00:49:12.618 --> 00:49:14.864
Social justice, moral, ethical, just what

00:49:14.864 --> 00:49:16.959
we're supposed to be talking about here.

00:49:16.959 --> 00:49:20.292
It's also a trade issue because soda tax

00:49:21.590 --> 00:49:24.727
has become a worldwide phenomenon.

00:49:24.727 --> 00:49:27.936
South Africa, Portugal
and the United Kingdom

00:49:27.936 --> 00:49:31.873
are either looking at or
have passed soda taxes

00:49:31.873 --> 00:49:35.600
and so our trading partners
are getting involved in this

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:39.724
and of course, the most
impressive one is Mexico

00:49:39.724 --> 00:49:43.811
where I just was, where
the advocacy campaign

00:49:43.811 --> 00:49:47.859
has been carried out at
the highest possible level,

00:49:47.859 --> 00:49:49.948
and the research that goes with it is also

00:49:49.948 --> 00:49:51.973
being done at the highest possible level,

00:49:51.973 --> 00:49:54.117
and they've just come out with a paper

00:49:54.117 --> 00:49:58.284
that documents a significant
reduction in soda consumption,

00:50:00.251 --> 00:50:03.233
particularly among people who are poor,

00:50:03.233 --> 00:50:05.459
which is exactly the target group

00:50:05.459 --> 00:50:07.717
that they wanted to get at.

00:50:07.717 --> 00:50:11.131
So, much, much progress,
signs of movements,

00:50:11.131 --> 00:50:14.291
and then the business community thinks

00:50:14.291 --> 00:50:18.360
that food activists are
your new brand managers.

00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:20.110
Let's make that true,

00:50:21.344 --> 00:50:24.011
would be my recommendation here.

00:50:26.330 --> 00:50:28.315
So the food industry is scared,

00:50:28.315 --> 00:50:30.115
they're worried about it,

00:50:30.115 --> 00:50:32.026
and it's up to us to make sure

00:50:32.026 --> 00:50:34.329
that we hold them accountable.

00:50:34.329 --> 00:50:37.697
So that brings me to
the moral of the story

00:50:37.697 --> 00:50:40.257
which is that I think
it's really important

00:50:40.257 --> 00:50:44.048
for us to exercise our personal moral

00:50:44.048 --> 00:50:47.072
and ethical responsibility
in our food choices.

00:50:47.072 --> 00:50:49.503
That's Vote With Your Fork every time

00:50:49.503 --> 00:50:52.720
you make a decision about the
kind of food you're buying,

00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:56.042
you're making a vote for
the kind of food system

00:50:56.042 --> 00:50:57.851
that you want to have.

00:50:57.851 --> 00:51:00.400
Make it happen, choose fair trade,

00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:04.696
and choose all of these
other kinds of foods

00:51:04.696 --> 00:51:08.382
that will be healthier for
people and for the environment.

00:51:08.382 --> 00:51:11.558
At the same time, I think we
have a moral responsibility

00:51:11.558 --> 00:51:15.225
as a society to change
food system policies.

00:51:16.478 --> 00:51:19.572
I think that's going to be
difficult for the next few years,

00:51:19.572 --> 00:51:22.014
but that doesn't mean that
we shouldn't be trying,

00:51:22.014 --> 00:51:24.192
and it doesn't mean that
we shouldn't be trying

00:51:24.192 --> 00:51:26.206
particularly at the local level

00:51:26.206 --> 00:51:28.758
where real progress can be made.

00:51:28.758 --> 00:51:31.175
The purpose of this is to
make the healthy choice

00:51:31.175 --> 00:51:32.581
the easy choice

00:51:32.581 --> 00:51:36.197
and the most environmentally
friendly choice.

00:51:36.197 --> 00:51:38.949
So that's the message that
I wanna leave you with

00:51:38.949 --> 00:51:41.206
and I thank you very, very much

00:51:41.206 --> 00:51:43.534
for the opportunity to
share this with you today.

00:51:43.534 --> 00:51:44.367
Thank you.

00:51:44.367 --> 00:51:47.367
(audience clapping)

00:51:53.142 --> 00:51:53.975
- [Man] I want you to comment,

00:51:53.975 --> 00:51:56.863
I've always been struck with
just how much more expensive

00:51:56.863 --> 00:51:59.211
what we call organic
food at the grocery is.

00:51:59.211 --> 00:52:01.246
I mean, fruits and vegetables
(mumbles) to start with,

00:52:01.246 --> 00:52:03.510
and then on top of that,
is the profit margin

00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:06.631
greater on organic food
than it is on regular?

00:52:06.631 --> 00:52:09.175
- It may be, you'll have to
ask organic producers here

00:52:09.175 --> 00:52:12.618
but it costs more to produce organic food

00:52:12.618 --> 00:52:16.118
because you have to use better techniques,

00:52:17.119 --> 00:52:19.835
you need more people, you
need people watching it,

00:52:19.835 --> 00:52:21.812
you gotta handpick off bugs,

00:52:21.812 --> 00:52:24.269
you gotta do all kinds of things,

00:52:24.269 --> 00:52:26.499
so it's more expensive.

00:52:26.499 --> 00:52:27.541
Is it more profitable?

00:52:27.541 --> 00:52:29.748
I think maybe it is, I don't know.

00:52:29.748 --> 00:52:31.588
I think it depends,

00:52:31.588 --> 00:52:34.051
but it certainly costs more to produce.

00:52:34.051 --> 00:52:35.055
Yeah?

00:52:35.055 --> 00:52:36.488
- [Man] Hi, thank you
so much for your talk.

00:52:36.488 --> 00:52:38.798
I just had a question about the personal

00:52:38.798 --> 00:52:40.081
moral responsibility.

00:52:40.081 --> 00:52:43.641
It seems like, to me,
we seem wave after wave

00:52:43.641 --> 00:52:47.100
of activism changed the
way that the market works

00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:49.696
but ultimately, the corporations
that are controlling

00:52:49.696 --> 00:52:51.704
most of the capital and the resources

00:52:51.704 --> 00:52:55.065
seem to have misaligned incentives
with the rest of society

00:52:55.065 --> 00:52:58.369
to create a better way
of life for everyone,

00:52:58.369 --> 00:53:00.435
and I'm wondering how you square away

00:53:00.435 --> 00:53:03.616
the misaligned incentives of capitalism

00:53:03.616 --> 00:53:06.199
that will always co-opt methods

00:53:09.584 --> 00:53:13.167
to recycle better, to
treat workers better,

00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:17.573
with the individual choice

00:53:17.573 --> 00:53:19.326
of making the world a better place.

00:53:19.326 --> 00:53:22.955
- Yeah, I think it's very difficult,

00:53:22.955 --> 00:53:25.630
it would be very difficult
for me to give a talk

00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:29.051
that started out saying I
think our capitalist system

00:53:29.051 --> 00:53:31.779
is really bad for health
and the environment.

00:53:31.779 --> 00:53:35.453
It's much easier for me
to talk about it this way.

00:53:35.453 --> 00:53:37.966
And I think people can hear it better

00:53:37.966 --> 00:53:39.244
if you talk about it this way.

00:53:39.244 --> 00:53:41.281
I think what the food movement is doing

00:53:41.281 --> 00:53:43.324
is trying to create an alternative.

00:53:43.324 --> 00:53:45.264
It's a small alternative,

00:53:45.264 --> 00:53:47.162
it's not a huge piece of it,

00:53:47.162 --> 00:53:50.498
but it's an important piece
for a great many people.

00:53:50.498 --> 00:53:55.133
And if you wanna take on
capitalism, more power to you.

00:53:55.133 --> 00:53:57.019
I don't know how to do that.

00:53:57.019 --> 00:53:59.916
I certainly don't know how to do it now

00:53:59.916 --> 00:54:02.149
when half of the voters,

00:54:02.149 --> 00:54:04.188
or slightly less than half of the voters

00:54:04.188 --> 00:54:08.102
elected somebody who's very
interested in capitalism

00:54:08.102 --> 00:54:09.693
and his own self-interests.

00:54:09.693 --> 00:54:12.288
So I'd rather talk about this.

00:54:12.288 --> 00:54:15.038
I think you can go into a school

00:54:15.038 --> 00:54:17.582
and change the food in a school

00:54:17.582 --> 00:54:19.846
and make that food healthy.

00:54:19.846 --> 00:54:21.831
And people are doing
that all over the country

00:54:21.831 --> 00:54:23.176
and you're doing wonderful things

00:54:23.176 --> 00:54:25.326
for the kids in that school,

00:54:25.326 --> 00:54:27.758
and maybe teaching them
about alternatives.

00:54:27.758 --> 00:54:30.028
I don't know any other way of doing it.

00:54:30.028 --> 00:54:34.713
I'm not somebody who's
willing to take that on.

00:54:34.713 --> 00:54:36.677
- [Man] I really respect that response.

00:54:36.677 --> 00:54:38.177
I think one thing I'll
just say to challenge you

00:54:38.177 --> 00:54:40.134
is that with survey after survey,

00:54:40.134 --> 00:54:43.263
you see that particularly
young people are increasingly

00:54:43.263 --> 00:54:45.968
disenfranchised with
capitalism, generally,

00:54:45.968 --> 00:54:48.528
and are more open to alternative systems,

00:54:48.528 --> 00:54:51.737
not only systematically
but also in the way

00:54:51.737 --> 00:54:53.503
that we distribute resources,

00:54:53.503 --> 00:54:54.993
so I'd encourage you to
check out those numbers

00:54:54.993 --> 00:54:57.282
because I think there
may be a bigger opening

00:54:57.282 --> 00:54:59.138
than we like to think,
so, thank you again.

00:54:59.138 --> 00:55:00.673
- Well, then, vote.

00:55:00.673 --> 00:55:02.815
Get out there and vote.

00:55:02.815 --> 00:55:06.648
(audience laughing, clapping)

00:55:07.527 --> 00:55:08.951
- [Woman] I am an Redditor-dietician,

00:55:08.951 --> 00:55:10.878
I'm not paid by Coke, I promise.

00:55:10.878 --> 00:55:12.799
Most of us are not.

00:55:12.799 --> 00:55:14.338
And I'm really interested
in the convergence

00:55:14.338 --> 00:55:15.864
of nutrition and sustainability.

00:55:15.864 --> 00:55:17.004
I think it's really big,

00:55:17.004 --> 00:55:18.515
and sometimes when you
talk about more of these,

00:55:18.515 --> 00:55:22.682
do you think we'll see it in
the 2020 Dietary Guidelines?

00:55:23.952 --> 00:55:27.215
- In this administration?
(audience laughing)

00:55:27.215 --> 00:55:28.406
I don't know.

00:55:28.406 --> 00:55:30.639
It depends on who the committee is,

00:55:30.639 --> 00:55:32.096
how strong the committee is,

00:55:32.096 --> 00:55:36.143
and how the committee is willing to fight

00:55:36.143 --> 00:55:38.327
for what they think is right.

00:55:38.327 --> 00:55:39.929
And I don't know, I
mean, are they appointing

00:55:39.929 --> 00:55:41.375
that committee right now?

00:55:41.375 --> 00:55:42.790
I don't intend to be appointed

00:55:42.790 --> 00:55:46.413
to those committees anymore, so (laughs).

00:55:46.413 --> 00:55:47.705
(woman speaking, indistinct)

00:55:47.705 --> 00:55:51.617
Yes, so it depends on who gets on there.

00:55:51.617 --> 00:55:53.674
- [Woman] Thank you.

00:55:53.674 --> 00:55:54.764
- [Woman] Hi, thank you
so much for your talk

00:55:54.764 --> 00:55:57.395
and thank you for your work, I love it.

00:55:57.395 --> 00:55:59.700
This might be another
sort of knotty problem

00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:03.078
linked to capitalism,
but what do you see as

00:56:03.078 --> 00:56:06.048
a possible solution or
solutions to the problem

00:56:06.048 --> 00:56:07.856
of industry-funded research,

00:56:07.856 --> 00:56:10.183
because we see that across
the board in all disciplines

00:56:10.183 --> 00:56:11.552
and it's really problematic?

00:56:11.552 --> 00:56:12.752
- Yeah, that's the subject of the book

00:56:12.752 --> 00:56:14.835
I'm working on right now.

00:56:17.334 --> 00:56:19.477
I only see one solution to it

00:56:19.477 --> 00:56:21.542
and it's an impossible one.

00:56:21.542 --> 00:56:25.709
And that is, and I'll just
go cut right to the chase.

00:56:26.810 --> 00:56:31.423
Because industry funding
influences the outcome of research,

00:56:31.423 --> 00:56:33.177
and the people who do the research

00:56:33.177 --> 00:56:35.690
do not recognize that influence

00:56:35.690 --> 00:56:39.948
and are completely
unconscious of its happening,

00:56:39.948 --> 00:56:42.391
and there's plenty of
research that shows that,

00:56:42.391 --> 00:56:43.776
the only way that you could do that

00:56:43.776 --> 00:56:47.943
would be to set up an industry
fund that was required.

00:56:49.219 --> 00:56:51.374
I mean, I think if you require

00:56:51.374 --> 00:56:53.685
food companies of a
certain size to contribute

00:56:53.685 --> 00:56:56.228
a certain amount of money
into a research fund,

00:56:56.228 --> 00:56:59.525
then they were required to
do it, it wasn't voluntary.

00:56:59.525 --> 00:57:03.284
If it was voluntary, you'd
have to pander to the companies

00:57:03.284 --> 00:57:04.933
and that wouldn't work.

00:57:04.933 --> 00:57:07.024
Then I thought I think
something like that might work.

00:57:07.024 --> 00:57:10.381
But I can't think of
anything less than that.

00:57:10.381 --> 00:57:12.227
You know, I think there
are individual researchers

00:57:12.227 --> 00:57:14.925
who can try to protect themselves

00:57:14.925 --> 00:57:18.037
from the influence, if they're aware

00:57:18.037 --> 00:57:20.005
that they might be influenced,

00:57:20.005 --> 00:57:22.182
but it's really difficult.

00:57:22.182 --> 00:57:23.015
- [Woman] And I think it's great.

00:57:23.015 --> 00:57:24.515
Thank you so much.

00:57:26.998 --> 00:57:29.298
- [Woman] Hi, I'm wondering
if you have any thoughts

00:57:29.298 --> 00:57:32.184
about the proliferation of tech companies

00:57:32.184 --> 00:57:35.702
getting in on food and
food delivery services

00:57:35.702 --> 00:57:37.786
and what friends of mine
are starting to call

00:57:37.786 --> 00:57:39.560
the uberization of food.

00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:42.029
That's something you're
watching or thinking about.

00:57:42.029 --> 00:57:43.243
- Yeah, I think it's hilarious.

00:57:43.243 --> 00:57:47.326
I mean, I'm the wrong
generation for this, right?

00:57:48.310 --> 00:57:53.016
And I have sort of an automatic (mumbles).

00:57:53.016 --> 00:57:55.016
Have you ever tasted it?

00:57:56.465 --> 00:57:58.372
It tastes like uncooked pancake batter

00:57:58.372 --> 00:58:01.122
in my view, and you can quote me,

00:58:02.076 --> 00:58:04.548
but yeah, I just don't get it at all.

00:58:04.548 --> 00:58:07.515
And yet, there are people
who are fascinated by it.

00:58:07.515 --> 00:58:11.515
There's vast amounts of
venture capital going into it.

00:58:11.515 --> 00:58:14.441
And I actually have gone to
a couple of tech conferences

00:58:14.441 --> 00:58:17.324
'cause I'm kinda interested
in what they're doing,

00:58:17.324 --> 00:58:20.455
and I did actually visit AeroFarms,

00:58:20.455 --> 00:58:24.105
which is a place where
they're growing microgreens

00:58:24.105 --> 00:58:28.076
in a huge factory in Newark, New Jersey.

00:58:28.076 --> 00:58:30.872
And that's impressive, actually.

00:58:30.872 --> 00:58:34.375
So, there may be some
aspects of it that work

00:58:34.375 --> 00:58:37.292
but I wouldn't put any money in it.

00:58:38.664 --> 00:58:41.127
- [Woman] Thank you.

00:58:41.127 --> 00:58:41.960
- [Man] Hi there.

00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:44.422
I'm one of the people that
advocates eating insects

00:58:44.422 --> 00:58:47.051
in a self-interested way
because I own a company

00:58:47.051 --> 00:58:48.683
that farms food-grade crickets,

00:58:48.683 --> 00:58:51.600
and we're building a new place in--

00:58:52.514 --> 00:58:54.876
- I'm looking horrified
because I was given

00:58:54.876 --> 00:58:57.859
an enormous bag of, they weren't crickets,

00:58:57.859 --> 00:58:59.731
what were they?

00:58:59.731 --> 00:59:02.628
Grasshoppers, yes, which I shared

00:59:02.628 --> 00:59:04.154
with people at lunch today.

00:59:04.154 --> 00:59:06.555
- [Man] Yeah, and they're
delicious, I think.

00:59:06.555 --> 00:59:09.068
And we also try them.

00:59:09.068 --> 00:59:11.026
So we're trying to build
a kind of new piece

00:59:11.026 --> 00:59:12.564
of the food industry, and most of us

00:59:12.564 --> 00:59:14.146
are trying to do that responsibly.

00:59:14.146 --> 00:59:15.355
I'd be curious if you had any thoughts

00:59:15.355 --> 00:59:17.759
on how to avoid some of the pitfalls

00:59:17.759 --> 00:59:21.033
that loom for scaling food businesses

00:59:21.033 --> 00:59:22.783
as, you know, we see,

00:59:23.808 --> 00:59:25.338
you know, the capitalist
structure of forcing

00:59:25.338 --> 00:59:27.498
large companies or
incentivizing large companies

00:59:27.498 --> 00:59:31.165
to act in kind of not
very responsible ways.

00:59:32.079 --> 00:59:33.854
- Well, you do the best you can,

00:59:33.854 --> 00:59:37.771
but economic forces are
invariably to cut costs

00:59:40.546 --> 00:59:42.967
'cause cost is the big issue in food.

00:59:42.967 --> 00:59:45.586
I've just read this morning, I think,

00:59:45.586 --> 00:59:49.957
that retail grocery stores
are having a terrible time.

00:59:49.957 --> 00:59:53.146
Wegmans, which is a
chain in the Northeast,

00:59:53.146 --> 00:59:56.873
is having to cut its prices
because it can't compete.

00:59:56.873 --> 01:00:01.547
So if the pressure is to keep
the price as low as possible,

01:00:01.547 --> 01:00:05.848
then you're going to not pay
your workers reasonable wages,

01:00:05.848 --> 01:00:08.104
you're going to cut food safety,

01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:10.096
you're gonna do all those other things

01:00:10.096 --> 01:00:12.094
that food companies are doing.

01:00:12.094 --> 01:00:13.776
So, one of the arguments is

01:00:13.776 --> 01:00:16.361
well, people need to pay more for food.

01:00:16.361 --> 01:00:19.072
That's not an argument
I'm comfortable making

01:00:19.072 --> 01:00:22.329
because if we're gonna make
people pay more for food,

01:00:22.329 --> 01:00:25.480
we have to pay people more
so they can afford it.

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:26.832
We have enough trouble with that,

01:00:26.832 --> 01:00:28.006
so good luck to you.

01:00:28.006 --> 01:00:29.688
I don't know what to say.

01:00:29.688 --> 01:00:32.325
You have to stay small,
and if you stay small,

01:00:32.325 --> 01:00:35.497
then you won't be rich.
(audience laughing)

01:00:35.497 --> 01:00:39.664
Well, you know, I was in
academic all my life and it's...

01:00:41.874 --> 01:00:43.932
- [Woman] So thank you for a great talk.

01:00:43.932 --> 01:00:45.438
I mean, it was fantastic.

01:00:45.438 --> 01:00:47.644
But I want to ask just your thoughts,

01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:49.696
your broad thoughts on an issue

01:00:49.696 --> 01:00:52.000
that didn't come up in the talk

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.262
which is the whole foods
all need to be cooked,

01:00:56.262 --> 01:00:58.937
whereas everything else
is just handed to you

01:00:58.937 --> 01:01:03.338
all fried and buttered and
cut up into bite-size pieces.

01:01:03.338 --> 01:01:06.657
And you know, it somehow
seems to have become

01:01:06.657 --> 01:01:10.983
harder and harder for small
families, or single people,

01:01:10.983 --> 01:01:13.270
or even large families to just cook,

01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:15.144
and I just wonder what your thoughts are

01:01:15.144 --> 01:01:18.750
on how that can be done
more because I don't see,

01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:23.620
that's just a practicality
that we have to think through.

01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:26.788
- Yeah, I learned to cook
in junior high school.

01:01:26.788 --> 01:01:28.137
You know, home economics,

01:01:28.137 --> 01:01:30.704
that I would took cooking classes.

01:01:30.704 --> 01:01:33.230
And one of the things, you
know, if you know how to cook,

01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:36.476
you can produce a meal in no time at all.

01:01:36.476 --> 01:01:40.134
But people have other
priorities and I don't like

01:01:40.134 --> 01:01:43.158
to judge other people's
decisions about that.

01:01:43.158 --> 01:01:45.195
If they don't want to cook, or
they don't know how to cook,

01:01:45.195 --> 01:01:48.191
there are plenty of other options.

01:01:48.191 --> 01:01:51.020
If you do know how to cook,
you can live very cheaply.

01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:52.948
So that's an incentive.

01:01:52.948 --> 01:01:56.518
I don't know what to say about that.

01:01:56.518 --> 01:02:00.959
I like to cook sometimes,
but sometimes not.

01:02:00.959 --> 01:02:03.606
- [Woman] I, too, wanna thank
you for all your many years

01:02:03.606 --> 01:02:06.694
of incredibly important and valuable work.

01:02:06.694 --> 01:02:08.817
My question also relates to something

01:02:08.817 --> 01:02:10.618
that was not touched on in your talk

01:02:10.618 --> 01:02:13.025
but that is your thoughts
on the effectiveness

01:02:13.025 --> 01:02:16.017
of food recovery efforts
because of the enormous

01:02:16.017 --> 01:02:17.850
amount of wasted food.

01:02:19.366 --> 01:02:21.857
- Yeah, I decided that waste
wasn't gonna be my issue

01:02:21.857 --> 01:02:23.616
and I would leave it to
lots of other people.

01:02:23.616 --> 01:02:25.816
I think it's an easy one,

01:02:25.816 --> 01:02:27.633
and it's a feel-good issue,

01:02:27.633 --> 01:02:29.798
makes everybody feel really terrific.

01:02:29.798 --> 01:02:33.431
I'm much more concerned
about the production side,

01:02:33.431 --> 01:02:35.627
that the reason we have
so much waste is because

01:02:35.627 --> 01:02:39.336
so much is produced, and
it's built into the system.

01:02:39.336 --> 01:02:41.728
And I'd rather try to figure out some way

01:02:41.728 --> 01:02:44.015
to attack it from that end.

01:02:44.015 --> 01:02:46.258
But lots and lots and lots of people

01:02:46.258 --> 01:02:49.689
are involved in food waste in the same way

01:02:49.689 --> 01:02:51.437
that lots and lots of people are involved

01:02:51.437 --> 01:02:54.785
in food distribution systems to the poor,

01:02:54.785 --> 01:02:57.095
food banks and these kinds of things,

01:02:57.095 --> 01:02:59.809
these are feel-good issues,

01:02:59.809 --> 01:03:03.976
and I hope they're entry
points into the food system

01:03:05.555 --> 01:03:07.024
and I support them for that reason.

01:03:07.024 --> 01:03:08.411
You get people involved in this,

01:03:08.411 --> 01:03:12.191
maybe realizing that
there are larger forces

01:03:12.191 --> 01:03:15.178
that are causing this,
and maybe looking at

01:03:15.178 --> 01:03:19.555
what in public health we
call upstream causes of it.

01:03:19.555 --> 01:03:23.213
But there are lots of people
working on food waste.

01:03:23.213 --> 01:03:25.546
I figure they don't need me.

01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:28.483
- [Woman] Thanks for being here.

01:03:28.483 --> 01:03:29.898
It's exciting to be face-to-face with you

01:03:29.898 --> 01:03:32.344
after following you online for so long.

01:03:32.344 --> 01:03:35.441
I'm just wondering, what you've seen

01:03:35.441 --> 01:03:37.190
that's maybe been exciting to you

01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:40.682
in terms of new mothers, pregnant women,

01:03:40.682 --> 01:03:42.451
low-income women, specifically,

01:03:42.451 --> 01:03:45.179
and healthy eating for babies,

01:03:45.179 --> 01:03:46.558
knowing that if they start healthy,

01:03:46.558 --> 01:03:49.734
the likelihood of continuing healthy--

01:03:49.734 --> 01:03:51.517
- Well, there are lots of
people who are working on that

01:03:51.517 --> 01:03:54.591
and lots of NGOs, and lots of groups.

01:03:54.591 --> 01:03:56.550
It's not something I'm
personally interested,

01:03:56.550 --> 01:03:59.243
that I'm personally involved in,

01:03:59.243 --> 01:04:00.797
but I certainly support that

01:04:00.797 --> 01:04:02.765
there are baby-friendly hospitals

01:04:02.765 --> 01:04:07.653
and lots of efforts trying
to get women to breastfeed,

01:04:07.653 --> 01:04:09.133
and some of them are successful,

01:04:09.133 --> 01:04:10.683
and some of them more successful,

01:04:10.683 --> 01:04:14.850
and I'm not sure what you're
really driving at here.

01:04:15.796 --> 01:04:17.296
It's a good thing.

01:04:18.619 --> 01:04:20.012
- [Woman] Hi, thank you for being here.

01:04:20.012 --> 01:04:21.707
I was just hoping you could comment more

01:04:21.707 --> 01:04:24.313
on the nature of the soda tax (mumbling)

01:04:24.313 --> 01:04:27.005
contention of how this
tax could be higher burden

01:04:27.005 --> 01:04:30.990
for (mumbling) low-income,
but we see how this tax

01:04:30.990 --> 01:04:32.422
has been implemented in different ways

01:04:32.422 --> 01:04:35.924
and I think Berkeley itself
has done it very creatively,

01:04:35.924 --> 01:04:37.079
so I don't know if you could comment more

01:04:37.079 --> 01:04:38.726
of like (mumbles).

01:04:38.726 --> 01:04:41.320
- Different locations have decided to use

01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:43.238
the tax money in different ways,

01:04:43.238 --> 01:04:45.804
some of them more popular than others.

01:04:45.804 --> 01:04:49.087
Berkeley, as I understand, is putting it

01:04:49.087 --> 01:04:53.143
into child health and child health clinics

01:04:53.143 --> 01:04:56.976
and it's actually doing
that, so that's great.

01:04:57.820 --> 01:05:01.721
On it's a regressive tax
and it's hard on the poor,

01:05:01.721 --> 01:05:05.953
my answer to that is that Type II Diabetes

01:05:05.953 --> 01:05:09.139
is a regressive disease
and one of the reasons

01:05:09.139 --> 01:05:11.810
why the tax passed in Berkeley, I think,

01:05:11.810 --> 01:05:14.666
was because such a effort was made

01:05:14.666 --> 01:05:17.434
to do community organizing around.

01:05:17.434 --> 01:05:19.385
Do you know anybody who has diabetes?

01:05:19.385 --> 01:05:21.779
Is anybody in your family have diabetes?

01:05:21.779 --> 01:05:23.500
Do you know that the soda companies

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:26.749
are deliberately targeting
people of low-income?

01:05:26.749 --> 01:05:30.715
And that kind of thing, a real
education around the issue.

01:05:30.715 --> 01:05:34.882
So, I think the tax is a
phenomenal educational campaign,

01:05:37.826 --> 01:05:39.893
a sort of an unexpected benefit,

01:05:39.893 --> 01:05:41.998
even when the taxes don't pass

01:05:41.998 --> 01:05:43.748
so the sales go down.

01:05:47.654 --> 01:05:49.529
- [Woman] Hi, thank you
for being here today.

01:05:49.529 --> 01:05:51.727
I have a question about
how we can get those

01:05:51.727 --> 01:05:53.256
who are most affected by the industry

01:05:53.256 --> 01:05:55.334
involved in this narratives,

01:05:55.334 --> 01:05:56.167
and like you're talking about

01:05:56.167 --> 01:05:59.264
how minorities or people
of color are most affected

01:05:59.264 --> 01:06:01.568
by this industries, and also just access,

01:06:01.568 --> 01:06:03.657
because just looking around this room,

01:06:03.657 --> 01:06:05.345
and you say we should vote with our fork,

01:06:05.345 --> 01:06:07.437
many people can't afford to do that,

01:06:07.437 --> 01:06:09.875
so how to get more people involved

01:06:09.875 --> 01:06:11.534
in this food movement?

01:06:11.534 --> 01:06:14.308
- You do community organizing.

01:06:14.308 --> 01:06:16.226
That's the basis of of everything.

01:06:16.226 --> 01:06:19.893
If you want to bring a
large group of people

01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:23.741
into this movement,
you've got to talk to them

01:06:23.741 --> 01:06:25.646
and find out what they want.

01:06:25.646 --> 01:06:28.631
You have to listen to them.

01:06:28.631 --> 01:06:31.957
You need to try to work with them

01:06:31.957 --> 01:06:36.343
to find out how you can help
them get what they want,

01:06:36.343 --> 01:06:39.550
and expect it to take a long time.

01:06:39.550 --> 01:06:41.245
It's not something where you can go in

01:06:41.245 --> 01:06:43.479
and tell people what they ought to want.

01:06:43.479 --> 01:06:46.120
I don't think that works very well,

01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:49.993
though I'm greatly in favor
of community organizing.

01:06:49.993 --> 01:06:51.993
It's hard, but it works.

01:06:54.264 --> 01:06:55.919
- [Man] Thank you so much for your talk.

01:06:55.919 --> 01:06:58.258
I just wanted to ask
you about your opinion

01:06:58.258 --> 01:07:02.425
of the side effects of
carbon tax on food politics.

01:07:07.130 --> 01:07:11.501
For one, generally,
corporations are centralized

01:07:11.501 --> 01:07:15.683
so the miles that a product has to travel

01:07:15.683 --> 01:07:18.513
would be also subject to that tax,

01:07:18.513 --> 01:07:22.680
if the transportation is coming
from a fossil fuel source.

01:07:24.411 --> 01:07:27.871
And as it looks that in the next 10 years,

01:07:27.871 --> 01:07:29.618
that increasingly worldwide,

01:07:29.618 --> 01:07:32.449
there'll be more and
more taxing of carbon,

01:07:32.449 --> 01:07:35.782
I was wondering how the distinction that

01:07:38.215 --> 01:07:42.382
Gerard Hastings makes between
businesses and industries,

01:07:43.222 --> 01:07:46.746
between, say, a local socially-motivated,

01:07:46.746 --> 01:07:49.913
also profit-motivated company versus a

01:07:51.076 --> 01:07:55.668
you know, (mumbles)
responsibility investors

01:07:55.668 --> 01:07:59.585
focused corporation on
how this centralization,

01:08:00.742 --> 01:08:04.473
decentralization with taxing of distance

01:08:04.473 --> 01:08:06.713
will make various foods more expensive

01:08:06.713 --> 01:08:09.704
or local foods, say, less expensive.

01:08:09.704 --> 01:08:10.848
- Thanks for asking that.

01:08:10.848 --> 01:08:12.938
I rarely get asked questions

01:08:12.938 --> 01:08:15.852
that I've never been asked before.

01:08:15.852 --> 01:08:17.093
But you just won the prize

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:19.165
and I don't have the faintest idea.

01:08:19.165 --> 01:08:20.525
(audience laughing)

01:08:20.525 --> 01:08:22.859
But I will pay attention
to it from now on.

01:08:22.859 --> 01:08:24.526
Thank you very much.

01:08:26.620 --> 01:08:29.238
- [Woman] Okay, so if you
were to recruit nutritionists,

01:08:29.238 --> 01:08:32.454
dieticians and food activists
to join your movement,

01:08:32.454 --> 01:08:34.055
what could you ask us to do

01:08:34.055 --> 01:08:35.439
to be apart of what you're doing?

01:08:35.439 --> 01:08:37.631
- To pick an issue that you care about

01:08:37.631 --> 01:08:39.464
and get to work on it.

01:08:40.807 --> 01:08:42.277
There are plenty of them.

01:08:42.277 --> 01:08:45.936
There are enormous numbers of food issues

01:08:45.936 --> 01:08:48.677
that people are involved
in that they care about.

01:08:48.677 --> 01:08:52.502
Pick the one that you
really feel passionate about

01:08:52.502 --> 01:08:55.669
and get to work, and have fun with it.

01:08:57.010 --> 01:08:59.125
Activism is fun.

01:08:59.125 --> 01:09:00.500
Hello.

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:03.826
- Thank you so much for all
your work and coming here.

01:09:03.826 --> 01:09:07.778
I wonder if you'd comment
on diet soda drinks.

01:09:07.778 --> 01:09:10.275
- Oh, do I have to?
(audience laughing)

01:09:10.275 --> 01:09:14.050
- I don't know some of these, Pepsi Cola,

01:09:14.050 --> 01:09:17.527
and sort of trying to turn
themselves into health food

01:09:17.527 --> 01:09:21.694
companies or at least change
their image in that regard.

01:09:23.435 --> 01:09:25.915
- Well, I have rules about
eating and one of them

01:09:25.915 --> 01:09:27.762
is never eat anything artificial,

01:09:27.762 --> 01:09:31.012
so that completely excludes diet drinks

01:09:32.090 --> 01:09:33.981
because they have artificial
sweeteners in them,

01:09:33.981 --> 01:09:35.981
so they're off my radar.

01:09:38.268 --> 01:09:41.379
I'm squirming about it
because I know lots of people

01:09:41.379 --> 01:09:44.164
think that they're really
harmful and unhealthful.

01:09:44.164 --> 01:09:47.317
I haven't seen that
evidence, I'm not convinced

01:09:47.317 --> 01:09:52.278
that you do anything except
pee out all that stuff.

01:09:52.278 --> 01:09:54.038
But I don't think they taste good,

01:09:54.038 --> 01:09:55.509
and there's certainly no evidence

01:09:55.509 --> 01:09:59.536
that they help people
maintain a healthy weight.

01:09:59.536 --> 01:10:01.302
In fact, there's quite a bit of evidence

01:10:01.302 --> 01:10:03.617
that people who consume diet sodas,

01:10:03.617 --> 01:10:06.672
this is an interesting area where

01:10:06.672 --> 01:10:08.942
you can tell who funded the study

01:10:08.942 --> 01:10:11.296
by what its result is.

01:10:11.296 --> 01:10:14.169
So if the study shows that diet drinks

01:10:14.169 --> 01:10:17.026
help people lose weight,
and are really healthy,

01:10:17.026 --> 01:10:18.479
the soda industry funded them.

01:10:18.479 --> 01:10:21.248
And if the study comes out and says

01:10:21.248 --> 01:10:23.296
people gain weight on diet sodas,

01:10:23.296 --> 01:10:26.193
they were probably funded independently.

01:10:26.193 --> 01:10:28.392
I don't know, I just don't want

01:10:28.392 --> 01:10:30.327
to have anything to do with them,

01:10:30.327 --> 01:10:34.071
so I'm not sure that's
very helpful, sorry.

01:10:34.071 --> 01:10:37.631
And I don't know what
the tax people should do.

01:10:37.631 --> 01:10:41.240
I think, probably the more important tax

01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:43.573
would be a graded sugar tax,

01:10:44.526 --> 01:10:48.832
like they're trying to do in Great Britain

01:10:48.832 --> 01:10:50.352
and that would put a lot of pressure

01:10:50.352 --> 01:10:53.016
on food companies to reduce sugar,

01:10:53.016 --> 01:10:55.800
but it would also put
pressure on soda companies

01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:59.105
to put more artificial
sweet in beverages out there

01:10:59.105 --> 01:11:00.522
and I don't know.

01:11:02.129 --> 01:11:03.962
I'm stuck on that one.

01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:06.536
Is that it?

01:11:06.536 --> 01:11:07.568
Thank you very much.

01:11:07.568 --> 01:11:10.464
- [Woman] Thank you so much.
