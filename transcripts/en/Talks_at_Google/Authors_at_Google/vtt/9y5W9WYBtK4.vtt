CHRIS: Hey guys.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.740
Thanks for coming out.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.980
Today we've got another
author talk here at Google.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.400
Alexa Clay is a leading expert
on subculture and innovation

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.747
from unlikely places.

00:00:18.747 --> 00:00:20.580
She's the co-author of
"The Misfit Economy",

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.080
a book that explores underground
and informal information.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.120
She works to create
bridges and opportunities

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.020
for misfit subcultures
within the formal economy.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.600
She's the founder
of Wisdom Hackers,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.300
an incubator for
philosophical inquiry,

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.550
and the co-founder of the League
of Intrapreneurs, a movement

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.530
to create change from
within incumbent systems

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:37.980
in big organizations.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.060
Alexa has written and
appeared in "Fast Company",

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.820
"Forbes", "Wired", "Dazed
and Confused", "Vice",

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.060
"Harvard Business Review",
the "New York Times", and MTV.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.918
Please give me a hand
in welcoming Alexa Clay.

00:00:48.918 --> 00:00:52.236
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:52.887 --> 00:00:53.720
ALEXA CLAY: Awesome.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.360
Thanks, Chris.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.040
Thanks, Google for having me.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.972
How are you guys doing?

00:00:58.972 --> 00:01:00.440
Excellent.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.489
So I want to share, really,
three passions with you today.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.100
The first, misfits.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.980
For the past three years, I've
been traveling around the world

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.110
and speaking to pirates
and hackers and gangsters,

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.330
and really trying to better
understand the different faces

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.570
of entrepreneurship.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.370
I think when we often
think of the personality

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.310
of the entrepreneur, it's
sort of the geek funder

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.250
kind, the Mark Zuckerberg
hoodie wearing college dropout.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.920
And I wanted to really
expand that definition

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.780
and look at people
that we don't think of

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.890
but are often entrepreneurs in
the informal and black market

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:35.850
economies.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.350
So I'll share a little bit
about that from my new book,

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.310
"The Misfit Economy".

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.540
And then I want to
talk about alter egos.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.080
I've been experimenting with
alter egos now for a few years,

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.400
and it's a passion
I have that I hope

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.600
you'll leave today also
wanting to experience some of.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.690
But my appreciation
for alter egos

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.880
really started when I had to
increasingly commodify myself

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.480
for this talking
head type culture.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.050
And through Facebook,
through Twitter,

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.310
through developing
this LinkedIn persona,

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.170
increasingly individuals
are becoming brands.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.470
And to escape some
of that pressure,

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.600
I started developing
people who were not me

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.890
who I could begin to play with
to escape the Alexa Clay that

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.960
was becoming everywhere
on the internet.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.840
So I'll talk a little bit about
some of those experiments.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.020
And then lastly, I want
to share a new project

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.920
that I'm working on that looks
at this idea of basically

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.010
an incubator for
the next messiah,

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.580
and really explores how
our spiritual and prophetic

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.240
traditions are being
shaped by the digital age.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.800
So let's get started.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.000
My real love and appreciation
for misfits, to some extent,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.990
started with this
desire to look at people

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.830
who didn't operate within
traditional command and control

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:56.840
capitalism.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.730
So for me personally, I
grew up with two parents

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.420
who were anthropologists.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.400
I loved Joan of Arc and Henry
Thoreau, two famous misfits,

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.430
when I was younger, and my
mother actually researched

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.220
alien abduction while
I was growing up.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.580
So she traveled
the world and spoke

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.120
to people who believed they
were somehow abducted by aliens.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.580
And I think in some way, this
gave me a real appreciation

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.510
for talking to people who
made me deeply uncomfortable,

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.280
as well as preserving
unknowns, not

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.860
trying to come out pro
or con on whether or not

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.800
I thought aliens existed, but
appreciating that conversation.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.890
I remember when I
was eight years old,

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.150
feeling both sort of
terrified-- As you're beginning

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.420
to distinguish between fantasy
and reality as a child,

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.240
the existence of aliens or the
possible existence of aliens

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.850
was deeply unsettling
and destabilizing.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.410
But then I also
remember in addition

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:58.020
to fear feeling this
sense, really, of loss

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.190
at not being chosen as an
ambassador of the human race.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.330
Like, why wasn't I being
abducted, if these aliens were

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.250
really out there?

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.610
And so going from this
experience of abduction

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.840
and alien encounters,
I started going

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.140
into a very different terrain.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.829
I had always had a more
esoteric upbringing,

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.970
and I went into the
corporate heart of darkness.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.330
I went into Fortune 500 and
multinational companies,

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.950
and within those
environments I really wanted

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.224
to understand them with
an anthropological eye.

00:04:30.224 --> 00:04:32.160
What are the rituals?

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.400
What does it mean to put on that
office suit and play that game?

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.300
And how are some of these
bureaucracies functioning?

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.930
And within those
environments, I discovered

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.690
what appeared to me like a
lost tribe of corporate rebels.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.860
We called them
intrapreneurs, or people

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.650
that were actively trying
to hack these cultures

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.590
from within.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.120
So someone, for example,
like Dave Berdish, who I met,

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.020
who was at Ford Motor Company.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.410
And he essentially was a
third generation auto worker.

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.050
His grandfather had been
a prominent activist

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.250
who worked at Ford.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.650
He'd been beaten
by Ford's henchmen.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.650
So he had this sort of love-hate
relationship with Ford.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.495
And Dave is someone that very
much tried to become and adopt

00:05:16.495 --> 00:05:19.690
a radical activist type of
perspective within the company.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.010
So he got the company to
think more about human rights.

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.620
Oh yay.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.200
OK.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.620
So I'm going to fast
forward a little bit, then.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.150
So here.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.800
Corporate rebels.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.424
So Dave was someone
who got the company

00:05:29.424 --> 00:05:33.040
to think a lot more about
human rights practices.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.250
He was trying to get
the company to build out

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.030
mobility solutions, so to
think beyond just automobile

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.410
manufacturing.

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.770
How do we actually create social
and environmental business

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.020
models within this company?

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.719
How do we begin to hack the
DNA of this old dinosaur,

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:52.010
and get it to become a little
bit more future friendly?

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.940
So I met tons of
people like this.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.380
We started essentially what was,
like, Alcoholics Anonymous type

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.754
of therapy groups for them.

00:05:59.754 --> 00:06:01.420
So we brought all
these corporate rebels

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.670
that we could find,
from Morgan Stanley,

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.640
from Ford, from Unilever, from
all these different companies,

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.230
and brought them together
to have a space where they

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.550
could peer mentor each other.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.170
And from that was created to
the League of Intrapreneurs,

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:21.340
which basically provided a
global guerrilla movement

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.990
for connecting intrapreneurs
from across these companies

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.290
to work together.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.680
And from there, I
got really interested

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.520
in working with people that
weren't just camouflaging

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.390
within the system.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.120
I think intrapreneurs
really have

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.010
to hide some of
their bigger agenda

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.780
to actually make it fit
with corporate priorities

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.200
and figure out how to
game corporate systems.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.620
And so I wanted to
really work with people

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.060
that were more guerrilla agents
on the outside of our systems,

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.840
working with people in the black
market and informal economies.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.976
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:33.220
-We're lawbreakers.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.715
One law made, a hundred
laws made to break us.

00:08:35.715 --> 00:08:39.180
[CHANTING]

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:42.645
[MUSIC CONTINUES]

00:08:58.540 --> 00:08:59.290
ALEXA CLAY: Great.

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:01.220
So you can see there
in the video some

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:04.940
of the different archetypes that
we focused on within the book.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.910
And really the start
of this all began

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:11.590
with seeing the ways in which a
lot of these illegal economies

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:15.130
actually predated innovations
within the mainstream economy.

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:16.630
So, for example, McDonald's.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:19.340
Before McDonald's invented
the franchising structure,

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:22.060
you actually had the mafia
and groups like Hell's Angels

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.660
that were using
this structure that

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:27.140
predated ways in which
corporations were using it

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:27.750
today.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:30.290
Or looking, for example,
within the porn industry.

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:34.590
I think, thinking beyond
Hulu or YouTube or Netflix,

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.910
it was that video streaming
technology was first used

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.650
really within the porn sector.

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:42.620
And then for me, the real
epiphany for a lot of this work

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.040
began when I started
meeting people that

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.840
used to run drug businesses.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.070
So one of the first
conversations I had

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:52.600
was with a guy who
made over $8,000

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.290
a week running a
heroin business,

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:57.176
and he was an
amazing entrepreneur.

00:09:57.176 --> 00:09:58.550
I came to see that
even though he

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:00.790
was on the wrong side of
the law in a lot of ways,

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:05.290
he was managing a
product, building a brand,

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:08.590
doing customer recruitment,
retaining employees.

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:11.490
He did all the things that any
traditional entrepreneur would

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:14.450
do, and yet he ended
up going to prison,

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:17.360
and in getting out of prison he
didn't have many opportunities

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.420
for employment.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:22.040
And so he got connected with a
program called Defy Ventures,

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.220
and the purpose of Defy
Ventures is basically

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.290
to bridge these worlds of
formal entrepreneurship

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:29.970
and the traditional
venture capital community

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:33.520
with the world of
prisons and ex-cons

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.260
and people that do have
these amazing entrepreneurial

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.360
leadership skills
but need to plug

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.130
into formal entrepreneurship.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:43.450
And so Defy Ventures
runs what is

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:46.210
a bit of an incubator or
accelerator for people

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:50.680
to pitch and grow their skills
within the formal economy.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.600
And another conversation
that I had really

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.140
early on was with
someone called King Tone,

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.520
and he was the former
leader of the Latin

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.300
Kings, a Hispanic street gang.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:02.540
And they had just undergone,
in the late '90s, one

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:05.070
of their deadliest
periods, where

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:07.570
the gang had done
this internal purging,

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:10.270
and they were really being
penetrated by the FBI

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.690
and at risk of
losing their license

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:14.340
to operate in a lot of ways.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.700
And Tone was someone
who really was thinking

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.900
about how to do
change management

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:20.760
from within this gang culture.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:24.230
He wanted to ask, what if we
take this gang and transition

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:27.890
it more into a social movement
like the Black Panthers?

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:31.980
And so he built alliances
with activist groups,

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.910
and really tried
to upscale the gang

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:39.010
to develop some of these skills
to become more of a civic actor

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:42.010
rather than just being dependent
on the criminal economy.

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:45.150
And he encountered a
lot of challenge there.

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:46.860
There were many people
that didn't want

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.680
to see the Latin Kings evolve.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.620
There were many people,
too, whose incomes

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:53.410
depended on the illicit economy.

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:55.280
And even within the
gang, there were so

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.861
many people who didn't want
to lose the stealthy nature

00:11:58.861 --> 00:11:59.360
of the game.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.740
They didn't want to come
out and be more publicly

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:05.680
visible as a force for good in
the world, because they were

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:09.790
deeply threatened by a lot of
the traditional power systems

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.061
and by having a public brand.

00:12:12.061 --> 00:12:13.810
You know, this was a
brand that had always

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:15.050
stayed in the shadows.

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:17.560
So he's someone that I've
continued to talk to and really

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:22.280
focus on how we can build better
risk taking and decision making

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.050
skills for youth.

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:26.950
But he also completely changed
my mindset about gang cultures

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:27.670
in the US.

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:29.570
And he's now working
on a memoir project

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:31.820
to help document
some of his stories

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:34.550
from within the Latin Kings.

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:36.760
Another person,
in a similar vein

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.600
of how do we use people
that were formerly

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.220
within these black market
or illicit economies

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.287
and plug them into
the formal economt--

00:12:44.287 --> 00:12:45.870
Chris and I were
chatting a little bit

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:47.730
about moonshine,
which I've developed

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:49.870
a new-found appreciation
for, and we've

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:52.930
been taking moonshine around to
a bunch of our launch events.

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:55.520
How many of you guys have
tried moonshine before?

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.020
Yeah?

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:56.840
OK.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:00.150
Are you from, like,
Appalachia, or you just-- it's

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:01.470
like a new hipster phenomenon?

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:02.366
AUDIENCE: Ah, no, no.

00:13:02.366 --> 00:13:03.262
It's [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:05.245 --> 00:13:06.120
ALEXA CLAY: OK, cool.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.242
They make their own?

00:13:07.242 --> 00:13:08.226
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:13:08.226 --> 00:13:08.850
ALEXA CLAY: OK.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:09.350
Nice.

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:11.960
Yeah, so it's fantastic.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.180
We made moonshine cocktails
at one of our launches,

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.044
and it was just-- It's
really a forceful drink.

00:13:17.044 --> 00:13:19.210
But to me it's interesting,
because in Tennessee now

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:19.890
it's legalized.

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:21.840
So after the financial
crisis there,

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.240
the state decided to legalize
the production of moonshine,

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.110
and so now there are
all these companies

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:29.450
that are emerging that
are actually working

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:31.580
with old school bootleggers.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.070
So people that have been
doing this, and it's

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:36.260
been passed on as a
sort of artisanal craft

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:37.210
for generations.

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:39.920
And so the founder of
Sugarlands, for example,

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.850
is working with all
these old bootleggers,

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:44.050
and he told me at
their first meeting

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:45.540
he met with a guy
who was drinking

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.650
moonshine out of a bear claw.

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:49.870
And so you just have this
really interesting bridge

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:52.410
between these informal
cultures on the one hand

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:54.310
and these new companies
that are trying

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:58.170
to package this and provide
economic opportunity for people

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:01.720
that have been formerly
in the illicit economy.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:02.640
And camel milk.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.720
Camel milk is another thing
that I have been evangelizing

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.410
and forcing people to try.

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:09.810
We profile camel milk
in the book a bit,

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:12.230
looking at the ways in
which Amish camel milk

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:14.800
farmers around the US are
distributing camel milk.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.530
It's now a product that's
available in Whole Foods

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:19.410
here in California, for example.

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:23.810
And it's essentially being sold,
to get around FDA regulations,

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:25.810
through buyer's clubs,
buyer's clubs that

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:27.290
are similar to
the ones that were

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:31.010
created in the '80s to
sell HIV-AIDS medication.

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:35.010
So it's mostly for sold
through membership associations

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:37.740
like that, and there are a huge
group of lobbyists or activists

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:39.660
now who are working
on trying to legalize

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:42.660
camel milk within the US.

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.460
Copycats.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:48.620
Traveling to India and China
and Brazil for this research,

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:51.610
I met a lot of people that
really didn't care a whole lot

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:53.190
about intellectual property.

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:56.670
They basically were fine to
infringe on corporate patents.

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:58.470
And so, for example,
in India I spoke

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:01.950
to someone who was essentially
reverse engineering

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:04.240
pharmaceutical drugs
and making them

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:08.060
much more accessible and
affordable for the poor there.

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:10.120
And this became a really
interesting strategy,

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.995
and the more that I
researched this, the more

00:15:11.995 --> 00:15:13.820
that I came to see
the ways in which

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.900
Western pharmaceutical
companies, in response

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.730
to the pressure of
copycat imitators in a lot

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:22.840
of these markets, actually
had to develop tiered pricing

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.280
models to compete.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.550
So in this way, the copycats
who were questioning

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:30.730
the monopolistic practices
of a lot of these companies

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:34.460
forced these Western companies,
ultimately, to evolve.

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:36.990
And I think it's a bit ironic,
because certainly in the US,

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:40.130
a lot of the founding of
the US industrial economy

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:44.110
was built on patent robbers
who stole patents from Western

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:47.250
Europe and commercialized
them here in the US,

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:48.890
completely infringing on it.

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:52.410
And yet, it's now companies,
mostly US companies,

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.120
who are abroad who
are trying to protect

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.820
their IP in a similar way.

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:59.210
And going to another
historic culture,

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:01.190
part of the premise
of this book was

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:04.550
to say, well, what can we
learn from these alternative

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:08.250
economies to actually reprogram
the mainstream economy?

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:11.540
And so we did a lot of
research into self-governance,

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:13.640
into different
ways of organizing.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.550
And it became really
interesting, in fact,

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:17.770
to study historic
pirate cultures,

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:21.250
and to see ways in which
pirates organized their vessels.

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:23.940
And a lot of historic
pirates were actually

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:28.320
escaping the dehumanizing
conditions of merchant vessels,

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:32.670
and so they created egalitarian
societies aboard their ships.

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:35.020
They actually
created constitutions

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:37.920
to govern their vessels before
constitutions were created

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.460
by Western European
nations, and they

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:45.900
had more egalitarian pay systems
than the merchant vessels.

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:48.860
And similarly, Anonymous
was another organization--

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:50.610
and a lot of hacker
collectives, actually,

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:52.700
that we studied were
really interesting

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:56.430
in pioneering decentralized
forms of leaderlessness.

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:58.640
You also saw this in
the Occupy movement.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.330
So we really came
to understand ways

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:04.260
in which cultures and
corporate cultures

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:08.211
could actually leverage
principles from decentralized

00:17:08.211 --> 00:17:09.460
governance and leaderlessness.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:13.050
You know, there's not any
one person within Anonymous

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:17.690
that is the spokesperson or that
is controlling the actions that

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:19.819
are undertaken by the group.

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:22.780
Anyone can submit to take
an action under Anonymous,

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:26.010
and then other people that
want to go in on that action

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:26.630
are welcome.

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:29.570
And so that became
another way of thinking

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:32.190
about inspiring
examples of cultures

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:34.260
that were more
self-governing, and now you

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.510
do see corporate cultures
that are beginning

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:39.750
to experiment more with this.

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:42.090
And then another element
that we really looked at

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:45.940
was this idea of the hacker
ethos, not merely Anonymous

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.780
and IT hackers, but the
ways in which the hacker

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:52.090
ethos was spilling over
into mainstream culture.

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:56.250
And one of my conversations that
just left me totally buzzing

00:17:56.250 --> 00:18:00.450
was with this guy Gary Slutkin,
who basically went around

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:02.990
to try and hack the
problem of violence.

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:05.870
So he in a lot of ways was
more of a late blooming

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:09.230
misfit, a reluctant
hacker, but he started off

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:12.800
as a researcher in
infectious disease.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.820
He did work on tuberculosis, and
malaria and HIV-AIDS in Africa

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:17.540
for years.

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:18.340
He burnt out.

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:20.980
He ended up going back
to his native Chicago,

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:23.430
and there in Chicago, started
reading the newspaper,

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:26.580
and reading all of these
incidents of violence

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:30.340
and urban and inner city gangs
and all the issues there,

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:33.960
and so started studying these
patterns of violent outbreak

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.840
and recognizing that
violence spreads

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:41.170
exactly the same way that an
infectious disease spreads.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:43.040
And so from this
insight, he went

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.850
about trying to cure the world
of violence in the same way

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:48.020
that you would go about
curing or containing

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:49.650
an infectious disease.

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:53.200
So he created a network of
violence interrupters, people

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:57.510
that could be called
in to mediate instances

00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:00.250
where violence might
erupt or might occur.

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:03.020
And in many neighborhoods,
where you don't necessarily

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:06.240
feel comfortable calling
in your local police force,

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:10.240
calling in this trusted
intermediary who

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.480
isn't going to
put the law on you

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.290
was safer for a lot
of these communities.

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:16.120
And a lot of the
violence interrupters,

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.511
similar to the community
health outreach model,

00:19:18.511 --> 00:19:20.010
are actually from
these communities,

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:23.170
so they have much more trust.

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:25.050
From there, I've been
doing a lot of research

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:27.790
on another kind of
alternative community, which

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:29.380
are the world of LARPing.

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:33.300
I don't know how many people
have ever LARPed before?

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:34.900
One?

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:35.850
You're Google.

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:36.440
Two.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.480
You've done everything.

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:40.290
You drink moonshine and LARP.

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:42.470
So I'm doing my first
LARP in a few weeks.

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:45.280
But I think this
genre is especially

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.570
interesting for testing
out alternative scenarios,

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:51.710
and particularly the
Nordic LARP scene really

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:54.600
allows you to prototype
alternative worlds.

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.720
So if you have a
question about--

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.530
If you're building an
alternative financial system,

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:02.650
or you're really interested
in living in a communitarian

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:05.480
society, rather than
fully commit to that,

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.020
you can actually just spend
three hours exploring what

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.860
that world would look like.

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:12.920
And in many ways, I think LARP
is an interesting phenomenon,

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.140
too, because you have to inhabit
these alternative identities,

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:19.420
and so that touches a bit
on my love for alter egos

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:21.809
and seeing that as
you begin to inhabit

00:20:21.809 --> 00:20:23.350
these different
personalities there's

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:24.890
this phenomenon
of bleeding, where

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:28.150
some of the characteristics
of the character that you're

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:31.160
playing come to bleed into
your normal personality.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.770
And in many ways, sometimes
that can be destabilizing.

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:35.880
Other times it can be
deeply therapeutic,

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:39.824
as you come to test out
different personality traits.

00:20:39.824 --> 00:20:41.490
I was interviewing
someone the other day

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:45.830
who told me he learned how to
be an extrovert through LARP.

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:48.090
And so going through all
these different case studies,

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:53.620
we essentially synthesized five
key principles that were really

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:55.690
part of these misfit
economies that we think

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:59.420
can be applied to more formal
systems that are in need

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.150
of change and provocation.

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:04.800
And so certainly this idea of
hustle is really important.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.550
It's something that we
see tying the black market

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:10.810
communities of drug
dealers, of gangsters,

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:13.220
with the startup and
tech communities.

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:16.130
The next is really looking
at that hacker ethos,

00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:19.740
and how that is not just
functioning within those IT

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:23.919
communities, but spilling over
and becoming-- people, even

00:21:23.919 --> 00:21:26.210
intrapreneurs who are trying
to hack corporate cultures

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:29.170
from the inside, or people
that are trying to hack

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:31.250
vital societal problems.

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:34.230
Looking at the power
of copycat behavior

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:35.840
and what happens
when people actually

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.670
start collaborating
and putting less

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:40.750
of a premium on
intellectual property.

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:45.180
Looking at-- with LARP, or with
some of the more provocative

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.420
artistic protagonists that we
profiled in the book-- looking

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:50.600
at the power of provocation.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.220
Definitely, you see this a
lot in activist groups, too.

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:56.002
But how do we ask the
questions that not only get us

00:21:56.002 --> 00:21:57.710
to think about different
business models,

00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:00.440
but get us to really
question entire systems?

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.670
So we did a lot of
interviews, for example,

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:05.550
with protagonists within
the unschooling system,

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:07.050
and looking at
people that were even

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:09.010
questioning the entire
construct of how

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:11.160
we do traditional education.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.920
And then lastly, you
have maybe heard a lot

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.070
about pivots and lean startups.

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:18.290
And so for us we
really looked at pivots

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:22.650
as a different phenomenon,
pivots as personal pivots.

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:24.930
So many of the misfits
that we spoke to

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:26.770
were incredible in
the sense that they

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:30.470
were able to walk
the road less chosen.

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:33.400
They were able to take
these dramatic leaps

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:37.620
and go into new fields and
tolerate a great degree

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:39.510
of ambiguity and take risks.

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.340
And so we focus a
lot on these stories

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:44.820
of people that truly got
out of their comfort zones

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:47.900
and were able to bring
diverse worlds together

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:51.370
to accomplish some of their
entrepreneurial ventures.

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.470
And as a result, we have
"The Misfit Economy",

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:54.560
the book in front of you.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:57.130
We also did a spin
out show on NAT GEO,

00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:59.400
called "Underworld, Inc."
which ran for a time.

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.510
We had a Kickstarter
campaign initially,

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:03.530
where we raised over $70,000.

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:04.710
That got us started.

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:06.820
And we worked with
both traditional media,

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:08.900
but then we've also done
a few quirky things.

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:13.672
So we worked to get
Nigerian spam sent out

00:23:13.672 --> 00:23:15.130
around the time of
our book launch,

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:17.390
where we developed
these fake spam notes--

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:19.500
I don't know if you could
see these from here--

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.360
and sent these to
all of our friends,

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:24.920
and that was enormously
fun, and a lot of people

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.580
didn't realize that it was fake.

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:28.850
And then we also tagged a city.

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:31.240
So we did a bunch of graffiti
around New York City,

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.350
and we also tagged
it with stickers.

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:34.850
And then we had a
launch party where

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:37.480
we brought a bunch
of drug kingpins

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:41.780
and sort of big mavericks
within the black market economy

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:42.280
together.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.390
So in the middle
there is George Young,

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:47.320
who inspired Johnny Depp's
performance in the movie

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:48.620
"Blow".

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:50.770
We also have Antonio
Fernandez, who

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:54.500
I mentioned earlier, who was
the leader of the Latin Kings,

00:23:54.500 --> 00:24:00.710
and David Victorson, who
smuggled 37 tons of marijuana

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:04.170
from Colombia to
Seattle, Washington.

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:07.360
And this was an interesting
event, because on the one hand,

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.680
we brought together
all these leaders who

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.930
are amazing entrepreneurs
in the black market economy,

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:13.700
and then we brought
them in conversation

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:17.440
with the tech scene and startup
founders in New York City.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.160
And this is basically what
we want to do more of.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:23.030
How can we actually harvest
some of these skills

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:25.460
and give these guys more
of a platform, an avenue

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:29.000
to talk about some of the
lessons that they learned

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.680
and get this into the
hands of entrepreneurs

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:33.770
who are maybe on the
other side of the law

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:34.700
in the formal economy?

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:36.074
And I think part
of this question

00:24:36.074 --> 00:24:37.470
is a question of access.

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:39.120
I recently just
did this bus trip

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.230
where I was traveling
around the US,

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:44.065
and in every community
that I went to,

00:24:44.065 --> 00:24:47.400
you have amazing spaces like
this, these tech incubator

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.020
spaces that have tons
of resources and rock

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:52.920
climbing walls and great foods--
I saw that you were eating

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.570
a coconut, which is awesome.

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:56.210
And then on the
other side of town,

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:59.180
you have people
who are basically

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:02.180
just street hustlers, who don't
have any of these resources

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:04.730
but who have all the
skills of entrepreneurship.

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:06.680
And how do we bridge
these worlds together?

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.640
So that's part of my
mission moving forward

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.850
is that the book isn't
just a book in itself,

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:13.020
but it's an
invitation for people

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:14.880
from these different
communities to find

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:20.510
ways of plugging in and creating
bridges across one another.

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:22.310
And then another
thing that's evolved

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:25.990
is some really interventionist
artistic projects,

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:28.249
where I've been inspired
by some of the misfits

00:25:28.249 --> 00:25:29.790
that I've interviewed,
and I've tried

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:31.260
to activate this in my own work.

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:33.410
So I used to write
a lot of poetry,

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:36.810
and no one really
read this poetry.

00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:38.440
My parents didn't even read it.

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.860
So I maybe had,
like, five people

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:41.320
that would read this poetry.

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.130
And so there's so
many poets out there

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:44.440
where this is also an issue.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.510
You have this amazing
language, and yet there's

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:49.380
no real mainstream
audience for it.

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:52.690
So we developed this fun
thing called Porn and Poetry,

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:55.660
where we basically worked
with hackers to hack porn

00:25:55.660 --> 00:26:00.900
sites with poems, so as you're
watching a particular video,

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:03.090
you'll suddenly get
this crazy popup that's

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:05.640
not like your usual
porn popup, that's

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.890
a beautiful poem
by one of the poets

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:09.160
that we've curated it from.

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:13.540
So that project is going
strong, and has been really fun.

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:16.040
And that brings
me to alter egos.

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:19.280
Another artistic project
that I've been exploring

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:22.760
is a character called
the Amish futurist.

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:25.839
And there's a lot
of good heritage.

00:26:25.839 --> 00:26:27.880
We were making fun of
Bowie a little bit earlier,

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.870
but there's a lot of good
folks that have experimented

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:32.920
with alter egos themselves.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:35.930
And my version of this
was this Amish lady.

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:39.370
So I started wearing
Amish clothes and a bonnet

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:43.470
and going around to tech
conferences and startup places

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:47.580
and basically just asking people
very Socratic and existential

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:50.640
questions, trying to get into
the bigger meaning of what

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.340
they were doing.

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:53.420
So for me, one of my
prime frustrations

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:56.630
is not really understanding
the bigger role

00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:58.820
that the technologies
that people are creating

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:00.760
have on our subjective lives.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.430
Like, how is the
technology that you're

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:07.490
making changing my experience
of intimacy or well-being

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:08.039
in the world?

00:27:08.039 --> 00:27:09.830
And so these were some
of the conversations

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:11.850
that I was able to
have as Rebecca, which

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:14.250
is what I call her,
because she's very sweet

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:17.900
and she asks things in
a very vulnerable way

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:19.800
and from an ignorant
place, obviously,

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.610
because she hasn't experienced
a lot of technology.

00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:24.450
And so that's been
a really fun way

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:27.700
of really provoking that scene
and asking hard questions.

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:32.090
And it also in part comes from
a real love of Amish people.

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:34.650
I've spent time
in Amish country.

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:36.770
I have an Amish newspaper
here with me, actually,

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:37.800
if anyone wants to see.

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:40.740
It's very funny, because
they advertise for phones,

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.350
but they advertise for plain
phones in the newspaper.

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:45.150
So it's like as
simple as possible,

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:47.630
where you can't get apps
and you can't text message

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:50.320
and you can only have
credit phone systems.

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:52.540
And in many of these
Amish communities--

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.920
Kevin Kelly has written about
this extensively-- you really

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.550
have slow adoption
of technology.

00:27:57.550 --> 00:28:00.400
So it's not complete
tech abstinence,

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:03.730
but you're really looking
at ways in which you

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:04.880
have these beta testers.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.920
So people with an
Amish community

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:08.660
will test a
particular technology

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:11.680
before it's rolled out for
the entire community to use,

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:14.550
and that's to make sure that
the community understands

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:16.410
the effect of that technology.

00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:19.270
And so I've gone around and
talked to in my Amish persona

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:20.760
about the power of buttermilk.

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.067
And part of the
power of buttermilk

00:28:23.067 --> 00:28:25.150
is the power of tradition,
in that we don't always

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:27.336
need to be innovating,
but that somethings

00:28:27.336 --> 00:28:28.710
are really good,
like buttermilk,

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:31.710
and they should stay the same.

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:33.830
And also really
combating this idea

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:37.170
of the Lone Ranger
type of entrepreneur

00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:39.940
in favor of more collaborative
entrepreneurship, which

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:42.360
you see more in
Luddite communities

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:44.490
and Amish communities.

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:47.250
And for me personally,
the alter ego

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:50.110
gave me the ability to really
deconstruct my own personality.

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:52.560
It was like LARP in some ways.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:54.540
It was very therapeutic.

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:59.670
Suddenly I could be in a very
vulnerable, more feminine

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:02.620
and very sensitive
element, and suddenly

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:05.220
get access to a
version of myself

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:06.570
that I didn't have before.

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:09.610
So I think with
alter egos, we all

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:12.280
can actually tap into
this greater elasticity

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:13.270
that we have.

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:15.100
There's so many
different personalities

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:17.220
that we have inside
of us, and maybe we've

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:20.580
come to live out one version
or one kind of script

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:23.919
of who we are that really
plays to our strengths.

00:29:23.919 --> 00:29:25.460
But I think part of
the joy of living

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:29.750
is to get to experience as many
different versions of yourself

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:30.450
as possible.

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:33.630
At least that's where I get
a lot of pleasure from it.

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:36.330
And from this, I want to
share a little bit more,

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:40.060
lastly, just about this
interest of prophecy.

00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:41.960
Certainly there are
a lot of misfits

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.370
who take part in various
prophetic traditions.

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:47.620
I used to study 17th
century astrologers who

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:49.829
were being kicked out of
the scientific establishment

00:29:49.829 --> 00:29:51.995
and were always predicting
that the end of the world

00:29:51.995 --> 00:29:52.820
was going to come.

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:54.870
And then I also am very
active in following

00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:57.650
the hashtag #prepper,
where you just

00:29:57.650 --> 00:29:59.400
see all these amazing
different people who

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.941
think that the world
is going to end,

00:30:00.941 --> 00:30:04.490
and there's a huge market
for prepper goods in case

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:05.490
this is going to happen.

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:07.580
One of my favorite
prepper personas

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:12.680
is this woman Survivor Jane,
and she basically works on--

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:14.550
after the apocalypse
happens, she

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:17.160
makes sure that people
have access to makeup.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.950
So, like, how do you
forage for cosmetics,

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:22.160
and how you look pretty
after the apocalypse happens?

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.118
So there are all these
like weird personalities

00:30:24.118 --> 00:30:26.710
within the scene.

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:29.960
And for me this asks
this question of, well,

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:33.150
how is spirituality,
how is apocalypse,

00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:37.020
how are our prophetic ideals
and religious beliefs changing

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:38.840
as a result of the digital?

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:42.400
Like, if we take this
wiki kind of concept

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.349
or peer to peer concept
and apply it to religion,

00:30:45.349 --> 00:30:46.390
what does this look like?

00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:49.480
How does greater
decentralization and access

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:52.420
to information affect
our spiritual beliefs?

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:55.920
So one of the things
that I started looking at

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:59.600
was this idea of the mash-up,
where increasingly people

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.670
are taking a little
bit of Buddhism

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:03.750
or a little bit from
the Torah and they're

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:08.410
mashing it up into their
own spiritual system.

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:10.790
And increasingly it's
becoming individual,

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:14.920
but there's an ability to access
this information like never

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:15.440
before.

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.870
And the result of
this was a group

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:19.290
I put together called
Wisdom Hackers, where

00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:22.760
we each explored one burning
question that we were holding.

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:26.810
So one person looked at, for
example, festival spirit.

00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:31.300
He spent a whole summer going
to various music festivals

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:33.800
across Europe and asking
how do we keep festival

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:36.680
spirit alive in everyday life.

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:38.210
My Wisdom Hacker
question was really

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:39.930
around the nature
of identity, which

00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:43.550
was partially my
preoccupation with alter egos.

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:47.010
And this became a community
for us to hold these questions,

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:49.260
where in the busyness
of modern life,

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:53.650
I think we don't often get
to explore deep things that

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:54.567
were actually holding.

00:31:54.567 --> 00:31:56.733
And so how do we give
ourselves not just permission,

00:31:56.733 --> 00:31:58.520
but also build
accountability with peers

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:00.480
to do some of that
investigation?

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.980
So that was something
that we ran.

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:05.300
We had 15 people initially
who each explored a question,

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:08.500
and then we've held global
salons around the world.

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:10.690
And this group next is
putting on something

00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:14.160
that we're calling the
Incubator for the Next Messiah,

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:17.660
and this is basically
"American Idol" for gurus.

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:19.260
The whole idea is
how do we apply

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:23.420
the logic of startup incubation
to the guru industry?

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:26.772
So we're going to work with
a major VC backer in San

00:32:26.772 --> 00:32:28.480
Francisco-- and I'm
going there next week

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:33.000
to begin scouting people-- and
basically have them kick this

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.450
off by launching this
fake press release

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:38.320
where we get them to
talk about their boredom

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:41.270
in investing merely in startups
and say how they want to really

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:43.480
invest in the next guru.

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:46.060
And then we have a whole
source and selection

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:51.050
process for doing that, and
we'll get 15 aspiring gurus

00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:52.250
to go through this process.

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:54.660
And this is
interesting, because it

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:56.580
plays to different
markets in different ways.

00:32:56.580 --> 00:33:00.110
It can be more of a pure
play reality program,

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:06.640
but then we also hope to embed
more of a satirical group

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:10.340
within it to actually film more
of the funny bits that happen,

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:11.715
and not for it to
be so straight,

00:33:11.715 --> 00:33:15.750
but for it to actually be
a bit more of a satire.

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:18.930
And so that plays to
a mainstream audience,

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:21.010
but then also to more
of a snarky audience

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:24.680
that we can cultivate
online and do more guerrilla

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:27.300
and transmedia engagement with.

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:27.800
Great.

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.900
So that's all I wanted to share.

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:31.730
Thank you guys so
much for listening.

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:36.230
And I think we have a little
bit of time for a Q&amp;A. Cool.

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.730
Great.

00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:38.330
So, any questions?

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:41.840
Any alter ego ideas that
people are thinking about?

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:52.610
CHRIS: So I'll
pop up here first.

00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:54.220
First let's give a round
of applause to Alexa.

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:55.219
Thanks so much for that.

00:33:55.219 --> 00:33:58.171
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:58.244 --> 00:33:59.660
And this is something
that we were

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:02.118
kind of to discussing as we
were walking around the office,

00:34:02.118 --> 00:34:03.670
but I think it's interesting.

00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:06.096
How do you go about sourcing
these people and meeting them

00:34:06.096 --> 00:34:07.720
and then securing
interviews with them?

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.303
I mean, you're talking
to gang members

00:34:09.303 --> 00:34:11.210
and pirates and hackers,
people who generally

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:12.219
don't want to be found.

00:34:12.219 --> 00:34:13.460
Can you just talk
about that a little?

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:13.610
ALEXA CLAY: Yeah.

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:14.109
Yeah.

00:34:14.109 --> 00:34:15.699
Definitely.

00:34:15.699 --> 00:34:18.280
So there's no LinkedIn for the
black market economy, which

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:20.060
would have been really easy.

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:22.210
There is a fixer industry,
that I didn't realize

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:23.420
until after writing the book.

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:25.670
So there are people
that can connect you

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:28.850
with leading gangsters
or Somali pirates.

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:31.929
I wasn't a journalist by trade,
so I didn't know that existed.

00:34:31.929 --> 00:34:35.205
But we really just
asked everyone we knew.

00:34:35.205 --> 00:34:36.663
So we went to
different-- You know,

00:34:36.663 --> 00:34:38.560
when I showed up in
India, for example,

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:40.070
we were trying to
find someone who

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:42.840
could sell us drugs
initially, and just

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:46.630
take every avenue that we
could to find these guys.

00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:49.650
We got in touch with the
guy from the Latin Kings

00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:52.290
through the Occupy
Movement, but it was really

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:56.780
just-- There wasn't like
a rigorous ability to be,

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:59.120
like, this is exactly
who we want to speak to,

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:01.350
and it was more just
who we encountered.

00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:05.090
But we found some
amazing, incredible folks,

00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:07.455
and I think the
book is really-- You

00:35:07.455 --> 00:35:10.470
go from starting with an Amish
camel milk farmer to going

00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:13.417
to Somali pirates
and then King Tone,

00:35:13.417 --> 00:35:15.500
and you begin to see some
of the similarities that

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.230
are animating these very
different types of personality.

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:22.507
So it was definitely hard,
and took, like, three years,

00:35:22.507 --> 00:35:24.590
and I'm still getting
introduced to people now who

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:25.340
I'm writing about.

00:35:31.355 --> 00:35:33.980
AUDIENCE: During that process of
encountering all these people,

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:36.720
how often did you feel
threatened or scared,

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:39.230
or possibly get
arrested or harassed

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:42.220
by non-misfit economy people?

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:43.400
ALEXA CLAY: Yeah.

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:46.800
So I never really felt
physically threatened

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:47.650
or frightened.

00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:49.320
There was one-- If
you saw the video,

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.330
I was on the back
of that motorcycle.

00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:53.960
That was the worst experience.

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:58.680
That was a gangster who is
a third generation mafia

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:01.930
guy, associated with Dawood
Ibrahim's gang in India,

00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:03.500
which is notorious.

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:06.430
And he was a little bit
fucked up that evening,

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:09.210
and decided to perform
for our filmmaker, who

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:11.230
was, like, yeah, great
shot, get on the bike,

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:13.330
and was just like
doing wheelies.

00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:16.020
And so I felt like
I almost died then.

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:24.280
There weren't any moments where
we really felt threatened.

00:36:27.149 --> 00:36:28.690
AUDIENCE: So it
seems like a big part

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:30.320
of the concept of
the misfit economy

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:33.430
is to question a lot of the
rules that are put forth.

00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:34.980
And one of things
you did is you had

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:37.800
a lot of people who are,
in essence, criminals, who

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:40.134
are breaking those
rules for reasons that

00:36:40.134 --> 00:36:41.800
help them business-wise,
but then you're

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.114
connecting them with startups.

00:36:43.114 --> 00:36:45.280
But then you also talk about
the more spiritual side

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:50.600
of thinking through
the process of maybe

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:53.350
not necessarily breaking
those rules, but what that is.

00:36:53.350 --> 00:36:55.760
So how are you dealing, I
guess, with that balance?

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.780
Because it seems
to me that you have

00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:01.220
a big moral issue of telling
people-- which you see a lot,

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:03.195
I think, in startups
and in big businesses,

00:37:03.195 --> 00:37:05.580
because they will break
rules that they should not

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:10.340
be breaking and vice versa,
other rules that some companies

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:11.852
break that ends up
making them big.

00:37:11.852 --> 00:37:12.560
ALEXA CLAY: Yeah.

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.185
AUDIENCE: So how do
you kind of balance

00:37:14.185 --> 00:37:15.700
that, I guess, in this concept?

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:16.670
ALEXA CLAY: Yeah.

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:18.480
I think it's
definitely a challenge.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:21.320
And I think the first thing
that we tried to overcome

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:23.870
was this idea that we
can't just see the world

00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:25.710
in good and evil terms.

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:27.800
Particularly, I think,
having more empathy

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.360
for the black market innovators,
because a lot of these guys

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.070
were born into poverty,
and this activity

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:38.330
provided a way of actually
growing economically.

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:40.760
So maybe I have more
patience and tolerance

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.990
for people that are breaking
the rules in that sense,

00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:45.240
because they're coming from
environments of constraint

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:49.140
versus a company like Uber,
whose success really owes

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:51.810
to the fact that they are
breaking a lot of rules

00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:56.560
and having regulation
lag behind a lot of that.

00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:59.630
So that, I guess, I
have less empathy for.

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:03.530
But I think particularly coming
from my experience of working

00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:05.870
with intrapreneurs within
the corporate sector,

00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:07.910
they were breaking
rules all the time.

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:09.900
And they weren't like
big regulatory rules,

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:12.450
but there are so many
rules and protocols

00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:15.340
that we have within
massive organizations,

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:18.250
in the nature of bureaucracies,
that really stifle innovation.

00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:23.370
So for that subgroup of people,
rule breaking or breaking

00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:26.500
protocol became an important
part of their own survival,

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:29.750
and a way of getting these
very disruptive, often

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:31.260
social and
environmentally driven,

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:34.030
propositions into the company.

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:37.240
So, yeah, I wouldn't say there's
one blanket answer on that.

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:39.660
But it's definitely
a good question.

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:41.820
And I think the whole
spirit of is how do we

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:45.830
bring greater informality
into the economy generally,

00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:49.570
because we've seen the ways in
which industrial economies have

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:50.570
essentially expired.

00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:52.030
These command and
control systems,

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:53.613
we can't really
afford to live in them

00:38:53.613 --> 00:38:55.760
for a variety of reasons.

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.710
So how do we actually
become better

00:38:57.710 --> 00:39:01.090
at improvising and creating some
of these new types of systems

00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:02.416
that we see more on the fringe?

00:39:06.525 --> 00:39:07.900
AUDIENCE: In a
lot of your slides

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:09.358
and what you've
been discussing, it

00:39:09.358 --> 00:39:11.470
seems like a
gendered issue, where

00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:13.770
a lot of the people who
you're talking to were male.

00:39:13.770 --> 00:39:14.790
ALEXA CLAY: Yeah.

00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:16.770
AUDIENCE: Do you think
that's attributed

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:21.290
to similar situations where it's
just the patriarchy overall?

00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:24.484
Do you think it's some kind
of other kind of system

00:39:24.484 --> 00:39:25.400
that's involved there?

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:28.620
And how are women involved
in this situation,

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:29.922
this misfit economy?

00:39:29.922 --> 00:39:30.630
ALEXA CLAY: Yeah.

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:32.421
I think it's really
interesting, because we

00:39:32.421 --> 00:39:34.260
tried to find a lot of
female protagonists,

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:35.635
but even within--
you know, there

00:39:35.635 --> 00:39:38.730
are Latin Queens in
addition to the Latin Kings.

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:41.020
But a lot of the criminals,
particularly the ones who

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:45.000
were able to take the
most risk and also

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.630
able to speak to us, because
of the nature of their egos

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:53.340
that weren't really threatened
by us, they ended up being men.

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:56.270
And I think in many ways,
the sort of personality--

00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:58.740
When we had our launch
party, for example,

00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:02.500
and these drug
kingpins were there,

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:06.127
there was something really
fatalistic in their thinking.

00:40:06.127 --> 00:40:07.710
Like, they knew they
would get caught.

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:09.760
They knew this
wouldn't last forever.

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:15.000
And they were basically
chasing, some of them,

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.110
women and money
in a lot of ways.

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:20.850
And I do think since
we've encountered

00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:24.500
a lot of case studies of
entrepreneurs that are women.

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:27.030
So within Somali piracy,
for example, it's

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:28.940
not that women are
becoming pirates,

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:32.590
but they're actually supplying
a lot of the narcotic

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:34.470
that the pirates are
becoming dependent on.

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:37.580
And so that's less
risk in a lot of ways,

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:39.900
and they can manage that
domestically while being

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:43.420
embedded locally in community.

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:47.120
Even when I stayed
with an Amish family,

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:51.520
there was one particular woman
who was serving us all dinner,

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.140
and then didn't even
sit down with us.

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:54.900
And so you saw
ways in which there

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:57.590
was kind of a patriarchal
culture that was forming.

00:40:57.590 --> 00:41:01.370
But then after that,
we all went downstairs,

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:04.300
and she just destroyed
everyone at ping-pong.

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:07.990
She just was, like, totally
wicked and serving and spiking.

00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:10.610
And for me it was beautiful,
but there was also

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:13.240
this sort of moment of sadness,
because I realized suddenly

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:15.370
she had all this
energy within her

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:18.020
and all this drive and
force and fierceness

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:21.625
that she didn't really have
an outlet in the world for.

00:41:21.625 --> 00:41:23.000
So I think it's
a great question,

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.900
and it's something I'm
continually exploring.

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:28.161
But I wouldn't say there's
one narrative that I've really

00:41:28.161 --> 00:41:30.160
been able to pull out,
where I can just say, oh,

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:32.740
black market's evil, patriarchy.

00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:35.125
But yeah, there are a lot
of issues there for sure.

00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:45.460
AUDIENCE: So I guess a lot of
the alternative communities

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:48.780
are sort of antagonistic
to each other,

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:50.860
and I'm kind of
interested in what

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:54.210
happens where these
communities, economies, rub up

00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:57.830
against each other, in the sense
that the people that you're

00:41:57.830 --> 00:42:01.632
talking to are unusual,
maybe in those--

00:42:01.632 --> 00:42:04.790
And so you're sort of talking
to the misfits of the misfits,

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:06.770
in a way.

00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:10.990
How did their lives play out
after they've decided that they

00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:12.470
wanted to take on that role.

00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:17.000
Do they end up just going
back to the way they were?

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.280
Do they make a choice?

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:19.860
Do they cross over?

00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:21.042
That kind of stuff.

00:42:21.042 --> 00:42:21.750
ALEXA CLAY: Yeah.

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:24.320
I think it's an
interesting question.

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:27.490
First of all, we didn't
just try and profile

00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:30.690
status quo individuals within
the black market economy.

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:33.787
So even within-- King Tone,
who ran the Latin Kings,

00:42:33.787 --> 00:42:35.370
we were trying to
find someone who was

00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:37.050
trying to change that culture.

00:42:37.050 --> 00:42:39.420
And all the misfits
that we profiled

00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:42.560
were people that were
born into certain cultures

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.810
and were actively trying
to change them from within.

00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:48.920
So I think that's something
they definitely all share.

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.790
And your other
question was about what

00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:53.821
happens after they sort
of embrace this identity.

00:42:53.821 --> 00:42:54.820
Well, I think it's hard.

00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:56.890
I think-- And this
is the challenge

00:42:56.890 --> 00:42:59.950
of-- The end of the book is,
like, what happens when we all

00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:01.650
embrace our inner misfits?

00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:05.820
And I think the more
authentic you feel you are,

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:07.930
the more pushback
you can often get

00:43:07.930 --> 00:43:10.600
from the cultures or
the institutions that

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:11.750
are hosting you.

00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:14.920
So it is often a
balance of how there's

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:18.970
a trade off between
individuality and authenticity

00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:21.750
on the one hand and the
degree of conformity

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:25.010
that we need to fit into
different institutions.

00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:28.190
Tone failed, ultimately,
at transforming the Kings,

00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:32.030
because of the external pushback
and the internal pushback.

00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:35.480
And a lot of the intrapreneurs
that we profiled ultimately

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:38.980
had to jump ship, because they
realized these cultures weren't

00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:42.240
actually fostering the
type of environment they

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:44.450
needed to bring these
innovations to life.

00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:47.250
So I think it's a
really hard balance

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:49.457
for those that can
to try and leave

00:43:49.457 --> 00:43:50.540
the cultures they're from.

00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:52.910
That's sometimes
the avenue for that.

00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:56.880
But in other cases, you just
need enormous resilience,

00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:59.670
because you are going
against the dominant culture

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:04.350
and grain of the systems
that you're part of,

00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:06.194
and that's exhausting.

00:44:06.194 --> 00:44:07.610
And I think both
of my parents did

00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:09.380
that in very different
ways growing up,

00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:12.290
so it's a sort of
battle that I'm used to,

00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:14.260
and it's why have
appreciation for it.

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:16.406
But if you're doing things
that aren't normalized

00:44:16.406 --> 00:44:19.030
in the world, where people don't
really understand where you're

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:21.290
coming from, or you're
asking questions

00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:24.770
that feel like they're very
alien to people, that can

00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:26.760
be very threatening for people.

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:28.620
And so one of the
things we look at

00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:31.690
is how these groups
need entourages,

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:33.090
need these support networks.

00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:35.230
Whether or not you're
a gangster trying

00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:37.302
to transform within
the gang or you're

00:44:37.302 --> 00:44:38.760
someone within a
corporation trying

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:43.240
to do that, or even this book
project owes to, like, 20

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:45.450
of my closest friends
who were always there

00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:47.939
and able to support me.

00:44:47.939 --> 00:44:49.730
So I think for anyone
doing anything that's

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:53.920
a bit offbeat or unusual, having
that core group of support

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:55.960
people that can
normalize your reality

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:58.890
for you is really important
as you're trying to unplug
