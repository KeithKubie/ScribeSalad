00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.568
My opponent tonight
is Jason Kander,

00:00:02.601 --> 00:00:04.370
president of Let America Vote.

00:00:04.403 --> 00:00:05.538
Here's all you need to know.

00:00:05.571 --> 00:00:07.673
Let America Vote
is an organization

00:00:07.706 --> 00:00:10.143
that fights voter suppression,
which is weird.

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:12.678
I've never had
any problem voting.

00:00:12.711 --> 00:00:15.948
He's a former Army captain
who served in Afghanistan.

00:00:15.981 --> 00:00:19.218
As general of this TV show,
I expect a firm salute.

00:00:19.251 --> 00:00:22.221
In one of Barack Obama's
final interviews as president,

00:00:22.254 --> 00:00:24.557
he described him as one
of the rising stars

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:25.958
in the Democratic Party.

00:00:25.991 --> 00:00:28.761
Look out, Candidate
Oprah-Booker-Kaepernick-Dunham.

00:00:28.794 --> 00:00:31.030
Jason Kander, everybody.
Jason, welcome.

00:00:31.063 --> 00:00:32.498
(cheering and applause)

00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:36.903
So, Jason, you made a splash
with a campaign ad back in 2016.

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:38.771
You were running for senator
in Missouri.

00:00:38.804 --> 00:00:39.972
Let's take a look at it.

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:41.974
I also believe
in background checks

00:00:42.007 --> 00:00:44.444
so that terrorists can't get
their hands on one of these.

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:46.979
I approve this message,

00:00:47.012 --> 00:00:50.316
because I'd like to see
Senator Blunt do this.

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:52.852
Okay, wow. Wow.

00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:55.054
-Whoops? We like guns.
-Thank you.

00:00:55.087 --> 00:00:57.857
We respond to guns.
But you're a Democrat with a gun

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.058
wearing a blindfold.

00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:00.593
What was the point of that?

00:01:00.626 --> 00:01:02.528
You wear the blindfold
'cause you didn't want to...

00:01:02.561 --> 00:01:04.797
make eye contact with the gun?
What's going on there?

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.200 line:0%
-I didn't want it to get weird.
-Yeah, no, not at all.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:09.702 line:0%
-No... -A Democrat holding a
gun-- automatically, it's weird.

00:01:09.735 --> 00:01:11.437 line:0%
No, the-the point of it was
that... look,

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.673 line:0%
the NRA was saying that...
and they were spending millions

00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:16.275 line:0%
of dollars pointing out that I
had an "F" rating from the NRA,

00:01:16.308 --> 00:01:19.479 line:0%
which I proudly have. And,
you know, we wanted to respond.

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:21.881
And the way I wanted to respond
was to say, "Look, yeah,

00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:24.016
"I'm for background checks
and the NRA's wrong about this

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:25.952
and, also, I know what the heck
I'm talking about."

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:27.820
-So that's what that ad was.
-(stammers) You don't know

00:01:27.853 --> 00:01:30.022
what the heck you're talking
about. You are anti-guns.

00:01:30.055 --> 00:01:32.625
America's all about guns
and the Second Amendment.

00:01:32.658 --> 00:01:35.161
Well, I mean, I think given
the fact that I carried one

00:01:35.194 --> 00:01:37.497
as part of my job,
I felt like I was in a position

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.299
to sort of talk about why
it was important that we not,

00:01:40.332 --> 00:01:42.635
for instance, let terrorists
get ahold of a gun like that.

00:01:42.668 --> 00:01:45.638
Now, you, after this ad... It
was... got a little bit of buzz.

00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:47.840
-Mm-hmm. -President Obama said
you were the future

00:01:47.873 --> 00:01:49.976
of the Democratic Party.
What is the future

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.512
of the Democratic Party?
Because you lost that election.

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:55.581
So if that's the future,
great, I'm all in.

00:01:55.614 --> 00:01:58.417
Uh, look, I think right now
the future's pretty great.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.419
I mean, I've been...
I've been in 33 states

00:02:00.452 --> 00:02:02.955
talking to Democrats in the last
year. People are fired up.

00:02:02.988 --> 00:02:05.458
What I'm excited about,
with regards to how excited

00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:08.928
people are, is really just that
it's not like a politician on TV

00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:10.663
that's bringing people out
into the movement--

00:02:10.696 --> 00:02:12.465
it's somebody down the street
from him saying,

00:02:12.498 --> 00:02:13.733
"Hey, I'm going
to this town hall.

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:15.668
"I'm gonna demand answers
about health care.

00:02:15.701 --> 00:02:17.336
"Why don't you go with me
even though we're in

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:18.671
"a super red district?
Why don't you come over

00:02:18.704 --> 00:02:19.872
and make phone calls with me?"

00:02:19.905 --> 00:02:21.407
That's what's bringing
people in,

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.142
and-and I think
that's pretty exciting.

00:02:23.175 --> 00:02:26.145
-You're focusing right now
on voter suppression. -Yeah.

00:02:26.178 --> 00:02:29.949
But what's wrong with making
it hard for people to vote?

00:02:29.982 --> 00:02:32.485
Don't we want the best people
to vote?

00:02:32.518 --> 00:02:34.754
Well, you actually
sort of nailed

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:37.089
-what is the Republican strategy
on this... -Of course I did.

00:02:37.122 --> 00:02:40.226
Well, right. Because they think
that the best people for voting

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:41.694
are people who vote Republican.

00:02:41.727 --> 00:02:44.197
And so the entire strategy
from the Republicans

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.866
is to say that they're gonna
make it harder to vote

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:48.868
for people
who don't vote Republican.

00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:50.670
And I think that's un-American.

00:02:50.703 --> 00:02:52.538
I think we should let
every eligible voter vote.

00:02:52.571 --> 00:02:54.073
That's why I started
Let America Vote--

00:02:54.106 --> 00:02:55.875
to create consequences
politically

00:02:55.908 --> 00:02:57.443
for people who are making it
harder to vote.

00:02:57.476 --> 00:03:00.446
Yeah, but the purpose of voting
is to win.

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:02.949
I think being a winner
is being American.

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:04.717
That's just
the Republicans being winners.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.352
-See, I...
-Is this the right strategy?

00:03:06.385 --> 00:03:07.753
Like, oh, let everybody win.

00:03:07.786 --> 00:03:09.655
Like, okay, let Republicans take
the House again.

00:03:09.688 --> 00:03:11.657
See, I think that, uh,

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.261
what it is to be American is
to say that, you know,

00:03:15.294 --> 00:03:17.396
"Let's have everybody get in
there and make their argument.

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:20.233
We'll let every eligible voter
actually participate,"

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:21.567
as opposed to saying,

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.969
"Let's change the rules
of the election.

00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:25.004
"Let's play a bunch of tricks
so that we can win

00:03:25.037 --> 00:03:26.772
without actually having to sell
anybody on our argument,"

00:03:26.805 --> 00:03:28.608
which is, I think, what
the Republicans are doing.

00:03:28.641 --> 00:03:30.476
But Trump disbanded
the commission

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:34.647
to, uh, explore voter fraud,
so, aren't we done with that?

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.983
Like, we just assume
three million illegal votes

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:39.452
for Hillary, but let's move on.

00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:41.454
So, I'm glad you brought that up

00:03:41.487 --> 00:03:43.356
because
when President Trump said that

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.224
there were three to five million
illegal votes

00:03:45.257 --> 00:03:47.093
in the election,
that's actually, in my mind,

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:49.262
the biggest lie that a
sitting president has ever told.

00:03:49.295 --> 00:03:51.530
And I think when he told that,
a lot of people went,

00:03:51.563 --> 00:03:53.966
"Okay, well, here's just a guy
who lost the popular vote

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:56.035
by about that amount,
and he's making this up."

00:03:56.068 --> 00:03:58.237
And-and that's a reasonable
takeaway from it.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.706
But the rest of the story is,
is that he's really trying

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.275
to undermine faith
in American democracy

00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:05.077
so he can put laws in place
that make it harder to vote

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.246
for people who are really
unlikely to vote for him.

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:08.848
That's really the key
to his reelection strategy.

00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:11.284
So, what is your organization?
What are you actively doing?

00:04:11.317 --> 00:04:13.286
So we create political
consequences for folks

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:14.720
who make it harder to vote.

00:04:14.753 --> 00:04:16.455
Basically, if you are
a Republican politician

00:04:16.488 --> 00:04:18.457
out there right now trying
to keep people from voting,

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.393
we want to keep you
from getting reelected.

00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:21.861
We knocked on 200,000 doors

00:04:21.894 --> 00:04:23.195
in the November elections
last year.

00:04:23.228 --> 00:04:24.897
We're expanding to five states.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.233
We're a boots-on-the-ground
organization that is out there

00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:29.468
making sure that there are
consequences for this,

00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:30.970
for the first time politically.

00:04:31.003 --> 00:04:32.972
-You also have a podcast.
-I do.

00:04:33.005 --> 00:04:35.875
Now, as a liberal,
are you... are you, like,

00:04:35.908 --> 00:04:38.044
contractually obligated
to have a podcast?

00:04:38.077 --> 00:04:39.745
-How does that work?
-Yeah. -(laughter)

00:04:39.778 --> 00:04:41.080
-No. Yeah.
It's part of the deal. -Yeah.

00:04:41.113 --> 00:04:42.348
-It's part of the deal, yeah.
-Uh-huh.

00:04:42.381 --> 00:04:44.083
-And it's great.
-It's like...

00:04:44.116 --> 00:04:46.686
It's also huge money. Like,
the jet is great, you know.

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:48.087
-I can only imagine.
-Yeah...

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.222
-You got into public service
and podcasting. -Yeah. Yeah.

00:04:50.255 --> 00:04:52.558
Like, smart. You're clearly not
a conservative.

00:04:52.591 --> 00:04:54.560
Yeah. Yeah, my in-laws are
super pumped about it.

00:04:54.593 --> 00:04:56.629
Why podcast?

00:04:56.662 --> 00:04:58.698
-Uh. ...-Just 'cause you want,
like, pretentious people

00:04:58.731 --> 00:05:00.966
to listen to you,
is that what it is?

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:03.836
It would be nice. No.
No, look, uh, as I...

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:06.038
You know, around the country,
one of the most common questions

00:05:06.071 --> 00:05:07.707
that I get from people is,

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.710
"How do I talk to my aunt
who voted for Trump?"

00:05:10.743 --> 00:05:13.279
"How do I stay friends with
my friend from high school

00:05:13.312 --> 00:05:14.980
who I love,
who voted for Trump?"

00:05:15.013 --> 00:05:17.583
And look, I'm somebody,
who, in the election,

00:05:17.616 --> 00:05:19.485
even though we didn't win,
I won over a lot of people

00:05:19.518 --> 00:05:21.087
who also voted for Trump,
without,

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.155
you know,
changing my values at all.

00:05:23.188 --> 00:05:25.758
And I realized that if we can
tell the stories of people

00:05:25.791 --> 00:05:28.928
who are living divisive issues
every day of their life--

00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:30.463
stuff like college
affordability,

00:05:30.496 --> 00:05:32.098
stuff like, you know,
race and policing,

00:05:32.131 --> 00:05:33.566
that kind of thing--

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:35.835
then we would give people
a greater... a greater ability

00:05:35.868 --> 00:05:37.336
to communicate with folks
in a way

00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:38.604
that doesn't drive them apart,

00:05:38.637 --> 00:05:40.206
or cause them
to have to just agree

00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:42.141
when they don't really agree,
like, pretend they agree.

00:05:42.174 --> 00:05:44.143
Do you think there is
common ground to be had?

00:05:44.176 --> 00:05:45.478
There's all this conversation.

00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:47.146
"How do I talk to somebody
on the other side?"

00:05:47.179 --> 00:05:49.882
"I don't understand how
they voted for that one person."

00:05:49.915 --> 00:05:52.051
-Is there common ground
to be had there? -Yeah.

00:05:52.084 --> 00:05:53.686
And the key is
to tell your own story.

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:55.454
Like, I refer to this
as "showing your math."

00:05:55.487 --> 00:05:56.655
Because, like,
when I was in school,

00:05:56.688 --> 00:05:58.324
I wasn't very good at math,
and I realized

00:05:58.357 --> 00:06:01.494
that if I, like, showed my
journey on the way to my answer,

00:06:01.527 --> 00:06:02.828
that sometimes
the teacher would give me,

00:06:02.861 --> 00:06:04.230
like, a partial credit for it.

00:06:04.263 --> 00:06:05.698
So it's the same thing.

00:06:05.731 --> 00:06:07.800
If somebody... If you're saying
something to somebody,

00:06:07.833 --> 00:06:09.568
and they don't really agree
with your position,

00:06:09.601 --> 00:06:10.936
you got to tell 'em
how you got there.

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:12.505
You got to tell 'em
what it is in your life

00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:14.774
that brought to you that point,
and showing your math.

00:06:14.807 --> 00:06:16.876
And it causes people to kind of
let their barriers down,

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:18.978
and that's sort of
what we show on the podcast.

00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:21.480
So, it's a podcast where you
tell people to talk to people

00:06:21.513 --> 00:06:24.116
that they don't understand, and
in order to connect with them,

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:25.317
they have to show their math?

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:26.752
Yeah, yeah.
It's, like, super simple.

00:06:26.785 --> 00:06:29.188
You're gonna get a ton
of listeners, let me tell you.

00:06:29.221 --> 00:06:30.656
-(laughter)
-There's no math involved.

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:31.891
-That's the funny thing.
-No math?

00:06:31.924 --> 00:06:33.726
You don't have to do any math,
no, uh-uh.

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:35.428
Tell me something
I already know.

00:06:35.461 --> 00:06:37.663
54% of the country voted

00:06:37.696 --> 00:06:39.999
for somebody not named
Donald Trump in 2016.

00:06:40.032 --> 00:06:42.067
And the reason that's important
is because it means

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.436
that even
if he won the election,

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:44.637
he didn't win the argument

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.872
about who America is,
or where we're going.

00:06:46.905 --> 00:06:48.941
And there's a movement happening
in the country right now.

00:06:48.974 --> 00:06:51.377
And that 54% is growing
even more.

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.712
And the most effective movements
in the history of this country

00:06:53.745 --> 00:06:56.382
are the ones that start,
not in Washington and go out,

00:06:56.415 --> 00:06:58.017
but the the one
that start everywhere else

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.052
and go<i> to</i> Washington.
So, people should get involved,

00:07:00.085 --> 00:07:02.121
'cause it's an exciting movement
to be a part of,

00:07:02.154 --> 00:07:04.256
and I think it's gonna make
a big difference in November.

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:06.459
-Electoral college, man.
-(applause and cheering)

00:07:06.492 --> 00:07:07.860
Do the math.

00:07:07.893 --> 00:07:09.528
He's president
of Let America Vote,

00:07:09.561 --> 00:07:11.697
and hosts a podcast,
Majority 54.

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:13.263 line:92%
Jason Kander, everyone.
