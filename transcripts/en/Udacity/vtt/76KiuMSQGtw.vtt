00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's see. I said whatever this something is could be replaced with ω².

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Check it out. The something in this case--the something that multiples our x is k/m.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
If I know k and I know ω, I can get m, but I don't know ω. I know period.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Why don't I get ω from that period.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Well, in this case the period is 1 second so ω is just 2π.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Okay, well, now I know that ω², 2π² is equal to k/m--50/m.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Well, all I have to do now is solve this equation for m.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
When I do, I find that I need a mass of 1.27 kg.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Okay, this was a little tricky.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The take away I want you to remember is that any time you can write your force like this,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
acceleration equals negative something times x,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
you're going to get simple harmonic motion. That's really incredible.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Not only that--whatever this something is will be the square of your angular frequency.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Now, that's really cool, but unfortunately all this stuff we've learned about springs--

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
well, springs weren't how they made the first clocks or first chronometers.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
There was one day when our good friend Galileo while sitting in a church saw something

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
that blew his mind and would forever change navigation.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Le'ts talk to Tjeerd Bucker again to see what Galileo found.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
[Tjeerd Bucker, Museum Booerhaave] Well, it's a rumor or an anecdote--however you want to call it.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Galileo was sitting in this church, and see the chandelier swinging from left to right,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and he checked with his pulse to see if it kept an accurate rate.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Due to counting, he found out that there was an equal line in oscillation,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
an isochronism, in the pendulum in the swinging of the chandelier.

00:01:37.000 --> 99:59:59.000
That's how the pendulum started life, really.
