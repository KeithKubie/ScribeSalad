00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.650
&gt;&gt; 
All right. I'm here with Cosmo Nadal [ph]

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:13.250
from myERP.com. He made a really great, great
application, very feature rich. So Cosmo [ph],

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.659
I want you tell us a bit about what myERP.com
does.

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:22.189
&gt;&gt; NADAL: Okay. So myERP.com is a complete
accounting [INDISTINCT] solution for small

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.990
businesses and for the most thing it's free
and online, and of course, it's made with

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.990
Google technology and Java. Okay.
&gt;&gt; Perfect. All right. So I see here you have

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.510
a demo, so that--could you show us a bit about
how the application works?

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.620
&gt;&gt; NADAL: Okay, great. So let's say we have
a customer called AT&amp;T and I want to sell

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:51.870
this kind of personal services. So you can
see here, we have the [INDISTINCT] and we

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:59.120
can have here icons, and go to calls, emails,
meeting, task. Meetings are completely synchronized

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:07.420
with Google agenda so you can have here the
agendas that you have created in myERP.com.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.700
And then you can create here an opportunity
of an account. So let's say that we create

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.040
an opportunity of an icons. So, let’s say
that we create an opportunity on AT&amp;T and

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:30.540
we want to sell them, senior [INDISTINCT]
for ten days, that's it. So now, we're going

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:38.200
to convert these opportunities into quotes.
So we just have to put a quote here; we have

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:46.950
here NT&amp;T, customer, and we select here an
opportunity that is previously down. We take

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:55.380
that one for 10 days and for 1,000 letters
per day. So my quote is done. I can print

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:04.370
or send it by email. Then, I go to the sales
process and I would like to convert in one

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:17.180
click my quotes into like a sales order. It'll
go from here to here. Then, I would like to

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:25.959
convert my sale order into invoice. So I just
have to select my sale order and to convert

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:34.519
into invoice, so easy. And at the very end,
I will be able to receive payment from my

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:42.260
customer and say, "All right. I just have
to check that one and to convert this absolute

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:51.870
payment into payments." So, I receive here
$10,000. So then, I just have to go to the

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:58.079
bank and to make my deposits. What is great
is that in the accounting module, everything

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:03.769
is done. I mean that you don't have to make
any entry in your accounting, it's post. So,

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:10.340
if you want to see your accounting collections–so
everything is done here. So you don’t have

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.359
to need–use quick books anymore or sales
force, it's a complete web-based solution,

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:25.079
and you can also manage [INDISTINCT] and forecasting.
And we also have a package with manufacturing,logistic,

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:29.279
and special management. So it's free, yes,
it's possible and online.

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:31.650
&gt;&gt; Perfect.
&gt;&gt; NADAL: Thank you.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:39.219
&gt;&gt; So can you tell us a bit about how great
[INDISTINCT]

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.930
&gt;&gt; Do you want to?
&gt;&gt; Okay, go ahead.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.379
&gt;&gt; It was very [INDISTINCT] because we have
no idea how develop a web application using

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:54.459
HTML or JavaScript or CSS, so we are just
a Java developers so it was necessary to be

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:02.719
able to cross with Java. And so it was–if
there was not GWT, there was no myERP on the

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:05.599
web.
&gt;&gt; And also we already had an application–different

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:11.859
publication made in Java, so we didn't want
to move to another technology and so [INDISTINCT]

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:16.480
is a perfect product.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And so you guys are using great on

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.150
the front end and that's JavaConnect. How
about the service side, are you guys using

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.130
Java on the server side as well?
&gt;&gt; We only use Java on server side as well.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:36.800
We use Tomcat as the application server and
nothing else supporting these–about to make

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:43.880
migrating of application to App Engine. So,
it probably means that we use MySQL. We are

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:52.720
very close MySQL and we use ActiveMQ messaging
system. And App Engine doesn't offer us to

00:04:52.720 --> 00:05:02.000
use this technology in App Engines. So, we
have to stick with our hosting–hosting choice

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.290
that is Amazon EC2.
&gt;&gt; MALE: So you guys haven't considered--haven't

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:11.410
[INDISTINCT] that has been a limiting factor?
[INDISTINCT]

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:18.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the database and messaging system
of course we are using GMS with ITMQ, so App

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:24.700
Engine cannot–doesn’t offer us to use
this kind of technology. We have to use big

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:32.430
table as a store engine,
so we cannot.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.210
&gt;&gt; All right. So, one of the biggest–one
of the best features about the web toolkit

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.240
and what's the reason why we have been using
[INDISTINCT] in first place is because of

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.770
the customer browser. it let's you default
Java code while you’re running the browser

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.630
[INDISTINCT] It looks like doing a step-by-step
plugging your Java decoder tools. So, have

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:54.560
you guys used that [INDISTINCT]? How essential
was it to your development?

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:00.363
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we are using the [INDISTINCT] because
we can run that application really fast and

00:06:00.363 --> 00:06:07.930
we don't have to compress so it doesn't take
time. And when we make some updating for Java

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:16.670
code, we just have to refresh the [INDISTINCT]
to see updates and that's so we can debug

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:23.500
like Java application, standard Java application.
So, it's really interesting for us and it

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.350
was life.
&gt;&gt; You can't be very productive using the

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:37.220
[INDISTINCT] mode.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, because compiling take longer. Compiling

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.950
take a lot of time, so we are saving time
by compiling epecially when you are on the

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:46.230
verge, you don't have to compile everything,
you just have to refresh and to see [INDISTINCT]

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.560
directly.
&gt;&gt; Right, right. Finally, whatever you did

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.360
get stuck, the quick online community has
been pretty helpful and pretty active. You

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:58.530
guys want to see me there when [INDISTINCT].
So, how fast can you even view...

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:01.780
&gt;&gt; Coming here is great. It’s getting bigger
and bigger.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:09.970
&gt;&gt; And believe me I can [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; Guys from Google on the forum on the Google

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:15.990
group so we can get directly from the guy
that develop Google web toolkits, so it's

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:22.421
great. Also, we can contribute to the community
by helping each other, so it's very interesting.

00:07:22.421 --> 00:07:29.690
&gt;&gt; Oh, we both do some blog on things like
that, so we all have to improve our [INDISTINCT].

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.630
It’s really...
&gt;&gt; It's very much appreciated. It's very much

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:34.630
appreciated.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:36.690
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Especially for new technology.
