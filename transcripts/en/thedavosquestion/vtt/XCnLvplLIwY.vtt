Well I think that China has a great potential
to pull us out of the economic crisis. And

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:16.590
I've learned a great deal about Chinese sees
society in the last few days. In fact I believe

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:25.079
that it is civil society and all war going
on in the area of sultry innovation that has

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:33.000
a great potential. And that the rest of the
world will be able to learn from China. Besides

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.510
I believe that what China can teach the rest
of the world, which will contribute to pulling

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.760
us out of the crisis, is China's literature.
Especially the classical literature. Kung

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:54.249
Fatuus, and Juhism, and Buddhism. Which all
these philosophies are reflected in Chinese

00:00:54.249 --> 00:01:04.210
people's approach to life. Respect to others.
Respect to work. And the high values in which

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.940
Chinese people implement in their every day
lives. Thank you.
