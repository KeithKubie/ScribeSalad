00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:03.689
- [Voiceover] In the last
video we took a guess at what

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.759
the solution was for our
differential equation and we came

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:11.679
up with an exponential as
our guess and as we did the

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:16.341
analysis we developed a
characteristic equation.

00:00:16.341 --> 00:00:18.704
We ended up with a complex
answer for one of the

00:00:18.704 --> 00:00:22.871
adjustable parameters, the
natural frequency of our circuit.

00:00:25.964 --> 00:00:27.921
So here's the form of
our proposed solution,

00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:30.774
now this is getting kinda
complicated but I promise you

00:00:30.774 --> 00:00:33.371
we're gonna simplify this pretty soon.

00:00:33.371 --> 00:00:37.304
We have two solutions for s, s
one and s two that we plugged

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:40.422
in as plus and minus j omega naught,

00:00:40.422 --> 00:00:43.472
and we have more adjustable
amplitude parameters that we

00:00:43.472 --> 00:00:45.055
have to figure out.

00:00:50.447 --> 00:00:53.439
So now in this video we're
gonna continue on solving our

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:56.678
differential equation, this
is our proposed solution,

00:00:56.678 --> 00:00:59.424
this is a pretty complicated
looking expression and

00:00:59.424 --> 00:01:02.592
what we're gonna call on
here now is something really

00:01:02.592 --> 00:01:06.819
important in electronics and
in general and it's called

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:08.236
Euler's Identity.

00:01:15.243 --> 00:01:18.785
And we're gonna use this
identity to figure out what to do

00:01:18.785 --> 00:01:22.387
with these complex exponential terms.

00:01:22.387 --> 00:01:25.237
So if you search on this term
on Kahn Academy you'll find

00:01:25.237 --> 00:01:28.586
an explanation of where
these identities come from

00:01:28.586 --> 00:01:30.771
but I'm just gonna state 'em right here.

00:01:30.771 --> 00:01:34.105
And what it says is that
Euler's identitiy is

00:01:34.105 --> 00:01:38.272
e to the j x anything up
there equals cosign x plus j

00:01:46.028 --> 00:01:49.528
times sine x, that's one of the identities

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:56.166
and the other identity is
e to the minus j x equals

00:01:59.554 --> 00:02:02.054
cosign of x minus j sine x.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:11.337
So these are useful because
we have this exponential

00:02:11.337 --> 00:02:15.004
function with the complex
unit inside of it,

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.080
when we go over to this side,

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.408
this is sort of a normal complex number,

00:02:20.408 --> 00:02:23.360
cosign x is some number
between plus and minus one,

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.780
sine x is some number
between plus and minus one,

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.963
and it's just a normal complex number

00:02:28.963 --> 00:02:32.494
so this may help us
simplify our life here as we

00:02:32.494 --> 00:02:34.128
move forward.

00:02:34.128 --> 00:02:37.765
So that's a really important
identity that we get to use

00:02:37.765 --> 00:02:39.765
to solve our LC circuit.

00:02:43.221 --> 00:02:45.473
Now I'm gonna go back and
rewrite these two exponential's

00:02:45.473 --> 00:02:47.806
using Euler's Identity here.

00:02:48.872 --> 00:02:52.475
This is gonna get big but it'll
collapse down pretty soon.

00:02:52.475 --> 00:02:56.642
Okay, let me move over here,
i equals k one times e to the

00:02:58.586 --> 00:03:02.813
plus j omega t let's use this
one here so that would be

00:03:02.813 --> 00:03:06.980
cosign x is omega naught t
plus j sine x is omega naught t

00:03:22.837 --> 00:03:24.920
and we use the first one.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.057
Okay, now the second term is
plus k two times now we have

00:03:32.867 --> 00:03:37.587
the negative up in the
exponent so we use this one

00:03:37.587 --> 00:03:41.754
cosign omega naught t minus
j sine omega naught t.

00:03:50.525 --> 00:03:52.927
Now we have our solution spread
all out across the screen

00:03:52.927 --> 00:03:56.199
and let's see if we can
tidy things up here.

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:58.951
So what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna gather all the cosign

00:03:58.951 --> 00:04:02.173
terms together, this one and this one

00:04:02.173 --> 00:04:05.972
and then I'll gather
the sine terms together.

00:04:05.972 --> 00:04:10.139
Okay so i equals cosign omega
naught t, and the cosign is

00:04:16.167 --> 00:04:19.750
multiplied by k one
and plus k two alright.

00:04:29.945 --> 00:04:31.695
Now let's add to that

00:04:36.483 --> 00:04:40.650
we have j sine and j sine so
I'll write sine omega naught t

00:04:43.664 --> 00:04:47.831
over here and j times what,
j times k one and this time

00:04:53.685 --> 00:04:57.852
we have this minus sign
that makes it minus k two,

00:05:00.292 --> 00:05:04.459
alright so now, current is
some number times cosign plus

00:05:07.427 --> 00:05:10.249
j times some number times sine.

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:12.633
Now these are two arbitrary
constants and I'm just gonna

00:05:12.633 --> 00:05:16.716
make up another one, I'm
just call this one a one

00:05:21.452 --> 00:05:25.285
we'll call this one a
two and we'll call that,

00:05:26.873 --> 00:05:29.706
I'll use the j, k one minus k two,

00:05:34.097 --> 00:05:35.930
now I can rewrite this

00:05:38.533 --> 00:05:41.450
as i equals a one cos mega naught t

00:05:50.017 --> 00:05:53.100
plus a two sine omega naught t, good.

00:06:00.377 --> 00:06:02.507
So from now on we're
gonna work with these a's

00:06:02.507 --> 00:06:04.854
and if I ever want to know
what the original k's were

00:06:04.854 --> 00:06:07.591
I would just come back
to these equations here,

00:06:07.591 --> 00:06:11.758
once I figure out a, I can
figure out both the k's.

00:06:12.619 --> 00:06:14.786
So let's keep pressing on,

00:06:15.633 --> 00:06:17.996
how do we figure out a one and a two?

00:06:17.996 --> 00:06:20.522
Well to do that we're gonna
use the initial conditions,

00:06:20.522 --> 00:06:21.355
the ic's.

00:06:24.364 --> 00:06:28.531
And if we think back we
remember that in our original

00:06:29.467 --> 00:06:34.382
schematic we had some q
here which means we had a

00:06:34.382 --> 00:06:38.549
plus or minus v zero, v
naught, and we said the current

00:06:42.673 --> 00:06:45.090
through here started at zero.

00:06:46.207 --> 00:06:48.787
So that's our initial conditions,

00:06:48.787 --> 00:06:51.870
v of time equals zero equals v naught

00:06:53.502 --> 00:06:57.169
and current of time
equals zero equals zero.

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.736
Let's use these two values
to help us figure out what

00:07:02.736 --> 00:07:04.403
a one and a two are.

00:07:05.575 --> 00:07:08.041
And we'll do that in the
next video as we continue the

00:07:08.041 --> 00:07:10.470
derivation of the natural response.
