00:00:00.587 --> 00:00:03.860
- [Voiceover] "The following
equation shows Kepler's 3rd Law

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.987
"of planetary motion.

00:00:05.987 --> 00:00:10.107
"It relates the time, t (in days),

00:00:10.107 --> 00:00:13.416
"that a planet takes to
revolve once around our sun

00:00:13.416 --> 00:00:16.318
"to the distance, d (in kilometers),

00:00:16.318 --> 00:00:18.084
"of that planet from the sun."

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:22.240
So, it tells us, t, how many
days, and it's in relation

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.841
to the distance that that
planet, in kilometers,

00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:26.304
is from the sun.

00:00:26.304 --> 00:00:29.624
"Mars is approximately 4 times as distant

00:00:29.624 --> 00:00:32.038
"from the sun as Mercury is.

00:00:32.498 --> 00:00:34.221
"About how many times longer would

00:00:34.221 --> 00:00:37.751
"Mars's revolution time
be than for Mercury?

00:00:37.751 --> 00:00:41.442
"Round your answer to the
nearest whole number."

00:00:41.922 --> 00:00:43.508
So, let's think about it a little bit.

00:00:43.508 --> 00:00:47.712
If you increased d by a factor of four,

00:00:48.432 --> 00:00:51.288
if you increased d by a factor of four,

00:00:51.688 --> 00:00:53.748
what's going to happen to t?

00:00:54.478 --> 00:00:57.060
Well, if you increase
d by a factor of four,

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.879
you're going to notice you
take d to the third power.

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.246
So if you replace d with 4d,

00:01:02.696 --> 00:01:04.150
so if you replace it with 4d,

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.216
you're going to get t squared is equal

00:01:07.216 --> 00:01:10.056
to 3.98,

00:01:10.056 --> 00:01:13.097
times 10 to the negative 20,

00:01:13.697 --> 00:01:17.276
times 4d to the third power.

00:01:17.276 --> 00:01:19.273
Well, 4d to the third power,

00:01:19.273 --> 00:01:21.038
four is going to be the same thing,

00:01:21.038 --> 00:01:24.288
I could rewrite that as four to the third,

00:01:24.288 --> 00:01:25.705
times d to the third.

00:01:25.705 --> 00:01:29.838
Four to the third power, that's
16 times four, that's 64.

00:01:30.258 --> 00:01:32.810
So, it's going to be the same thing as 64,

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.317
times d to the third power.

00:01:35.317 --> 00:01:38.939
Or I could just write this
as d to the third power,

00:01:39.489 --> 00:01:42.515
and then all of that times 64.

00:01:43.425 --> 00:01:45.835
Now, we have to be careful here.

00:01:45.835 --> 00:01:48.041
We might say, "Hey, look, this expression

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:50.967
on the right side is 64 times

00:01:50.967 --> 00:01:52.615
this expression right over here."

00:01:52.615 --> 00:01:54.682
When we increased d by a factor of four,

00:01:55.352 --> 00:01:58.142
the right side becomes 64 times as big,

00:01:58.142 --> 00:01:59.987
because, remember, four
to the third power.

00:02:00.737 --> 00:02:05.084
If this becomes 4d, this
becomes 64, d to the third,

00:02:05.084 --> 00:02:08.520
which we saw right over there.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.050
But on the left hand side,
you have a t squared.

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.418
You have a t squared.

00:02:14.418 --> 00:02:18.133
So, over here, you would
get that t is equal

00:02:18.133 --> 00:02:19.921
to the principal root

00:02:19.921 --> 00:02:23.915
of all of this business right
over here, the 3.98 times ten

00:02:23.915 --> 00:02:26.213
to the negative 20, times d to the third.

00:02:26.213 --> 00:02:28.419
Here, you're going to get
t is going to be equal

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:32.065
to the principal root

00:02:32.065 --> 00:02:37.065
of 3.98 times 10 to the negative 20,

00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:40.377
times d to the third, times,
you could throw the 64

00:02:40.377 --> 00:02:41.676
under the radical, or you could say,

00:02:41.676 --> 00:02:43.837
times the principal root of 64.

00:02:44.227 --> 00:02:46.436
Well, the principal root of 64 is eight.

00:02:47.216 --> 00:02:49.154
So, times eight.

00:02:49.154 --> 00:02:50.663
So, when you look at it this way,

00:02:50.663 --> 00:02:52.915
you increase d by a factor of four,

00:02:52.915 --> 00:02:55.887
you're going to increase
t by a factor of eight.

00:02:55.887 --> 00:02:58.714
This expression is the same
thing as this expression,

00:02:58.714 --> 00:03:03.684
but we have a times eight here now.

00:03:04.234 --> 00:03:06.081
So about how many times
longer would Mars's

00:03:06.081 --> 00:03:08.448
revolution time be than for Mercury?

00:03:09.078 --> 00:03:11.026
Well, eight times longer.
