when I was a kid growing on the

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550
when I was a kid growing on the
 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.720
when I was a kid growing on the
Mediterranean coast of Spain I dreamed

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730
Mediterranean coast of Spain I dreamed
 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.430
Mediterranean coast of Spain I dreamed
of being an ocean Explorer diver and I

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440
of being an ocean Explorer diver and I
 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.220
of being an ocean Explorer diver and I
started studying marine biology and I

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230
started studying marine biology and I
 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.589
started studying marine biology and I
realized that what I was seeing

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599
realized that what I was seeing
 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.900
realized that what I was seeing
underwater was not the same thing that I

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910
underwater was not the same thing that I
 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.200
underwater was not the same thing that I
saw on Gustav's movies and I thought

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210
saw on Gustav's movies and I thought
 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.790
saw on Gustav's movies and I thought
that the Mediterranean was just a poor

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800
that the Mediterranean was just a poor
 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.750
that the Mediterranean was just a poor
see but then one day I jumped in a

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760
see but then one day I jumped in a
 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.939
see but then one day I jumped in a
marine reserve that had been protected

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949
marine reserve that had been protected
 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.170
marine reserve that had been protected
for 10 years and I realized on that very

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180
for 10 years and I realized on that very
 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:47.200
for 10 years and I realized on that very
moment everything that we lost

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210
 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.380
after 10 years doing research in

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390
after 10 years doing research in
 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.810
after 10 years doing research in
degraded environments I decided that I

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820
degraded environments I decided that I
 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.630
degraded environments I decided that I
didn't want to get depressed anymore so

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640
didn't want to get depressed anymore so
 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.250
didn't want to get depressed anymore so
with National Geographic we conducted

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260
with National Geographic we conducted
 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.270
with National Geographic we conducted
two expeditions in 2005 in 2007 to the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280
two expeditions in 2005 in 2007 to the
 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.180
two expeditions in 2005 in 2007 to the
Northern Line Islands and there we

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190
Northern Line Islands and there we
 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.430
Northern Line Islands and there we
visited the city of islands from

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440
visited the city of islands from
 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.920
visited the city of islands from
inhabited to uninhabited and pristine

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930
inhabited to uninhabited and pristine
 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.880
inhabited to uninhabited and pristine
and that trip was like going back in

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890
and that trip was like going back in
 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.469
and that trip was like going back in
time we were able to see what the ocean

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479
time we were able to see what the ocean
 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.840
time we were able to see what the ocean
was like 50 years ago hundred years ago

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850
was like 50 years ago hundred years ago
 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.320
was like 50 years ago hundred years ago
500 years ago that was the best way to

500 years ago that was the best way to
 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.290
500 years ago that was the best way to
understand our integrated impact on
