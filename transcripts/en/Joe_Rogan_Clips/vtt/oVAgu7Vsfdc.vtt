00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.470
The Joe Rogan experience and he works at,
so we run a math today,

2
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.140
so to run running and muck out really early,
early,
early run in the morning,

3
00:00:07.141 --> 00:00:10.430
run at lunch.
Running at dawn is beautiful.
It's an African.

4
00:00:10.431 --> 00:00:13.140
If you can mention the African dawn's I got coming up.

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.440
Were you worried about something running up and grabbing you well on that thing?

6
00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:19.890
I wasn't,
I mean they,
they told me I supposed to have security.
I wasn't,

7
00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:24.030
I was kind of cool that people,
we weren't about people.
You were around any,

8
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.960
I was la animals.
I was in a uh,

9
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.560
the mountain Zebra National Park and you know,

10
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.090
if you've ever been in the list of priorities they say,

11
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.680
so they tell you to sit in this shuttle shower bank,
big open top vehicle,

12
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.020
which got metal bars over it and they say the animals,

13
00:00:40.021 --> 00:00:42.810
they know that the shape of that they knows metal and metal doesn't taste very

14
00:00:42.811 --> 00:00:45.600
good.
So you'll be fine and there's a guy with a gun and you feel good.

15
00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:48.180
But when I went there,
of course they said,
well,

16
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:51.690
you're running outside near the vehicle.
And I thought,

17
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.990
is this right?
This pretty be good television.
But
he said,
okay,

18
00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:00.840
I'll just stay close to there's something's coming.
And they did.
I said,

19
00:01:00.841 --> 00:01:04.980
what about how the lions during the lions have eaten yesterday?
They're fine.

20
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.140
And they told me,
you know,
and that's what lines they come.

21
00:01:07.141 --> 00:01:11.370
They never go for snacks.
Lions are kind of organized like that.
We ate yesterday,

22
00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:14.390
we ripped apart some animal and we don't need to go and have a bag of crystal.

23
00:01:14.391 --> 00:01:15.060
They knew.

24
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.790
They knew that the line knew whether they knew where they were and that they

25
00:01:17.791 --> 00:01:18.540
were okay,

26
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.900
but they said the buffalo are around and they can stamp you to death about.

27
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.240
I didn't their buffalo,
so black death,
they called them,
rarely call them,

28
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.210
blocked out the,
they're responsible for so much.

29
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.900
They're not as responsible as hippos.
Hippos are number one,

30
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.410
but they fuck a lot of people up,
man.
They don't take any shit.

31
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.040
Have you think about bowls like people when people try to ride bulls?
Yeah,

32
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.540
like domestic cow bulls.
They're ruthlessly aggressive animals.
Yeah.

33
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.690
I mean they'll fucking throw you through the air.
Now.

34
00:01:45.691 --> 00:01:50.691
Think of them but wild and in Africa and fighting off lions and that's,

35
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.310
that's African buffaloes.

36
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.610
I mean they are for Roche's animals and that just,

37
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.600
I didn't know what I had to do.
I knew that with um,
hippos,

38
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.290
if you come in between their water source,
then they'll just kill you.

39
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:07.020
They'll fuck you up.
Um,
I didn't know what I have to do to buffalo's weather.

40
00:02:07.021 --> 00:02:10.370
I had to write it.
Can't go anywhere near that,
into that Grand Mal.
Yeah.

41
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.260
If they find you to be a threat at all,
they're just so powerful.

42
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.830
They just launch you in there.

43
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.430
There's a great video that I was watching this morning of a lion.

44
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.350
It was trying to take out a small buffalo and the other one got behind the line

45
00:02:22.351 --> 00:02:26.970
and launched it through the air.
It was literally flying like 40 feet in the air,

46
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.650
like flipping head over heels.
Cause this,

47
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.780
the strength of this thing to take a giant cat and just with its head,

48
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.510
she's woo and just flies.

49
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.630
That wasn't the one with the crocodile in it as well?
No,
no.

50
00:02:39.631 --> 00:02:43.200
This was one that was on the side of a dirt road.
All right.

51
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.220
Have you heard about the curfew?
Busy go to busy wild on Instagram.

52
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.120
I think that's the,
uh,
have you heard about the Kroger gas?
I saw that,
yeah.

53
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.490
That's interesting,
isn't it?
Cause that I feel that buffalo,

54
00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:57.300
there are acting like the local townspeople and that the,

55
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.320
I think the lines of the SS and the crocodile is another,

56
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.100
yeah.
This is it.
This is the video.
So it looks like the lions attacking this one.

57
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:09.790
Look at that.
Boom.
Oh,
it's actually not nearly as high as I thought it was.

58
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.540
Maybe I'm thinking of another one.
Yeah,
that one's pretty good though.
I mean,

59
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.690
just to see it do that.
Oh,
you know what I'm thinking of?

60
00:03:17.691 --> 00:03:20.480
I'm thinking of relentless enemies.
That's what I'm thinking of.
There's a,

61
00:03:20.481 --> 00:03:22.980
there's actually a,
um,
uh,

62
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.990
a documentary about this one particular strain of lion that there was a,

63
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.310
apparently the river split sides or the river changed its path and it turned

64
00:03:35.031 --> 00:03:40.031
this area into an island and the lions had to adapt because the only thing that

65
00:03:40.311 --> 00:03:44.470
they could eat was buffalo,
which is very difficult to kill.
You know,

66
00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:44.991
they usually,

67
00:03:44.991 --> 00:03:48.320
they're eating antelope and other smaller things that aren't nearly as
dangerous.

68
00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.830
Right.
So these lions developed became far larger,

69
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.160
so the female lions are as large as a normal male lion and there hulking like

70
00:03:58.311 --> 00:04:01.460
massive muscles and they're just enormous.

71
00:04:01.461 --> 00:04:05.690
It's just enormous strain of lion that's exclusively eating buffalo.

72
00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.260
And there's a whole documentary.
It's a national geographic documentary.

73
00:04:09.261 --> 00:04:10.970
I think it's really good,

74
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.910
but it's just incredible to see these things walking around and they look

75
00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.530
cartoonish to like the hulk.

76
00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.210
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

77
00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:20.510
<v 0>So it's hard to tell.
You'd have to compare them to a regular line,</v>

78
00:04:20.511 --> 00:04:22.880
but there's some images of these things walking around.

79
00:04:22.881 --> 00:04:27.650
They just look so much larger than a regular lion because they just had to
adapt.

80
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.110
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

81
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.980
<v 0>And I would think that if you're running around,
like if you're running,</v>

82
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.990
you've got to think like you're,

83
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.550
you look like something that's trying to get away.

84
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.180
What made running in that park?
Yeah,
no,
I was right next to the green vehicles.

85
00:04:41.181 --> 00:04:44.470
So the big metal green vertical was there and they just said stay close.

86
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.230
So I was one door flip away from,

87
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.110
I just launched myself into the is open top.

88
00:04:50.111 --> 00:04:53.710
So I would've been in that vehicle before they go out to me,
I hope.

89
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.300
Did you hear about the woman from,

90
00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.310
she was an editor on the game of Thrones and she was in one of those parks and

91
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:02.410
she had a window rolled down and she,

92
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.560
they told her keep your windows rolled up at all times and she was trying to

93
00:05:05.561 --> 00:05:09.550
take better photographs and the cat reached in and grabbed her and pulled her

94
00:05:09.551 --> 00:05:11.380
out of the vehicle and killed her.

95
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.780
This is the last year or they're,
they're,
they're a dangerous creature.

96
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.450
Yeah.
And you're just out there running with them.
Yeah.
Well I they,
um,

97
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.940
yeah,
this is,
oh,
is that a picture of it?
Yeah.
Oh God,

98
00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:29.620
they have a picture of it happening is in 2015.
Oh,
wasn't really that long ago.

99
00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:34.120
That just looked it up yet recently knows my facts.

100
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.250
Terrible was flying,
bro.
Look at that though.

101
00:05:36.251 --> 00:05:40.060
That is just so awful that they actually caught it on camera.
Well,

102
00:05:40.061 --> 00:05:43.870
she just thought it was,
you know,
she was safe.
She was in the car.

103
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.050
I reached in and grabbed her and pulled her out.
Yeah.
I,
uh,

104
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.030
you're out there running around.

105
00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.670
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
