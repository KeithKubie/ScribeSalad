1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,020
Let's just do it. You're going to do
it. Okay. It's just freaking do it. Hey,

2
00:00:04,021 --> 00:00:08,100
I'm Jad Abumrad I'm Robert
Krulwich, Radiolab, the pod guests.

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,330
[inaudible] today's topic is, um, well,
you know what, something you just did.

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,560
I didn't, I had my eyes closed the
whole time. Aw, you gave it away.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,680
You know what I'm about to say? Pretend
you don't know what I'm saying. Okay.

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,860
Today's topic is, um, something
you just did actually what?

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:30,660
Yeah, that you did. You did it again
there in there. I don't know what it is.

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,190
There's something with my fingernails.
No, no. In there something. What?

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,630
Tell me. Okay. You blinked. Oh,
it's about, do you ever wonder, um,

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,160
I know this about blinks. This is
interesting, right? When you blink,

11
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,090
you should,

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,900
if you really understand what's going
on since a little bit of darkness,

13
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,210
cause after all your eyes are
closed for an instant of time,

14
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,250
but you don't because your mind
erases the darkness of the blink.

15
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,970
So you can blink away, but the world
will seem seamless and blink less to you.

16
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:02,940
Even though your observers
will see you blinking,

17
00:01:02,941 --> 00:01:05,070
you will not feel the blink inside.

18
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:09,210
Do you ever wonder what is the actual
purpose of the blink to wet in your

19
00:01:09,211 --> 00:01:12,150
eyeball? I assume? Well, that's
what they tell you in ninth grade,

20
00:01:12,151 --> 00:01:14,670
but actually you would
think of that is the case.

21
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,570
They don't really humid days or let's
say in the sauna you would blink less

22
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,230
because it's very human and now
you don't have the right thing.

23
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,910
But very dry days, I would
blink more. Yeah, they've,

24
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,030
they've actually done studies where
they put people in Saunas and they've at

25
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,700
measured the rate of their blinks
in there. It doesn't change. Oh,

26
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,070
so there's something else
[inaudible] reason for the blend.

27
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,960
And so that's what we want to explore
in this podcast. Why you do we blink?

28
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,000
Actually, the answers are
completely fascinating.

29
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,650
Who are you going to ask this question to?

30
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:47,400
A great scientist that blink cologists
you will meet a blink ologists shortly.

31
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:52,140
But first I want to take you
to a guy who who uh, well he,

32
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,820
he's a blink. Colleges
have a different story.

33
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,080
Let's say he doesn't really
study blinks per se, but he,

34
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,430
when we sort of stumbled into it.

35
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,480
My name is Walter Murch.

36
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,330
I'm a film editor and I've been working
as a both as a film editor and as a

37
00:02:05,331 --> 00:02:07,910
sound mixers since the late 1960s

38
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,420
Walter Merchant's edited some
amazing films, apocalypse now,

39
00:02:11,421 --> 00:02:13,970
the godfather cold mountain.

40
00:02:13,971 --> 00:02:17,300
He's really one of the great editors
in modern cinema. Oh, well thank you.

41
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:17,811
Thank you.

42
00:02:17,811 --> 00:02:21,620
And he's also a great thinker about
editing and he tells the following story

43
00:02:21,621 --> 00:02:25,070
about a discovery that he made while
working on one of his early films.

44
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,900
Well, this was many years ago. Uh,

45
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,950
when I was editing Francis
Coppola was the conversation

46
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:36,690
[inaudible],

47
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,370
which by the way is another great,

48
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:42,540
great movie was I think
1972 1973 and in the movie,

49
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:45,420
Gene Hackman plays a surveillance expert.

50
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,950
He spends the whole movie essentially
trying to decode this one conversation

51
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,200
that he's recorded. So
Walter marches there,

52
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:55,950
he's in the editing suite trying
to put it all together. He was

53
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,100
working late at night, all myself
on this old editing machine,

54
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,620
making a tape go and go
backwards. And forwards.

55
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:11,790
Oh look, that's terrible.
Cut Dead on a park bench.

56
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:17,860
And I was editing a scene when gene
Hackman is a get him for Christmas.

57
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,860
Yeah, he's already got the tapes. Okay.

58
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,710
What he's listening to in his laboratory,

59
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,170
what's a bit of a Meta moment actually,

60
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,940
because on screen gene Hackman
is editing tape and in his room,

61
00:03:32,941 --> 00:03:37,080
Walter merge his editing tape
of Gene Hackman editing tape.

62
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,490
A lot of fun. You know,
every scene in a movie,

63
00:03:41,491 --> 00:03:46,491
even simple scenes require tons of cuts
because as a viewer you're constantly

64
00:03:46,891 --> 00:03:50,400
being bounced around from one camera
angle to the next, into the next.

65
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,550
And though it seems like what you're
watching is a continuous performance from

66
00:03:53,551 --> 00:03:53,970
the actor.

67
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,930
It's actually been cobbled together
by the editor from dozens of takes.

68
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,540
So Walter Merchant's doing
this, he's editing this scene,

69
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:05,541
cut by laborious cut and it's important
to understand he's making every cut by

70
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,110
feel. What I will do is
run the film at full,

71
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,070
his mother mother's from try
to feel the rhythm, you know,

72
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:19,030
almost musical way and
right when he's ready,

73
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:23,840
who you there? Hit the cut
button and then rewind.

74
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,920
Run the film again and cut.

75
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:33,560
And if I've hit that cut button
on the same frame twice in a row,

76
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,980
that tells me that I'm
probably where I should be.

77
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:41,180
So he is editing this scene
together, takes many days. He says,

78
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:46,540
and somewhere along the way he
begins to get this creeping sense,

79
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,020
you know, when you're in a room and
maybe there's a leak outside and you,

80
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,630
there's a little drip,
drip, drip going on.

81
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,890
I began to get the sense that,

82
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,573
uh,

83
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,030
that there were some

84
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,280
collaboration going on between
myself and in this case gene Hackman

85
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,700
cause he would find, he says that
every time he made it, yeah. Cut.

86
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,310
He would see that on the screen. Gene
Hackman would have blinked [inaudible]

87
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,580
you mean your cuts kept falling
smack in the middle of his blinks?

88
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,630
Oh yeah. Wow. When I saw
it, well this is peculiar.

89
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,980
Am I responding to him blinking? Oh,

90
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,080
it didn't seem like that it was
possible and yet the alignment was um,

91
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:34,603
consistent

92
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:38,240
[inaudible]

93
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,160
so Walter merged,

94
00:05:39,161 --> 00:05:42,500
developed a theory that maybe blinking
has very little to do with [inaudible]

95
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,510
moisture or any of that.

96
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:48,690
Maybe it's a kind of hidden
punctuation to thought

97
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,161
we're storytelling.

98
00:05:51,161 --> 00:05:55,750
Thank you so much for agreeing to do
this and this is a very cool idea,

99
00:05:55,751 --> 00:05:58,040
but it's just an idea
and we wanted to know

100
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,010
if there's anything to this
scientifically. Can you,

101
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,550
can you do me a favor and introduce
yourselves? Yes, yes. Tell them me first,

102
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,860
but then we found out about
these two Japanese researchers

103
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,420
who were nice enough to Skype with
us. My name is Tami Nakano and

104
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,240
[inaudible] in the cognitive neuroscience.

105
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:21,950
My name is [inaudible] and
she was a student of mine.

106
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,370
Okay. Tell me how mommy's going to talk

107
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,040
and bring is [inaudible]. Very common,

108
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,780
very common phenomenon,

109
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:36,500
but the purpose of rank is military.

110
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,640
Now the reason we had called to mommy
and sugar was because they had just

111
00:06:40,641 --> 00:06:44,570
completed an experiment which they hoped
would solve this mystery of blinking

112
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:48,770
and what they did was they got a bunch
of subjects together and they hooked each

113
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,630
person up to a kind of Gizmo.

114
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:55,450
We put two electrodes, one
above and one below the eye.

115
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,980
And when we blink,

116
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:02,040
we can recall very strong electrical
signal and we can later analyze

117
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,780
automatically when the subject blinked.

118
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,930
This is actually what it sounds like
when a person blanks and once they had

119
00:07:14,931 --> 00:07:15,800
everybody hooked up,

120
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,780
they played them a movie.

121
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,880
Each puzzle I present the
movie full street time.

122
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,540
Which movie

123
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,910
did you use by the way? Uh,
Ms Debbie. British quantity.

124
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,990
Okay. Mr. Bean, if you don't
know the movie, I didn't.

125
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:39,000
It's kind of like a farce. So that
means that bean is the Mr. Bean because,

126
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:44,370
uh, the story is easily
understand without sound.

127
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,030
The reason she took out
the sand was for, well,

128
00:07:48,031 --> 00:07:50,160
it's actually not that interesting
why she took out the sound.

129
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,210
What they did was they watched people
watching movies, recorded their blanks.

130
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,080
Each time they watched and what
they found was really weird.

131
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,860
First thing they noticed
within each person, uh,

132
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:09,960
Dave's blink at the same
time point in the movie,

133
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:14,640
meaning people when they watch the movie
many times tend to always blink in the

134
00:08:14,641 --> 00:08:15,570
same spots,

135
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:21,020
but weirder than that. Also
the timing of breach occurred.

136
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,120
At the same time between people,

137
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:28,150
they found a large percentage of
their subjects actually fell in sync.

138
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:33,170
They began to blink at the exact
same moment in the movie. Oh,

139
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:36,830
often did synchronization
occurred between people.

140
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:43,750
Uh, so, uh, according
to [inaudible] analysis,

141
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,920
one third of

142
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:48,480
blinks contributed to synchronization.

143
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,730
Just to appreciate that. I mean,

144
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:54,900
imagine you're sitting in a movie
theater with 200 other people,

145
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,630
dark, the movie starts,

146
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:02,490
action gets on the way and you're just
there watching and with each unconscious

147
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:07,320
blink that you make 70 people
make that blink right with you.

148
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:13,340
Like all these little butterfly wings
fluttering at the same time. Oh yeah.

149
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,340
Yeah. Wow.

150
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:21,950
And so they, uh, this was the question
was why, why does this happen? And uh,

151
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,610
yeah, they analyze their data
with that question in mind.

152
00:09:25,611 --> 00:09:29,750
What they found is that what seems
to be happening is that people,

153
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,450
as they watched the movie,
get in sync with the story.

154
00:09:32,451 --> 00:09:36,920
They intuit the narrative flow sort of
peaks in the valleys of the tail and

155
00:09:36,921 --> 00:09:41,330
they're able to align their blinks
so that they fall right in the gaps.

156
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:46,220
Those little micro beets where
nothing happens. Yes. We found that,

157
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,170
uh, uh,

158
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:53,790
rink synchronizes occurred at the
conclusion of a action by the OCTA.

159
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,600
We start by Mr [inaudible].
She gave a bunch of examples.

160
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,920
One example is the empty street.
There's a moment in the film,

161
00:10:00,921 --> 00:10:05,270
she says where all you see is this empty
street for just a few frames just to

162
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,050
beat.

163
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:11,050
And that moment everybody blinks these
streets or you know when Mr. Bean walks

164
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:14,960
into a room, closes the door,
right as the door finishes closing,

165
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,853
everybody blinks.

166
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,720
So these sound like rest stops.

167
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:20,780
If they were the New Jersey turnpike
is be where you'd go in and get your

168
00:10:20,781 --> 00:10:23,540
coffee. Exactly. Say if it's
an eyeball, you just blinked.

169
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,880
One reason is that, uh,

170
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:30,690
we don't want to miss
very important point in,

171
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:35,710
in the story [inaudible] hypotheses is
that you see blinking is related to the

172
00:10:37,061 --> 00:10:39,820
punctuation. Our ways of thinking.

173
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:45,300
Maybe there is some kind
of synchronization of the
thinking of the editor or

174
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:51,160
film maker, uh, that might, uh, you see,

175
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:55,030
make us blink at the same time.
Huh. But still, there's a white

176
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,180
question here like,

177
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:01,390
cause why would we even need to do that
in a blink and no one knows really.

178
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,800
But it may be that we blink at all because
we can only process life in chunks.

179
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:16,430
Might Be Chow, make a
tanking of the uh, role of,

180
00:11:16,431 --> 00:11:21,431
of information now for effective
processing information processing or a

181
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,420
effective memorizing

182
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,720
in computer terms. It's like
that moment when we saved a dish

183
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:31,350
was enough information in
our buffer so to speak.

184
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,550
And now we think I've got to remember
this and that's at that moment that we

185
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,110
blink. Huh? That's what Walter
Mertz. Thanks. But who knows? Oh,

186
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,790
it's popping a new tape
every time you blink. Yeah,

187
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:46,860
because I noticed that culturally,
um, when you feel that you are done,

188
00:11:46,861 --> 00:11:49,080
you know enough changes over time.

189
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:53,800
Like my daughter will watch a Cary grant
movie and the character played by Cary

190
00:11:53,801 --> 00:11:57,220
grant will be in bed,
throw off the covers,

191
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:01,930
put his feet on the floor, get up and
then walk to the door. The whole thing.

192
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,600
She thinking like, come on, come on guy.

193
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:07,890
Just she wants it to calm and go
chunk and go. And so I don't know.

194
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,380
She's blinking madly Susie, but she's
clearly frustrated because she knows her.

195
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,130
Yeah.

196
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:17,040
I'm not sure that the chunking
isn't an artifact of where,

197
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:20,770
how you see when you're alive, like when
you're alive. Yeah. I wonder if the,

198
00:12:20,771 --> 00:12:24,820
if the blink rates have changed over
over generations, I'm sure they have

199
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,920
two years of darkness, which you are,
which thanks to your lovely brain.

200
00:13:17,921 --> 00:13:22,190
You're totally unaware of missing.
Thank you Brad. Thank you, ray.

201
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,160
I am, I'm getting up.

202
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,240
I'm rod and I remember call it Radiolab
is supported in part by the Sloan

203
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,680
Foundation, the corporation for
public broadcasting and one other.

204
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:36,830
We have one other, the biggest one in the
mall, the National Science Foundation.

205
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,100
Yes. Before we close,

206
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:43,240
I just want to thank Tim Howard for
