00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:01.890
Hello.

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.120
In this series of presentations
I'm going to try to teach you

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.020
everything you need to know
about triangles and angles

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.120
and parallel lines.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.820
And this is probably the
highest yield information that

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.460
you could ever learn, and
especially in terms of

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.720
standardized tests.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.980
And then when we've learned all
the rules we'll play something

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.920
that I call the angle game,
which is essentially what the

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.500
SAT makes you do over
and over again.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.780
So let's start
with some basics.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.120
Well, you know
what an angle is.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.550
Well actually, maybe you
don't know what an angle is.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.040
And I'll tell you
what an angle is.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.400
If I have two lines-- I'm
going to draw a thicker

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.530
line than that.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:47.130
If I have two lines and they
intersect at some point, the

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.360
angle is a measure of exactly
kind of how wide the

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.600
intersection is between
those two lines.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.470
Let me use a better tool.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.940
So this is the angle.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.470
An angle is how wide those
two lines kind of open up.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.020
And they're measured either in
degrees or radians, and for the

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.890
sake of most of a geometry
class we'll use degrees.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.620
And when we start doing
trigonometry you'll

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.230
learn radians.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.525
Or maybe you could
learn it now.

00:01:14.525 --> 00:01:17.670
And you're probably
familiar with this.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.350
0 degrees would be these two
lines on top of each other.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.620
This, if I were to just eyeball
it, looks like 45 degrees.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:34.920
If I had the lines even
wider apart like that,

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.720
that's 90 degrees.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.180
And 90 degree lines are also
called perpendicular, because

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.370
they are-- I feel like saying,
because they are

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.080
perpendicular-- but because one
is going completely vertical

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.165
while the other is
going horizontal.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.170
It's actually amazingly
difficult to find the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.150
exact right wording.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.260
But I think you get the idea.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.950
By definition, perpendicular
lines have a 90 degree

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.070
apart from each other.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.820
And, you know, you've seen this
all the time in things like

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.880
squares and rectangles.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.570
If I were to draw a
rectangle like that.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.940
Right?

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.920
A rectangle is made up of a
bunch of perpendicular lines,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.790
or lines at 90 degree angles.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.720
So example.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.410
These two lines are at
a 90 degree angle.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.525
The way you draw a 90
degree angle is you draw

00:02:19.525 --> 00:02:21.700
a little box like that.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.700
That's the same thing as
doing this-- as doing

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.520
a 90 degree angle.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.050
And you could even
get wider angles.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.410
So if you go above 90 degrees.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.810
So let's say I had
lines like this.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.820
So this would be-- I don't
know, I'm just eyeballing

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.440
it-- 135 degrees or
something like that.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.130
If you ever want to really
measure the angles, you can use

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.170
something called a protractor.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.240
That's a tool maybe your
teachers can help you use that.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.410
So that'd be 135 degrees.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.190
And then if you had it so wide
that the two lines are actually

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:10.950
almost forming a line, then
this becomes 180 degrees.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.130
It's almost like one line.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.870
Right?

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.600
This is 180 degrees.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.100
And then you can keep going.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.200
So if this angle here is 135
degrees, you can actually also

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.030
measure this angle right here.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.355
Let me do it in a different
color just to add some variety.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.320
So then this angle right here.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.920
So the angles in a circle
are there are 360

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.970
degrees in a circle.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:49.610
So if this is 135, this magenta
angle would be 360 degrees

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.050
minus 135 degrees.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.380
And that's equal to what?

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:02.230
That's 225 degrees, is
this magenta angle.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.440
And then we could do
other things like that.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.220
So one, you know that the
degrees in the circle

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.670
are 360 degrees.

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.760
This is important to know.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.390
Degrees in a circle
are 360 degrees.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.350
It's also important to know
that if you just go kind of

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.450
halfway around a circle,
like we did here,

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.890
that's 180 degrees.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.420
Like if you viewed the
pivot point as like,

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.440
let's say, right here.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.480
I mean it looks like just
one line and it really is.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.130
But that's 180 degrees.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.410
And then if you go quarter
way around the circle,

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.420
that's 90 degrees.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.400
All right?

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.770
Hopefully you're getting
a bit of an intuition

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.380
for what an angle is.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.290
So now I will teach you
a bunch of very useful

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.675
rules for angles.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.160
Clear this.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.520
So let me redraw.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.090
So if I had a line like this.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.910
I like using the colors, just
so I think it keeps you from

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.060
getting completely bored.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.780
And it might not be completely
intuitive what I'm doing, but

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.120
let's add an angle like that.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.850
And so, let's just say-- you
know, I'm not measuring these

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.140
exactly-- let's say that
this is 30 degrees.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:26.300
We know that if we go all the
way around the circle, we know

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.550
that that's 360 degrees.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.890
Right?

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.330
And that's a very ugly
looking around the circle

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.040
angle that I drew.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.230
So then we also know
that this angle right

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:43.370
here is 330 degrees.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.670
Right?

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.630
Because this angle plus this
magenta angle is going to

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:48.850
equal the whole circle.

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.620
So this is equal
to 330 degrees.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.930
So remember that.

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.410
The angles in a circle--
or there are 360

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:58.470
degrees in a circle.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.740
I don't know if you remember.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.360
You probably don't.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.460
This was probably
before you were born.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.920
But there used to be a game
called 720, and it was a

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.940
skateboarding game--
it was a video game.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.870
And the 720 was essentially
you were trying to jump

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.430
your skateboard and
spin around twice.

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.280
And that's 720 degrees.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.130
If you go around a circle
twice that's 720 degrees.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.470
If you just jump and
spin around once, you

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.140
went 360 degrees.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.690
So you've probably heard this
in just popular culture.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:29.510
But anyway.

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.610
So 360 degrees in a circle.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.730
And you could imagine half
a circle is 180 degrees.

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:39.240
So the other important thing to
realize is, like we said, if

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.410
we go halfway around the
circle it's 180 degrees.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.890
But if we have two angles that
add up to that-- so let's say.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.280
I don't know if these lines are
thick enough for you to see.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.700
Let me draw something thicker.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.600
It doesn't look ideal,
but you get the idea.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:10.370
So if we have this
angle, let's call it x.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:18.250
And then this angle is y.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.280
What do we know about the
relationship between x and y?

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:26.490
Well, we know that the entire
angle is half of a circle.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:27.290
Right?

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.570
So that's 180 degrees.

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:33.240
That's 180 degrees,
this entire angle.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.190
So what are angles x and
y going to add up to?

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.230
I'm trying to stay
color consistent.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:49.810
x plus y are going to
equal-- I'm color blind,

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:53.740
I think-- 180 degrees.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:59.290
Or you could write y is
equal to 180 minus x.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:03.680
Or x is equal to 180 minus y.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:08.040
But if x plus y are equal to
180 degrees-- and you can see

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.870
that it makes sense that they
do-- if you add the two angles

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:13.020
you go halfway around a circle.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:19.390
Then that tells us that x and y
are-- and this is a fancy word,

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:21.930
and it's just good to commit
this to memory-- they are

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.905
supplementary angles.

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:38.680
That's when you add
to 180 degrees.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.390
Now what if we had
this situation.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.690
Oh my God, that was horrible.

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:48.720
Undo.

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:52.505
Let's say I had this situation.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:55.990
Let's see.

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:57.370
I draw two perpendicular lines.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:57.570
Right?

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:01.960
So this is going a quarter
way around the circle.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:02.170
All right.

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:07.710
Let's say this entire angle
here-- I'm drawing it really

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:09.060
big-- that's 90 degrees.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:09.290
Right?

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:10.960
They're perpendicular.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:15.210
And now if I had two
angles within that.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.800
So now if I have two angles
here-- so let's say that this

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:26.150
is x and this is y-- what
do x and y add up to?

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:28.020
Well, x plus y is 90.

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:37.220
And we can say that x and
y are complementary.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:41.670
And it's important to not get
confused between the two.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.610
Just remember complementary
means two angles add up to 90

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:48.360
degrees, supplementary means
that two angles add

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.160
up to 180 degrees.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.000
I'm running out of time, so I
will see you in the next video.
