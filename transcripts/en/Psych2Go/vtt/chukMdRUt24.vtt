00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.740
While jobs and careers give us something to do and the financial support we need, there's more to life than working.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:12.880
Humans rely on the love and support of others, and without these things life would be pretty bleak.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.300
Just ask anyone who's fed up with dating guys who keep breaking their heart,

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.000
or someone who's still dreaming about meeting the girl they're going to spend the rest of their life with.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.880
Whether they're in the early 20s feeling jaded or in their 40s and divorced,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.660
it is perfectly normal and okay to feel frustrated.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.240
Despite everything, there are reasons to have the courage to let love in.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.760
Here are five reasons why you might have a hard time finding love.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.500
1. You're looking in all the wrong places.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.240
It's been said that bars and parties aren't the best places to find the love of your life,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.120
but life is rarely as black and white as that.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.820
Maybe someone's looking too hard, eager to make a move on the first person to give them attention.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.460
They may be so excited to scope out the crowd, that they forget about those who are already in their lives.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:09.080
They may even be shutting down opportunities for themselves, because they aren't open to meeting someone at a bar,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.120
party or another unexpected place.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.220
2. You don't give people enough chances.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.740
When someone begins to turn down every opportunity because of one awkward experience,

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:28.680
it's time to ask what's really going on. Is everyone you've met really that bad, or are you just making excuses?

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:35.400
Sometimes, we hold ourselves back more than we like to admit due to fears and high expectations.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.440
If someone goes on one date, it doesn't mean that they're committed forever and settling for anyone less than their true love.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.120
It's all about recognizing how many opportunities you've taken away from yourself.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.620
If finding love is a priority, you must keep an open mind and an open heart.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.140
3. You haven't practiced self-love yet.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.460
Someone can be the kindest person and still end up dating jerks who break their heart.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.680
A little self-love can help anyone realize what kind of care they need, and deserve, in their relationships.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:20.320
Those who don't practice self-love often rely solely on their partner for it, which can easily lead toward an unhealthy, co-dependent relationship.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.800
4. You're playing the comparison game.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.960
Is your ex still on your mind?

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.600
Those who compare their new dates with their exes are often harder to reach and unable to fully connect with someone new.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.980
They may project their excess characteristics onto their new partner,

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.220
and will likely not be able to get to know them for who they truly are.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.880
If the ex is still in the picture, or in the thoughts, it's not time to start dating yet.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.800
5. It's not your time yet.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.220
If you've mastered self-love and have a good head on your shoulders,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:02.540
then maybe it's just not your time yet. It doesn't mean that it'll never happen. It just means that now isn't the best time.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.380
Until then, prioritize yourself and let the right opportunities find their way to you.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:15.140
