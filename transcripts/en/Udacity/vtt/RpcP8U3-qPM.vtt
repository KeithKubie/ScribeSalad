00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now we're going to use Euler's formula to give us a handle on how fast edges grow

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
relative to the number of nodes in a planar graph.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We're going to make use of two other facts.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
One is that every region in a planar graph has to be encapsulated--has to be bounded--

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
by at least three edges for it to be a region.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It might be more that that, but it has to be at least three.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
If you think about three times the number of regions,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
the number of edges has to be at least that big, though, we're counting each edge twice,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
because each edge can actually participate in two regions.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Twice the number of edges has to be bigger than or equal to three times the number of regions.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Rewriting Euler's formula, we have this--rewriting this equation, we have this.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Substituting in, we have this.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Let's multiply through by 3. We get 3m + 6 â‰¤ 3n + 2m.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Subtract m from both sides and subtract 6 from both sides, a

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and we get m, the number of edges, can't be any bigger than 3n - 6,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
which this expression is in Î˜(n).

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The most edges that we can have in a planar graph is at most linear in the number of nodes.
