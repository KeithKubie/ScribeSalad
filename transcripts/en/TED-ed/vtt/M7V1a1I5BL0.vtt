00:00:06.358 --> 00:00:10.541
In ancient Greece, violent internal
conflict between bordering neighbors

00:00:10.541 --> 00:00:14.470
and war with foreign invaders
was a way of life,

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.851
and Greeks were considered
premier warriors.

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:22.104
Most Greek city-states surrounded
themselves with massive defensive walls

00:00:22.104 --> 00:00:23.831
for added protection.

00:00:23.831 --> 00:00:27.312
Sparta in its prime was a different story,

00:00:27.312 --> 00:00:29.013
finding walls unnecessary

00:00:29.013 --> 00:00:34.110
when it had an army of the most feared
warriors in the ancient world.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.385
So what was Sparta doing differently
than everyone else

00:00:37.385 --> 00:00:40.092
to produce such fierce soldiers?

00:00:40.092 --> 00:00:44.051
To answer that question, we turn to
the written accounts of that time.

00:00:44.051 --> 00:00:47.207
There are no surviving written accounts
from Spartans themselves,

00:00:47.207 --> 00:00:50.937
as it was forbidden for Spartans
to keep records,

00:00:50.937 --> 00:00:55.252
so we have to rely on those of
non-Spartan ancient historians,

00:00:55.252 --> 00:00:58.990
like Herodotus, Thucydides,
and Plutarch.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.631
These stories may be embellished

00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:03.940
and depict Sparta 
at the apex of its power,

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.297
so take them with a grain of salt.

00:01:06.297 --> 00:01:10.155
For Spartans, the purpose for their
existence was simple:

00:01:10.155 --> 00:01:12.183
to serve Sparta.

00:01:12.183 --> 00:01:13.631
On the day of their birth,

00:01:13.631 --> 00:01:16.656
elder Spartan leaders examined
every newborn.

00:01:16.656 --> 00:01:21.136
The strong healthy babies were considered
capable of fulfilling this purpose,

00:01:21.136 --> 00:01:25.245
and the others may have been left
on Mount Taygetus to die.

00:01:25.245 --> 00:01:30.442
Every Spartan, boy or girl,
was expected to be physically strong,

00:01:30.442 --> 00:01:31.751
mentally sharp,

00:01:31.751 --> 00:01:33.622
and emotionally resilient.

00:01:33.622 --> 00:01:38.545
And it was their absolute duty
to defend and promote Sparta at all costs.

00:01:38.545 --> 00:01:40.383
So in the first years of their lives,

00:01:40.383 --> 00:01:44.953
children were raised to understand that
their loyalty belonged first to Sparta,

00:01:44.953 --> 00:01:47.879
and then to family.

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:50.969
This mindset probably made it easier
for the Spartan boys,

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:54.315
who upon turning seven,
were sent to the agoge,

00:01:54.315 --> 00:01:56.440
a place with one main purpose:

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.110
to turn a boy into a Spartan warrior

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.910
through thirteen years of relentless,
harsh, and often brutal training.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.000
The Spartans prized physical perfection
above all else,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.788
and so the students spent a great deal
of their time learning how to fight.

00:02:13.788 --> 00:02:15.657
To ensure resilience in battle,

00:02:15.657 --> 00:02:18.847
boys were encouraged to fight
among themselves,

00:02:18.847 --> 00:02:22.707
and bullying, unlike today, 
was acceptable.

00:02:22.707 --> 00:02:25.632
In order to better prepare the boys
for the conditions of war,

00:02:25.632 --> 00:02:27.534
the boys were poorly fed,

00:02:27.534 --> 00:02:30.256
sometimes even going days without eating.

00:02:30.256 --> 00:02:32.683
They also were given little 
in the way of clothing

00:02:32.683 --> 00:02:35.547
so that they could learn to deal
with different temperatures.

00:02:35.547 --> 00:02:39.346
Spartan boys were encouraged
to steal in order to survive,

00:02:39.346 --> 00:02:40.534
but if they were caught,

00:02:40.534 --> 00:02:41.896
they would be disciplined,

00:02:41.896 --> 00:02:45.979
not because they stole,
but because they were caught in the act.

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:48.138
During the annual contest of endurance

00:02:48.138 --> 00:02:51.129
in a religious ritual known as
the diamastigosis,

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.866
teenage boys were whipped
in front of an altar

00:02:53.866 --> 00:02:56.729
at the Sanctuary of Artemis Orthia.

00:02:56.729 --> 00:03:00.429
It was common for boys to die
on the altar of the goddess.

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:03.812
Fortunately, not everything
was as brutal as that.

00:03:03.812 --> 00:03:06.452
Young Spartans were also taught
how to read,

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:07.282
write,

00:03:07.282 --> 00:03:08.535
and dance,

00:03:08.535 --> 00:03:11.021
which taught them graceful control
of their movements

00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:12.761
and helped them in combat.

00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:15.888
While the responsibilities for the girls
of Sparta were different,

00:03:15.888 --> 00:03:17.587
the high standards of excellence

00:03:17.587 --> 00:03:22.028
and expectation to serve 
Sparta with their lives remained the same.

00:03:22.028 --> 00:03:25.409
Spartan girls lived at home with
their mothers as they attended school.

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:27.499
Their curriculum included the arts,

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:28.568
music,

00:03:28.568 --> 00:03:29.462
dance,

00:03:29.462 --> 00:03:30.238
reading,

00:03:30.238 --> 00:03:31.459
and writing.

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.260
And to stay in peak physical condition,
they learned a variety of sports,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.510
such as discus,

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.483
javelin,

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:39.253
and horseback riding.

00:03:39.253 --> 00:03:42.753
In Sparta, it was believed that only
strong and capable women

00:03:42.753 --> 00:03:47.495
could bear children that would one day
become strong and capable warriors.

00:03:47.495 --> 00:03:50.616
To all Spartans, men and women,

00:03:50.616 --> 00:03:53.185
perhaps the most important lesson
from Spartan school

00:03:53.185 --> 00:03:55.473
was allegiance to Sparta.

00:03:55.473 --> 00:03:59.910
To die for their city-state was seen
as the completion of one's duty to Sparta.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.100
Upon their death,

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.932
only men who died in battle
and women who died in childbirth

00:04:04.932 --> 00:04:07.095
were given tombstones.

00:04:07.095 --> 00:04:11.464
In the eyes of their countrymen,
both died so that Sparta could live.
