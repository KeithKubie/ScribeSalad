00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.800
&gt;&gt; Edward Widmer: I'm Ted Widmer.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.750
I'm the brand new director of
the Kluge Center, and I just want

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.110
to briefly welcome you before
turning the real introduction

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.050
over to Nancy Groce.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.340
I'm so new, in fact, that I saw
a poster announcing this talk,

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.320
and I was wondered if I could
sneak away from the Kluge Center

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.990
to attend it, because
it was so compelling;

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.310
and I didn't fully realize
it was a talk being hosted

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:41.610
by the Kluge Center.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.370
[Laughter] So I'm really glad
to be here in both the capacity

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.160
of new director and a very
interested participant.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.270
I'm also thrilled to have learned
-- I just met Sheryl yesterday,

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.350
and I'm enjoying meeting people
from all around the world

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.120
in the various divisions
of the Library,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.820
but particularly within
the Kluge Center.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.220
And Sheryl and I as we talked
realized that on the Earth,

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.320
this very large planet we
all inhabit, she and I lived

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.690
about four streets away from each
other in Providence Rhode Island.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.420
Rhode Island is so small we often
don't even use street names,

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.720
and she said, "I live near the
pharmacy where you can buy wine."

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.880
[Laughter] So I'm delighted to
meet a new hometown friend hundreds

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.410
of miles away from
where we both live.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.830
But before Sheryl begins,
I want to ask Nancy Groce

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.710
from the American Folklife Center
to do the real introduction.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.510
Thank you.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.540
[ Applause ]

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.600
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Thank you and
good afternoon to everybody,

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.720
and welcome to the
Library of Congress.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.780
Today's event is being sponsored --

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.540
sort of cosponsored
by the Kluge Center

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.860
and the American Folklife Center.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.000
My name is Nancy Groce, and I'm
one of the staff folklorists

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.440
at the American Folklife Center.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.400
On behalf of my center and Ted
Widmer and his colleagues here

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.180
at the Kluge Center, I'm delighted
you are able to join us here today

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.760
for a presentation
by Sheryl Kaskowitz.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.090
Dr. Kaskowitz is a Rhode
Island based ethnomusicologist,

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.670
who was recently awarded the
prestigious John Kluge Fellowship

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.140
to pursue her research
here at the Library.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.870
Now, one of the great things about
receiving a Kluge fellowship is

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.170
that the award allows scholars
from throughout the United States,

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.490
really, throughout the
world, to come to the Library

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.440
to pursue their research at this,

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.500
the world's largest research
facility, and to take advantage

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.260
of the strength and resources of
the Library's numerous collections.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.610
At the American Folklife Center
where Dr. Kaskowitz has chosen

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.710
for so much of her research
during her residency,

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:47.070
AFC is one of 20 specialized
reading rooms here at the Library.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.790
By itself alone, the American
Folklife Center is the world's

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.780
largest ethnographic collection.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.460
We think we have over six million
items documenting various aspects

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.210
of traditional cultures
from more than 144 nations

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.490
and over 800 cultural groups.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.710
Our greatest strengths
is, of course,

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.440
our holdings in American culture,
and especially American music.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.490
We have more than 3,000
individual collections

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.880
at the American Folklife
Center, and there are many

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.090 position:56%
that have never been fully explored.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.810
Among these -- and I should add one

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.490
of the staff's favorite is a
collection of Sidney Robertson,

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.740
or she was known for her
marriage, Sidney Robertson Cowell,

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.310
which we split between our holdings
and the Music Division holding.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.640 position:56%
Robertson was a pioneering collector
whose significant contributions

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.710
to the field of folklore

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.650
and ethnomusicology have long been
overshadowed by her contemporaries,

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.420
like Alan Lomax and Charles Seeger.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.960
Therefore, as happy as we
are to welcome Kluge fellows,

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.150
we were particularly
delighted when Sheryl arrived

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.480
to research Robertson's
rich collection.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.460
And I should add, I just
want to give a shout-out

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.220
to AFC staff member, Kathy Kurtz
[phonetic], who is here today

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.320
who has also done significant
work on Sidney Robertson Cowell.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.770
And but there was more than
enough material for many scholars,

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.710
and both Sheryl and
Kathy spent a lot

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.810
of time comparing notes
and working together.

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.640
So Sheryl Kaskowitz received her
PhD in music and ethnomusicology --

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.330
well actually it's in music with
a focus on ethnomusicology, right,

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.630
from Harvard University in 2011.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.990
And she's now at Brown
University as a researcher,

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.380
as well as an independent
scholar in Rhode Island.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.370
Her research interests
focus on popular vernacular

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.580
and participatory music making in
the US, and include both historical

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.360
and contemporary practices.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.580
Her most recent book, "God Bless
America," which was published

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.030
by Oxford University Press in
2013, presents a social history

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.460
and an ethnography of the
iconic Irving Berlin song.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.920
Today, she will be presenting an
overview of her current research,

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.750
and I'd like to ask you to
join me in welcoming her

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.340
for this presentation
entitled, "Delight in What it is

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:12.510
to be an American: Sidney Robertson
on the Road, 1935 to 1937."

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.870
[ Applause ]

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.460
&gt;&gt; Sheryl Kaskowitz:
Thank you so much.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.140
I just -- thank you
to Ted and to Nancy.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.480
It's been such a privilege
to be here as a Kluge fellow.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.360
I'm only able to be here for four
months, which when I started felt

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.630
like a long chunk of time and
it just went really quickly.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.770
But I especially wanted to
thank, I mean, the librarians,

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.570
the archivists who I worked with.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.550
Everybody was so helpful and
welcoming, and especially

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:55.460 position:56%
in the Folklife Center, Kathy Kurtz,
and Nicky Saylor, we sort of went

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.510
out on gossiping lunches
to talk about Sidney,

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.890
because they've both
done work on her.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:06.120
Todd Harvey was extremely helpful
and helped me pull the audio

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.810
that I'm going to be playing
for you; and Nancy Groce

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.900
and really everybody who helped me
at the desk, really taught me how

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.670
to use the reel-to-reel machines.

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:15.970
So thank you.

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.880
And thank you also
to the Kluge Center.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:23.010
All of the fellows, the staff,
really made it a really kind

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.120
of a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.040
So and also, you know, we've
had some technical difficulties,

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.620
and so whatever happens, happens
at this point is how I feel.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.630
So just a note about
names, Sidney --

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:44.700
I tend to call her by her
first name because she's known

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.000
as Sidney Robertson Cowell.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.130
She married the composer,
Henry Cowell, in 1941,

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.690
and in musicological circles,
she's known almost exclusively

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.580
with her association with him.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:01.310
But because I'm dealing with
a time before she married him,

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.640
it felt strange to call her by a
name that didn't exist at the time,

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.730
so we're sort of time-traveling and
I'm calling her Sidney Robertson.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:13.110
So today, I'm going to focus
my talk around three road trips

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.920 position:56%
that Sidney Robertson took between
1935 and 1937, during which she came

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.620
into her own as a folk
music collector.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.370
These trips also illuminate
some really interesting history

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.720
about the government's use of folk
music throughout the New Deal,

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.790
showing the power that these songs
of the people were seen to hold.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.500
In one of many unpublished,
undated reminisces

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.450
that I found among her papers,

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:39.460
Sidney Robertson described
the pivotal moment

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:44.260
when she left California, quote,
"Drawn by a belated curiosity

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.930
to know more of America
than is visible

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.200
from her pleasant California
backwater,

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.230
and without any conscious intention
beyond some firsthand experience

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:54.430
at the current crisis
in national life,

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:57.830
the writer drove east
in the summer of 1935.

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:00.010
The logic of such a
foray by a young woman

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:03.450
with no resources beyond her
training in music and psychology,

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:08.380
some experience in progressive
education, a small car, $75,

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:13.030
and a driving curiosity about life
and people is not evident even now.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:16.030
The reward for risk and
hardships seems ample,

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:19.680
for she exchanged the sentimental
tie to France and European culture

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.320
for knowledge and delight in
what it is to be an American

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.130
without at all knowing what
she was about at the time."

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:32.250 position:56%
In 1935, Sidney Robertson was living
in Carmel and feeling restless.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.080
In the past three years,
she had been let go

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.460
from her job directing the music
program at an alternative school,

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:40.690
and had amicably divorced her
husband, Kenneth Robertson,

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.590
who she'd married the year
she graduated from Stanford.

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:46.310
She'd just left the job as a
governess for a wealthy family

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:49.750
in Pebble Beach, and was living
in an artist colony in Carmel,

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.800
teaching piano and contributing
concept write-ups and book reviews

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:57.060
to a fledging left-leaning magazine
called "The Pacific Weekly."

00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:00.140
As she complained in a letter
to her mother that year, quote,

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.060
"I get bored talking of
Communism and sex down here

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:07.730
where only a few people ever talk
about anything else," unquote.

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:09.630
[Laughter] Her younger
sister, Jean, had plans to go

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:13.880
to the Henry Street Settlement
in New York, and in April 1935,

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.820
Sidney wrote to the settlement
house's director, Helen Hall,

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.600
to offer her services
in their music programs.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.740 position:56%
She concluded the letter by writing,
quote, "You're doing the sort

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.130
of work I care most about doing,
and I hope very much eventually

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:29.870
to be able to contribute
to it some way."

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:33.360
What might have moved Sidney to
make such a drastic life change?

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.930
She may have been influenced by
her work at the Pacific Weekly,

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:41.270
a left-of-center paper started
by two Veteran journalists

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.070
who had settled on the coast.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.720
The paper featured articles
and editorials sympathetic

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.140
to left-of-center causes, and
to the plight of working people.

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.420
Born into a wealthy
family in San Francisco,

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:54.390
Sidney had not had
experience with such hardships.

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:57.420
But a book that Sidney reviewed
in the Pacific Weekly seems

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.210
to have had an effect on her.

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:04.610
Writing under the pseudonym Robin
Howe, Sidney reviewed "Waiting

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:08.580
for Nothing," by Tom Kromer, a
realistic autobiographical novel

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:11.420
about the hard life of a
vagrant traveling West.

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:14.510
She wrote, quote, "The Impact
of this book is like nothing

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:15.810
that has been written

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:18.040
out of individual experience
of the Depression.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:22.490
It is stark as a winter tree, no
pathos, no plea, no art intervene

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:25.580
between you and the facts
of Kromer's experience,

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.380
facts which makes savage propaganda

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.590
because you feel they
cannot be born.

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:34.790 position:56%
No conscious drama could improve on
the profound violence of this book."

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:38.510
This review was published the same
day that Sidney wrote her letter

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:41.410
to Helen Hall, which may
indicate that it had a role

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:43.500
in her decision to head East.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.550
As she later said in
an interview, quote,

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:47.910
"I began hearing about
the Depression.

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:51.080
The Depression crept over the
country slowly, and in California,

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.840
you didn't hear about it too much.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.140
But I began hearing things

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:57.500
and I decided I was having
much too privileged a life."

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.210
A little over a week after
Sidney sent her letter,

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:02.800
Helen Hall wrote back to say that
she would certainly be of use

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.500
at Henry Street, and Sidney began

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.350
to plan her first cross-country
road trip.

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:09.230
First, she had to convince
her mother

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:13.040
that driving was the best plan,
even though she was in her 30s,

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.930
summarizing her case
over several letters.

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:19.020
Quote, "I hate to pay out
cash for a railroad ticket.

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.540
One has nothing to show for it.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.550
I've never driven across
the continent.

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:23.990
June isn't a bad month.

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:26.270
When do you suppose people
drive if not in summer,

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:28.510
and my tires are all
good for the moment.

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:32.360
And later, quote, "A
transcontinental trip sounds wild,

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.750
but after all, it's
only the trip from here

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:39.410
to San Francisco multiplied 20
times in various ways," unquote.

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:42.190
[Laughter] And finally, "No;
I've always wanted to drive

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:44.060
and I really feel equal to it.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.510
It will be a grand luck."

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:49.170
On June 15th, Sidney set off
with a friend of a friend

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.020
who was relocating to New York.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.350
Postcards that she sent
regularly to her mother showed

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:57.080 position:56%
that they headed south from Carmel,
and spent over a week on a slow tour

00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:00.330
of the Southwest before
needing to pick up the pace,

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.160
driving the long stretch
from Colorado

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.620
to New York City in just five days.

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:09.070
From Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,
she wrote, quote, "We're 189 miles

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:11.560
from NYC, a mere nothing to us.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.180
Such perfectly beautiful country."

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:17.090
Sidney landed at the
Henry Street settlement

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:20.990
on Manhattan's Lower
Eastside on July 4th, 1935,

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:24.070
and began working at
Social Music Program.

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:27.280 position:56%
Settlement houses were set up in
urban areas to offer social services

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.530
and activities that were intended
to have an assimilating effect

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:33.900
on the immigrant communities
with which they worked.

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:35.880
Music had been used
in settlement houses

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.610
since their inception
along two separate tracks.

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:41.150
Music schools taught
conservatory-style lessons

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:44.640
in Western art music as a mode
of uplift through high culture,

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:48.200
and social music programs offered
participatory music to people

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.170
of all skills and backgrounds,
with the expressed purpose,

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:53.760
according to scholar
Shannon Green, to quote,

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:57.980
"Ease relationships among members
of the community through music."

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.690
In particular, these social
music programs use folk music

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:03.400
that immigrants had brought with
them from their home countries,

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.390
in order to strengthen a sense of
community and ease communication

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:09.410
between different ethnic groups
living in the same neighborhood.

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:12.500 position:56%
As part of her work at Henry Street,
Sidney collected Yiddish songs

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:16.060 position:56%
from the older members of the Jewish
community to teach back to everyone

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:18.960
in group-singing programs
that she led.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:22.040
In the end, Sidney spent just
eight months at Henry Street,

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:26.420
leaving in March of 1936 after
she fell ill with bronchitis.

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:28.790
But as we shall see, her time
in the settlement house proved

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:31.650
to be good preparation
for her government work.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.270
In the summer of 1936,
Sidney joined the music unit

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:39.550
of the special skills division in
the Resettlement Administration.

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:40.850
This agency was tasked

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:43.560
with resettling those whose
livelihoods have been destroyed

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:48.560 position:56%
by the Depression onto newly-created
homesteads, with a stated goal to,

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:51.860
quote, "Put houses, and land,
and people together in such a way

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.950
that the props under our economic

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:58.320
and social structure will be
permanently strengthened," unquote.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.720
Homestead residences were a mix
of farmers whose land had failed,

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.500
jobless urban workers
willing to return to farming,

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.080
and unemployed miners and
other rural workers whose jobs

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.820
had disappeared.

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:11.520
The guiding principle behind
these resettlement communities was

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.310
to foster a cooperative
spirit that would do more

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:18.090
than simply boost morale
during tough times,

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:21.460
but would in fact inspire a
move toward cooperative farming

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:24.940
and a new sense of
collective purpose.

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:29.520
According to a 1935 memo written by
a staffer named Katherine Kellogg,

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.360
the goal of the agency's
special skills division was

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:35.010
to provide recreational
opportunities to, quote,

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:38.340 position:56%
"Bind the homesteaders into
harmonious social units, to maintain

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:41.510
and build up morale, and to
relieve the strain of insecurity

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:45.840
until economic stabilization
had been accomplished."

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.040
These goals seem to echo
the settlement houses' use

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.370
of social music to
unify a community.

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:53.400
And in fact, Katherine Kellogg
had herself previously worked

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.920
at the Henry Street Settlement,
and her recommendations

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.390
for special skills seem to
reflect this familiarity

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:01.050
with the settlement
movement's ideas.

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:04.670
The music unit sent musicians to
several resettlement homesteads

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:06.690
to provide opportunities
for social music-making

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:09.360
and they also followed the
settlement house practice

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.550
of collecting folk songs
to teach in the community.

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:15.930
But here, instead of Yiddish
songs from the old country,

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:18.740
the Special Skills Division
focused on collecting folk songs

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:22.320
from the rural areas where most
resettled homesteaders came from,

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.380
with the expressed idea to
put this music to work, quote,

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:29.810
"As an integrating social force,"
unquote, on the new homesteads.

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:33.540
After persuading the government
to purchase recording equipment,

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:36.860
which was no small feat, the music
unit began sending specialists

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.620
on the recording trips
to collect songs

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.970
that would then be brought
back to resettlement homesteads

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:42.930
to be used in community singing.

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:47.980
The music unit was led by Charles
Seeger, a musicologist and composer

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.580
who had previously worked within
the radical Composers Collective

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:52.070
in New York City.

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:55.010
After Sidney had worked in the
Washington office as his assistant

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:59.850
for two months, she was sent on
her first road trip in July 1936.

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:03.240
According to her report, she was
sent to Western North Carolina to,

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:06.610
quote, "Get training and experience
in running the recording machine,

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:09.780
and in the rough and tumble of
folk song collecting under the wing

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:15.110
of a veteran in the
field," John A. Lomax.

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:18.220
Sidney's travel companions
on this trip were two

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:21.140
of the imminent folk music
collectors of the day.

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.310
John Lomax, who had recently been
appointed the honorary curator

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:27.590 position:56%
of the archive of American folk song
here at the Library of Congress,

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:30.600
represented the public sphere,
and was considered a pioneer

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.770
in the recording of
American vernacular music.

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:36.730
On this trip, Lomax was
joined by Frank C. Brown,

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:39.640
a professor at Duke whose
focus on discovering survivals

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.320
of Old English ballads in the
songs of the rural Appalachians,

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:47.110
represented the dominant
interest for academic folklorists.

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:51.080 position:56%
The first part of the trip was spent
visiting Dr. Brown's ballad singers

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:54.060
in the rural mountains near
Blowing Rock, North Carolina,

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:56.760
followed by a visit to a prison
in Boone, North Carolina,

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:00.570
where Lomax recorded songs sung
by African-American prisoners.

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:02.530
Sidney then went on
alone to meet the rest

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:04.120 position:56%
of the special skills division staff

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.820
at the Folk Music Festival
in Asheville.

00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:10.480
While Sidney was on this
trip, Seeger noted in a memo

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:14.200
to a supervisor that her experience
with these two collectors, quote,

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.370
"Reveals a flair for
diplomacy," unquote.

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:20.750
[Laughter] Sidney's description of
the trip in her own report shows

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:23.540
that she was adapted in
navigating the large personalities

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:26.280
and egos of her companions.

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:30.990
Quote, "I survived two days of
14 hours each and one of 17,

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:34.530
the driving of Misters Brown and
Lomax, their outrageous manners

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:36.780
to each other, and
the constant necessity

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:40.610
for impeccable behavior toward
the mountain people, our hosts.

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:42.750
Once Mr. Lomax recovered
from the notion

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:46.400
that a woman is a fragile thing
to be waited on hand and foot,

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.810
I was able to relieve him
with the driving and recording

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:52.270
and lugging odds and ends about
recharging batteries, et cetera.

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:56.010
I took note from Dr. Brown
-- " exclamation point,

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:58.960
"regularly from the beginning."

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:02.270
Reading about this trip, one
can imagine that these men,

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:05.330
both born in the previous century,
didn't quite know what to do

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:07.170
with a woman like Sidney.

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:09.570
Lomax found it difficult
to allow her to help,

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:10.870
and Brown could only view her

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:13.800
as filling the traditional
role of secretary.

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.870
But Sidney wrote that Lomax
did, quote, "Make every effort

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:18.600
to divorce himself
from the machinery

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.710
so I could have a shot at it."

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:23.790
And she noted with pride that
he, quote, "Ultimately offered

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:25.460
to leave his machine in my hands,

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:28.230
so he gather he felt sure
I could use it properly."

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:32.120
In addition to honing her
diplomatic and technical skills,

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.430
the trip seemed to help
Sidney carve out her own path

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:37.170
and developing methodology
for fieldwork.

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:40.430
In a memo entitled, "Observations
on Technique of Collecting,"

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:43.040
written just after the
trip, she wrote, quote,

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.630
"I came to the conclusion
that the collectors' visit

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:50.130
to make records should be a social
occasion, never a business one."

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.800
She disliked the way Professor
Brown seemed to push his singers

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:56.500
to recall songs, noting that,
quote, "A collector is after all

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.500
in the position of one asking
a favor, and he should be alert

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.170
to the fatigue of singer and player

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:05.200
and return another day
if necessary," unquote.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.070
Sidney later said that she was
troubled by Lomax's treatment

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:11.060
of the African-American
singers from whom he collected,

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.550
calling it "domineering
and patronizing,"

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:15.360
though this actually
went unmentioned

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.470
in her original report from 1936.

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:20.900
Her response to all of
this seems to have been

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.180
to frame her own relationships
with her informants

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.850
on friendlier more
egalitarian terms,

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:28.630
though her written descriptions
could sometimes hint toward a kind

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:30.540
of detached ridicule.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:34.100
For example, she wrote of one of
Professor Brown's singers quote,

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:37.630
"A man in his 40s who had but one
snag tooth left in his head sang

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:39.680
for us in a wobbly falsetto,

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.570
which Dr. Brown said was the
old mountain way of singing.

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:45.080
It sounded to me as if he were
simply unaccustomed to singing

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:48.820
and unable to control his voice."

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:51.210
[Laughter] Over time, she
became less prone to caricature

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:53.440
and judgment in describing
musicians,

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.200
but she often couldn't resist
including an amusing anecdote

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:59.970
about something they said, often
written in country dialect.

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:03.140
These stories, with a hint
of ridicule while often told

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:06.920
with the spirit of affection, are
also manifestations of the cultural

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:11.050
and economic divides that existed
between collector and musician.

00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:15.200
This trip also helped clarify
her understanding of the kind

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.760
of music the special skills
division was interested in.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:22.010
Their goal was very different than
that of academics who are focused

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:24.900
on capturing and classifying
remnants of a static history,

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:28.540
rather than on the rule of
music and contemporary life.

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:31.310
As she wrote, quote, "Dr.
Brown's classifications

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:34.410
of folks songs doesn't give
us the faintest idea --

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:37.140
the faintest hint along the
lines that are important to us.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.930
What are people singing now?

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:40.230

contrasted with the antiquarian one.

life is that of a man with his head

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:51.210
over his shoulder toward
the imagined perfections

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:53.780
of the past," unquote.

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:56.750
Sidney expressed strong feelings
about the importance of their work

00:20:56.750 --> 00:21:00.010
in framing folk music as a living
tradition that held value in

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:01.930
and of itself, as she concluded

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:05.880
in a poetic tone not usually
associated with government reports.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:09.570
Quote, "And here we are,
struggling to make our way

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:12.020
into the main current
of contemporary culture,

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:15.220
which we conceive as dynamic
and alive, drawing its force

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:17.580
from a thousand tributaries
which flow forward

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:22.370
with a perpetual meeting of
the waters in the future."

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:25.660
The resettlement administration's
interest in the social use

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.850
of music set them apart not
only from academic folklores,

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:32.250
but also from other public folk
music collectors, like John Lomax,

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:35.850
whose goals were focused on
preservation and dissemination.

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:38.910
Charles Seeger wrote that the music
unit's main concern should be,

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:41.760
quote, "To regard music
as a social function,

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:45.150 position:56%
to direct it towards certain
definite social goals as an activity

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:50.220
of masses of people, rather than
merely of isolated individuals."

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:53.400
In other words, the music
unit emphasized group singing

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.530
and other group musical activities

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:58.000
to reinforce the resettlement
administration's goals

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.520
of fostering cooperation, and
they felt that the folk songs

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.280
that already resonated with the
homesteaders' rural American

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:08.840
identity served as the best
vehicle for this message.

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.200
I should note that in many ways,

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:13.510
the music program followed the
racialized thinking of the time,

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:16.750
and the systemic racism of the
Resettlement Administration,

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:19.580
whose homesteads were
strictly segregated

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:23.340
with only one community set
aside for African-Americans.

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:27.090
Thus, the music unit sought
music from white, rural musicians

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:29.980
for the most part, with
the unfortunate effect

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:32.490
that their definition of
American music focused

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:36.350
around these traditions, and this
even as the music they recorded,

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:41.810
complicated this binary with lots
of crossovers that I can detect

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:43.720
between black and white
musical traditions,

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:47.960
but that's a discussion
for another time.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.650
In a series of song sheets
that Charles Seeger produced

00:22:50.650 --> 00:23:00.260
to be distributed in the homesteads
-- sorry if you can't see those,

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:04.130
several songs with specifically
cooperative messages were included,

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:07.910
including "Cooperation is our
Aim," which is the top one,

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:12.840
and includes the coop
symbol of the two trees.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:16.420
And "We Ain't Down Yet," which is
the second one, and you can see

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:20.610
in the art it has the sign
pointing to cooperate.

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:23.990
And this art was done
by Charles Pollock,

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:25.570
who is Jackson Pollock's brother.

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:28.040
And the other -- and I mean,

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.840
there are so many things
to say about this.

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:35.700
They issued, I believe,
eight song sheets,

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:39.020 position:56%
and none of them had the
resettlement logo, none of them said

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:45.090
where they were from; also
discussion for another time.

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:49.730
So they also used well-known
folk songs with rural themes.

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:56.640
And in the case of a song like
"Wayfaring Stranger" -- so okay.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:02.560
They also use well-known -- music
unit staff wrote new words meant

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.960
to resonate with the lives of
homesteaders in rural areas.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:09.210
So here it says, "The following
modern verses from Virginia

00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:12.820
and Florida respectively
have been received."

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:17.090
So the two verses on the top from
Virginia were from Charles Seeger

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:19.680
in Washington, DC, which I guess
they decided was close enough

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:20.990
to Virginia.

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:26.640
And the third and fourth verse
were from a music specialist

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:27.940
who was working in Florida,

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:33.550
but was from New York City;
so really fascinating.

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:37.880
So what I'm hoping to do is to
play a recording that the unit made

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.560
of Sidney singing these
last two verses

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:43.130
with Charles Seeger on the guitar.

00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:45.510
But I don't know if
it's going to work.

[ Music and Singing ]

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.530
Given her wealthy background
and urban life,

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:34.200
these lyrics could
not have resonated

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.260
with Sidney's own experience,
but she may have identified

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:40.780
with the romantic idea of a
lonesome traveler after venturing

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:45.950
out on her own to collect
folk songs.

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:50.400
Sidney was sent on her first solo
recording trip in November of 1936.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.850 position:56%
Originally, the collecting was to be
made on the way to a new assignment

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:57.270
as a music representative in
the migrant camps in California,

00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:00.350
driving cross-country along
what Charles Seeger called,

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:02.100
"The Broadway of America,"

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:05.010
leading through Tennessee,
Arkansas, et cetera.

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:07.920
Along the way, she planned to visit
several resettlement homesteads

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:11.220
in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and
Tennessee, and she made connections

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:13.700
with a network of local folk
music collectors who pledged

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:17.540
to help her find musicians
in their area to record.

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:20.390 position:56%
Sidney's resettlement administration
collection is not widely known

00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:23.480
outside of folk music circles,
but when it is discussed,

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.850
it is usually in connection
with her work in the Ozarks.

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:29.710
She was among the first to
collect folk songs from that region

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:32.920
from musicians like the Duneune
[phonetic] Family shown here.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:36.420
And she also held two
separate recording sessions

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:40.560
with Emma Dusenbury, an elderly
blind woman from rural Arkansas,

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:44.310 position:56%
who is legendary among folk music
collectors for the astounding number

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:46.120
and range of songs
in her repertoire;

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:49.430
and John Lomax had
collected from her earlier.

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:52.170
Here I'll just play an example
of their session together,

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:55.220
which shows a bit of the warmth
that Sidney tried to cultivate

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:58.510
in her recording sessions.

00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:38.360
[ Singing ]

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.950
And that was a play party game,
which Sidney often was looking

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:45.920
for as a kind of representative
of music

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:49.760
that was being used
in the community.

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:54.880
And I should just say, the other
aspect of her Ozarks collecting is

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:58.590
that there seems to be a love
story involved that I'm not going

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:00.170
to have time to talk
about, so you'll just have

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:04.800
to wait for the HBO miniseries.

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:09.640
[Laughter] So what I am going to
focus my discussion of this trip

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:13.040
on is her collection
of labor protest songs,

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:16.030
which went largely unmentioned
in her official field reports,

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:20.000
but are hidden in plain sight
in the recordings themselves.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.550
In making plans for recording
sessions during her trip,

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:25.960
she confided in a letter to a
special skills staffer, quote,

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.880
"Of course, the thing
I'm most anxious to get

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:31.760 position:56%
on the whole trip are
contemporary worker songs," unquote.

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.760
Just a few days before
she left Washington,

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.610
Sidney met with the
director of education

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:38.770 position:56%
for the International Ladies Garment
Workers Union, who gave her a list

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:41.710
of union contacts across
the country.

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:43.480
In a confidential memo
about the meeting,

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:46.290 position:56%
she noted that the union's
education staff traveled the country

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:48.610
with portable record players,

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:51.260
playing union songs
to get people to sing.

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:54.340
Seeing a clear connection between
the labor union's musical programs

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:58.010
and the goals of the special skills
music unit, she concluded, quote,

00:28:58.010 --> 00:29:00.890
"Here is music as a social
tool being consciously used

00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:04.060
with a very clear aim
and view," unquote.

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:06.520
Of course, all of this
interest in labor songs had

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:08.140
to be kept below the radar.

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:11.420
The resettlement administration was
already under fire from lawmakers

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.600
who felt it was too
costly and veered too close

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.680
to Communism in its goals.

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:18.860 position:56%
Presumably, any music program within
the agency would have been seen

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:20.680
as frivolous, but one invested

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:24.120
in labor songs could
seem downright dangerous.

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:28.340
In fact, the entire music unit kept
an extremely low public profile.

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:29.640
The unit was not mentioned

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.890
in the special skills
division's annual report,

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:35.720 position:56%
and many of their memos and
reports detailing their program were

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:38.070
marked confidential.

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:42.400
Syndey left Washington on November
7th, her car loaded with 250 pounds

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:45.310
of recording equipment
and blank aluminum disks,

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:50.430
and headed to the Westmoreland
homesteads near Greenburg,

00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:52.180
Pennsylvania.

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:55.140
Her first recording session was
delayed by technical difficulties,

00:29:55.140 --> 00:30:02.190
first by car trouble, then --
sorry, then because of malfunctions

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:03.980
with the recording machine.

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:05.590
In talking to a radio repairman,

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:07.810
she learned that many
electrical disturbances

00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:10.930
in a small town would
interfere with the machine,

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:14.140
and because of this complication,
she had to cancel the next session

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:18.150
as well as she wrote in her report,
quote, "A little before 11:00,

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:21.120
a bakery nearby started
its electric dome mixers

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:24.990
and the intermittent disturbance
made recording impossible."

00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:28.770
Finally, the next day, she was able
to conquer these technical barriers

00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:32.330
to make her first solo recording
of a man with the wonderful name

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:36.260
of Tink Queer, a fiddler
accompanied by two guitarists,

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:39.090
perhaps exactly the kind of
music she had expected to find.

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:42.380
So here's an excerpt from
the end of one of the songs,

00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:46.510

Sidney's voice at the end.

From here she traveled
across the Appalachians

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:15.620

themselves and also the field notes

couldn't fit everything in.

her first labor protests songs.

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:42.790
With help from Cumberland's
music specialist, Leonard Kirk,

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:45.530
Sidney had set up a recording
session with the Garrett Family,

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:50.350
homesteaders and musicians with
a deep repertoire of songs.

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:52.940
This is her official report
from her visit with the Garrets,

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:56.190
and it's uncharacteristically
short, a straightforward list

00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:59.230
of the songs she recorded without
any of the colorful descriptions

00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:01.470
or asides of her previous
reports which often went

00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:03.250
on for several single-spaced pages.

00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:04.920
And there's also no mention

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:08.490
of contemporary labor
songs being recorded here.

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:11.830
These missing details appear in a
confidential report that she sent

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:16.790 position:56%
in later, which begins, quote, "I
won't again try to combine recording

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:19.940
of labor and more orthodox
songs in the same locality.

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:22.430
It is too difficult to manage."

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:25.830
And she later described how
they kept things quiet, quote,

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:28.430
"I told Kirk to be careful to
cover the Garrets and Phillips

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:30.800
by being a little vague
about just what I did record,

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:33.970
and by mentioning some of
the old songs they know."

00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:37.030
So here's an excerpt
of Sidney's recording.

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:39.260
This is Henry Garrett singing
"Strike it Harem" [phonetic]

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:43.020 position:56%
in Tennessee, which is an adaptation
of a traditional song called,

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:46.580
"The Hills of Roane County," with
new words by Herschel Phillips,

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:49.910
recounting a recent
strike at a local mill.

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.070
&gt;&gt; "Strike at Harriman, Tennessee."

00:33:55.070 --> 00:34:00.730
It is written by -- it was
written by Herschel Phillips.

[ Guitar and Singing ]

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:54.270
&gt;&gt; Sheryl Kaskowitz: After
Tennessee, Sidney stopped

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:56.830
for brief recording sessions in
Little Rock and the small town

00:34:56.830 --> 00:35:00.700
of Clinton, Arkansas, before
continuing on to St. Louis.

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:04.280
There, she met up with Joe Jones, a
painter and Communist part activist

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:07.880
who had visited the special skills
DC office earlier that year.

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:11.160
He had described the songs that had
been sung during a citywide strike

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:14.700
that September after the City
of St. Louis cut many citizens

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:18.370
from its relief roles, and Sidney
wrote that she felt determined

00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:20.980
to record them on her trip.

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:23.710
Just as in Tennessee, there's no
official report describing her

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:25.010
activities in St. Louis.

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:28.560
And this time, even a
confidential memo was too public,

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:32.110
perhaps because of the involvement
of known Communist party activists.

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:34.260
Instead, Sidney wrote
a personal letter

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:37.860
to special skills director Adrian
Dornbush, and mailed it to the home

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:41.720
of another special skills
staff member, just to be safe.

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:45.020
She recorded four full disks,
about 15 different songs sung

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:48.350
by a multiracial group of activists
who arrived throughout the day,

00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:52.370
quote, "Sent in by the grapevine
operating among the comrades."

00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:55.610
The session had, as she described
it, almost a party atmosphere

00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:59.380
with everyone drinking beer
and chatting between takes.

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:01.710
This session seemed to
convince Sidney of the power

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:03.100
of these kinds of protest songs.

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:06.840
So she wrote, quote, "I used to
be rather scornful of the tendency

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.440
of radical groups to adapt
a familiar song instead

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:10.790
of writing their own.

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:13.140
But one couldn't hear them
sung as I did on Tuesday

00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:15.980
without believing thoroughly
in their living quality.

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:19.150
They are certainly not
being fed from the top."

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:22.160
She took note of one song
popular among garment workers sung

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:26.000
to the tune of "Rock-a-Bye Baby,"
noting quote, "The girls adore

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.400
and are perfectly aware of the
light irony in the contrast

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:32.440
between the bitter words
and the childlike tune.

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:37.510

that she found most impressive

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:17.840
on this trip, writing that it
was, "Alone, worth the trip,"

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:21.630
was the blues implected chant
aimed at St. Louis Mayor Dickman.

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:24.830
She wrote, quote, "This is the
one thing that was sung so much

out into neighborhood
streets hour after hour.

00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:32.710
She noted that it was
set to an old blues tune,

00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:36.670
saying that the dirge-like tune
was sung, quote, "With a dark,

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:39.480
patient quality of tone,
monotonous and threatening

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.780

&gt;&gt; Sheryl Kaskowitz: From St.
Louis, Sidney went to Springfield,

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:37.280
Missouri, where she was
told that her assignment

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:41.090
in California did not go through,
and was called back to Washington.

00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:43.710
After two happy weeks spent
recording in the Ozarks,

00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:47.370
she returned to DC in January
1937, having traveled more

00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:51.240
than 4600 miles, and collected
85 disks of materials to deposit

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:52.880
in the Library of Congress.

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:55.680
But this first solo trip would
be her last official trip

for the Resettlement Administration.

00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.570
By the time Sidney was
back in Washington,

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:02.030
the Resettlement Administration
had been absorbed by the Department

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:06.080
of Agriculture, and the Special
Skills Division lost its support.

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:07.950
As funding for the
music unit dwindled,

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:10.610
Sidney received a new
assignment as a community manager

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:13.710 position:56%
at a homestead in Austin, Minnesota.

00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:15.930
Though there was no musical
component to her job there,

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:18.670
she held onto the special
skills recording machine,

00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:22.200
and collected folk music on the
side, this time including the music

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:23.850
of ethnic immigrants,
the first collector

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:25.560
to do so, and call it American.

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:29.590
In the fall of 1937, she
left Minnesota and returned

00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:31.250
to California, where she would go

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:36.080
on to direct the California
Folk Music WPA Project.

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:39.570
"So if the Resettlement
Administration's music program

00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:43.570 position:56%
lasted just two years, and Sidney
Robertson was involved for even less

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:48.870
than that, why does the story need
to be told," one might ask oneself

00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:52.140
after spending four
months in an archive.

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:57.550
[Laughter] For one thing, Sidney's
contributions to public folk music

00:39:57.550 --> 00:40:00.170
and to the academic
field of ethnomusicology

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:02.060
in the US are often overlooked.

If Charles Seeger is seen as a major
figure in both of these arenas,

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:09.250
then Sidney's role should also be
recognized, since she was the one

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:11.750
who tried out his collecting
methodologies in the field,

00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:15.380
and participated in his efforts
to value the social role of music

00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:20.250
within a culture, an idea that
was transformative in many ways.

00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:23.870 position:56%
There's also certainly an important
legacy in the recordings themselves.

00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:26.920
Sidney's recordings are not as well
known as those recorded by Alan

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:30.510
and John Lomax, largely because
she did not share the Lomax's drive

00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:33.610
to make her discoveries
available to a wider audience.

00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:36.600
Perhaps Sidney needs to be
recognized as at least a kind

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.840
of godmother of the folk revival.

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:41.900
She certainly seems to have had
an influence on Mike Seeger,

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:45.210
Charles' son and Pete's
stepbrother, who recorded many

00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:47.830
of the songs she collected
and later wrote to her, quote,

00:40:47.830 --> 00:40:50.760
"I'm very thankful of your
field collecting in the '30s,

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:55.470 position:56%
and remember your visits, which were
always a special family occasion."

00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:59.340
And why focus on these more
obscure labor songs rather

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:02.700
than finding lost musical
gems in her recordings?

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:06.300 position:56%
Well, I am fascinated by the
special skills division's covert use

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:08.680
of music on the resettlement
homesteads.

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:11.250
I think it's a really
interesting moment to explore

00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:15.610
when a US government agency showed
a belief in the power of music,

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:16.910
and acted on it in a way

00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:20.460
that I think would be
surprising to many Americans.

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:22.870
And I think this official
embrace of folk songs

00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:27.050
as representing national identity
while problematic and complicated

00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:31.790
in many ways, did have a lasting
impact on our musical lives.

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:35.020
In an oral history
interview, Adrian Dornbush,

00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:36.620
the director of Special Skills,

00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:39.410
said that the divisions

00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:42.800
"Is the one tangible thing that
we did in the special skills,

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:46.580 position:56%
which has really lasted and boomed."

00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:49.100
Many studies of the Resettlement
Administration focused

00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:52.070
on its failures, which
provide lessons and warnings

00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:54.840
about overreaching
government programs.

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:57.530
Recently, though, scholars
have begun to look more kindly

00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:59.510
on the administration's legacy.

[phonetic] points

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:04.830

still exist and even thrive,

were discussion criteria?

then second sort

00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:10.320

00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:17.800
I mean, that's a great question.

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:20.520
I think, you know, she was still
carving it out in many ways.

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:21.830
What she talked about is --

00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:25.990
so part of what she did
is that she would meet

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:31.030
with like a local folk music
collector who knew the region,

00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:35.470
and that person would
take them to the singers

00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:37.510
that that person knew about.

00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:42.920
And so she was often sort of
dependent on those filters.

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:46.510
Sometimes she would
just go and set up --

00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:49.890
like she'd set up in a grocery
store, you know, in a rainstorm

00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:52.330
and collected some songs.

00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:55.600
But what she said is
that often it would be --

00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:59.650
they would be talking to -- she
said this about Frank Brown,

00:44:59.650 --> 00:45:04.260
that he was really focused on what
the older people were singing,

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:08.330
and she would try to talk to
the kids, and things like that.

00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:12.660
But that being said, she often
got kind of sucked into the --

00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:16.190
especially when she was in
North Carolina and other parts

00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:18.410
of the Appalachians,
the sort of excitement

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:20.190
of finding these old ballads.

00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:23.750
And so even though she did
try to set herself apart,

00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:28.390
she was still collecting
those things.

00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:33.980
But in terms of like what the
Resettlement Administration was

00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:42.180
interested in, and wanted to use,
yes, I mean, I think that a lot

00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:45.380
of it -- it was not a
strategically planned thing.

00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:48.870
And that, I think, is part
of what she was good at,

00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:52.850
was sort of finding her
way, showing up in a town,

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:59.370
asking if people knew singers,
and kind of seeing what she found.

00:45:59.370 --> 00:46:02.120
And then for your second
question about the canon, I mean,

00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:06.250
I've been thinking about that
a lot, and one of the things

00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:10.610
that I started doing was
tracing songs that --

00:46:10.610 --> 00:46:12.830
like Mike Seeger songs that
traced themselves back.

00:46:12.830 --> 00:46:16.130
Another place to look
is Ruth Crawford Seeger,

00:46:16.130 --> 00:46:19.460
who is Charles Seeger's second
wife put together folk songs

00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:20.760
for children.

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:25.220
And she thankfully noted
who collected what.

00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:29.460
And so she was another person
who you can see kind of remnants

00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:31.380
of her songs in there, and songs

00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:33.100
that I'm familiar with
because of that.

00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:35.250
But it's hard to trace
those lineages.

00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:37.900
I think, you know, this idea
because she wasn't as interested

00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:39.780
in putting things forward, I mean,
in the hands of another collector,

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:41.130
we might all know about
Emma Dusenbury, for example.

00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:42.540
She might have, you know, tried
to, I don't know, I mean, you know,

00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:44.040
bring her to urban audiences
the way that the Lomax's did.

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:45.340
So that's something that
I'm still exploring.

00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:46.640
I mean, I do think that it's there.

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:47.940
And, I mean, I guess the
other thing is that she --

00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:49.240
Allan Lomax kind of came on
the scene just after her,

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:50.540 position:56%
and so she ended up mentoring him
in certain ways, giving him contacts

00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:52.020
for his -- when he went to the
upper Midwest, he got contacts

00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:53.320
from her, and things like that.

00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:54.620
So I'm kind of trying to
tease out her influence --

00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:55.920
and it's very easy to, you
know, over-blow it, obviously,

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:57.220
but I do think it's there, so.

00:46:57.220 --> 00:46:58.520
&gt;&gt; It's a very small question.

00:46:58.520 --> 00:46:59.820

that [inaudible] in relation

00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:25.330
to the music of the 1930s.

00:47:25.330 --> 00:47:26.950

[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:38.690 position:56%
Yes. Well, I mean, this is something
Cathy and I talked about a lot.

00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:43.490
She said in an interview,
"Oh, I, you know,

00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:46.130
wasn't a member of
the Communist Party.

00:48:46.130 --> 00:48:48.570
A lot of my friends were.

00:48:48.570 --> 00:48:51.170
I thought it was sort of
silly the way they thought --

00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:54.390
" you know, she thought
it was kind of naïve.

00:48:54.390 --> 00:49:00.630 position:56%
But we've talked about the fact that
Sidney seems to have kind of set --

00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:05.120
she doesn't come across
as extremely political.

00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:12.930
And she kind of sets herself
apart like as an observer almost.

00:49:12.930 --> 00:49:22.080
So what I can't tell with the labor
songs is how much it was the method

00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:27.540
that the labor activists were
using in terms of using this music

00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:31.320
in this particular way
to change people's minds

00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:36.010
and make them feel united,
versus the actual message of --

00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:37.330
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:49:37.330 --> 00:49:39.490
Yes, exactly; exactly.

00:49:39.490 --> 00:49:42.410
Yes; and in terms of
your blues point, I mean,

00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:45.490
that's something that,
you know, kind of --

00:49:45.490 --> 00:49:48.200
what I was getting
at about this idea

00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:51.870
that the music complicates the
binary that people try to set

00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:55.150
up about, "We're looking at
white music," because it's --

00:49:55.150 --> 00:50:01.810
when you're listening to
the music, you can't pull

00:50:01.810 --> 00:50:03.740
out all of those threads.

00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:08.440
And yes and so I think --

00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:12.290
yes but certainly the issue
of race is one -- it's --

00:50:12.290 --> 00:50:18.300
that I'm going to need to
explore more fully, so.

00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:19.600
Yes.

I know that there are collections
of like labor papers and --

00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:51.510
but I don't know -- it's
a really good question.

00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:57.320

they're even tagged to be able

to find them in the collection here.

00:51:01.230 --> 00:51:04.090
It doesn't seem like
the kind of thing

00:51:04.090 --> 00:51:06.810
that at least the government
collectors were doing.

00:51:06.810 --> 00:51:09.930
I actually don't know
if that's true,

00:51:09.930 --> 00:51:19.410
if the WPA collectors
were doing that as well.

00:51:19.410 --> 00:51:31.870
&gt;&gt; Can I make one more
comment about your remarks

00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:35.340
about the possible
connections [inaudible].

00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:39.210
Of course.

[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:42.700
Yes; right.

00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:48.720
And so yes it's hard to know
with her reminisces also how much

00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:52.700
of things that are interfering --
or not interfering but contributing

00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:55.510
over time that if you asked
her later, you know, I mean,

00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:57.400
that question in an
interview, "Were you a member

00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:00.610
of the Communist Party," you
know, it obviously is going

00:52:00.610 --> 00:52:03.130
to evoke lots of feelings.

00:52:03.130 --> 00:52:07.310
[Laughs] But it does seem that
she had this kind of apolitical --

00:52:07.310 --> 00:52:11.270
even though she was writing for
this very political magazine,

00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:18.850 position:56%
for example, her music columns were
just completely separated from that.

00:52:18.850 --> 00:52:22.160
It was just "Oh, this person came
and they played a lovely Schubert,

00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:23.460
and then they did -- " you know?

00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:29.390
And I don't -- so that's, again,
something that I'm kind of trying

00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:32.830
to like wrap my mind around about.

00:52:32.830 --> 00:52:34.910
Yes.

00:52:34.910 --> 00:53:07.050
&gt;&gt; In working with the 1938 to 1940
[inaudible] Sidney recorded a lot

00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:16.610
of music [inaudible] genocide.

00:53:16.610 --> 00:53:23.830
And then and the songs
are about the genocides.

00:53:23.830 --> 00:53:28.420
She never mentions
in her correspondence

00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:31.610 position:56%
or field notes the fact of the
genocide, or she records [inaudible]

00:53:31.610 --> 00:53:35.780 position:56%
in Fresno in 1939, which is is right
-- Franco is sort of [inaudible].

00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:39.400
And she again somehow says,
"Well, they were very reserved,"

00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:43.320
but doesn't say anything
about [overlapping].

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:44.620
&gt;&gt; Sheryl Kaskowitz: Why; right.

00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:48.980
And I think that's part of
why I was having this question

00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:51.420
about the labor songs, that
it really had to do more

00:53:51.420 --> 00:54:00.360
with the technique than the,
you know -- what would that be,

00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:13.530
the medium more than the message.

00:54:13.530 --> 00:54:29.200
Because she didn't seem to
ardently like follow, you know,

00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:49.490 position:56%
or express strong feelings about
the ideas behind the labor movement.

00:54:49.490 --> 00:55:05.230
She was just really interested in
the way that they were using music.

00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:08.960
&gt;&gt; I had another question.

00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:10.260
&gt;&gt; Sheryl Kaskowitz: Sure.

00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:12.400
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] from the age of 40,

00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:17.460
she was incredibly
protective of the singers.

00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:22.330
Now, this is after more Lomax
had done a lot of her [inaudible]

00:55:22.330 --> 00:55:25.770
and she had already done
the recording [inaudible].

00:55:25.770 --> 00:55:28.450
But she would say on the recordings

00:55:28.450 --> 00:55:33.300
that no commercial use will ever
be made of these recordings.

00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:35.620
And a lot of the recordings
[inaudible] catalogue

00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:40.430
that was created by WPA
workers saying it was scripted,

00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:45.170
but perfectly in her
[inaudible] and it was scripted.

00:55:45.170 --> 00:55:47.280 position:56%
And some of that I think contributed

00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:50.590
to people not knowing
as much about her work.

00:55:50.590 --> 00:55:56.090 position:56%
I wonder in that earlier theory, did
you find that she was protective?

00:55:56.090 --> 00:56:01.440
I think -- didn't Charles Seeger
go and play some records of hers

00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:04.890
without asking her at the White
House and she was sort of incensed

00:56:04.890 --> 00:56:06.980
that -- so I just wondered --

00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:08.280
&gt;&gt; Sheryl Kaskowitz: Yes.

00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:12.430
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] from that earlier
period that she had that sense

00:56:12.430 --> 00:56:15.500
that she'd better protect this
from these [overlapping] --

00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:20.830
&gt;&gt; Sheryl Kaskowitz: Yes; she
definitely talks about that,

00:56:20.830 --> 00:56:25.500
and that wasn't something
I included in this talk.

00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:28.710
But she -- there is a lot of back
and forth about just how to deal

00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:30.010
with the ethics of collecting.

00:56:30.010 --> 00:56:31.310
And I think that she definitely
fell on the side of privacy, or,

00:56:31.310 --> 00:56:32.610
you know, I think that the
government really did not want

00:56:32.610 --> 00:56:33.910
to look like they were
exploiting people, right,

00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:35.210
if they recorded these
songs, you know,

00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:36.510
like the early recording
companies were going and doing,

00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:37.810
and recording songs and
then making lots of money.

00:56:37.810 --> 00:56:39.120 position:56%
So I think that that definitely had
to do with why she's not well-known,

00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:40.420
and why her singers
aren't more well-known.

00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:41.720
Because -- I mean, you heard --

00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:43.020
I don't know if the sound quality
was bad, but in that announcement

00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:44.320
that she made on almost every
recording, she would say, you know,

00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:45.620
it's not for commercial use.

00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:46.920
And I think that was developed by
the Resettlement Administration

00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:48.220 position:56%
as a way to show, you know, we're
not making money on this and -- yes.

00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:49.520
So but it is something
that it's really --

00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:50.820
and it changed over
the course of her life.

00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:52.120
She got into fights with Alan
Lomax much later and she wrote,

00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:53.420
saying like, "Is there any way

00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:54.720
that I can copyright the
songs that I recorded."

00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:56.020
And so I think that she kind
of went through -- yes some --

00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:57.320
I don't think she ever had like
a clear idea of her vision of it,

00:56:57.320 --> 00:56:58.620
but she certainly was
more protective

00:56:58.620 --> 00:56:59.920
and more private about
her collections.

00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:01.220
So do we have time
for one last question?

00:57:01.220 --> 00:57:03.020
Sure.

00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:22.400

00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:26.430
Yes; I mean -- yes and
certainly it was --

00:57:26.430 --> 00:57:29.210
I think that was part of what
the collectors were struggling

00:57:29.210 --> 00:57:32.810
with was once you had something
recorded, what did that mean?

00:57:32.810 --> 00:57:34.230
You captured it in one way,

00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:37.010
but it couldn't really be
captured in other ways.

00:57:37.010 --> 00:57:38.310

00:57:38.310 --> 00:57:39.610
Yes, exactly.

00:57:39.610 --> 00:57:42.260
And, you know, I mean, that's
the folk tradition, so.

00:57:42.260 --> 00:57:45.590
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Folks, I think
we're going to have to wrap it up.

00:57:45.590 --> 00:57:48.760
And I want to thank
everybody for their patience

most especially you, Sheryl.

[Laughs] Thank you.

00:57:56.020 --> 00:57:59.300
