00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.035
ERDEM INAN: Peak Games
was founded in 2010.

00:00:08.035 --> 00:00:11.320
Our aim is to create
global technology products

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.170
and reach millions of users.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.370
We're based in Istanbul, so
we started targeting Turkey.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.430
But very quickly, we expanded
into other countries.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.050
We take the classic game
experience and migrate it

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.910
to mobile, creating a
very socially dynamic,

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.360
interactive, community-driven
game so that people can

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.360
socialize, have a fun time,
send each other gifts,

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.130
chat in a digital environment.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.390
Additional to that, we
also build casual games--

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.310
the level-based tapping,
swiping, matching type

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:41.840
of games.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.860
Our aim is to scale
up all of our games,

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.530
specifically in
their target markets,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.700
and be a reputable
player globally.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.520
Android is our priority
mobile platform.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.480
Currently, we have 65k
of installs every day

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.040
from Android.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.300
For Spades Plus, for example,
we have more than 70%

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.820
of our mobile revenue coming
from the Android platform.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.580
Most of our games are
dependent on scale.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.980
They get more fun when
we have people chatting,

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.600
gifting each other.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.400
And getting more
users in Android

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.210
is a lot easier than any
other mobile platform.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.970
Its dynamic structure, its
flexible, fast iteration cycles

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.020
allow us to quickly
fix something

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.380
if something is not going well.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.210
This gives us a
lot of flexibility,

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.370
because most of
our classic games

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.615
depend heavily on
user experience.

00:01:29.615 --> 00:01:31.240
ILKIN ULAS BALKANAY:
Google Play staged

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.950
rollout helps us fix critical
marks before the game is

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.540
downloaded by
millions of players.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.080
After adding new
features to our games,

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.700
we release the update
to 5% of our users.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.355
Then we monitor
the user feedback.

00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:48.420
And if everything is OK,
we increase the percentage,

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.662
and make the game visible
to all of our players.

00:01:52.662 --> 00:01:54.370
ERDEM INAN: We've seen
that the app store

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.950
images can change the conversion
of an app up to 20-30%.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.940
And we've also seen that short
description, long description,

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.970
all have an effect
on your conversion.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.639
And even a 5% increase
in our conversion

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:08.514
corresponds greatly to
our cost per installs,

00:02:08.514 --> 00:02:10.949
to our marketing
ROI, and eventually

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.145
to the size of the game.

00:02:13.145 --> 00:02:14.853
Android has been super
helpful in growing

00:02:14.853 --> 00:02:16.680
in the international markets.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.120
We've seen that the user
acquisition was easier,

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.880
and it's massive in scale.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.270
There a lot of
companies that you

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.300
can work with in terms
of user acquisition.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.760
Average cost per
acquisition in Android

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.250
has been around
30-40% lower than

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.130
the other mobile platforms.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.905
And adverts is our strongest
source of acquisitions.

00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:38.410
It's connected to all
other Google products.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.760
That allows us a
greater visibility

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.140
on how we're performing.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.690
These type of things create
a long-lasting business

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.630
for Peak Games.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.250
And for the last
three years, we're

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.540
mostly focusing on Western
Europe and North America,

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.250
and trying to grow our games
in international markets,

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.120
because that's where we
believe our future is lying in.
