00:00:00.083 --> 00:00:01.919
So, me and the whole
bridal party

00:00:01.919 --> 00:00:03.629
were roommates freshman year,

00:00:04.296 --> 00:00:07.257
and everyone said I was going to
be the first one to get married.

00:00:07.257 --> 00:00:09.801
And now I'm the only one
who's not, which is crazy.

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:13.096
It's crazy.

00:00:22.064 --> 00:00:25.651
Please stop. Please stop.
I can't do this anymore.

00:00:26.318 --> 00:00:27.819
There's more than
one type of Latino.

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:29.404
And I'm not going to fulfill
some stereotype

00:00:29.404 --> 00:00:31.740
just to make somebody happy.
I'm sorry.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.700
Hey, man, aren't you
the jaguar from Narcos?

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.452
Oh yes, I am.

00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:37.204
Don't lie to me.

00:00:37.204 --> 00:00:39.081
Sex is a very
important decision.

00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:40.958
How are you defining sex?

00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:43.293
What if there's two men
or two women?

00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:46.171
How would you define sex with
multiple simultaneous partners,

00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:48.924
or what if somebody's undergone
genital reconstruction

00:00:48.924 --> 00:00:50.592
or is intersex?

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.888
He is just so, "Mm,"
and you're more like,

00:00:55.514 --> 00:00:58.100
"Mm," you know?
Does that make sense?

00:00:58.642 --> 00:01:00.310
Am I delicate?

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.396
You just decanted white wine.

00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:04.106
It needs to breathe.

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.945
Back in the day, ese,
we had to call people like this.

00:01:13.699 --> 00:01:16.285
Damn. That's what's up.

00:01:16.285 --> 00:01:18.745
Hey,

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:38.307
What do you say to that?

00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:44.479
Hey, get back here.
I'm not done. I'm not.

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.189
Did I say I was
done?
