 [Funny Music] 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.640
 Rodriguez: Since my childhood 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.240
 I always wanted to invent something 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.800
 Has an impact on millions of people. 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.360
 Through user-targeted technology, 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.600
 We see this achievable. 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.600
 We can design great games 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.200
 Attract children and help them develop their intelligence 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.520
 And develop their skills every day. 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.760
 Our company consists of a small team working in 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.440
 The field of games ten years ago. 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.000
 Our vision is to be a global company 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.600
 Since we started our business. 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.840
 The idea of ​​the first application appeared when 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.200
 My niece asked me to apply the sounds of the animals. 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.880
 Everything in the market was full of ads. 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.400
 I shared my suggestion with the Panel that 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.480
 We design our application for animal sounds, 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.360
 But without ads. 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.880
 When we launch the application, 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.640
 We started receiving thousands of downloads every day. 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.320
 As the first application to be launched, it was only in three languages. 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.160
 But then, at the Google Learning Center, 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.760
 People from around the world use the app. 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.400
 We decided to translate the application into as many languages ​​as possible. 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.520
 Our team consists of four members here in Argentina 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.360
 We were working to establish the initial part of the projects. 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.880
 But when we realized from the beginning 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.000
 That we create a large and very strong team, 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 We started to recruit people from all over the world 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.720
 To cooperate with us in the tasks of voice translation, translation of languages, 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.920
 And interpretation. 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.800
 In about two months, 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.640
 We have released the application into 15 languages, 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.520
 Our purchases have increased 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.720
 By 300% in just 12 months. 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.400
 Balloon: In order to reach the universal, 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.000
 You should have a conception of all cultural aspects. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.560
 In our Animal Sounds product, 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.800
 We offer pig, 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.880
 In some specific countries, 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.000
 Users asked us to remove the animal from the game. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.840
 After removing the animal specifically for those countries, 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.280
 Our average rating has changed from 3.9 stars to 4.2 stars, 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.120
 The result for us was really amazing. 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.480
 Evaluations in the audit section are an effective tool. 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.960
 In order to learn from your users forum, 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.080
 We respond to them in the language of the original users 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.920
 With the help of Google Translator. 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.760
 As a result, we have seen a significant improvement 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.760
 In user ratings. 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.680
 In fact, all are 4.4 stars or higher 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.640
 in the middle. 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.720
 Rodriguez: Share more apps in the Google Play store 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.720
 Is great for us, 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.040
 So we can reach millions of people 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.720
 Every month in different countries 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.200
 In different languages. 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.520
 We have recently begun work on translation of applications. 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.080
 Prices are also of paramount importance. 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.920
 Since we started, we have seen a 20% increase in our earnings. 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.440
 Balloon: We realize that Papumba is like a bridge 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.680
 Which connects children, parents and teachers. 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.400
 All our products carry their design 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.960
 The idea of ​​enhancing the capabilities of our young users, 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.000
 It is very exciting to design a new product 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 We know it will make a difference 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.160
 In many families and homes from all over the world 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.600
 In order to prepare the future generation of adults in the best possible way. 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.400
