Hi. I would just like to respond to some of
the comments that have come back here. Obviously

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:11.539
people agree with what I'm saying. We had
a very good sports session this morning. The

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:20.340
general consensus actually values their own
sport coupled with combined action from industry

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.630
and government could make a major difference
here. The values of sport are really, really

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.910
important. I think we've established that
and shown that through The Homeless World

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:36.890
Cup. The impact it can make in the lives of
some of those deprived people living in the

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:45.280
most destitute prevent. So very, very much
on the same things, coming back to and see

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.610
that general consensus, it almost seems like
a no brainer. So my real point now is, ok

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.820
no one seems to know greater. Why aren't we
all coming together right now? Sitting down

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.990
and saying ok let's get something together
to do right now.. And if Obama is saying,

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:09.760
we want to pour money into public expenditure,
as a result of getting us out of this situation.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:18.409
Mind you a significant amount of that would
be spent on sports. Competing countries, building

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:27.859
places to play, not thinking of sport places.
Be very, very creative. I think India is the

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:33.789
answer and coming out the other side will
be a value space against society based on

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:41.020
the values of sport. Hand played, fair played
and you certainly could make a difference

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.500
in the world.
