00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.830
Here's a picture of the seat heater control in

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.700
my car. When I push the control, it prompts

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.540
the highest temperature. And then I can push again

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.705
to lower the temperature. This design is confusing to

00:00:12.705 --> 00:00:14.780
me because this is not in alignment with my

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.700
conceptual model of how temperature controls should work. Most

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.300
temperature controls I've encountered start with the lowest temperature.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.730
And then move to the highest temperature. I wonder

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.440
why the designer designed it this way. What

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.660
would your guess be? For the example of

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.340
understandable design, here's my iPhone's text messaging feature.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.530
The design is pretty straight forward. The interface guides

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.890
me through entering texts into the two required

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.370
fields. And then once complete, the Send button

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.740
is activated. It's hard to make a mistake

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.140
here, in large part because it's easy to discover

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.330
what to do, and because of the excellent feedback

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.890
provided during interaction. That said, there's usually always room for

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.730
improvement in design. How could this design be improved.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.980
And now back to Dawn with examples in the world.
