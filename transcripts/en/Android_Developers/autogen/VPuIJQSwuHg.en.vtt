absolutely so and of course they do also

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:21.760
absolutely so and of course they do also

have a menu button down and this is the
 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:24.690
have a menu button down and this is the
confusing thing because they have

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:24.700
confusing thing because they have
 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.970
confusing thing because they have
something which looks a lot like an

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:26.980
something which looks a lot like an
 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.860
something which looks a lot like an
action bar which has a menu button and

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870
action bar which has a menu button and
 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.810
action bar which has a menu button and
if you click that you do get an overflow

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:30.820
if you click that you do get an overflow
 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.060
if you click that you do get an overflow
menu but and so they've done this thing

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.070
menu but and so they've done this thing
 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.680
menu but and so they've done this thing
where you've still got the menu button

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:34.690
where you've still got the menu button
 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.300
where you've still got the menu button
and that brings up you know I wonder if

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310
and that brings up you know I wonder if
 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:37.200
and that brings up you know I wonder if
there I wonder if they're using

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.210
there I wonder if they're using
 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:38.970
there I wonder if they're using
something like actionbarsherlock and

API level is 15 yeah and we had

00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:54.789
API level is 15 yeah and we had
 

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:57.210
API level is 15 yeah and we had
originally said 11 okay yeah to make

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:57.220
originally said 11 okay yeah to make
 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.520
originally said 11 okay yeah to make
sure it's up to it yeah 14 but let's

00:06:59.520 --> 00:06:59.530
sure it's up to it yeah 14 but let's
 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.369
sure it's up to it yeah 14 but let's
make it 15 and just be safe mm-hmm so

00:07:02.369 --> 00:07:02.379
make it 15 and just be safe mm-hmm so
 

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:03.450
make it 15 and just be safe mm-hmm so
that's one thing you can get rid of that

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:03.460
that's one thing you can get rid of that
 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.879
that's one thing you can get rid of that
really easily because it'll come back on

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:05.889
really easily because it'll come back on
 

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:08.850
really easily because it'll come back on

okay so the other call out that I wanted

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:14.470
okay so the other call out that I wanted
 

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:16.170
okay so the other call out that I wanted
to mention here is that they have

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:16.180
to mention here is that they have
 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.339
to mention here is that they have
implemented the drawer pattern i'm

00:07:17.339 --> 00:07:17.349
implemented the drawer pattern i'm
 

00:07:17.349 --> 00:07:18.480
implemented the drawer pattern i'm
pretty sure they're aware that this

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:18.490
pretty sure they're aware that this
 

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.129
pretty sure they're aware that this
isn't quite the right drawer pattern but

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:20.139
isn't quite the right drawer pattern but
 

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:21.659
isn't quite the right drawer pattern but
i wanted to put it out there for other

00:07:21.659 --> 00:07:21.669
i wanted to put it out there for other
 

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:23.580
i wanted to put it out there for other
people who may be watching yeah this is

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:23.590
people who may be watching yeah this is
 

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.309
people who may be watching yeah this is
calling sort of that prototype G+ model

00:07:26.309 --> 00:07:26.319
calling sort of that prototype G+ model
 

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:28.709
calling sort of that prototype G+ model
where the action bar all shifts across

00:07:28.709 --> 00:07:28.719
where the action bar all shifts across
 

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:30.300
where the action bar all shifts across
and you can see that here so

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:30.310
and you can see that here so
 

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.369
and you can see that here so
everything's moved across the right

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:32.379
everything's moved across the right
 

00:07:32.379 --> 00:07:33.689
everything's moved across the right
model is actually the way youtube

00:07:33.689 --> 00:07:33.699
model is actually the way youtube
 

00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:35.459
model is actually the way youtube
doesn't which is that your action bar is

00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:35.469
doesn't which is that your action bar is
 

00:07:35.469 --> 00:07:38.520
doesn't which is that your action bar is
is consistent so all the all the stuff

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:38.530
is consistent so all the all the stuff
 

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:39.899
is consistent so all the all the stuff
here along your action bar they should

00:07:39.899 --> 00:07:39.909
here along your action bar they should
 

00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:42.600
here along your action bar they should
stay here no matter what and rather have

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:42.610
stay here no matter what and rather have
 

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:44.279
stay here no matter what and rather have
than having sort of a drawer icon you

00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:44.289
than having sort of a drawer icon you
 

00:07:44.289 --> 00:07:46.350
than having sort of a drawer icon you
would have your application icon or logo

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:46.360
would have your application icon or logo
 

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.330
would have your application icon or logo
with an upper fords and so they're

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:48.340
with an upper fords and so they're
 

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.070
with an upper fords and so they're
clicking that will then leave everything

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.080
clicking that will then leave everything
 

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.749
clicking that will then leave everything
here as it is and then just have this

00:07:51.749 --> 00:07:51.759
here as it is and then just have this
 

00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:54.300
here as it is and then just have this
side part here slide-out so in the same

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:54.310
side part here slide-out so in the same
 

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:55.680
side part here slide-out so in the same
way but still having the action bar

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:55.690
way but still having the action bar
 

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:58.469
way but still having the action bar
along the top and I think you know so

00:07:58.469 --> 00:07:58.479
along the top and I think you know so
 

00:07:58.479 --> 00:07:59.550
along the top and I think you know so
that's that's kind of the right way to

00:07:59.550 --> 00:07:59.560
that's that's kind of the right way to
 

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.080
that's that's kind of the right way to
do it that's all listed in the design

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:01.090
do it that's all listed in the design
 

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:03.390
do it that's all listed in the design
patterns on Android design yeah and

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:03.400
patterns on Android design yeah and
 

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.890
patterns on Android design yeah and
again it's not that these guys got it

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:04.900
again it's not that these guys got it
 

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.140
again it's not that these guys got it
wrong it's that there wasn't a design

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:07.150
wrong it's that there wasn't a design
 

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:08.670
wrong it's that there wasn't a design
pattern and now there is if they

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:08.680
pattern and now there is if they
 

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.680
pattern and now there is if they
followed an example which turns out we

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:10.690
followed an example which turns out we
 

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:12.240
followed an example which turns out we
decided wasn't quite the right example

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:12.250
decided wasn't quite the right example
 

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.100
decided wasn't quite the right example
all right so now I'll tell you this is

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:14.110
all right so now I'll tell you this is
 

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:15.990
all right so now I'll tell you this is
driving me crazy because I tell you so

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.000
driving me crazy because I tell you so
 

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.820
driving me crazy because I tell you so

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:45.920
basically it's a combination of a few
different kinds of camera ads so you can

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:45.930
different kinds of camera ads so you can
 

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.280
different kinds of camera ads so you can
take your photos and ye hipster filters

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:48.290
take your photos and ye hipster filters
 

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:51.080
take your photos and ye hipster filters
excuse me which we will do once again

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:51.090
excuse me which we will do once again
 

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:55.780
excuse me which we will do once again
let's try and get let's get down

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:55.790
 

00:13:55.790 --> 00:14:00.440
there we go very nice so you can take

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:00.450
there we go very nice so you can take
 

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:03.019
there we go very nice so you can take
your photos and apply your hipster

00:14:03.019 --> 00:14:03.029
your photos and apply your hipster
 

00:14:03.029 --> 00:14:04.730
your photos and apply your hipster
filters as you would as you would

filters as you would as you would
 

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.019

selection of you know different standard

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:08.910
selection of you know different standard
 

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:10.100
selection of you know different standard
things and you can actually do quite a

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:10.110
things and you can actually do quite a
 

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:12.410
things and you can actually do quite a
lot here in terms of applying different

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:12.420
lot here in terms of applying different
 

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:16.010
lot here in terms of applying different
kinds of presets eventually maybe it

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:16.020
kinds of presets eventually maybe it
 

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:17.210
kinds of presets eventually maybe it
does seem to be taking a long time but I

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:17.220
does seem to be taking a long time but I
 

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.310
does seem to be taking a long time but I
do like there there little rotating

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:19.320
do like there there little rotating
 

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.560
do like there there little rotating

you know i know we harp on this a lot

00:14:30.769 --> 00:14:30.779
you know i know we harp on this a lot
 

00:14:30.779 --> 00:14:32.150
you know i know we harp on this a lot
but we get this question a lot you know

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160
but we get this question a lot you know
 

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.370
but we get this question a lot you know
people will bring us an app that uses

the way our designers like it and I

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:45.630
the way our designers like it and I
 

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:46.730

think that's not really cool let me

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:46.740
think that's not really cool let me
 

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.980
think that's not really cool let me
first off is not Android but second off

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:48.990
first off is not Android but second off
 

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:51.050

it's not yours it's somebody else's

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:51.060
it's not yours it's somebody else's
 

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.000
it's not yours it's somebody else's
stuff that's right but when you take

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:53.010
stuff that's right but when you take
 

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:55.610
stuff that's right but when you take
something that Android provides and then

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:55.620
something that Android provides and then
 

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:57.199
something that Android provides and then
make it completely your so it works

00:14:57.199 --> 00:14:57.209
make it completely your so it works
 

00:14:57.209 --> 00:14:59.120
make it completely your so it works
exactly the same has a little cycling

00:14:59.120 --> 00:14:59.130
exactly the same has a little cycling
 

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:01.370
exactly the same has a little cycling
mmm color so you know what's going on

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:01.380
mmm color so you know what's going on
 

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:04.670
mmm color so you know what's going on
but has your branding in it I think

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:04.680
but has your branding in it I think
 

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.650
but has your branding in it I think
that's great I wish that more apps would

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:06.660
that's great I wish that more apps would
 

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:07.850
that's great I wish that more apps would
do that so and then you get the

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:07.860
do that so and then you get the
 

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:09.170
do that so and then you get the
advantage of having that consistency

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:09.180
advantage of having that consistency
 

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.060
advantage of having that consistency
across all the versions of your app and

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:11.070
across all the versions of your app and
 

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:13.250
across all the versions of your app and
everything else now we also have the

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:13.260
everything else now we also have the
 

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.949
everything else now we also have the
very consistent to yet this should be a

00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:15.959
very consistent to yet this should be a
 

00:15:15.959 --> 00:15:17.750
very consistent to yet this should be a
built in control right now the hitters

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:17.760
built in control right now the hitters
 

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.630
built in control right now the hitters
drip I mean they've actually got like a

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:20.640
drip I mean they've actually got like a
 

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:21.829
drip I mean they've actually got like a
bunch of different ones so they've got

00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839
bunch of different ones so they've got
 

00:15:21.839 --> 00:15:23.120
bunch of different ones so they've got
the standard effects that you're

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:23.130
the standard effects that you're
 

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:24.620
the standard effects that you're
applying there and you can you could

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:24.630
applying there and you can you could
 

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:27.410
applying there and you can you could
actually modify the degree of each of

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:27.420
actually modify the degree of each of
 

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:31.370
actually modify the degree of each of
these which is nice as well see apply

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:31.380
these which is nice as well see apply
 

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.590
these which is nice as well see apply
that and I think you can then go through

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600
that and I think you can then go through
 

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.000
that and I think you can then go through
and apply a bunch of different kinds of

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:35.010
and apply a bunch of different kinds of
 

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:36.440
and apply a bunch of different kinds of
filters so they've got the distortion

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:36.450
filters so they've got the distortion
 

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:38.660
filters so they've got the distortion
filters they've got you know all any of

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:38.670
filters they've got you know all any of
 

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:39.590
filters they've got you know all any of
those different things I think it's

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:39.600
those different things I think it's
 

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.300
those different things I think it's
really interesting that compared to so

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:41.310
really interesting that compared to so
 

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:43.430
really interesting that compared to so
many other apps or looked odds this app

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:43.440
many other apps or looked odds this app
 

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.530
many other apps or looked odds this app
is really slow mmm at applying filters

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:45.540
is really slow mmm at applying filters
 

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:47.960
is really slow mmm at applying filters
and I wonder if it's because they're not

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:47.970
and I wonder if it's because they're not
 

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:51.470
and I wonder if it's because they're not
taking advantage of acceleration in in

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:51.480
taking advantage of acceleration in in
 

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.990
taking advantage of acceleration in in
android especially in honeycomb and

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.000
android especially in honeycomb and
 

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.900
android especially in honeycomb and
above you can use renderscript or you

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:56.910
above you can use renderscript or you
 

00:15:56.910 --> 00:16:00.710
above you can use renderscript or you
can use the GPU to accelerate this sort

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720
can use the GPU to accelerate this sort
 

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.600
can use the GPU to accelerate this sort
of thing this is most of these filters

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:02.610
of thing this is most of these filters
 

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:04.310
of thing this is most of these filters
just boil down to convolutions of one

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:04.320
just boil down to convolutions of one
 

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:07.340
just boil down to convolutions of one
kind or another so you can I and Java is

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:07.350
kind or another so you can I and Java is
 

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:07.890
kind or another so you can I and Java is
just not

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:07.900
just not
 

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.600
just not
go to convolutions at all its memory

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:09.610
go to convolutions at all its memory
 

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:11.520
go to convolutions at all its memory
layout is wrong it doesn't have access

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:11.530
layout is wrong it doesn't have access
 

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:15.740
layout is wrong it doesn't have access
to simdi floating point instructions I

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:15.750
to simdi floating point instructions I
 

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:18.990
to simdi floating point instructions I
don't even think it has access to

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:19.000
don't even think it has access to
 

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.310
don't even think it has access to
non-strict floating point instructions

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:20.320
non-strict floating point instructions
 

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.080

all sorts of performance problems so you

really really really don't want to write
 

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:33.150
really really really don't want to write

your your filter code in Java or even in
 

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.890
your your filter code in Java or even in
just generic C++ you really want to be

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:34.900
just generic C++ you really want to be

of things now personally I would kind of

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:52.600
of things now personally I would kind of
 

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.420

prefer if it just did something sensible

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:54.430
prefer if it just did something sensible

by default maybe save it to the SD card

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:56.230
by default maybe save it to the SD card
 

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:58.530
by default maybe save it to the SD card
and then take me back to a page where it

00:16:58.530 --> 00:16:58.540
and then take me back to a page where it
 

00:16:58.540 --> 00:16:59.850
and then take me back to a page where it
just displays all the things that I've

00:16:59.850 --> 00:16:59.860
just displays all the things that I've

but we're still seeing a reasonable

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:11.860
but we're still seeing a reasonable
 

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:13.440
but we're still seeing a reasonable
amount of time taken to load each of the

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:13.450
amount of time taken to load each of the
 

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:15.270
amount of time taken to load each of the
pictures here well it's tough to they

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:15.280
pictures here well it's tough to they
 

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.620
pictures here well it's tough to they
get around that right because we've

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:16.630
get around that right because we've
 

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:18.450
get around that right because we've
gotten we've got network latency we've

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:18.460
gotten we've got network latency we've
 

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:19.970
gotten we've got network latency we've
got the decoding

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:19.980
got the decoding
 

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.220
got the decoding
you know these are probably not small

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:22.230
you know these are probably not small
 

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:24.500
you know these are probably not small
bitmaps and that's out of the question

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:24.510
bitmaps and that's out of the question
 

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:27.200
bitmaps and that's out of the question
here is like you know and and you can

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:27.210
here is like you know and and you can
 

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:28.970
here is like you know and and you can
see actually once what's things end up

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:28.980
see actually once what's things end up
 

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:30.830
see actually once what's things end up
in cash yes keeping it in which is nice

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:30.840
in cash yes keeping it in which is nice
 

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:34.100
in cash yes keeping it in which is nice
I I think that of of the apps i've

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:34.110
I I think that of of the apps i've
 

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:36.049
I I think that of of the apps i've
looked at these these guys are doing

00:20:36.049 --> 00:20:36.059
looked at these these guys are doing
 

00:20:36.059 --> 00:20:39.370
looked at these these guys are doing
exactly the right thing I mean you can't

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:39.380
exactly the right thing I mean you can't
 

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:41.750
exactly the right thing I mean you can't
you can't you know overcome the laws of

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760
you can't you know overcome the laws of
 

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.810
you can't you know overcome the laws of
physics but really are you just not

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:44.820
physics but really are you just not
 

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:47.450
physics but really are you just not
trying hard enough yeah well they're

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:47.460
trying hard enough yeah well they're
 

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:49.159
trying hard enough yeah well they're
they're trying pretty hard actually um

00:20:49.159 --> 00:20:49.169
they're trying pretty hard actually um
 

00:20:49.169 --> 00:20:51.830
they're trying pretty hard actually um
this does feel pretty good it's very

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:51.840
this does feel pretty good it's very
 

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.260
this does feel pretty good it's very
hard to see on on the video on YouTube

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:54.270
hard to see on on the video on YouTube
 

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:56.960
hard to see on on the video on YouTube
but this is an extremely smooth

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:56.970
but this is an extremely smooth
 

00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:59.450
but this is an extremely smooth
scrolling experience the flinging feels

00:20:59.450 --> 00:20:59.460
scrolling experience the flinging feels
 

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:01.610
scrolling experience the flinging feels
just right so the rock physics it's yeah

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:01.620
just right so the rock physics it's yeah
 

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:07.669
just right so the rock physics it's yeah
it's all good so yeah Bravo you click

00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:07.679
it's all good so yeah Bravo you click
 

00:21:07.679 --> 00:21:09.110
it's all good so yeah Bravo you click
through and so this is a good experience

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120
through and so this is a good experience
 

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.120
through and so this is a good experience
you know you're swiping Swiper left ride

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:11.130
you know you're swiping Swiper left ride
 

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:12.530
you know you're swiping Swiper left ride
you can see here the physics are right

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:12.540
you can see here the physics are right
 

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:14.450
you can see here the physics are right
it's it's moving at the same speed as my

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:14.460
it's it's moving at the same speed as my
 

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:15.799
it's it's moving at the same speed as my
finger but then I can just do a quick

00:21:15.799 --> 00:21:15.809
finger but then I can just do a quick
 

00:21:15.809 --> 00:21:18.530
finger but then I can just do a quick
flick and it it feels about right so

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:18.540
flick and it it feels about right so
 

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:20.900
flick and it it feels about right so
that's done a good job and they've got

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:20.910
that's done a good job and they've got
 

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:23.840
that's done a good job and they've got
the the pinch to zoom and then it's

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:23.850
the the pinch to zoom and then it's
 

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:25.669
the the pinch to zoom and then it's
always an interesting question what do

00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679
always an interesting question what do
 

00:21:25.679 --> 00:21:27.650
always an interesting question what do
you do once you've pinch-to-zoom get to

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:27.660
you do once you've pinch-to-zoom get to
 

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.840
you do once you've pinch-to-zoom get to
the edge um but this seems fine I like

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:29.850
the edge um but this seems fine I like
 

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:31.610
the edge um but this seems fine I like
that yeah I got here once I get to the

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:31.620
that yeah I got here once I get to the
 

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:33.260
that yeah I got here once I get to the
edge of the picture as long as I'm able

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:33.270
edge of the picture as long as I'm able
 

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:35.870
edge of the picture as long as I'm able
to take it back and undo my swipe across

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:35.880
to take it back and undo my swipe across
 

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.370
to take it back and undo my swipe across
I think that's the right approach I'm

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:37.380
I think that's the right approach I'm
 

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:38.270
I think that's the right approach I'm
actually wondering if there's any

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:38.280
actually wondering if there's any
 

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.770
actually wondering if there's any
chances these guys were actually using

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:39.780
chances these guys were actually using
 

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:41.630
chances these guys were actually using
danielle pans library because it does

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:41.640
danielle pans library because it does
 

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.690
danielle pans library because it does
exactly this as possible days or maybe

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:44.700
exactly this as possible days or maybe
 

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:46.370
exactly this as possible days or maybe
seeing this and used it as a basis quite

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:46.380
seeing this and used it as a basis quite
 

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.950
seeing this and used it as a basis quite
possibly yeah yeah yeah I think that

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960
possibly yeah yeah yeah I think that
 

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.750
possibly yeah yeah yeah I think that
these guys are doing everything right as

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:50.760
these guys are doing everything right as
 

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.390
these guys are doing everything right as
far as yeah the physics there a little

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400
far as yeah the physics there a little
 

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.460
far as yeah the physics there a little
bit it's a little funny once you're a

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:55.470
bit it's a little funny once you're a
 

00:21:55.470 --> 00:22:00.200
bit it's a little funny once you're a
bouncing home it's too much fun for this

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:00.210
bouncing home it's too much fun for this
 

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:02.960
bouncing home it's too much fun for this
time of day and again we've kind of got

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:02.970
time of day and again we've kind of got
 

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:05.140
time of day and again we've kind of got
the this is interesting so now we've got

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:05.150
the this is interesting so now we've got
 

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:07.520
the this is interesting so now we've got
the the menu button on the action bar

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:07.530
the the menu button on the action bar
 

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:09.890
the the menu button on the action bar
here but they've still got the legacy

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:09.900
here but they've still got the legacy
 

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:10.909
here but they've still got the legacy
button down here and that does

00:22:10.909 --> 00:22:10.919
button down here and that does
 

00:22:10.919 --> 00:22:12.289
button down here and that does
absolutely nothing so that's now

00:22:12.289 --> 00:22:12.299
absolutely nothing so that's now
 

00:22:12.299 --> 00:22:14.900
absolutely nothing so that's now
confusing because it's ambiguous yeah

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:14.910
confusing because it's ambiguous yeah
 

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:16.490
confusing because it's ambiguous yeah
you know so at the very least I mean

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:16.500
you know so at the very least I mean
 

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:17.870
you know so at the very least I mean
really the right solution here is get

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:17.880
really the right solution here is get
 

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:19.760
really the right solution here is get
rid of this I'll set your target SDK to

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:19.770
rid of this I'll set your target SDK to
 

00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:24.049
rid of this I'll set your target SDK to
15 you know at the very 16 now yeah

00:22:24.049 --> 00:22:24.059
15 you know at the very 16 now yeah
 

00:22:24.059 --> 00:22:25.310
15 you know at the very 16 now yeah
exactly should always be the latest

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:25.320
exactly should always be the latest
 

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.539
exactly should always be the latest
version that's a good tip for you guys

00:22:26.539 --> 00:22:26.549
version that's a good tip for you guys
 

00:22:26.549 --> 00:22:29.039
version that's a good tip for you guys
as well as always talk with the latest

00:22:29.039 --> 00:22:29.049
as well as always talk with the latest
 

00:22:29.049 --> 00:22:31.649
as well as always talk with the latest
k there's really no reason not to avoid

00:22:31.649 --> 00:22:31.659
k there's really no reason not to avoid
 

00:22:31.659 --> 00:22:33.810
k there's really no reason not to avoid
right the only possible reason not to is

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:33.820
right the only possible reason not to is
 

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.210
right the only possible reason not to is
if you have no confidence that your app

00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:36.220
if you have no confidence that your app
 

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:37.979
if you have no confidence that your app
works on the latest SDK and you're

00:22:37.979 --> 00:22:37.989
works on the latest SDK and you're
 

00:22:37.989 --> 00:22:42.330
works on the latest SDK and you're
unable to test on any new device or new

unable to test on any new device or new
 

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:45.210
unable to test on any new device or new
emulator so I would have sympathy with

supported recently um and it's still a

00:22:53.159 --> 00:22:53.169
supported recently um and it's still a
 

00:22:53.169 --> 00:22:56.430
supported recently um and it's still a
little buggy but in general you're you I

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:56.440
little buggy but in general you're you I
 

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.320
little buggy but in general you're you I
should should support the latest SDK

00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:58.330
should should support the latest SDK
 

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:00.479
should should support the latest SDK
yeah alright so let's let's jump out of

00:23:00.479 --> 00:23:00.489
yeah alright so let's let's jump out of
 

00:23:00.489 --> 00:23:02.609
yeah alright so let's let's jump out of
this because not actually show how much

00:23:02.609 --> 00:23:02.619
this because not actually show how much
 

00:23:02.619 --> 00:23:04.139
this because not actually show how much
time we've spent but let's have a look

00:23:04.139 --> 00:23:04.149
time we've spent but let's have a look
 

00:23:04.149 --> 00:23:06.899
time we've spent but let's have a look
at at glimmer so glimmers a little bit

00:23:06.899 --> 00:23:06.909
at at glimmer so glimmers a little bit
 

00:23:06.909 --> 00:23:08.460
at at glimmer so glimmers a little bit
different this is not your sort of

standard camera replacement app this is

00:23:10.019 --> 00:23:10.029
standard camera replacement app this is
 

00:23:10.029 --> 00:23:14.849
standard camera replacement app this is
actually an app to browse flicker so in

00:23:14.849 --> 00:23:14.859
actually an app to browse flicker so in
 

00:23:14.859 --> 00:23:16.259
actually an app to browse flicker so in
terms of functionality much more

00:23:16.259 --> 00:23:16.269
terms of functionality much more
 

00:23:16.269 --> 00:23:18.389
terms of functionality much more
simplistic here we basically you know

00:23:18.389 --> 00:23:18.399
simplistic here we basically you know
 

00:23:18.399 --> 00:23:20.519
simplistic here we basically you know
you sign into your flickr account and

00:23:20.519 --> 00:23:20.529
you sign into your flickr account and
 

00:23:20.529 --> 00:23:22.409
you sign into your flickr account and
then you can scroll through all the

00:23:22.409 --> 00:23:22.419
then you can scroll through all the
 

00:23:22.419 --> 00:23:24.930
then you can scroll through all the
pictures nice what does Daniel Pham have

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:24.940
pictures nice what does Daniel Pham have
 

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:33.810
pictures nice what does Daniel Pham have
to say about racers oh right oh yeah it

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:33.820
to say about racers oh right oh yeah it
 

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:35.430
to say about racers oh right oh yeah it
looks like you know how to potty yeah

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:35.440
looks like you know how to potty yeah
 

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.739
looks like you know how to potty yeah
that was actually I i/o last year not

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:46.490
full background and then maybe because
there's more text and it's more

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:46.500
there's more text and it's more
 

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.320
there's more text and it's more
important you you know / lane

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:48.330
important you you know / lane
 

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:50.180
important you you know / lane
more of that on top of the text but when

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:50.190
more of that on top of the text but when
 

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:51.799
more of that on top of the text but when
you've got images like you look at the

00:26:51.799 --> 00:26:51.809
you've got images like you look at the
 

00:26:51.809 --> 00:26:53.419
you've got images like you look at the
way magazines work right like the big

00:26:53.419 --> 00:26:53.429
way magazines work right like the big
 

00:26:53.429 --> 00:26:54.889
way magazines work right like the big
advantage of magazines is that you've

00:26:54.889 --> 00:26:54.899
advantage of magazines is that you've
 

00:26:54.899 --> 00:26:57.230
advantage of magazines is that you've
got you know rich color full full color

00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:57.240
got you know rich color full full color
 

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.330
got you know rich color full full color
and adapts like this if you have the

00:26:59.330 --> 00:26:59.340
and adapts like this if you have the
 

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:01.549
and adapts like this if you have the
pictures user because it's awesome yeah

00:27:01.549 --> 00:27:01.559
pictures user because it's awesome yeah
 

00:27:01.559 --> 00:27:04.460
pictures user because it's awesome yeah
so this is looking pretty good we don't

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:04.470
so this is looking pretty good we don't
 

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:05.690
so this is looking pretty good we don't
have the hipster filters to go through

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:05.700
have the hipster filters to go through
 

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:08.149
have the hipster filters to go through
so I think maybe we move on to the to

00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159
so I think maybe we move on to the to
 

00:27:08.159 --> 00:27:09.620
so I think maybe we move on to the to
the next appt the last one which we're

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:09.630
the next appt the last one which we're
 

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:11.720
the next appt the last one which we're
going to look at today we can resume

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:11.730
going to look at today we can resume
 

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:16.130
going to look at today we can resume
resume effects so this is again sort of

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:16.140
resume effects so this is again sort of
 

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:17.870
resume effects so this is again sort of
so this is just your hipster filters and

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:17.880
so this is just your hipster filters and
 

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.850
so this is just your hipster filters and
it's locked into landscape view which we

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:19.860
it's locked into landscape view which we
 

00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:21.830
it's locked into landscape view which we
decided to leave this way to kind of

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:21.840
decided to leave this way to kind of
 

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:23.899
decided to leave this way to kind of
prove a point which is I don't always

00:27:23.899 --> 00:27:23.909
prove a point which is I don't always
 

00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:25.310
prove a point which is I don't always
want to take my photos and landscape

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:25.320
want to take my photos and landscape
 

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:28.190
want to take my photos and landscape
view through so you know your UI

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:28.200
view through so you know your UI
 

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.840
view through so you know your UI
particularly you can see here this is

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:29.850
particularly you can see here this is
 

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:31.759
particularly you can see here this is
basically an entirely a custom camera

00:27:31.759 --> 00:27:31.769
basically an entirely a custom camera
 

00:27:31.769 --> 00:27:33.200
basically an entirely a custom camera
you want they've drawn all about

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:33.210
you want they've drawn all about
 

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:35.180
you want they've drawn all about
themselves right so there's really no

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:35.190
themselves right so there's really no
 

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:38.240
themselves right so there's really no
reason here why they can't rotate the

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:38.250
reason here why they can't rotate the
 

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:40.789
reason here why they can't rotate the
assets right absolutely and even these

00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799
assets right absolutely and even these
 

00:27:40.799 --> 00:27:42.560
assets right absolutely and even these
days like I remember back in the days of

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:42.570
days like I remember back in the days of
 

00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:46.460
days like I remember back in the days of
Android 1.1 you you had to take photos

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:46.470
Android 1.1 you you had to take photos
 

00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:48.860
Android 1.1 you you had to take photos
in landscape mode because there was no

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:48.870
in landscape mode because there was no
 

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:50.210
in landscape mode because there was no
way of knowing what orientation the

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:50.220
way of knowing what orientation the
 

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.879
way of knowing what orientation the
camera was at that's that changed a long

00:27:52.879 --> 00:27:52.889
camera was at that's that changed a long
 

00:27:52.889 --> 00:27:54.409
camera was at that's that changed a long
time ago now so you can actually query

00:27:54.409 --> 00:27:54.419
time ago now so you can actually query
 

00:27:54.419 --> 00:27:55.669
time ago now so you can actually query
the device to find out what the

00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:55.679
the device to find out what the
 

00:27:55.679 --> 00:27:57.799
the device to find out what the
orientation camera is and rotate things

00:27:57.799 --> 00:27:57.809
orientation camera is and rotate things
 

00:27:57.809 --> 00:27:59.389
orientation camera is and rotate things
so that they're sort of in the right

00:27:59.389 --> 00:27:59.399
so that they're sort of in the right
 

00:27:59.399 --> 00:28:02.450
so that they're sort of in the right
aspect ratio perspective it's also worth

00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:02.460
aspect ratio perspective it's also worth
 

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:04.430
aspect ratio perspective it's also worth
asking yourself if you really really

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:04.440
asking yourself if you really really
 

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.820
asking yourself if you really really
need to do a custom camera view because

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:06.830
need to do a custom camera view because
 

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:09.139
need to do a custom camera view because
whenever you duplicate system

00:28:09.139 --> 00:28:09.149
whenever you duplicate system
 

00:28:09.149 --> 00:28:12.110
whenever you duplicate system
functionality you risk looking out of

00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:12.120
functionality you risk looking out of
 

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.750
functionality you risk looking out of
date once the system updates and in

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:14.760
date once the system updates and in
 

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:17.060
date once the system updates and in
particular you're going to miss out on

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:17.070
particular you're going to miss out on
 

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:19.370
particular you're going to miss out on
any brand new functionality that the

00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:19.380
any brand new functionality that the
 

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:22.039
any brand new functionality that the
system gives you now for this you know

00:28:22.039 --> 00:28:22.049
system gives you now for this you know
 

00:28:22.049 --> 00:28:24.220
system gives you now for this you know
maybe maybe they've got some really cool

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:24.230
maybe maybe they've got some really cool
 

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:27.769
maybe maybe they've got some really cool
camera stuff going on the problem is

00:28:27.769 --> 00:28:27.779
camera stuff going on the problem is
 

00:28:27.779 --> 00:28:31.759
camera stuff going on the problem is
that a lot of the coolest camera

00:28:31.759 --> 00:28:31.769
that a lot of the coolest camera

technology in Android is being supplied
 

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:38.880
technology in Android is being supplied
by OEM libraries so

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:38.890
by OEM libraries so
 

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:41.010

you may be missing out on something

00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:41.020
you may be missing out on something
 

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:43.620
you may be missing out on something
really really slick if you completely

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:43.630
really really slick if you completely
 

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:45.900
really really slick if you completely
override the camera it's interesting if

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:45.910
override the camera it's interesting if
 

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:47.370
override the camera it's interesting if
I hit front-facing it doesn't do

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:47.380
I hit front-facing it doesn't do
 

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:50.910
I hit front-facing it doesn't do
anything so it may be a bug yeah well

00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:50.920
anything so it may be a bug yeah well
 

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:52.410
anything so it may be a bug yeah well
that's that's what you get right it's

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:52.420
that's that's what you get right it's
 

00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:55.170
that's that's what you get right it's
certainly freezing um did yeah it did it

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:55.180
certainly freezing um did yeah it did it
 

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:57.090
certainly freezing um did yeah it did it
just freeze do you think or no its back

00:28:57.090 --> 00:28:57.100
just freeze do you think or no its back
 

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:59.850
just freeze do you think or no its back
okay can't you take a walk um so the

00:28:59.850 --> 00:28:59.860
okay can't you take a walk um so the
 

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:01.230
okay can't you take a walk um so the
only reason I can think of that you want

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:01.240
only reason I can think of that you want
 

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.870
only reason I can think of that you want
to build a custom camera and then do the

00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:03.880
to build a custom camera and then do the
 

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:08.070
to build a custom camera and then do the
preview yourself is if you really need

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:08.080
preview yourself is if you really need
 

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.920
preview yourself is if you really need
to do live preview so do these guys do

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:10.930
to do live preview so do these guys do
 

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:12.420
to do live preview so do these guys do
library I believe what they do yeah if

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:12.430
library I believe what they do yeah if
 

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:13.860
library I believe what they do yeah if
you get the if you start it up and hit

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:13.870
you get the if you start it up and hit
 

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:16.590
you get the if you start it up and hit
the effects button I believe you're able

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:16.600
the effects button I believe you're able
 

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:25.500
the effects button I believe you're able
to apply okay let's have a look um all

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:25.510
to apply okay let's have a look um all
 

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:28.560
to apply okay let's have a look um all
right let's easy maybe this is coloring

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:28.570
right let's easy maybe this is coloring
 

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:34.920
right let's easy maybe this is coloring
or Brandon effects all right oh here

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:34.930
or Brandon effects all right oh here
 

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:39.420
or Brandon effects all right oh here
vignette vignettes always good okay yes

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:39.430
vignette vignettes always good okay yes
 

00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:40.950
vignette vignettes always good okay yes
they're going that in real time you can

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:40.960
they're going that in real time you can
 

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:45.600
they're going that in real time you can
see that on the edge thing right um but

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:45.610
see that on the edge thing right um but
 

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:48.180
see that on the edge thing right um but
you'll notice that a lot of the effects

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:48.190
you'll notice that a lot of the effects
 

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:50.610
you'll notice that a lot of the effects
that you want are actually disabled hmm

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:50.620
that you want are actually disabled hmm
 

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:53.790
that you want are actually disabled hmm
in in the real-time mode yeah yeah which

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:53.800
in in the real-time mode yeah yeah which
 

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:57.030
in in the real-time mode yeah yeah which
isn't surprising it's actually in ICS we

00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:57.040
isn't surprising it's actually in ICS we
 

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.650
isn't surprising it's actually in ICS we
improve things and jelly bean we

00:29:58.650 --> 00:29:58.660
improve things and jelly bean we
 

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:00.690
improve things and jelly bean we
improved them even more I think there's

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:00.700
improved them even more I think there's
 

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:04.500
improved them even more I think there's
one extra step that that the GL team is

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:04.510
one extra step that that the GL team is
 

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:06.770
one extra step that that the GL team is
talking about it but we've

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:06.780
talking about it but we've
 

00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:10.170
talking about it but we've
systematically been reducing the number

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:10.180
systematically been reducing the number
 

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:14.250
systematically been reducing the number
of operations that it takes to do a live

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:14.260
of operations that it takes to do a live
 

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:17.850
of operations that it takes to do a live
preview with effects so originally it

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:17.860
preview with effects so originally it
 

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:21.690
preview with effects so originally it
was extremely tedious and you had to

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:21.700
was extremely tedious and you had to
 

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:25.350
was extremely tedious and you had to
bring things through java now there's a

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:25.360
bring things through java now there's a
 

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:29.940
bring things through java now there's a
single copy involved if you're doing the

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:29.950
single copy involved if you're doing the
 

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:33.270
single copy involved if you're doing the
GPU acceleration on your effects and in

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:33.280
GPU acceleration on your effects and in
 

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.490
GPU acceleration on your effects and in
the future at some point we don't know

00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:35.500
the future at some point we don't know
 

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.770
the future at some point we don't know
exactly when but the team thinks that

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:37.780
exactly when but the team thinks that
 

00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:39.840
exactly when but the team thinks that
they can get that down 20 copies so

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:39.850
they can get that down 20 copies so
 

00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:41.460
they can get that down 20 copies so
you'll be able to go directly from the

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:41.470
you'll be able to go directly from the
 

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:44.970
you'll be able to go directly from the
camera to the GPU to whatever without

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:44.980
camera to the GPU to whatever without
 

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:47.040
camera to the GPU to whatever without
passing through user mode code at all

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:47.050
passing through user mode code at all
 

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:49.200
passing through user mode code at all
that's excellent yeah like the app which

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:49.210
that's excellent yeah like the app which
 

00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:50.250
that's excellent yeah like the app which
I've seen which really does the

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:50.260
I've seen which really does the
 

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:52.410
I've seen which really does the
most intensive real-time effects is I

00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:52.420
most intensive real-time effects is I
 

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:53.820
most intensive real-time effects is I
think paper camera they do a pretty good

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:53.830
think paper camera they do a pretty good
 

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:55.230
think paper camera they do a pretty good
job of this yeah they really do at least

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:55.240
job of this yeah they really do at least
 

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.910
job of this yeah they really do at least
if there are their effects at runtime

00:30:56.910 --> 00:30:56.920
if there are their effects at runtime
 

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.700
if there are their effects at runtime
which is kind of nice yep and they've

00:30:59.700 --> 00:30:59.710
which is kind of nice yep and they've
 

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:00.630
which is kind of nice yep and they've
done a lot of work to make that

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:00.640
done a lot of work to make that
 

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:03.000
done a lot of work to make that
successful I'm not surprised so that's

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:03.010
successful I'm not surprised so that's
 

00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:04.320
successful I'm not surprised so that's
that's the basically the way this app

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:04.330
that's the basically the way this app
 

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:06.120
that's the basically the way this app
works and it's got all of the standard

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:06.130
works and it's got all of the standard
 

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:07.410
works and it's got all of the standard
filters that you'd expect and you can

00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:07.420
filters that you'd expect and you can
 

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:09.420
filters that you'd expect and you can
apply them to photos either from the

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:09.430
apply them to photos either from the
 

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:11.580
apply them to photos either from the
camera or from from your gallery as well

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:11.590
camera or from from your gallery as well
 

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:13.260

which is nice there's no sort of

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:13.270
which is nice there's no sort of

not that I could find that's a shame

00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:20.020
not that I could find that's a shame
 

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:21.810
not that I could find that's a shame
because the share intent is really

00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:21.820
because the share intent is really
 

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:23.370
because the share intent is really
really easy to do and it works well for

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:23.380
really easy to do and it works well for
 

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:24.660
really easy to do and it works well for
photos well share they've got so they've

photos well share they've got so they've
 

00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:26.670
photos well share they've got so they've

got the standard Sharon tinea okay so
 

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:28.080
got the standard Sharon tinea okay so
you're just saying that they don't hook

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:28.090
you're just saying that they don't hook

because I on the one hand of like yeah
 

00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:44.490
because I on the one hand of like yeah
you're right every time I pick up an app

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:44.500
you're right every time I pick up an app
 

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.590
you're right every time I pick up an app
like that it's really cool on the other

it's true but you know I kind of like
 

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:56.100
it's true but you know I kind of like
the the combination particularly if it's

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:56.110
the the combination particularly if it's
 

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:58.620
the the combination particularly if it's
not if the communities is really

00:31:58.620 --> 00:31:58.630
not if the communities is really
 

00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:00.090
not if the communities is really
simplified so it's not about anything

00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:00.100
simplified so it's not about anything
 

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:01.860
simplified so it's not about anything
other than taking a photo and letting

other than taking a photo and letting
 

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:03.630
other than taking a photo and letting
other people see it yeah because then

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:03.640
other people see it yeah because then
 

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:04.860
other people see it yeah because then

guide and that certainly still holds
 

00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:31.169

true here but I think one additional

00:33:31.169 --> 00:33:31.179
true here but I think one additional

the camera so you've got two options
here which we saw both of which is

00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:01.150
here which we saw both of which is
 

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:02.910

00:36:58.769 --> 00:36:58.779
my alarm got saved in that state that
 

00:36:58.779 --> 00:37:01.289
my alarm got saved in that state that
would not make me happy yeah likewise

00:37:01.289 --> 00:37:01.299
would not make me happy yeah likewise
 

00:37:01.299 --> 00:37:02.910
would not make me happy yeah likewise
when i'm applying filters and doing a

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:02.920
when i'm applying filters and doing a
 

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:06.599
when i'm applying filters and doing a
lot of tweaking um you want to have sort

00:37:06.599 --> 00:37:06.609
lot of tweaking um you want to have sort
 

00:37:06.609 --> 00:37:09.809
lot of tweaking um you want to have sort
of a commit step but you shouldn't call

00:37:09.809 --> 00:37:09.819
of a commit step but you shouldn't call
 

00:37:09.819 --> 00:37:11.729
of a commit step but you shouldn't call
it safe no because that doesn't make any

00:37:11.729 --> 00:37:11.739
it safe no because that doesn't make any
 

00:37:11.739 --> 00:37:13.890
it safe no because that doesn't make any
sense yeah um you should be saving as

00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:13.900

you go along in case
 

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:17.130
you go along in case
because even though you even though the

00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:17.140
because even though you even though the
 

00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:18.660
because even though you even though the
user hasn't committed they still don't

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:18.670
user hasn't committed they still don't
 

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:22.440

to a point where you can roll back
 

00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:26.010
to a point where you can roll back
essentially yes usually when you're

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:26.020
essentially yes usually when you're
 

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:27.510
essentially yes usually when you're
applying filters like this it's all

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520
applying filters like this it's all
 

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:29.760
applying filters like this it's all
logical operations at all mats right

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:29.770
logical operations at all mats right
 

00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:31.410
logical operations at all mats right
right so while you don't want to have to

00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:31.420
right so while you don't want to have to
 

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:33.240
right so while you don't want to have to
keep you know each of those operations

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:33.250
keep you know each of those operations
 

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:34.830
keep you know each of those operations

their camera button it goes to the best

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:17.080
their camera button it goes to the best
 

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:18.900
their camera button it goes to the best
way to the built-in camera so this is

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:18.910
way to the built-in camera so this is
 

00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:20.430
way to the built-in camera so this is
using all of the functionality that you

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:20.440
using all of the functionality that you
 

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.230
using all of the functionality that you
would have on the standard you know

00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.240
would have on the standard you know
 

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.700
would have on the standard you know
built-in camera app and then you can

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:23.710
built-in camera app and then you can
 

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:26.970
built-in camera app and then you can
take a photo and then you know lets you

00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:26.980
take a photo and then you know lets you
 

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:28.860
take a photo and then you know lets you
retake it or cancel it or whatever you

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:28.870
retake it or cancel it or whatever you
 

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:31.170

want to do so so that's your two

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:31.180
want to do so so that's your two
 

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:32.280
want to do so so that's your two
approaches and both of those are

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:32.290
approaches and both of those are
 

00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:36.720
approaches and both of those are
described in the link down there in the

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:36.730
described in the link down there in the
 

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:38.400

android developer guides and so they'll

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:40.390
android developer guides and so they'll
 

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:42.500
android developer guides and so they'll
tell you how to use both approaches

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:42.510
tell you how to use both approaches
 

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:44.760
tell you how to use both approaches
let's have a look so the the other thing

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:44.770
let's have a look so the the other thing
 

00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:46.890
let's have a look so the the other thing
we talked about was conforming to the

00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:46.900
we talked about was conforming to the
 

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:48.780
we talked about was conforming to the
design guide and so again we kind of

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:48.790
design guide and so again we kind of
 

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:50.550
design guide and so again we kind of
have a few different approaches here

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:50.560
have a few different approaches here
 

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:52.590
have a few different approaches here
with these apps i think they've pretty

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:52.600
with these apps i think they've pretty
 

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:55.530
with these apps i think they've pretty
much all except for bloomer done some

00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:55.540
much all except for bloomer done some
 

00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:58.800
much all except for bloomer done some
form of sort of custom user interface

00:38:58.800 --> 00:38:58.810
form of sort of custom user interface
 

00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:00.930
form of sort of custom user interface
yep and I think that's I think that's

00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:00.940
yep and I think that's I think that's
 

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:03.030
yep and I think that's I think that's
alright in this circumstance it kind of

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.040
alright in this circumstance it kind of
 

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.140
alright in this circumstance it kind of
makes sense you know you have a

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:04.150
makes sense you know you have a
 

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:06.240
makes sense you know you have a
particular ethos of design ethos which

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:06.250
particular ethos of design ethos which
 

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:08.310
particular ethos of design ethos which

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:08.320
you want to be consistent with on these
 

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:09.960
you want to be consistent with on these
apps there are a few little bits and

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:09.970
apps there are a few little bits and
 

00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:11.850
apps there are a few little bits and
pieces that I mean I think it probably

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:11.860
pieces that I mean I think it probably
 

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:14.100

the search here you should probably be

00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:25.390
the search here you should probably be

its own search this should really just

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:30.310
its own search this should really just
 

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:31.920
its own search this should really just
be using a standard action bar that's

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:31.930
be using a standard action bar that's
 

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:34.080
be using a standard action bar that's
always annoying yeah yeah but i think

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:34.090
always annoying yeah yeah but i think
 

00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:35.460
always annoying yeah yeah but i think
you know to a certain extent that's

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:35.470
you know to a certain extent that's
 

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:37.110
you know to a certain extent that's
that's our fault right and these guys

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:37.120
that's our fault right and these guys
 

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:39.630
that's our fault right and these guys
have obviously tried to mimic the action

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:39.640
have obviously tried to mimic the action
 

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:41.940
have obviously tried to mimic the action
bar pattern but since our action bar

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:41.950
bar pattern but since our action bar
 

00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:45.510

makes it hard stuff absolutely but

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:47.260
makes it hard stuff absolutely but
 

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:48.360
makes it hard stuff absolutely but
that's you know definitely something to

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:48.370
that's you know definitely something to
 

00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:49.800
that's you know definitely something to
keep in mind and something to look for

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:49.810
keep in mind and something to look for
 

00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:51.570
keep in mind and something to look for
its you know where have you seen sort of

00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:51.580
its you know where have you seen sort of
 

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:52.920
its you know where have you seen sort of
these standard patterns and I have to

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:52.930
these standard patterns and I have to
 

00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:55.380
these standard patterns and I have to
admit we tend to have a different view

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:55.390
admit we tend to have a different view
 

00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:56.970
admit we tend to have a different view
on what a standard pattern is based on

00:39:56.970 --> 00:39:56.980
on what a standard pattern is based on
 

00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:58.200
on what a standard pattern is based on
the fact that we're always using the

00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:58.210
the fact that we're always using the
 

00:39:58.210 --> 00:39:59.790
the fact that we're always using the
latest versions of the phones and the

00:39:59.790 --> 00:39:59.800
latest versions of the phones and the
 

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:01.650
latest versions of the phones and the

it's like well I've seen that the

00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:02.920
it's like well I've seen that the
 

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.980
it's like well I've seen that the
appropriate search action bar thing for

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:04.990
appropriate search action bar thing for
 

00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:07.440

looks like you should be able to type

00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:28.480
looks like you should be able to type
 

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:31.680
looks like you should be able to type
into that right this looks like voice

search bar mean horrible yeah and so you

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:34.480
search bar mean horrible yeah and so you
 

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:35.820
search bar mean horrible yeah and so you
know if you you know if you take the

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:35.830
know if you you know if you take the
 

00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:38.340
know if you you know if you take the
alternative approach you know based on

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:38.350
alternative approach you know based on
 

00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:40.620
alternative approach you know based on
the standard sort of action bar version

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:40.630
the standard sort of action bar version
 

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:43.320
the standard sort of action bar version
is that you will have one button here

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:43.330
is that you will have one button here
 

00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:44.940
is that you will have one button here
and that will expand and then you type

00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:44.950
and that will expand and then you type
 

00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:46.440
and that will expand and then you type
and then you hit enter and you're done

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:46.450
and then you hit enter and you're done
 

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:48.180
and then you hit enter and you're done
so it's sort of only a couple of actions

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:48.190
so it's sort of only a couple of actions
 

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:50.100
so it's sort of only a couple of actions
and you straight away have it and if you

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:50.110
and you straight away have it and if you
 

00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:52.320
and you straight away have it and if you
do it that way build your search into

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:52.330
do it that way build your search into
 

00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:54.540
do it that way build your search into
you know a bunch of ways which make it

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:54.550
you know a bunch of ways which make it
 

00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:56.400
you know a bunch of ways which make it
easy for you to to leverage that across

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:56.410
easy for you to to leverage that across
 

00:40:56.410 --> 00:40:59.570
easy for you to to leverage that across
the system yeah once again I think the

00:40:59.570 --> 00:40:59.580
the system yeah once again I think the
 

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:01.950
the system yeah once again I think the
the feel that I get from this app is

00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:01.960
the feel that I get from this app is
 

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:04.020
the feel that I get from this app is
that it had some good people behind it

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:04.030
that it had some good people behind it
 

00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:07.110
that it had some good people behind it
it's really good design and they ran out

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:07.120
it's really good design and they ran out
 

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:09.960
it's really good design and they ran out
of time and I can tell you exactly where

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:09.970
of time and I can tell you exactly where
 

00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:13.290
of time and I can tell you exactly where
on every piece of the UI exactly where

00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:13.300
on every piece of the UI exactly where
 

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.060
on every piece of the UI exactly where
they ran out of time and decided screw

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:15.070
they ran out of time and decided screw
 

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:17.430
they ran out of time and decided screw

a bit of feedback on exactly at which
 

00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:32.700
a bit of feedback on exactly at which
point they got

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:32.710
point they got
 

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:34.260
point they got
before they decided they had to ship it

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:34.270
before they decided they had to ship it
 

00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:36.450
before they decided they had to ship it
yeah you know what shipping stuff before

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:36.460
yeah you know what shipping stuff before
 

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:38.670

guy all right so do sir I think all of

00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:45.460
guy all right so do sir I think all of
 

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:46.800
guy all right so do sir I think all of
the apps are pretty good so that's I

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:46.810
the apps are pretty good so that's I
 

00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:48.450
the apps are pretty good so that's I
think something which was custom

00:41:48.450 --> 00:41:48.460
think something which was custom
 

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:49.950
think something which was custom
designed that look pretty good i should

00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:49.960
designed that look pretty good i should
 

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:51.599
designed that look pretty good i should
mention by the way that I did work for

00:41:51.599 --> 00:41:51.609
mention by the way that I did work for
 

00:41:51.609 --> 00:41:53.820
mention by the way that I did work for
Microsoft and I just slagging off the

00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:53.830
Microsoft and I just slagging off the
 

00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:55.620
Microsoft and I just slagging off the
competitor for funds know you've been it

00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:55.630
competitor for funds know you've been it
 

00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:57.180
competitor for funds know you've been it
you've done that job that's writing that

00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:57.190
you've done that job that's writing that
 

00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:59.820
you've done that job that's writing that
guy all right and so this is kind of the

00:41:59.820 --> 00:41:59.830
guy all right and so this is kind of the
 

00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:01.890
guy all right and so this is kind of the
other approach so you're looking at

00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:01.900
other approach so you're looking at
 

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:03.990
other approach so you're looking at
camera camera effects here and that

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:04.000
camera camera effects here and that
 

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.180
camera camera effects here and that
again is totally custom but I feel like

00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:06.190
again is totally custom but I feel like
 

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:09.150
again is totally custom but I feel like
here it's not really adding to it it

00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:09.160
here it's not really adding to it it
 

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:10.200
here it's not really adding to it it
makes a little bit harder to navigate

00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:10.210
makes a little bit harder to navigate
 

00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:11.940
makes a little bit harder to navigate
how did you understand what's going on

00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:11.950
how did you understand what's going on
 

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:13.740
how did you understand what's going on
and for not a huge amount of gain this

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:13.750
and for not a huge amount of gain this
 

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:16.200
and for not a huge amount of gain this

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:18.390
doesn't look incredible Mexico's targets
are tiny tiny tiny topshop they're

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:18.400
are tiny tiny tiny topshop they're
 

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:19.859
are tiny tiny tiny topshop they're
really really difficult to you so yeah

00:42:19.859 --> 00:42:19.869
really really difficult to you so yeah
 

00:42:19.869 --> 00:42:22.109
really really difficult to you so yeah
you basically this is a this is a

00:42:22.109 --> 00:42:22.119
you basically this is a this is a
 

00:42:22.119 --> 00:42:25.170
you basically this is a this is a
performance dis improvement exactly this

00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:25.180
performance dis improvement exactly this
 

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:26.540
performance dis improvement exactly this
is going to make it harder for people to

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:26.550
is going to make it harder for people to
 

00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:28.770
is going to make it harder for people to
do I mean basically if you've got an app

00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:28.780
do I mean basically if you've got an app
 

00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:31.140
do I mean basically if you've got an app
like this the intention is going to be

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:31.150
like this the intention is going to be
 

00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:32.609
like this the intention is going to be
that they use this instead of their

00:42:32.609 --> 00:42:32.619
that they use this instead of their
 

00:42:32.619 --> 00:42:34.349
that they use this instead of their
camera app so every time they want to

00:42:34.349 --> 00:42:34.359
camera app so every time they want to
 

00:42:34.359 --> 00:42:35.750
camera app so every time they want to
take a photo it's going to be with this

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760
take a photo it's going to be with this
 

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:38.370
take a photo it's going to be with this
including from within other apps so you

00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:38.380
including from within other apps so you
 

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:39.780
including from within other apps so you
need to make it at least as easy to use

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:39.790
need to make it at least as easy to use
 

00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:42.540
need to make it at least as easy to use
as feature complete as the built-in

00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:42.550

00:42:45.089 --> 00:42:45.099
camera app which can be tricky but in
 

00:42:45.099 --> 00:42:46.710

terms of you I here in particular you

00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:46.720
terms of you I here in particular you
 

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:47.880
terms of you I here in particular you
want to try and make sure that it is

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:47.890
want to try and make sure that it is
 

00:42:47.890 --> 00:42:49.680
want to try and make sure that it is
easy to use and certainly not harder and

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:49.690
easy to use and certainly not harder and
 

00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:52.020
easy to use and certainly not harder and
slowly tease yeah and again can't

00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:52.030

in some circumstances but you're always

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:50.690
in some circumstances but you're always
 

00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:52.390
in some circumstances but you're always
better off just using OpenGL if it's

00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:52.400
better off just using OpenGL if it's
 

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:53.980
better off just using OpenGL if it's
something that the GV you can handle all

your last resort and the reason it

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:03.950
your last resort and the reason it
 

00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:05.309
your last resort and the reason it
should be your last resort is because

00:45:05.309 --> 00:45:05.319
should be your last resort is because
 

00:45:05.319 --> 00:45:07.720
should be your last resort is because

I think that's one of the advantages of

00:45:17.559 --> 00:45:17.569
I think that's one of the advantages of
 

00:45:17.569 --> 00:45:18.970
I think that's one of the advantages of
something like renderscript is that it

00:45:18.970 --> 00:45:18.980
something like renderscript is that it
 

00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:20.740
something like renderscript is that it
really does all of that for you so it's

00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:20.750
really does all of that for you so it's
 

00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:22.650
really does all of that for you so it's
going to figure i right processor I

00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:22.660
going to figure i right processor I

get away from now it turns out this is a
not entirely a trivial problem so you

00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960
not entirely a trivial problem so you
 

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:03.170
not entirely a trivial problem so you
really need to be to look at the URLs or

00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:03.180
really need to be to look at the URLs or
 

00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:05.660
really need to be to look at the URLs or
uris which you get back you know when

something we should do so I'm going to
 

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:17.870
something we should do so I'm going to
put that to our writing team see we can

put that to our writing team see we can
 

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:18.920
put that to our writing team see we can
get something put together in the

yeah it is the other thing which we
 

00:47:39.210 --> 00:47:41.120
yeah it is the other thing which we
mentioned as well is we want these apps

00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:41.130
mentioned as well is we want these apps
 

00:47:41.130 --> 00:47:43.730

to work on all devices now it turns out

00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:43.740
to work on all devices now it turns out
 

00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:45.530

how to make sure that your app does work

exactly so definitely do do keep that in

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:16.730
exactly so definitely do do keep that in
 

00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:17.890
exactly so definitely do do keep that in
mind and so the reason why this is

00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:17.900
mind and so the reason why this is
 

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:19.450
mind and so the reason why this is
particularly important for cameras is

00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:19.460
particularly important for cameras is
 

00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:21.910
particularly important for cameras is
because you know there was an assumption

00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:21.920
because you know there was an assumption
 

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:23.980
because you know there was an assumption
and the very very very early days of

00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:23.990
and the very very very early days of
 

00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:25.600
and the very very very early days of
Android that every device would have a

and since that has gradually relaxed

00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:31.490
and since that has gradually relaxed
 

00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:33.720
and since that has gradually relaxed
over time to give more opportunities for

over time to give more opportunities for

over time to give more opportunities for
differences in hardware we have had to

00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:37.070
differences in hardware we have had to
 

00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:39.010
differences in hardware we have had to
maintain that assumption that if you are

00:48:39.010 --> 00:48:39.020
maintain that assumption that if you are
 

00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:41.860
maintain that assumption that if you are
asking for a camera permission that that

00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:41.870
asking for a camera permission that that
 

00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:44.110
asking for a camera permission that that
must mean that you need a camera for the

00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:44.120
must mean that you need a camera for the
 

00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:46.390
must mean that you need a camera for the
device and that's no longer the case and

device and that's no longer the case and

so you have to explicitly say hey I know

00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:48.320
so you have to explicitly say hey I know
 

00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:50.200
so you have to explicitly say hey I know
that I have asked for the permission to

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:50.210
that I have asked for the permission to
 

00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:51.490
that I have asked for the permission to
use the camera but even if the camera

00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:51.500
use the camera but even if the camera
 

00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:53.260
use the camera but even if the camera
isn't there that's fine I'm still happy

00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:53.270
isn't there that's fine I'm still happy
 

00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:54.460
isn't there that's fine I'm still happy
to run right you need to mark that

00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:54.470
to run right you need to mark that

addition one thing that I personally

00:48:59.800 --> 00:48:59.810
addition one thing that I personally
 

00:48:59.810 --> 00:49:01.720
addition one thing that I personally
find very confusing i think maybe other

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:01.730
find very confusing i think maybe other
 

00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:03.700
find very confusing i think maybe other
people do too is remember that camera in

00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:03.710
people do too is remember that camera in
 

00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:05.890
people do too is remember that camera in
this case means a rear-facing camera a

00:49:05.890 --> 00:49:05.900
this case means a rear-facing camera a
 

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:07.660
this case means a rear-facing camera a
front facing camera is something

00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:07.670
front facing camera is something
 

00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:09.340
front facing camera is something
completely different yeah that's what is

00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:09.350
completely different yeah that's what is
 

00:49:09.350 --> 00:49:12.010
completely different yeah that's what is
not exam room yeah front-facing camera

00:49:12.010 --> 00:49:12.020
not exam room yeah front-facing camera
 

00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:14.740
not exam room yeah front-facing camera
not camera and I mean I know there's a

00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:14.750
not camera and I mean I know there's a
 

00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:16.270
not camera and I mean I know there's a
lot of this stuff is going to seem weird

00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:16.280
lot of this stuff is going to seem weird
 

00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:18.130
lot of this stuff is going to seem weird
an arbitrary but it's it's really just

00:49:18.130 --> 00:49:18.140
an arbitrary but it's it's really just
 

00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:20.080
an arbitrary but it's it's really just
there to ensure backwards compatibility

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:20.090
there to ensure backwards compatibility
 

00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:22.750
there to ensure backwards compatibility
so we're beforehand camera meant

00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:22.760
so we're beforehand camera meant
 

00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:24.970
so we're beforehand camera meant
rear-facing camera it just didn't say

00:49:24.970 --> 00:49:24.980
rear-facing camera it just didn't say
 

00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:26.890
rear-facing camera it just didn't say
that it meant rear-facing camera we

00:49:26.890 --> 00:49:26.900
that it meant rear-facing camera we
 

00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:28.210
that it meant rear-facing camera we
can't change the string because that

00:49:28.210 --> 00:49:28.220
can't change the string because that
 

00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:29.530
can't change the string because that
will break all of the apps which have

00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:29.540
will break all of the apps which have
 

00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:31.930
will break all of the apps which have
made that assumption beforehand so you

00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:31.940
made that assumption beforehand so you
 

00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:33.370
made that assumption beforehand so you
can get a little bit confusing but

00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:33.380
can get a little bit confusing but
 

00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:35.200
can get a little bit confusing but
that's why backwards compatibility is no

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:35.210
that's why backwards compatibility is no
 

00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:39.910
that's why backwards compatibility is no
joke so okay so that's basically all of

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:39.920
joke so okay so that's basically all of
 

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:41.980
joke so okay so that's basically all of
the things in terms of prescriptions and

00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:41.990
the things in terms of prescriptions and
 

00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:43.810
the things in terms of prescriptions and
the advice there so we've got a couple

00:49:43.810 --> 00:49:43.820
the advice there so we've got a couple
 

00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:45.100
the advice there so we've got a couple
of minutes because the neck surgeries

00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:45.110
of minutes because the neck surgeries
 

00:49:45.110 --> 00:49:46.630
of minutes because the neck surgeries
yeah we're doing great I thought we I

00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:46.640
yeah we're doing great I thought we I
 

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:48.310
yeah we're doing great I thought we I
thought we were doing an hour today oh

00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:48.320
thought we were doing an hour today oh
 

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:50.290
thought we were doing an hour today oh
yeah we've got I mean official is about

00:49:50.290 --> 00:49:50.300
yeah we've got I mean official is about
 

00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:51.700
yeah we've got I mean official is about
eight minutes all right well let's get

00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:51.710
eight minutes all right well let's get
 

00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:53.860
eight minutes all right well let's get
on the rig off in less than eight

00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:53.870
on the rig off in less than eight
 

00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:55.210
on the rig off in less than eight
minutes then I think you're sorely

00:49:55.210 --> 00:49:55.220
minutes then I think you're sorely
 

00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:58.780
minutes then I think you're sorely
mistaken the whole lightning round so so
