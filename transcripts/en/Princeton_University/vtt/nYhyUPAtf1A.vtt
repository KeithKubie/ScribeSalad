00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.890
PAUL MULDOON: My name is Paul
Muldoon and this is the

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.140
Atelier on how to write a song.


00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:17.750
[SINGING]


00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.580
PAUL MULDOON: You know, one of
the things about the Atelier,

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.420
of course, the central idea of
the Atelier is that it's based

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.000
on a collaboration.


00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.420
And so I was thrilled to think
of the possibility of working

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.020
with John Wesley Harding, Wes
Stace, his real name, of

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.180
course, the great English
novelist.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.280
JOHN WESLEY HARDING: Paul
and I have been

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.050
writing songs together.


00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.150
And with his kind of lyrical
expertise and with my just

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.790
knowledge of throwing songs
together a bit, that's what

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.080
we're hoping to pass on.


00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:56.650
[SINGING]


00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:03.710
[SINGING]


00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.530
PAUL MULDOON: We would take a
particular theme that's based

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.000
on some kind of emotional
charge.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.130
It might be jealousy.


00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.890
It might be anger.


00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:14.970
It might be joy.


00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.090
It might be defiance.


00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.060
Whatever it might be, revenge.


00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.860
And just allow the students
to go to town on that.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.820
And it's worked out
fabulously well.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:25.950
MAIA TEN BRINK: We
did loneliness.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.150
And I thought about a love story
between the moon and the

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.030
Earth, where the moon can never
get close to the Earth,

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.470
but really wants to
be with the Earth.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.270
And the Earth just kind
of ignores it.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.700
And the moon's just going
around and around.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.640
But the Earth is in
love with the sun.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.690
EMMA ZORENSKY: We're working
with two instructors who are

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.370
very well known and they
have a reputation

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.320
that precedes them.


00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.680
But they're so fantastic
to work with.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.040
And I was definitely
intimidated, especially not

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.430
being a trained musician or
like a poet, that I just

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.230
didn't have that background.


00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.260
But the feedback that they give
was fantastic every week.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.940
And they have such a unique way,
especially Paul, of like

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.620
looking at a lyric and just
knowing the perfect thing to

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.210
do with it.


00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.010
And you and your partner could
have sat and worked on the

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.150
same two lines of a song
for half an hour.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.920
And he just like, [SNAP].


00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.900
PAUL MULDOON: I would be
inclined to think of "I hope

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.340 position:63%
the waves will come crash
every party in this town," and isolating

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.580
it even further and have
it a kind of bridge?

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.670
JOE EDELMANN: People get really
excited about these

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.550
songs when they hear them.


00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.740
And so it's more everybody has
their own thing that they find

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.390
special about the song, they
really want to talk about.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.190
So really the discussion has
always just sort of flowed

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.440
naturally from people's
reactions to the songs.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.140
JOHN WESLEY HARDING: Just be
thinking about this while

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.690
you're listening to these songs
this week and also as we

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.400
go into next week, which is the
rehearsal for the gig that

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.110
is on Saturday at 9:00 PM.


00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.250
EMMA ZORENSKY: I'm definitely
super excited.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.230
It's going to be a great
opportunity to just like

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.660
actually really show what we've
been working on in this

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.260
classroom to the community,
because I think so many of the

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.430
songs are so great.


00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.550
And there's so much talent, that
I had no idea, even as a

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.060
senior, existed on this campus
with regard to musicians and

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.270
lyricists and just actually
people that are creating.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.220
PAUL MULDOON: And we had the
great honor of working

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.500
together with this group of
extraordinary students in a

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.660
class called, "How to


00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:59.430
Write a Song." [SINGING]


00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.030
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.


00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:09.030
[APPLAUSE]
