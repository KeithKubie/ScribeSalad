00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:26.700
myself here i mean i i've created this
 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.880
myself here i mean i i've created this
great site and built this fantastic team

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890
great site and built this fantastic team
 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.369
great site and built this fantastic team
around it and i think that people should

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379
around it and i think that people should
 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:35.670
around it and i think that people should
focus on themselves and if people can do

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680
focus on themselves and if people can do
 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.060
focus on themselves and if people can do
the right things personally that can

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070
the right things personally that can
 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.030
the right things personally that can
have a tremendous impact and so we often

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040
have a tremendous impact and so we often
 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.200
have a tremendous impact and so we often
look to government or business or other

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210
look to government or business or other
 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.340
look to government or business or other
people to to do these things but i think

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350
people to to do these things but i think
 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.350
people to to do these things but i think
if we all spent more time looking to

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360
if we all spent more time looking to
 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.460
if we all spent more time looking to
ourselves it's really that simple i

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470
 
 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.840
 
think if we were if you were very vocal

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850
think if we were if you were very vocal
 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.230
think if we were if you were very vocal
with both our dollars terms of what what

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240
with both our dollars terms of what what
 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.330
with both our dollars terms of what what
products and services we're willing to

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340
products and services we're willing to
 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.870
products and services we're willing to
support and what not and in terms of the

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880
support and what not and in terms of the
 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.990
support and what not and in terms of the
political process i think that that in

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000
political process i think that that in
 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.700
political process i think that that in
itself can have a tremendous impact

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710
itself can have a tremendous impact
 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.649
itself can have a tremendous impact
because it also impacts the people

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659
because it also impacts the people
 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.300
because it also impacts the people
around you so it sort of covers the

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310
around you so it sort of covers the
 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.670
around you so it sort of covers the
consumer and the personal aspect sends a

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680
consumer and the personal aspect sends a
 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.190
consumer and the personal aspect sends a
message to business and sends a message

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200
message to business and sends a message
 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.670
message to business and sends a message
to to government so i think if we were a

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680
to to government so i think if we were a
 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.520
to to government so i think if we were a
lot more vocal and a lot less concerned

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530
lot more vocal and a lot less concerned
 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.310
lot more vocal and a lot less concerned
about what other people thought I think

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320
about what other people thought I think
 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.630
about what other people thought I think
when I think we'd be well on our way

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640
 
 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.950
 
really depends who you are answer what

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960
really depends who you are answer what
 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.330
really depends who you are answer what
what you've done I think a lot of people

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340
what you've done I think a lot of people
 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.889
what you've done I think a lot of people
what do they say a perfection is the

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899
what do they say a perfection is the
 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.020
what do they say a perfection is the
enemy of the good or something like that

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030
enemy of the good or something like that
 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.139
enemy of the good or something like that
I think a lot of people will put this

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149
I think a lot of people will put this
 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:56.910
I think a lot of people will put this
stuff off because they want to do the

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920
stuff off because they want to do the
 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.990
stuff off because they want to do the
right thing and I think logically the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000
right thing and I think logically the
 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.590
right thing and I think logically the
way to approach your own personal

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600
way to approach your own personal
 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.669
way to approach your own personal
situation in terms of the environment is

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679
situation in terms of the environment is
 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.900
situation in terms of the environment is
to take some time to a carbon calculator

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910
to take some time to a carbon calculator
 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.710
to take some time to a carbon calculator
figure out where you have the most

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720
figure out where you have the most
 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.890
figure out where you have the most
impact focus on those things first etc I

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900
impact focus on those things first etc I
 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.809
impact focus on those things first etc I
think the challenge with that is that

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819
think the challenge with that is that
 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.550
think the challenge with that is that
people may put that off and put that off

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560
people may put that off and put that off
 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.870
people may put that off and put that off
because it's a big thing they just want

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880
because it's a big thing they just want
 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.550
because it's a big thing they just want
to do it right I want to be sure so I

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560
to do it right I want to be sure so I
 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.680
to do it right I want to be sure so I
try to cancel people just just get

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690
try to cancel people just just get
 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.440
try to cancel people just just get
started pick something it doesn't really

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450
started pick something it doesn't really
 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.420
started pick something it doesn't really
matter what pick something that matters

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430
matter what pick something that matters
 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.069
matter what pick something that matters
to you and it just feels right and just

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.079
to you and it just feels right and just
 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.720
to you and it just feels right and just
start and I think that gets you on the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730
start and I think that gets you on the
 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.610
start and I think that gets you on the
path and then you know if you want to be

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620
path and then you know if you want to be
 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.039
path and then you know if you want to be
more strategic great by all means get it

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049
more strategic great by all means get it
 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.990
more strategic great by all means get it
get on those carbon calculators figure

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000
get on those carbon calculators figure
 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.339
get on those carbon calculators figure
out where you can have your impact and

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349
out where you can have your impact and
 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.030
out where you can have your impact and
sort of do that so I think that's I

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040
sort of do that so I think that's I
 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.340
sort of do that so I think that's I
think that's it that's a big one I think

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350
think that's it that's a big one I think
 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.800
think that's it that's a big one I think
in terms of general concepts there's a

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810
in terms of general concepts there's a
 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.979
in terms of general concepts there's a
very very simple one just small is sexy

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989
very very simple one just small is sexy
 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.430
very very simple one just small is sexy

gone from some close to a thousand

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680
gone from some close to a thousand
 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.819
gone from some close to a thousand
square feet like 50 years ago to close

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829
square feet like 50 years ago to close
 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:19.620
square feet like 50 years ago to close
to two and a half so literally two and a

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630
to two and a half so literally two and a
 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.509
to two and a half so literally two and a
half times as big while the average

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519
half times as big while the average
 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.789
half times as big while the average
family size is shrunk it's not like we

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799
family size is shrunk it's not like we
 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.559
family size is shrunk it's not like we
are a lot happier now than we were in

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569
are a lot happier now than we were in
 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.890
are a lot happier now than we were in
the 50s so you can live a great life and

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900
the 50s so you can live a great life and
 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.759
the 50s so you can live a great life and
and you know in a much smaller home and

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769
and you know in a much smaller home and
 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.089
and you know in a much smaller home and
and by doing that because the space is

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099
and by doing that because the space is
 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:38.789
and by doing that because the space is
much smaller you you save on heating you

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799
much smaller you you save on heating you
 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:41.159
much smaller you you save on heating you
save on cooling you see save on lighting

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169
save on cooling you see save on lighting
 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:44.309
save on cooling you see save on lighting
you save on furnishing it just makes for

you save on furnishing it just makes for
 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.699
you save on furnishing it just makes for
an overall simpler life so I think focus

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.740
an overall simpler life so I think focus
on small small is great and that can be

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750
on small small is great and that can be
