00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:11.500
 It’s also fair, I believe,

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.208
 to frame the value of higher education 

00:00:14.208 --> 00:00:16.125
as a political issue

00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:17.875
 and that hasn’t always been the case.

00:00:17.875 --> 00:00:20.667
 Higher education for decades, for centuries,

00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:23.166
 was a path that people took in life 

00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:24.959
to get a fulfilling life.  

00:00:24.959 --> 00:00:27.875
Now higher education has become political.

00:00:27.875 --> 00:00:31.291
 There are many who believe that people in higher education

00:00:31.291 --> 00:00:34.583
 have one perspective and that is a liberal perspective. 

00:00:34.583 --> 00:00:39.250
There are people who believe when you say the liberal arts, that it is a political statement

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.792
 and not about the liberal arts as a concept. 

00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:43.208
We need to explain that. 

00:00:43.208 --> 00:00:48.333
The reality is, the facts are, that if you look at the composition of the faculty 

00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:52.500
at many of the research universities and probably at many universities overall, 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.125
people tend to be more liberal in terms of the political ideology. 

00:00:57.125 --> 00:01:00.500
I have been very intent to make sure, because that’s true at Emory,

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.291
 to make sure that everybody has a voice. 

00:01:02.291 --> 00:01:06.875
This goes partly to difficult conversations, it goes partly to diversity and inclusion,

00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:10.959
 at the end of the day, they all come together somehow. 

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:15.375
 And if I may give an example, I met with a group of Young Republicans. 

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:20.417
And it started because they had put a Twitter out where they were, 

00:01:20.417 --> 00:01:25.333
they put a Twitter out where they publicized my political contributions, 

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:31.125
which were from quite a while ago because I realized I didn’t want that to be in social media. 

00:01:31.125 --> 00:01:34.792
And I reached out and we got together.

00:01:34.792 --> 00:01:39.792
 And we went from distrust and a divide to having a conversation about 

00:01:39.792 --> 00:01:43.500
them acknowledging that they were actually afraid to speak up. 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.583
That were afraid to be labeled because it seems that they are a minority. 

00:01:47.583 --> 00:01:51.542
So instead of having a conversation about different political ideologies

00:01:51.542 --> 00:01:56.208
 and where we might agree and disagree and we actually agree much more than they realized, 

00:01:56.208 --> 00:01:59.208
it ended up being a conversation about inclusion. 

00:01:59.208 --> 00:02:02.083
And it was quite telling that by the time they left my office,

00:02:02.083 --> 00:02:05.750
 they wanted to take a picture and they posted it with the same Twitter account 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.250
that they used to post the earlier Tweet about me. 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.208
In talking with the Young Republicans, I find myself reflecting on the conversations I

00:02:14.208 --> 00:02:15.959
 had with our DACA students.

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.500
 And it was actually a shared experience that I did not realize, had not thought about it before. 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.750
Because both groups, if I may call them groups,

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.583
 were talking and very concerned about the fact that they were worried that they would be stigmatized. 

00:02:29.583 --> 00:02:32.834
That they didn’t fit in, that they wouldn’t be respected. 

00:02:32.834 --> 00:02:36.083
They had a sense of fear, they had a desire to belong. 

00:02:36.083 --> 00:02:43.834
And I did not realize that I could be talking about such different challenges, such different differences

00:02:43.834 --> 00:02:46.208
 with the underlying factors being the same. 

00:02:46.208 --> 00:02:51.208
And this goes back to something that we talk a lot about, that’s understanding people. 

00:02:51.208 --> 00:02:55.542
Realizing the differences of opinions that we have in society,

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:57.458
 that we have on our campus, 

00:02:57.458 --> 00:03:03.000
we could approach this intellectually and say we’re going to teach you all of the skills to get it right,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.583
 to get a meaningful conversation.

00:03:05.583 --> 00:03:09.667
 One could walk through that and somebody could check off every box 

00:03:09.667 --> 00:03:12.709
and have done, asked the right questions, I’ve looked for evidence, 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.000
 I have listened.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.041
But there’s one part that we should not forget, 

00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:22.041
and that is teaching the power of empathy. 

00:03:22.041 --> 00:03:26.166
Empathy doesn’t mean you agree, but it does mean I listened to you,

00:03:26.166 --> 00:03:30.959
 I respect you and I will embrace you as a member of the same community.
