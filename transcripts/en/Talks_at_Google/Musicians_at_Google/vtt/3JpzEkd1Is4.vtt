[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.389 --> 00:00:07.430
AARON ZEMACH: Since their
inception a decade ago,

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.120
Jukebox the Ghost have been
finding new and creative ways

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.790
to make exciting and
innovative piano rock music,

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.790
as well as create a diverse
and ever-growing fan

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.810
base through the
use of social media.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.370
They've played over
1,000 live shows

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.740
across the US and the
world and have no intention

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.972
of slowing down anytime
soon, with their spring 2018

00:00:23.972 --> 00:00:25.180
tour being their largest yet.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.980
So everyone, please
welcome to the stage

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.530
Ben Thornewill, Tommy Siegel,
and Jesse Kristin of Jukebox

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.475
the Ghost.

00:00:30.475 --> 00:00:33.870
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:39.745 --> 00:00:40.310
Hey, guys.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:41.060
Thanks for coming.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.601
BEN THORNEWILL:
Thanks for having us.

00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:43.235
Hi, everybody.

00:00:43.235 --> 00:00:43.777
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:45.651
AARON ZEMACH: So for
anyone who doesn't know,

00:00:45.651 --> 00:00:48.136
you guys all met in college,
in Washington DC, right?

00:00:48.136 --> 00:00:49.010
BEN THORNEWILL: Yeah.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.500
AARON ZEMACH: So do you remember
the first time each of you

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.784
met the other people in the
band, what that was like?

00:00:54.784 --> 00:00:55.700
BEN THORNEWILL: Yeah--

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.050
AARON ZEMACH: What
was the moment?

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.091
BEN THORNEWILL: I don't
know if there's a moment.

00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:00.560
So Tommy's the new guy.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.090
We met Tommy our sophomore year.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.610
But Jesse and I lived by
each other freshman year,

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.080
and so we both showed up.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.600
And Jesse was like
still a skater kid,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.600
and I was like 5 foot 6" still
and wearing like, you know,

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.440
IZOD polos.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.610
And it was awful, really.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.160
But somehow we became friends
and started playing together.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.370
And then Tommy put up a
flyer in the music department

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.330
our sophomore year.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.121
TOMMY SIEGEL: Yeah.

00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:23.850
I mean, I remember I put up a
flyer in the music department,

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.350
an.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.900
You guys called
my landline, which

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.280
is really dating myself, here.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.080
But that was like the last three
months that I had a landline.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.330
And I just happened to be
around when you guys called.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.289
So lucky, lucky pick up.

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:39.080
AARON ZEMACH: Yeah.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.845
So you each came at it from
a different sense of styles.

00:01:41.845 --> 00:01:44.220
Ben, you're classically trained
as a piano player, right?

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.416
And Jesse, you have more
of a punk background.

00:01:46.416 --> 00:01:48.790
And Tommy, I've been told you
wanted to be in a jam band,

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:49.040
is your--

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.415
TOMMY SIEGEL: A
sort of jam band.

00:01:50.415 --> 00:01:50.940
Yeah, maybe.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:51.620
Sort of.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:52.370
Yeah.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.442
I like guitar solos.

00:01:53.442 --> 00:01:54.150
AARON ZEMACH: OK.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.085
So coming at it from all those
different styles and genres,

00:01:57.085 --> 00:01:58.460
why did you think,
in your heads,

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.350
that this would be like
the musical match that

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.190
would make it happen?

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.120
BEN THORNEWILL: I
don't think we did.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.950
JESSE KRISTIN: We didn't, no.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:03.680
BEN THORNEWILL: I
think it was just

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.320
like these are the guys that I
guess we're going to play with.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.590
And we'll see what happens.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.810
It wasn't like, ah, yes.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.900
I found a punk drummer
and a jam band kid.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:11.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.980
I got the band.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.880
JESSE KRISTIN: I never thought
I'd end up in piano rock.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.755
BEN THORNEWILL: Yeah.

00:02:15.755 --> 00:02:18.380
TOMMY SIEGEL: I remember
the first practice we had,

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.860
thinking this is strange,
but it could work.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:22.610
Maybe.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.610
At some point.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.950
That was my feeling.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.410
I was like, these guys are
good, but there's no basis.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.377
That's weird.

00:02:28.377 --> 00:02:30.335
BEN THORNEWILL: I think
we still feel that way.

00:02:30.335 --> 00:02:30.970
AARON ZEMACH: Like--

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.360
BEN THORNEWILL: Like
this is strange.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.490
I guess we can keep doing it.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.365
AARON ZEMACH: Mm-hmm.

00:02:34.365 --> 00:02:36.920
So when you get in a cab in
the city with a guitar case

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.740
or drums and the taxi driver
says, oh, you're in a band.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.360
What type of music do you play?

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.570
How do you describe it
to them, what you do now?

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.570
BEN THORNEWILL: Yeah, we
all look at each other.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:47.380
Umm--

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.300
JESSE KRISTIN: I say
I'm in a rock band.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.630
BEN THORNEWILL: Which is--

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.120
JESSE KRISTIN:
And that's simple.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.600
BEN THORNEWILL:
Simple and misleading.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.440
But I think-- I usually say
piano rock because that's like

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.500
an easy way to--

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.710
there's a piano in the
band, and there's also

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.210
drums and other stuff.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.500
But there's, I don't know.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.316
Yeah, piano rock.

00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:04.690
Sometimes we say
indie piano rock

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.056
because we wear skinny jeans.

00:03:06.056 --> 00:03:07.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.167
And it all balances out.

00:03:09.167 --> 00:03:10.000
AARON ZEMACH: Right.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.850
And so after DC, you moved
to Philadelphia for a bit.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.280
And now you're here,
based out of Brooklyn

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.370
for the past seven or eight
years we figured out earlier.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.860
And at what point in that
process did you realize, oh,

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.930
being a touring,
recording band is

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.760
going to be our full-time
lives from now on?

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.340
BEN THORNEWILL: That sort
of happened fairly quick out

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.850
of college.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.440
So when we started
playing in college,

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.590
we were playing shows
to friends and it's just

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.200
sort of anyone we can get,
and we're flyering the campus.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.180
And then, right towards
end of our senior year,

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.280
people that weren't our
friends started showing up.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.850
And that's when we're like, all
right, let's give this a go.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.540
And then moved to Philly and
had like a four bedroom house

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.220
for like $1,100 or something.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.380
Appallingly cheap.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.050
And then just started
touring and made just enough

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.597
to survive because we were in
the house that cost nothing.

00:03:55.597 --> 00:03:57.180
And then that's sort
of been the case,

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.470
and we just kept doing it.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.200
And the one thing that
always made sense for us

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.390
as we were trying to
make a career out of this

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.270
is when we toured, that's
how we made fans and got

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.215
in front of people.

00:04:08.215 --> 00:04:09.840
It was-- I don't
think it's really ever

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.923
been a conscious decision.

00:04:10.923 --> 00:04:12.840
We've just always kept
doing whatever worked.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.355
And what happened to work was
playing shows and touring.

00:04:16.355 --> 00:04:17.230
AARON ZEMACH: Mm-hmm.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.430
BEN THORNEWILL:
That sound right?

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.850
TOMMY SIEGEL: Correct.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:19.410
BEN THORNEWILL: OK.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.110
AARON ZEMACH: Good answer.

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.440
Good answer.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.959
Let's check.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.979
OK, that was the correct answer.

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.520
And so you've been
going-- now you're

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.100
releasing your fifth studio
album March 30th, "Off

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.750
To The Races."

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.870
What would you say about
this album has been new

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.260
and an evolution of the band?

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.676
And what parts of
it would you say

00:04:34.676 --> 00:04:36.910
are sort of like the core,
consistent music that

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.550
is Jukebox the Ghost?

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.210
TOMMY SIEGEL: So a
little background

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.490
I think on this record--

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.060
that is more important than I
think we knew going into it--

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.090
is that we, for
the last few years,

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.210
on Halloween, we've been doing
a show called Halloqueen, where

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.330
we play a set of our own stuff,
and then we get into costume

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.790
and come out and play a full set
of Queen dressed up as Queen.

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.420
And having to do a deep dive
into Queen's catalog for three

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.470
years in a row, I think it
had a bigger influence on us

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.350
than I think any of us
would have really imagined.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.550
Because what we
realized is we sort of

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.140
hedge our bets
sometimes in terms

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.060
of whether we're making
something that's weird

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.851
or something that's
poppy, and sometimes we

00:05:20.851 --> 00:05:22.300
sort of split the difference.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.270
And what we ended up
really enjoying about Queen

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.440
is that they're really
catchy and they are so weird.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.134
Like everything about
them is bizarre.

00:05:31.134 --> 00:05:33.550
Like even the hits you think
are normal, when you actually

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.830
go back and listen to them,
the harmonies, the guitar

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.900
solos, the structures.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.570
So I think for us,
it was the first time

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.950
we'd had a band that
we could reference

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.270
for creative decisions.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.220
Like should we do that?

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.872
I don't know.

00:05:49.872 --> 00:05:51.080
That might be a little weird.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.880
But Queen did it.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:52.380
You know?

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.370
And we could reference
them for everything.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.912
So if we wanted a big harmony
stack, we went for it.

00:05:57.912 --> 00:05:59.870
If we wanted a big guitar
solo, we went for it.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.960
If we thought this song should
have 50 different parts all

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.690
jumbled together, we did it.

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.390
And it's not as
if we were trying

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.610
to sound like Queen exactly.

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.660
It's more that I think they
were like our spiritual guide

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.000
in letting us give
less of a crap

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.601
than we normally do
about pop preconceptions.

00:06:20.601 --> 00:06:22.100
AARON ZEMACH: Yeah,
I can definitely

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.420
hear in like
"Jumpstarted," which

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.836
was one of the singles you
released that Queen influenced,

00:06:25.836 --> 00:06:28.120
or "Everybody's Lonely," too.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.620
And so I guess, starting from
that point of this inspiration

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.203
from Queen, what
does the process look

00:06:32.203 --> 00:06:34.420
like for a standard
Jukebox the Ghost song?

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.380
We have an idea,
what's the journey that

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.714
takes before it ends up
recorded and on an album?

00:06:38.714 --> 00:06:40.880
BEN THORNEWILL: Every song
sort of has its own path.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.120
I think Tommy and I both
write and then bring it

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:49.200
to the band in different states
of development or conception.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.530
Like "Jumpstarted,"
which is one we just

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:53.609
released a couple of weeks
ago, depending on when

00:06:53.609 --> 00:06:54.650
you're listening to this.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.120
It was a demo that
I built out at home

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.060
and added endless,
seemingly endless, vocals.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.650
And just everyday
I'd sit down and try

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:05.390
to add another part
without considering

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.280
what happened before
and never really thought

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.285
it'd be a Jukebox tune.

00:07:08.285 --> 00:07:09.410
But that is a good example.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.060
We brought it to
the band, and we all

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.890
started arranging and
thinking about it.

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.020
And they're like, this
should be a Jukebox tune.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.060
And I'm like, this
is totally spastic

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.860
and completely unlistenable.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.440
I don't think this
is a great idea.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.850
But it ended up working out.

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:24.920
And it's filled with harmony
stacks and guitar solos.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.625
But every song has its own path.

00:07:26.625 --> 00:07:27.125
But--

00:07:27.125 --> 00:07:28.744
TOMMY SIEGEL: And
this record is--

00:07:28.744 --> 00:07:30.410
another thing that
separates this record

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.356
from our other records
is that in the past,

00:07:33.356 --> 00:07:34.730
if we had a demo
or something, it

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.400
would be some rough recording
from the practice space

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.937
or an iPhone memo or something.

00:07:38.937 --> 00:07:41.270
In this record, I think if
you went through and listened

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.370
to our demos from
the record, they're

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:46.100
pretty much the same as what we
ended up with on the recording,

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.980
just with more life and
more bells and whistles.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.220
But we've all kind of become
more serious studio engineers

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.520
and producers on our own time
in the last three or four

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.280
years in a way that's starting
to really become meaningful

00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.025
now.

00:07:59.025 --> 00:08:00.400
AARON ZEMACH: And
so another song

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.760
I am specifically interested in.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.020
I heard there's a track
on this album, Ben,

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.887
where you recorded 170
different vocal parts

00:08:06.887 --> 00:08:07.970
and put them all together.

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:08.660
BEN THORNEWILL: Yeah.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.076
AARON ZEMACH: What
does that mean?

00:08:10.076 --> 00:08:11.930
And what's the story
behind trying that out?

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:13.013
BEN THORNEWILL: That was--

00:08:13.013 --> 00:08:15.710
so sometimes when I write,
I'll sit either at the piano

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:17.180
or, in this case,
at the computer.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.430
And it was for that
song, "Jumpstarted."

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:23.025
And I'd record a part, and
I don't think about it.

00:08:23.025 --> 00:08:24.650
Like, I have a lead
vocal line and then

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:26.360
I just start
stacking and adding.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.207
And so it'll just be--

00:08:28.207 --> 00:08:30.290
for whatever reason, instead
of like a snare drum,

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:31.670
I'll go like (SINGING) ah.

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:33.710
And then I'll do (SINGING) baa.

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.500
And I'll do it 18 different
times, 18 different ways,

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.390
stacked on top of itself.

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:41.059
And so the way that
that song ended up

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:42.665
with like 170
different vocal tracks

00:08:42.665 --> 00:08:45.950
is because I would do
these 15-part harmonies,

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:49.637
vocal stacks, all over the song,
all with different effects,

00:08:49.637 --> 00:08:50.720
all with different levels.

00:08:53.407 --> 00:08:53.990
And it worked.

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:55.490
And now we're having a lot
of trouble figuring out

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:56.220
how to do that live.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:56.803
I'll tell you.

00:08:56.803 --> 00:08:58.375
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:58.375 --> 00:08:59.000
But it's funny.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.340
We brought it into the
studio to actually record it,

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:05.210
and we uploaded all these
tracks to the session,

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:06.430
and it immediately crashed.

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:08.751
And the producers were
like, you can't do this.

00:09:08.751 --> 00:09:11.000
You have to make-- so we
did, you know, compressed it.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.920
But it's all in there.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:17.540
But I like using the voice and
the ability to record and layer

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.349
the voice on top of itself as
an instrument all to itself.

00:09:20.349 --> 00:09:21.890
You have the lead
vocal, and then you

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:25.250
have the harmonies
or all the textures

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:26.837
or other ways of
working with vocals.

00:09:26.837 --> 00:09:28.920
TOMMY SIEGEL: And there's
harmonies on the record,

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.630
too, that--

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:34.320
what's a fun coincidence--
like usually,

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.690
Ben and I both sing lead and
kind of trade off on songs.

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:39.770
And on this record--

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:42.110
in prior records, you could
really tell the difference,

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:44.257
I think, more between our songs.

00:09:44.257 --> 00:09:46.340
And this record you can
too, if you know the band.

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.400
But it just felt like
a fun coincidence

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.890
that we were both
really, really into thick

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:53.420
harmony stacks on this record.

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.782
That's a fun commonality
throughout the whole thing.

00:09:55.782 --> 00:09:56.490
AARON ZEMACH: Mm.

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:56.960
Mm-hmm.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.290
I guess it also makes me think--

00:09:58.290 --> 00:09:59.960
I have been seeing you
perform live for probably

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:00.780
about eight years.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.594
And as the group's evolved--

00:10:02.594 --> 00:10:04.010
we love technology
here at Google,

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:07.250
and you've been incorporating
more and more technology,

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:10.220
drum pads and synths and
live looping and more guitar

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:10.892
effects.

00:10:10.892 --> 00:10:13.100
Is that something that you've
made a conscious choice

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.058
that you're interested
in to change your sound?

00:10:15.058 --> 00:10:17.610
Or just a natural evolution
of what you've been doing?

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:20.660
BEN THORNEWILL: I think whenever
we add something technological

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.820
to our otherwise
basic live show,

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.400
it's just to get
across something

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.340
that we did on the record that
we have no other way of doing.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.910
So if I have a looper
pedal, I'll hit it.

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:34.220
And in a set amount of
time, it will just loop.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.660
And whenever I sing, it will
add that on top of itself.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.644
And so you can use that
as a way to falsify

00:10:39.644 --> 00:10:41.810
having an eight-part harmony
and just build it live,

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:42.800
and it exists there.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.682
Or if there's like
a, I don't know.

00:10:45.682 --> 00:10:47.390
Jesse, what do you
trigger on that thing?

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:48.639
JESSE KRISTIN: I think a snap.

00:10:48.639 --> 00:10:51.425
I can't even snap myself,
so it has to be a sample.

00:10:51.425 --> 00:10:52.300
BEN THORNEWILL: Yeah.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.479
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:53.479 --> 00:10:55.770
TOMMY SIEGEL: We're also
considering just sucking, too.

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:57.672
We haven't-- we're still
working it out, so.

00:10:57.672 --> 00:10:59.796
AARON ZEMACH: I'm interested
to hear how that goes.

00:10:59.796 --> 00:11:01.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:03.680
So we've been talking a
lot about live performing.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.110
You've done over 1,000 shows,
which feels ridiculous.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:08.990
And recently, you released
a live album of your music.

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:11.000
What inspired you
to want to release

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.622
some of that as an artifact?

00:11:12.622 --> 00:11:15.080
BEN THORNEWILL: I think a lot
of that was because we played

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.710
so many shows, and we're like--

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:19.790
and for so long, people would
come to shows and be like,

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:23.240
I love your records, but we
like your live show better,

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.034
which is tiresome
but understandable.

00:11:26.034 --> 00:11:28.700
And every time we make a record,
we think, well, maybe this one.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.158
Maybe this one
they'll like better.

00:11:30.158 --> 00:11:32.660
But we wanted to
sort of document

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.276
where we were at that time.

00:11:34.276 --> 00:11:35.900
And we had four
records under our belt,

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.629
and that was a
long period of time

00:11:38.629 --> 00:11:39.920
and a lot of material to cover.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.670
And we wanted to document and
honor the live arrangements

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:45.915
that we've been honing and
developing over the years.

00:11:45.915 --> 00:11:46.790
AARON ZEMACH: Mm-hmm.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.373
What's that balance
like for you guys?

00:11:48.373 --> 00:11:50.940
Do you prefer being on the
road, being in the studio?

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.745
A little of both?

00:11:52.745 --> 00:11:54.620
JESSE KRISTIN: My answer,
what I tell people,

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:57.260
is I think Jukebox
the Ghost is a--

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.742
we're not a studio band
in a typical sense.

00:12:00.742 --> 00:12:02.450
I think there are
bands that are born out

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:04.070
of the studio environment.

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:05.810
And the three of
us, we learned how

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:08.420
to play together just by
playing for our friends.

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:11.570
And that really just
kept snowballing,

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:13.850
and we were just tour more.

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:16.070
And I think that really
created our sound.

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:20.930
And then when it's time to
record our music, we record it.

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:24.260
But I'd say that we're
primarily a live band

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.777
and that does
inform our records.

00:12:26.777 --> 00:12:29.360
BEN THORNEWILL: But they're also
two totally different beasts.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.860
I mean, when you're
in a studio, you

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:33.260
can spend an entire day,
without exaggeration,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:34.835
on 10 seconds of music.

00:12:34.835 --> 00:12:36.960
And even that, it still
doesn't sound like anything

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:37.876
at the end of the day.

00:12:37.876 --> 00:12:41.940
You've just done
170 vocal tracks.

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:46.280
And then-- but live is sort
of this whole other realm

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.610
of existence where
it's not creative in

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:52.040
the conventional musical sense.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.070
You're there to put on a
show and travel and meet

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:56.314
people and do the thing and--

00:12:56.314 --> 00:12:58.730
TOMMY SIEGEL: Yeah, I'm always
confused by others like us.

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:02.390
I've seen shows where the band's
like people have been talking,

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:04.640
and they'd be like, shh.
(WHISPERING) And you're like,

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.530
I'm expressing myself up here.

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:09.410
And I guess I kind of understand
that, but maybe we've performed

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:10.550
our songs too many times.

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:15.165
But I'm like the expressing
myself part was years ago.

00:13:15.165 --> 00:13:16.790
Now we're putting on
a vaudeville show,

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:18.756
and I don't really care
if you talk or not.

00:13:18.756 --> 00:13:20.064
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:20.064 --> 00:13:20.990
So yeah.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:23.132
I find that kind of funny.

00:13:23.132 --> 00:13:25.340
AARON ZEMACH: Another thing
I have to ask about since

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:28.400
we're talking about the
live album is "Hold it In!

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:31.574
(Foot in Mouth Disease),"
the bonus release.

00:13:31.574 --> 00:13:33.740
Would you mind describing
for everyone who might not

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:34.880
be familiar with this?

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:35.900
BEN THORNEWILL: Jesse, why
don't you take this one.

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:37.160
TOMMY SIEGEL: Jesse made
this album, by the way.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.530
This is entirely his creation.

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:41.113
JESSE KRISTIN: I had some time
on my hands after that big tour

00:13:41.113 --> 00:13:42.230
we did to make the record.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:44.960
And so we recorded every
show from the record,

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:49.070
and we can only pick one
song per show for the record.

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:54.177
But there was so much banter
for an entire two month tour.

00:13:54.177 --> 00:13:55.010
Just so much banter.

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:59.240
So what I would do is I
would have the track open

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.460
and I would look for the
gap between the songs.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.920
So here's a wave form,
here's a wave form.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.600
And then I would just
turn up the volume

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:09.530
and listen to whatever these
guys said to the audience.

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:12.620
And I just listened to
every show and every gap,

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:15.600
and I just compiled all the
most ridiculous moments.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.100
And I--

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.516
BEN THORNEWILL: I have a long
history of really messing up

00:14:18.516 --> 00:14:20.810
from a conversational
standpoint on stage

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:24.800
because I get too comfortable,
and then my mind wanders.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.920
And when you're on like show
22, and you're in Des Moines,

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.307
and it just all falls apart.

00:14:29.307 --> 00:14:30.890
TOMMY SIEGEL: What's
amazing about Ben

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:32.870
is that he gets
nervous if you tell

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:34.130
him to call a pizza place--

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:34.220
BEN THORNEWILL: I hate it.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.600
TOMMY SIEGEL: --and just
order a pepperoni pizza.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.590
He can't do it.

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:39.221
But if you put him in front of
2,000 people with a microphone,

00:14:39.221 --> 00:14:41.720
he's like, let me tell you about
the most embarrassing thing

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:42.890
that's ever happened to me.

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:44.132
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:44.132 --> 00:14:45.590
BEN THORNEWILL:
And I don't realize

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:49.520
how bad it is until Jesse
went through and cataloged

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.710
150 moments.

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:54.620
JESSE KRISTIN: I think
it's 140 track album.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.240
Most songs are about 20 seconds.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.850
TOMMY SIEGEL: ITunes wouldn't
load it or something, right?

00:14:58.850 --> 00:14:59.420
Because it was too many tracks?

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.086
JESSE KRISTIN: Somehow
I figured it out.

00:15:01.086 --> 00:15:02.152
I, you know.

00:15:02.152 --> 00:15:04.610
AARON ZEMACH: I mean, as a fan,
it was quite a great treat.

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:07.510
And you guys have such a really
neat connection with your fans

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:08.690
directly.

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:10.760
One way specifically that
I wanted to talk about,

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.305
Tommy, are your Van Doodles.

00:15:12.305 --> 00:15:14.851
I think we actually have
some visuals to show.

00:15:14.851 --> 00:15:17.350
Could you describe for people
who might not be familiar what

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:18.844
the Van Doodles you do are?

00:15:18.844 --> 00:15:19.760
TOMMY SIEGEL: So yeah.

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:23.240
Through our band social media,
I'll take drawing requests

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.890
when we're on tour.

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:27.104
So a fan will tweet
like, you know-- oh,

00:15:27.104 --> 00:15:28.270
is there something up there?

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:28.760
OK.

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:29.540
AARON ZEMACH: Yup, we got it up.

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.873
TOMMY SIEGEL: A dinosaur
living out his dream of flying.

00:15:31.873 --> 00:15:33.401
Aka a dinoSoar.

00:15:33.401 --> 00:15:33.900
OK.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.530
And then I'll draw it and
tweet it back at them.

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:38.450
But it's something
everyone can see.

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:40.520
It's not like it's a
totally private exchange.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.020
Nicolas Cage playing-- yeah.

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:46.700
Nicolas Cage as both
Romeo and Juliet.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.463
Jesse as Pennywise the clown.

00:15:49.463 --> 00:15:51.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:55.574
This is a good selection.

00:15:55.574 --> 00:15:58.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:00.311
Very nice.

00:16:00.311 --> 00:16:02.810
AARON ZEMACH: I think we have
a bunch here of different ways

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:04.010
that you've drawn the band.

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:05.190
TOMMY SIEGEL: Yeah, different
ways of drawing the band.

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:07.540
And so this is a funny-- a
funny thing that I've noticed

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:10.220
is that we used to get
fan art pretty regularly.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:14.630
Like there were people who would
do fan art of us as something.

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:18.710
And then I started doing these,
and that totally dried up.

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:21.781
And I think it's because all
of a sudden, we in-sourced fan

00:16:21.781 --> 00:16:22.280
art.

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.470
Like it's totally
in-house now, so they

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:26.240
don't have to do it anymore.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.820
Which makes me feel a
little strange, but--

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:33.440
yeah, there's us as Charlie
Brown, or "the Great Pumpkin,

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.210
Charlie Brown," specifically.

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:37.510
AARON ZEMACH: So if someone
is listening to this video

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:39.970
and they want to figure out
what's the way that I can give

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:42.460
a tweet that Tommy is going
to see and fulfill my request,

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.100
is there like a secret sauce
of what you look for when

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:45.520
you're pulling tweets off?

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.400
TOMMY SIEGEL: Of
what I look for?

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:46.900
AARON ZEMACH: Yeah.

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:48.580
TOMMY SIEGEL: Well,
the ones I don't do

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:51.490
are the ones that are
like (SINGING) draw me.

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:53.042
Because I'm like,
I don't know you.

00:16:53.042 --> 00:16:55.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:55.010 --> 00:17:00.042
But otherwise, if they leave
enough room for it to be funny,

00:17:00.042 --> 00:17:01.000
then I want to draw it.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.490
If it's something that is
just too specific for anybody

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:07.569
to understand, then
I typically don't.

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:09.369
But I don't know.

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:10.150
I've done so many.

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:12.700
I mean, I've probably
done a couple of thousand

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:13.825
at this point or something.

00:17:13.825 --> 00:17:14.170
AARON ZEMACH: Wow.

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:15.109
And you have a book
of them, right?

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:15.660
That you--

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.243
TOMMY SIEGEL: Yeah,
a few years ago, I

00:17:17.243 --> 00:17:19.150
put out like a little zine.

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:21.670
It's not really a super
fancy book, but just

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:24.730
a compilation of the first
couple of years of doing it.

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:27.490
But it's totally
snowballed since then.

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:28.820
It's been a--

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:34.390
I mean, as you guys probably
know about social media,

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:37.325
it is very photocentric.

00:17:37.325 --> 00:17:38.950
And one of the weird
things about being

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:43.480
a musician in the social media
era is that listening to a song

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.940
takes time and patience.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:49.780
And you're going to have to
have somebody's total focus

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:52.280
to really get their attention.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.700
Which is like the opposite of
what social media was built

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.940
for, which is like this sort
of instantaneous ephemera

00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:59.620
of scrolling.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:03.040
So what we found is that
stuff like the drawings

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.650
is a way to maintain a
connection with our fans

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:10.750
on social media in a way that's
not too forced or narcissistic

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:14.685
or something, and
hopefully still draw people

00:18:14.685 --> 00:18:15.310
into the music.

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:18.940
Because I mean, if we're
posting a song on Facebook,

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:21.082
it's really tough for our song--

00:18:21.082 --> 00:18:23.290
even if they're a big fan
of music, it's tough for us

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:27.670
to compete with Kim Kardashian
and Trump and all these things

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:31.330
that are occupying the
same space as music now.

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:33.880
Whereas it used to be music
was you go to the record store

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:35.505
and you look at your
records and you're

00:18:35.505 --> 00:18:37.420
competing with other music.

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:41.080
But we are competing
with Kim Kardashian, so.

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.130
We're trying to win,
and we're in it to win.

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:44.921
BEN THORNEWILL: She is
a fierce competitor.

00:18:44.921 --> 00:18:46.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.435
AARON ZEMACH: And so with
this social media presence,

00:18:48.435 --> 00:18:50.560
you're fairly active across
all different channels,

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.980
and a lot of it feels
very spontaneous.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:55.600
And so as a band
who's using this

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.880
as a promotional venue, how
much of your social media

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.890
is strategies that
you think through?

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:02.620
How you're going to engage your
fans, cultivate an audience.

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:05.110
And how much of it is
just what's on your mind

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:08.114
and just popping
up in your heads?

00:19:08.114 --> 00:19:09.780
BEN THORNEWILL: We
outsource most of it.

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:11.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:13.220
No, it's a mix.

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:15.452
We sort of developed this voice.

00:19:15.452 --> 00:19:17.910
A lot of it came from the all
caps guy of a couple of years

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:18.410
ago.

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:21.990
And we just write
terrible, ridiculous things

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:24.807
in all caps with terrible
syntax and grammar.

00:19:24.807 --> 00:19:26.640
TOMMY SIEGEL: And it
used to be like an only

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.250
late night at a bar
kind of a posting thing.

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:33.090
But now it's just sort of become
an all hours of the day voice

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:33.920
for our--

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.330
this is specifically
Twitter I should say.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:40.009
Facebook, we have a--
we use capitalization--

00:19:40.009 --> 00:19:42.050
AARON ZEMACH: But now it's
proper capitalization.

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:44.700
TOMMY SIEGEL: Proper
capitalization, punctuation.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.410
Instagram may be
a little sloppier.

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:51.270
And then Twitter is just an
emoji, all caps landfill.

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:53.670
BEN THORNEWILL: It's
a total free-for-all.

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:54.240
AARON ZEMACH: So we
are going to start

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.406
taking audience questions
in just a minute if people

00:19:56.406 --> 00:19:58.290
want to start lining up.

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:00.000
While they do, though,
one more question.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.520
I guess as a result of having
this social media presence--

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.320
and you're very
engaged with your fans.

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:07.215
I see you at the merch table
after pretty much every show.

00:20:07.215 --> 00:20:08.850
Do you have any
particular memories

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:10.350
of interactions
with a fan that have

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:12.930
been meaningful in
some important way

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:16.504
or maybe crazy and unfortunate
in any particular way

00:20:16.504 --> 00:20:17.670
that stand out in your head?

00:20:21.202 --> 00:20:22.410
BEN THORNEWILL: You get both.

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:24.735
I mean, you have
the moments where--

00:20:24.735 --> 00:20:25.860
let me phrase it like this.

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:28.800
You forget that, or
as I often forget,

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.740
that music can have such
an actual, legitimate,

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:33.690
life-changing impact.

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.670
You know, you write
the song and then

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:38.370
you spend all this time
recording it and arranging it,

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:40.830
and we're in a van and we're
traveling and we're driving.

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:44.250
And all the detail, all the
mess, sort of takes over.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:46.230
And then you meet
somebody after show

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:49.510
who, without sort
of overexaggerating,

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:51.990
found a song at a time in
their life when they needed it.

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.620
You know?

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:54.570
And you get that feedback
of, for them, it's

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:56.140
like that saved my life.

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:59.790
Like it was there for a really
important part in my life.

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:01.950
And that's a really
beautiful thing

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:05.611
that can happen and sort of
pull me or any of us back in.

00:21:05.611 --> 00:21:06.360
Be like oh, right.

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:09.310
We're doing this for a
reason and this is great.

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.790
And then you have
people come up and be

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:16.470
so touchy-feely and grabby and
think they know you and try

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:17.924
to get you to their house.

00:21:17.924 --> 00:21:19.219
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:19.219 --> 00:21:20.760
And so you just
don't know who you're

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.593
going to talk to at the
end of a show, which

00:21:22.593 --> 00:21:23.596
is why we always go out.

00:21:23.596 --> 00:21:25.187
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:25.187 --> 00:21:26.020
AARON ZEMACH: Great.

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:27.120
Well, while we're
waiting for questions,

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.411
we talked about Queen and
how big an influence that was

00:21:29.411 --> 00:21:30.300
for you guys.

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:32.850
If you had to choose another
artist or musician that you

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:35.490
feel like right now is being
a big influence on the music

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:40.170
you're creating, what
other artists come to mind?

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:42.960
TOMMY SIEGEL: So this is
sort of a cop out answer,

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:46.080
but I've been thinking about
this as this record has

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.670
been finally finished.

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:50.400
Is that usually with
a record, I feel

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:54.524
like we've explored a sound and
I'm ready for the next thing.

00:21:54.524 --> 00:21:56.940
And what to me is fun about
this record is I'm like, well,

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:59.760
I could make another
record like that tomorrow.

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:03.810
So honestly, I
think it really felt

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:06.360
like we cracked something
new open with this record

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.283
that we're going
to keep exploring.

00:22:08.283 --> 00:22:09.250
AARON ZEMACH: Awesome.

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:11.204
So we have a question over here.

00:22:11.204 --> 00:22:12.088
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:22:12.088 --> 00:22:14.667
Thanks a lot for coming and
just for being a great band.

00:22:14.667 --> 00:22:16.250
We've been to a lot
of your live shows

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:17.182
and really love your music.

00:22:17.182 --> 00:22:18.140
BEN THORNEWILL: Thanks.

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:20.509
AUDIENCE: So kind of
a two-part question.

00:22:20.509 --> 00:22:22.050
Since you've done
so many live shows,

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:24.270
I'm curious is there
a song that you

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:26.430
love performing live the most?

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:29.250
And then is there one that maybe
you don't hate performing it,

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:31.620
but it's most loved by
crowds but you're like,

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:35.145
well, we could stop playing
that and I'd be happy about it.

00:22:35.145 --> 00:22:37.770
BEN THORNEWILL: I think before
I get into specifics, each of us

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:41.400
has a song that we
never want to play,

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.530
and it's always a conversation.

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:46.680
There's a song called
"The Popular Thing," which

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.410
is from our second record.

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:50.540
And not to throw you--

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:50.880
JESSE KRISTIN: No.

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.455
BEN THORNEWILL:
But Jesse hates it.

00:22:52.455 --> 00:22:54.030
He doesn't ever want to play it.

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:54.420
JESSE KRISTIN:
No, I don't like--

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:54.900
BEN THORNEWILL: He
likes the song--

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:55.040
JESSE KRISTIN: --playing it.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:55.810
I like the song.

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:56.850
BEN THORNEWILL: Never
wants to play it--

00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:57.520
JESSE KRISTIN: I
don't want to play it.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.335
BEN THORNEWILL: And it's such
a played out conversation

00:23:00.335 --> 00:23:01.710
that it's not
worth the argument.

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:02.650
We never play it.

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:04.650
TOMMY SIEGEL: I mean,
it's become a running joke

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:06.485
right before we go
on stage is like,

00:23:06.485 --> 00:23:07.860
want to throw
"Popular Thing" in?

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:08.940
BEN THORNEWILL: Yeah, let's
do "The Popular Thing."

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:10.410
JESSE KRISTIN: We're about
to get so many requests

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:11.211
for "Popular Thing.

00:23:11.211 --> 00:23:11.711
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:11.711 --> 00:23:12.604
Killing me.

00:23:12.604 --> 00:23:14.020
BEN THORNEWILL:
But then there are

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:16.103
songs that sort of all--
for me, "Good Day," which

00:23:16.103 --> 00:23:17.730
is the first from
our first record.

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:19.110
I always love playing it.

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:22.485
It feels special, it feels
emblematic of everything

00:23:22.485 --> 00:23:24.225
that we've done, and it always--

00:23:24.225 --> 00:23:26.020
it works, for whatever reason.

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:26.984
So that stays with me.

00:23:26.984 --> 00:23:29.400
TOMMY SIEGEL: We always pull
songs in and out of rotation,

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.700
too, or try to anyway.

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:35.770
Like "Hold It In," I think
we were all really, really,

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:36.930
really sick of.

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:38.760
And then we stopped-- we haven't
played it for like two years,

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.051
and now we're playing it again.

00:23:40.051 --> 00:23:41.790
And we're like,
ah, this is great.

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:42.630
It's so easy.

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:45.510
JESSE KRISTIN: Those breaks are
good though because for Ben,

00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:47.100
he's played a song
so many times,

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:49.050
he'll forget the
lyrics, somehow.

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:50.760
Because it's like
that comfort zone.

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:53.874
So you've got to give "Hold
It In" a break, or "Victoria."

00:23:53.874 --> 00:23:55.290
TOMMY SIEGEL: The
one song I'm not

00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:58.440
sure is ever going to get
old for me playing live

00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:59.940
is "Hollywood," which is like--

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:00.360
AUDIENCE: Yes, yes.

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.443
TOMMY SIEGEL: Yeah, right?

00:24:01.443 --> 00:24:02.784
I mean, it's just like--

00:24:02.784 --> 00:24:04.950
it was like the first time
we played that song live,

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:07.260
it was just so obvious that
we were never not going

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.220
to play it ever again.

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:11.261
BEN THORNEWILL: For those
of you that don't know,

00:24:11.261 --> 00:24:14.070
Jesse comes out and croons to
the audience like a jazz lounge

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:15.390
singer for that song.

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:16.170
JESSE KRISTIN: I
don't hate that one.

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:17.122
I don't mind it.

00:24:17.122 --> 00:24:17.622
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:17.622 --> 00:24:18.491
We're good.

00:24:18.491 --> 00:24:19.240
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.310
Thank you.

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:22.430
AARON ZEMACH:
Question over here?

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:23.490
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:26.499
I've been listening to your
music for I guess a while.

00:24:26.499 --> 00:24:29.040
And one of the things that keeps
me coming back to the albums

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.900
and sharing them with
my friends is not only

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.800
the sound, which I really
like, but the narratives

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:37.170
and the stories behind
songs and albums.

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:40.032
Some of them are really
apocalyptic, you know?

00:24:40.032 --> 00:24:41.490
And so I was
wondering if you could

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:44.760
talk a little bit about
a narrative or a story

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:45.540
behind an album?

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:48.930
Either an old one
or this new one.

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:52.140
TOMMY SIEGEL: Well, I know
the narrative thing, I think,

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:54.682
is particularly evident
on our first record.

00:24:54.682 --> 00:24:56.640
For those who don't know,
it's called "Let Live

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.470
and Let Ghosts."

00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:01.140
And that record was--

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:04.026
we were away from each other in
college for the only like nine

00:25:04.026 --> 00:25:06.400
month period that we were away
from each other in college

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:11.104
at all, and when
Ben was gone, you

00:25:11.104 --> 00:25:12.520
wrote "Good Day,"
and "Victoria--"

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:13.040
BEN THORNEWILL: "Victoria."

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:13.560
TOMMY SIEGEL: "--Hold It In."

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.540
You wrote-- I mean
all those songs were

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:17.682
from that period of time.

00:25:17.682 --> 00:25:19.140
And the same thing
happened for me,

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:22.440
but I was maybe being
a little OCD about it

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:25.350
and was writing a
full concept album

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:28.770
about the apocalypse,
which we then

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:33.270
divided up and trimmed down and
put parts of it on "Let Live

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:33.930
and Let Ghost."

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:37.290
But yeah, I was very
much a concept album guy

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:39.450
at that point in time.

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:44.810
And you can definitely hear
that on the first two records.

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:45.429
Yeah.

00:25:45.429 --> 00:25:47.470
The new record, by the
way, if anybody's curious,

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:50.170
is not a concept
record though, which

00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:52.210
I'm sorry to disappoint
anybody who was

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:54.204
hoping for our quadrophenia.

00:25:54.204 --> 00:25:56.370
JESSE KRISTIN: All the songs
are about horses, but--

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:57.949
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:57.949 --> 00:25:58.990
TOMMY SIEGEL: Not a plot.

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:00.050
It's just they're
all about horses.

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:01.540
BEN THORNEWILL:
It's just horses.

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:02.080
JESSE KRISTIN: Coincidence.

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:02.465
BEN THORNEWILL: Yup.

00:26:02.465 --> 00:26:02.654
AARON ZEMACH: All right.

00:26:02.654 --> 00:26:03.340
Thanks.

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:04.350
Question over here?

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:05.141
AUDIENCE: Hi, guys.

00:26:05.141 --> 00:26:06.530
Thanks for coming.

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:07.810
I was wondering if--

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:10.330
you said so this album
is more sort of free form

00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:13.900
and experimental, maybe.

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:16.570
Did you write anything in the
past that maybe resurfaced now

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:18.260
that didn't make
sense at the time

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:23.531
but now makes sense with
this more free form thing

00:26:23.531 --> 00:26:24.280
that you're doing?

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:24.610
BEN THORNEWILL: Yeah.

00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:25.401
I mean, it's funny.

00:26:25.401 --> 00:26:29.380
I think rarely-- we always--
whenever a song doesn't make it

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.150
on an old record,
we always think,

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:32.980
that's going to be
on the next record.

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:34.687
And it's never happened.

00:26:34.687 --> 00:26:36.520
And we are always holding
on to these songs.

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.312
I think you take,
or at least I take--

00:26:38.312 --> 00:26:39.520
and probably Tom takes, too--

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.830
like little pieces or
ideas from old songs

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:47.490
or structural concepts that
are out there and recycle them.

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:50.060
Because a lot of it ends up--
when you're writing a record

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:52.660
and then picking the songs for
the record, there's two parts.

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:55.480
We came into the record with
30, 40, 50 songs, something

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.730
like that, and then picking
the songs that we think

00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:01.300
are going to work
the best together.

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.804
And I think when you're
writing, you always think,

00:27:03.804 --> 00:27:05.470
no matter what, the
last thing you wrote

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:07.054
is the best thing
you've ever written,

00:27:07.054 --> 00:27:09.511
and you're probably never going
to write another song again

00:27:09.511 --> 00:27:10.180
in your life.

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:11.513
Like that's sort of the balance.

00:27:11.513 --> 00:27:15.010
And so I don't
know if we've ever

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:16.500
actually taken a
song from the past

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:18.800
and successfully
brought it back.

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.466
TOMMY SIEGEL: I don't think so.

00:27:20.466 --> 00:27:23.290
But I was thinking
about, recently, there's

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:26.920
a song that we used to play
in college that I was mentally

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:29.350
coming back to it for the
first time in like 12 years

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:34.450
and thinking, that
kind of could work now.

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:36.130
But it didn't-- for
whatever reason,

00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:38.837
it wasn't working
for us in 2008.

00:27:38.837 --> 00:27:40.795
But that's the first time
I've had that thought

00:27:40.795 --> 00:27:44.030
in I think our entire career.

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:45.532
So maybe in the future.

00:27:45.532 --> 00:27:46.240
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:46.450
BEN THORNEWILL: Yeah.

00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:47.159
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:27:47.159 --> 00:27:48.158
AARON ZEMACH: Over here.

00:27:48.158 --> 00:27:48.700
Hey.

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:49.990
AUDIENCE: Since
you're here at Google,

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:51.544
and you mentioned
social media, I

00:27:51.544 --> 00:27:53.710
wanted to kind of flip the
script and hear from you.

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:56.770
What's something that Google
and YouTube could do better

00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:59.230
to engage with
up-and-coming music

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:01.950
creators such as yourselves?

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:04.516
BEN THORNEWILL: Interesting.

00:28:04.516 --> 00:28:06.890
TOMMY SIEGEL: I think something
that would be interesting

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:14.150
would be to see if there is a
way to give music its own zone.

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:16.430
I just think it's not--

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:21.290
it's a space that's designed
for visuals and video and text,

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:24.630
and I think that
trying to compete

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:28.710
in that space with
audio is just--

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:31.350
I don't think there is like
an algorithmic solution.

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:34.710
I think it needs its
own space because people

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:36.870
need a different mental
space to explore music

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:39.600
than they do pictures of food.

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.982
And right now, we're competing
with pictures of food.

00:28:41.982 --> 00:28:43.440
BEN THORNEWILL:
And Kim Kardashian.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.450
TOMMY SIEGEL: And Kim
Kardashian, and pictures

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:48.150
of Kim Kardashian eating food.

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:49.650
So I would be
interested to see what

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:55.680
it would look like if Google
and Facebook and others maybe

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:59.940
tried to respect art in
its own space that is not

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:06.910
the same as the space that
pictures and advertising takes

00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:07.410
up.

00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:10.680
Because I guess my
feeling as a musician

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.800
is that the online
space sort of assumes

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:18.000
that we have the capital and
the resources of like Walmart

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.120
for advertising to
our own fan base.

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.490
And the return on
music, it's just not

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:26.550
the same financial return
as it is for things that

00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:29.200
are selling physical products.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.500
So I'd be interested to see
a space that allows music

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.712
to be in its own world.

00:29:33.712 --> 00:29:34.864
I think that would be fun.

00:29:34.864 --> 00:29:35.530
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:36.732
Thank you.

00:29:36.732 --> 00:29:38.040
AARON ZEMACH: Over here?

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:38.940
AUDIENCE: Hey, guys.

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:41.707
I'll ask two just
totally unrelated things.

00:29:41.707 --> 00:29:44.290
The first one being are we going
to hear more of Jesse singing

00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:45.160
on this new album?

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.200
Now that he broke
out with Hollywood

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:50.180
and has his own
kind of solo album?

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:54.490
And then the second one
being about the fan art.

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:56.440
As someone who's
actually made some,

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.940
I'm still trying to figure out
if it's just weird and creepy

00:29:58.940 --> 00:29:59.920
or like endearing.

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:02.345
And I'm curious what your
take is on that as well.

00:30:02.345 --> 00:30:03.970
TOMMY SIEGEL: Well,
I guess my question

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:05.678
for you would be do
you think it's creepy

00:30:05.678 --> 00:30:07.881
that we make our own fan
art for our own band?

00:30:07.881 --> 00:30:08.880
AUDIENCE: No, I love it.

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.700
I'm pretty egocentric myself.

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:13.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:15.784
BEN THORNEWILL: Is it
creepy when I sing?

00:30:15.784 --> 00:30:18.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:20.050
JESSE KRISTIN: No, this--

00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:22.310
well, I don't want
to spoil it too much.

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:25.780
But on this record, I'll
be singing background

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:28.190
vocal parts more than
previous records.

00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:30.160
But there is not a
Hollywood-like moment

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:31.510
on this one.

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:32.860
That isn't to say that--

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:34.100
BEN THORNEWILL: The next
record won't be all you.

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:34.645
TOMMY SIEGEL: I feel--

00:30:34.645 --> 00:30:35.620
JESSE KRISTIN:
[INAUDIBLE] all me.

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:37.161
TOMMY SIEGEL: I feel
his Phil Collins

00:30:37.161 --> 00:30:41.280
moment just like swelling
and ready to arrive.

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:42.440
That's how I feel.

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.440
BEN THORNEWILL: But as
far as the fan art thing,

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:45.341
we still love it.

00:30:45.341 --> 00:30:47.340
I think when-- and Tommy
was saying it dried up.

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:50.220
But that's not something
that we're happy about.

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:51.970
I mean, it's like,
oh, they've stopped

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:53.350
sending us stuff or making--

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:56.680
we want-- we love that
because we too are egocentric.

00:30:56.680 --> 00:31:00.550
And the more we can see
of us, about us, is great.

00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:01.300
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:02.290
I'll keep it up then.

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:03.910
BEN THORNEWILL: Yeah, thanks.

00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:04.130
AARON ZEMACH: Awesome.

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:05.421
Well, thanks for the questions.

00:31:05.421 --> 00:31:07.450
It's been so great
talking, but would you guys

00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:09.620
mind if we clear the stage
and we can hear a few songs?

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:10.210
Think that would be great.

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:11.076
BEN THORNEWILL:
Yeah, we'll do it.

00:31:11.076 --> 00:31:12.326
AARON ZEMACH: Thank you, guys.

00:31:12.326 --> 00:31:14.052
[APPLAUSE]

[APPLAUSE]

00:34:26.315 --> 00:34:30.530
TOMMY SIEGEL: So this is another
song from our new record,

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:33.780
and it's about growing
up, getting older.

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:35.454
And it's called "Boring."

BEN THORNEWILL: Thank you.

00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:28.930
So we have one more song left.

00:38:28.930 --> 00:38:30.460
Thank you all so
much for being here

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:34.420
and listening and asking
questions and giving us

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:35.309
tricky water bottles.

00:38:35.309 --> 00:38:36.100
All sorts of stuff.

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.237
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:38.237 --> 00:38:39.820
This last one's
called "Fred Astaire."
