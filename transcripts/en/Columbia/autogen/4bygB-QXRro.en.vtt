and of course the hiv/aids epidemic
impacted TB but we were able to design a

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:21.680
issues that may be of interest to you
 

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.500
issues that may be of interest to you
that are under the jurisdiction of FDA

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:23.510
that are under the jurisdiction of FDA
 

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:27.960
that are under the jurisdiction of FDA
but that I haven't had time to touch on

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:27.970
but that I haven't had time to touch on
 

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:30.880
but that I haven't had time to touch on
so let me begin sort of near the

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:30.890
so let me begin sort of near the
 

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:33.460
so let me begin sort of near the
beginning and try to frame some of our

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:33.470
beginning and try to frame some of our
 

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:35.590
beginning and try to frame some of our
issues at FDA in a broad historical

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:35.600
issues at FDA in a broad historical
 

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.140
issues at FDA in a broad historical
context with a few concrete examples and

context with a few concrete examples and
 

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:40.000
context with a few concrete examples and
I think it's striking to note that like

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:40.010
I think it's striking to note that like
 

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:43.060
I think it's striking to note that like

responding to emerging infectious
 

00:43:57.449 --> 00:43:59.390
responding to emerging infectious
disease threats and came to know the

00:43:59.390 --> 00:43:59.400
disease threats and came to know the
 

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:03.049
disease threats and came to know the
work of Stephen Morse and his

00:44:03.049 --> 00:44:03.059
work of Stephen Morse and his
 

00:44:03.059 --> 00:44:05.499

but as health commissioner I really saw

00:44:08.239 --> 00:44:08.249
but as health commissioner I really saw
 

00:44:08.249 --> 00:44:11.209
but as health commissioner I really saw
that New York City was an important hub

00:44:11.209 --> 00:44:11.219
that New York City was an important hub
 

00:44:11.219 --> 00:44:15.170

that we lack the medical countermeasures

you could turn a bit to your time at the
 

00:53:41.730 --> 00:53:45.440
you could turn a bit to your time at the
nuclear threat initiative and in the

nuclear threat initiative and in the
 

00:53:45.450 --> 00:53:48.080
nuclear threat initiative and in the
past you've talked about the dangers of

00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:48.090
past you've talked about the dangers of
 

00:53:48.090 --> 00:53:50.740

and i was wondering number one if you

00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:00.990
and i was wondering number one if you
 

00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:02.600
and i was wondering number one if you
think the kind of frameworks that we

00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:02.610
think the kind of frameworks that we
 

00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:06.200
think the kind of frameworks that we
have internationally have been adequate

00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:06.210
have internationally have been adequate
 

00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:07.400

which seemed to worsen with new
 

00:54:14.130 --> 00:54:17.810
which seemed to worsen with new
technology and number two now given your

00:54:17.810 --> 00:54:17.820
technology and number two now given your
 

00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:20.030
technology and number two now given your
time at the FDA what really keeps you up

00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:20.040

00:54:22.770 --> 00:54:25.790
at night is it a doomsday terrorist
scenario that seems to you know make a

00:54:25.790 --> 00:54:25.800
scenario that seems to you know make a
 

00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:28.040
scenario that seems to you know make a
lot of the plot lines of shows like 24

00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:28.050
lot of the plot lines of shows like 24
 

00:54:28.050 --> 00:54:31.040
lot of the plot lines of shows like 24
or is it something more like the 1982

00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:31.050
or is it something more like the 1982

you know early on you know did raise

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:43.530
you know early on you know did raise
 

00:54:43.530 --> 00:54:46.690
you know early on you know did raise
questions about the need for awareness

00:54:46.690 --> 00:54:46.700
questions about the need for awareness
 

00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:52.730
questions about the need for awareness
that as we advanced our knowledge and

00:54:52.730 --> 00:54:52.740
that as we advanced our knowledge and
 

00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:57.590
that as we advanced our knowledge and
understanding of biomedical research and

emerging technologies we needed to

00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:03.330
emerging technologies we needed to
 

00:55:03.330 --> 00:55:06.470
emerging technologies we needed to
recognize that there were potential miss

00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:06.480
recognize that there were potential miss
 

00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:09.740
recognize that there were potential miss
applications of this research I think

00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:09.750
applications of this research I think
 

00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:12.020
applications of this research I think
it's a continuing concern and it's it's

00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:12.030
it's a continuing concern and it's it's
 

00:55:12.030 --> 00:55:14.600
it's a continuing concern and it's it's
not unique to the area of life sciences

00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:14.610
not unique to the area of life sciences
 

00:55:14.610 --> 00:55:16.670
not unique to the area of life sciences
I think you know almost every new

00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:16.680
I think you know almost every new
 

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:19.310
I think you know almost every new
technology that's been developed has had

00:55:19.310 --> 00:55:19.320
technology that's been developed has had
 

00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:21.710
technology that's been developed has had
some miss application as well but I

00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:21.720
some miss application as well but I
 

00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:26.540
some miss application as well but I
think it is it was it was very important

00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:26.550
think it is it was it was very important
 

00:55:26.550 --> 00:55:29.960
think it is it was it was very important
to begin to engage in the discussions

00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:29.970
to begin to engage in the discussions
 

00:55:29.970 --> 00:55:33.410
to begin to engage in the discussions
so that people doing the research you

00:55:33.410 --> 00:55:33.420
so that people doing the research you
 

00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:40.430
so that people doing the research you
know recognized the complexity of some

00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:40.440
know recognized the complexity of some
 

00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:44.000
know recognized the complexity of some
of the new capabilities and that we try

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:44.010
of the new capabilities and that we try
 

00:55:44.010 --> 00:55:46.550
of the new capabilities and that we try
to develop you know some ways of

00:55:46.550 --> 00:55:46.560
to develop you know some ways of
 

00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:48.440
to develop you know some ways of
thinking about it both in terms of

thinking about it both in terms of
 

00:55:48.450 --> 00:55:51.859
thinking about it both in terms of
training of young scientists and also in

00:55:51.859 --> 00:55:51.869
training of young scientists and also in
 

00:55:51.869 --> 00:55:58.790

terms of frameworks for governance and
 

00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:01.430
terms of frameworks for governance and
oversight in some ways I'm not as close

there was a lot of understandable
 

00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:13.609
there was a lot of understandable

there are many good elements in terms of

attacks using biological agents and we

01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:13.590
attacks using biological agents and we
 

01:05:13.590 --> 01:05:15.410

one point you know have been interested
 

01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:23.090
one point you know have been interested
and have worked on biological weapons

01:05:23.090 --> 01:05:23.100
and have worked on biological weapons
 

01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:26.170
and have worked on biological weapons
programs and it's a very unique

01:05:26.170 --> 01:05:26.180
programs and it's a very unique
 

01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:31.610

asymmetrical threat potentially that you

01:05:31.610 --> 01:05:31.620
asymmetrical threat potentially that you
 

01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:33.820

develop biological weapons potentially
 

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:45.140
develop biological weapons potentially
and so it can become an attractive tool

01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:45.150
and so it can become an attractive tool
 

01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:48.860
and so it can become an attractive tool
of terrorism as well but it's really

01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:48.870
of terrorism as well but it's really
 

01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:55.670
of terrorism as well but it's really
only attractive as a weapon of terrorism

01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680
only attractive as a weapon of terrorism
 

01:05:55.680 --> 01:06:00.620
only attractive as a weapon of terrorism
if it can produce panic and terror and

and critical institutions and take a

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:10.890
and critical institutions and take a
 

01:06:10.890 --> 01:06:14.360
and critical institutions and take a
huge toll on both life and the economic

01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:14.370
huge toll on both life and the economic
 

01:06:14.370 --> 01:06:21.350
huge toll on both life and the economic
health of an area as well and so if

01:06:21.350 --> 01:06:21.360
health of an area as well and so if
 

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:24.590
health of an area as well and so if
we're unprepared it is guaranteed that

01:06:24.590 --> 01:06:24.600
we're unprepared it is guaranteed that
 

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:27.620
we're unprepared it is guaranteed that
all of those negative consequences can

01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:27.630
all of those negative consequences can
 

01:06:27.630 --> 01:06:28.210
all of those negative consequences can
and

01:06:28.210 --> 01:06:28.220
and
 

01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:33.970
and
will unfold in response to a large or

01:06:33.970 --> 01:06:33.980
will unfold in response to a large or
 

01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:38.470
will unfold in response to a large or
even a small attack but if we are

01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:38.480
even a small attack but if we are
 

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:40.570
even a small attack but if we are
prepared and we can mobilize quickly or

01:06:40.570 --> 01:06:40.580
prepared and we can mobilize quickly or
 

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:44.440
prepared and we can mobilize quickly or
if we have the tools to put in place a

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:44.450
if we have the tools to put in place a
 

01:06:44.450 --> 01:06:46.240
if we have the tools to put in place a
prevention strategy before something

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:46.250
prevention strategy before something
 

01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:49.359
prevention strategy before something
ever happens then the use of a

01:06:49.359 --> 01:06:49.369
ever happens then the use of a
 

01:06:49.369 --> 01:06:51.580
ever happens then the use of a
biological weapon as a the terrorist

01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:51.590
biological weapon as a the terrorist
 

01:06:51.590 --> 01:06:53.020
biological weapon as a the terrorist
agent is going to be a lot less

01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:53.030
agent is going to be a lot less
 

01:06:53.030 --> 01:06:55.089
agent is going to be a lot less
attractive and that's what I meant by

01:06:55.089 --> 01:06:55.099
attractive and that's what I meant by
 

01:06:55.099 --> 01:06:57.700
attractive and that's what I meant by
deterrence and I think you know in the

01:06:57.700 --> 01:06:57.710
deterrence and I think you know in the
 

01:06:57.710 --> 01:07:00.640
deterrence and I think you know in the
real world we have to take this threat

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:00.650
real world we have to take this threat
 

01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:03.760
real world we have to take this threat
very seriously we know it has happened

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:03.770
very seriously we know it has happened
 

01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:05.680
very seriously we know it has happened
has happened over the course of history

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:05.690
has happened over the course of history
 

01:07:05.690 --> 01:07:09.160
has happened over the course of history
and it's happened in our lifetimes in

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:09.170
and it's happened in our lifetimes in
 

01:07:09.170 --> 01:07:12.460
and it's happened in our lifetimes in
this country many of the doomsday

01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:12.470
this country many of the doomsday
 

01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:14.380
this country many of the doomsday
scenarios that that people have talked

01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:14.390
scenarios that that people have talked
 

01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:16.900
scenarios that that people have talked
about and I've certainly played in a lot

01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:16.910
about and I've certainly played in a lot
 

01:07:16.910 --> 01:07:18.849
about and I've certainly played in a lot
of exercises that were truly

01:07:18.849 --> 01:07:18.859
of exercises that were truly
 

01:07:18.859 --> 01:07:20.920
of exercises that were truly
catastrophic using biological agents

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:20.930
catastrophic using biological agents
 

01:07:20.930 --> 01:07:22.960
catastrophic using biological agents
those kinds of scenarios have a nun

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:22.970
those kinds of scenarios have a nun
 

01:07:22.970 --> 01:07:26.470
those kinds of scenarios have a nun
folder hopefully they never will and I

01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480
folder hopefully they never will and I
 

01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:29.770
folder hopefully they never will and I
think that as a nation will be a mistake

01:07:29.770 --> 01:07:29.780

toward addressing those kinds of
 

01:07:38.869 --> 01:07:41.170
toward addressing those kinds of
potentially catastrophic threats but I

01:07:41.170 --> 01:07:41.180
potentially catastrophic threats but I
 

01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:42.730
potentially catastrophic threats but I
think it's very important for us to

01:07:42.730 --> 01:07:42.740
think it's very important for us to
 

01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:43.960
think it's very important for us to

about in terms of the FDA role which is
 

01:08:05.030 --> 01:08:08.170

significant investments i think we want
 

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:35.769
significant investments i think we want
to be investing in things that will help

to be investing in things that will help
 

01:08:35.779 --> 01:08:37.970

disease threats because I think that we

01:08:40.249 --> 01:08:40.259
disease threats because I think that we
 

01:08:40.259 --> 01:08:41.870
disease threats because I think that we
know that mother nature can be a very

know that mother nature can be a very
 

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:45.200

powerful terrorist in her own right and
that for a lot of reasons we will

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:49.890
that for a lot of reasons we will

vaccines and other medical products we
all know that the price is a huge

01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:08.340
all know that the price is a huge

obviously has been a huge contribution

01:10:29.570 --> 01:10:29.580
obviously has been a huge contribution
 

01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:34.580
obviously has been a huge contribution
to making important drugs more available

01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:34.590
to making important drugs more available
 

01:10:34.590 --> 01:10:37.990

and in this country the shift from

01:10:37.990 --> 01:10:38.000
and in this country the shift from
 

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.300
and in this country the shift from
innovator brand drugs to generics has

01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:41.310
innovator brand drugs to generics has
 

01:10:41.310 --> 01:10:42.800
innovator brand drugs to generics has
been quite extraordinary I think about

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:42.810
been quite extraordinary I think about
 

01:10:42.810 --> 01:10:44.630
been quite extraordinary I think about
eighty percent of the prescriptions

01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:44.640
eighty percent of the prescriptions
 

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:46.290

01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:49.140
written in this country
they are for generic drugs and that has

01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:49.150
they are for generic drugs and that has
 

01:10:49.150 --> 01:10:51.780
they are for generic drugs and that has
you know really brought down costs of

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:51.790
you know really brought down costs of
 

01:10:51.790 --> 01:10:56.370
you know really brought down costs of
drugs and of course as part of the

01:10:56.370 --> 01:10:56.380
drugs and of course as part of the
 

01:10:56.380 --> 01:10:59.010
drugs and of course as part of the
response to hiv/aids there was a major

01:10:59.010 --> 01:10:59.020
response to hiv/aids there was a major
 

01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:02.970
response to hiv/aids there was a major
effort to make generic drugs available

01:11:02.970 --> 01:11:02.980
effort to make generic drugs available
 

01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:06.510
effort to make generic drugs available
in the health world an FDA played a very

01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:06.520
in the health world an FDA played a very
 

01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:09.709
in the health world an FDA played a very
significant role in that and we approved

01:11:09.709 --> 01:11:09.719
significant role in that and we approved
 

01:11:09.719 --> 01:11:11.850
significant role in that and we approved
through a mechanism that's called

01:11:11.850 --> 01:11:11.860
through a mechanism that's called
 

01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:13.560
through a mechanism that's called
tentative approval but it's not

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:13.570
tentative approval but it's not
 

01:11:13.570 --> 01:11:17.939
tentative approval but it's not
tentative it's but over a hundred I

01:11:17.939 --> 01:11:17.949
tentative it's but over a hundred I

think different different products as
 

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.890
think different different products as
part of that effort to get more drugs to

01:11:25.890 --> 01:11:25.900
part of that effort to get more drugs to
 

01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:28.669
part of that effort to get more drugs to
people who need them with respect to the

hiv/aids epidemic in in the developing
 

01:11:33.489 --> 01:11:37.439
hiv/aids epidemic in in the developing
world you know a huge issue now and

world you know a huge issue now and
 

01:11:37.449 --> 01:11:41.760
world you know a huge issue now and
going forward is how can we are speaking

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:41.770
going forward is how can we are speaking
 

01:11:41.770 --> 01:11:45.780
going forward is how can we are speaking
really with my FDA had on you know how

01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:45.790
really with my FDA had on you know how
 

01:11:45.790 --> 01:11:49.530
really with my FDA had on you know how
can we help support efforts to bring

01:11:49.530 --> 01:11:49.540
can we help support efforts to bring
 

01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:54.240
can we help support efforts to bring
down the cost of developing new medical

01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:54.250
down the cost of developing new medical
 

01:11:54.250 --> 01:11:59.129
down the cost of developing new medical
products and and do it in a timely er

01:11:59.129 --> 01:11:59.139
products and and do it in a timely er
 

01:11:59.139 --> 01:12:02.010
products and and do it in a timely er
way as well because time is money when

01:12:02.010 --> 01:12:02.020
way as well because time is money when
 

01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:05.549
way as well because time is money when
it comes to to drug research and

01:12:05.549 --> 01:12:05.559
it comes to to drug research and
 

01:12:05.559 --> 01:12:08.819
it comes to to drug research and
development and and in my mind that

01:12:08.819 --> 01:12:08.829
development and and in my mind that
 

01:12:08.829 --> 01:12:12.839
development and and in my mind that
means applying better science to the

01:12:12.839 --> 01:12:12.849
means applying better science to the
 

01:12:12.849 --> 01:12:15.419
means applying better science to the
process of drug development and review

01:12:15.419 --> 01:12:15.429
process of drug development and review
 

01:12:15.429 --> 01:12:19.379
process of drug development and review
and also for FDA to take a very serious

01:12:19.379 --> 01:12:19.389
and also for FDA to take a very serious
 

01:12:19.389 --> 01:12:21.780
and also for FDA to take a very serious
look at our regulatory pathways and how

01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:21.790
look at our regulatory pathways and how
 

01:12:21.790 --> 01:12:24.060
look at our regulatory pathways and how
can they be streamlined and modernize

01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:24.070
can they be streamlined and modernize
 

01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:26.839
can they be streamlined and modernize
partly through the use of better science

there's debate about you know the sort
 

01:12:37.389 --> 01:12:40.530
there's debate about you know the sort
of ballpark of the numbers but it it

they have to start on those drugs and so
it's not surprising that there may be

taking the drug at the same time that
 

01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:45.430
taking the drug at the same time that
they're taking other drugs because many

they're taking other drugs because many
people that have one chronic condition

people that have one chronic condition
 

01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:49.750
people that have one chronic condition
have many chronic conditions and also

01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:49.760
have many chronic conditions and also

taking it for a prolonged period of time
so this notion of our responsibility for

so this notion of our responsibility for
 

01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:56.920
so this notion of our responsibility for
the life cycle of a product becomes

01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:56.930
the life cycle of a product becomes

progression of a disease is also
 

01:16:51.550 --> 01:16:53.800
progression of a disease is also
something of a challenge because you

something of a challenge because you
 

01:16:53.810 --> 01:16:55.900
something of a challenge because you

01:19:47.090 --> 01:19:47.100
historical question i guess the ones
 

01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:49.040
historical question i guess the ones
that have been asked already it's about

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:49.050
that have been asked already it's about
 

01:19:49.050 --> 01:19:50.810

the regulation of the blood supply by
 

01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:54.470
the regulation of the blood supply by
the fda and i understand that when the

the fda and i understand that when the
 

01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:57.350

aids pandemic first broke out in the
 

01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:59.000
aids pandemic first broke out in the
late 70s that there is a lot of fear

01:19:59.000 --> 01:19:59.010
late 70s that there is a lot of fear
 

01:19:59.010 --> 01:20:00.890
late 70s that there is a lot of fear
about it and that the blood supply was

01:20:00.890 --> 01:20:00.900
about it and that the blood supply was
 

01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:02.300
about it and that the blood supply was
regulated in a way that kind of

01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:02.310
regulated in a way that kind of
 

01:20:02.310 --> 01:20:05.030
regulated in a way that kind of
reflected that fear with a different

01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:07.290
community groups and i was wondering if
 

01:20:07.290 --> 01:20:08.479
community groups and i was wondering if
you could touch a little bit upon how

you could touch a little bit upon how
 

01:20:08.489 --> 01:20:11.300
you could touch a little bit upon how
that decision was made to to make those

01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:11.310
that decision was made to to make those
 

01:20:11.310 --> 01:20:14.350
that decision was made to to make those
referrals and the reanalysis of those

referrals and the reanalysis of those
 

01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:16.879
referrals and the reanalysis of those
decisions since then and kind of looking

01:20:16.879 --> 01:20:16.889
decisions since then and kind of looking
 

01:20:16.889 --> 01:20:18.620

FDA's mission and and actually i don't
 

01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:31.070

think i mentioned it when i was talking

01:20:31.070 --> 01:20:31.080
think i mentioned it when i was talking
 

01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:32.780
think i mentioned it when i was talking
about the long list of things that we do

about the long list of things that we do
 

01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:34.220
about the long list of things that we do
but it's something that's that's very

but it's something that's that's very
 

01:20:34.230 --> 01:20:37.570
but it's something that's that's very
important and can be quite complex

01:20:37.570 --> 01:20:37.580
important and can be quite complex

complex scientifically in terms of what
 

01:20:41.010 --> 01:20:43.310
complex scientifically in terms of what
should we be screening for and do we

01:20:43.310 --> 01:20:43.320
should we be screening for and do we
 

01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:46.490

actually have the Diagnostics to enable

01:20:46.490 --> 01:20:46.500
actually have the Diagnostics to enable
 

01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:49.160
actually have the Diagnostics to enable
us to meaningfully screen and how much

01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:49.170
us to meaningfully screen and how much
 

01:20:49.170 --> 01:20:56.090
us to meaningfully screen and how much
risk is acceptable in terms of exposures

01:20:56.090 --> 01:20:56.100
risk is acceptable in terms of exposures
 

01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:58.310
risk is acceptable in terms of exposures
through the blood supply and do we have

01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.320
through the blood supply and do we have
 

01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:02.419

potential concerns about the safety of
 

01:21:08.850 --> 01:21:12.260
potential concerns about the safety of
the blood supply and then there's you

01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:12.270
the blood supply and then there's you
 

01:21:12.270 --> 01:21:17.030
the blood supply and then there's you
know a lot of issues about the

01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:17.040
know a lot of issues about the
 

01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:18.830
know a lot of issues about the
management of the blood supply as well

01:21:18.830 --> 01:21:18.840
management of the blood supply as well
 

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:20.990
management of the blood supply as well
and we are very involved in shortages of

01:21:20.990 --> 01:21:21.000
and we are very involved in shortages of
 

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.090
and we are very involved in shortages of
different kinds of blood components and

01:21:23.090 --> 01:21:23.100
different kinds of blood components and
 

01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:26.360
different kinds of blood components and
and how to address those and how to

01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:26.370
and how to address those and how to
 

01:21:26.370 --> 01:21:28.459
and how to address those and how to
monitor to anticipate when there may be

monitor to anticipate when there may be
 

01:21:28.469 --> 01:21:33.169
monitor to anticipate when there may be

international partnerships I'm wondering
if you could speak to what you would

if you could speak to what you would
 

01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:06.100
if you could speak to what you would
consider the biggest barrier to

well you know I think Trust is always a
 

01:25:22.789 --> 01:25:29.609
well you know I think Trust is always a
barrier to partnership and I think past

01:25:29.609 --> 01:25:29.619
barrier to partnership and I think past
 

01:25:29.619 --> 01:25:33.040

working relationships or lack thereof
 

01:25:33.050 --> 01:25:38.830
working relationships or lack thereof
can be a barrier to cooperation I think

01:25:38.830 --> 01:25:38.840
can be a barrier to cooperation I think
 

01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:48.219
can be a barrier to cooperation I think
a failure to recognize and act with an

that it's not so much about barriers
it's the eagerness for collaboration

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:12.010
it's the eagerness for collaboration
 

01:26:12.010 --> 01:26:16.260
it's the eagerness for collaboration
because we all are facing the same

of regulatory questions so that we can
 

01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:13.920
of regulatory questions so that we can
have confidence in the outcomes and not

have confidence in the outcomes and not
 

01:27:13.930 --> 01:27:16.200

just look at the process because in the

just look at the process because in the
in the realm that I work in sometimes

in the realm that I work in sometimes
 

01:27:18.370 --> 01:27:20.580
in the realm that I work in sometimes
we've gotten bogged down because we do

01:27:20.580 --> 01:27:20.590
we've gotten bogged down because we do
 

01:27:20.590 --> 01:27:23.220
we've gotten bogged down because we do
things differently but it doesn't

01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:23.230
things differently but it doesn't
 

01:27:23.230 --> 01:27:24.960
things differently but it doesn't
necessarily mean that one is right and

01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:24.970
necessarily mean that one is right and
 

01:27:24.970 --> 01:27:26.760
necessarily mean that one is right and
one is wrong if you look at the outcomes

01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:26.770
one is wrong if you look at the outcomes
 

01:27:26.770 --> 01:27:29.460
one is wrong if you look at the outcomes
you know one that that I think is kind

01:27:29.460 --> 01:27:29.470
you know one that that I think is kind
 

01:27:29.470 --> 01:27:32.310
you know one that that I think is kind
of interesting certainly nothing I never

01:27:32.310 --> 01:27:32.320
of interesting certainly nothing I never
 

01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:35.370
of interesting certainly nothing I never
thought about before was that if you're

01:27:35.370 --> 01:27:35.380
thought about before was that if you're
 

01:27:35.380 --> 01:27:38.220
thought about before was that if you're
looking at sea food safety like oysters

01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:38.230
looking at sea food safety like oysters
 

01:27:38.230 --> 01:27:40.890
looking at sea food safety like oysters
you can either test the oyster meat or

01:27:40.890 --> 01:27:40.900
you can either test the oyster meat or
 

01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:42.900
you can either test the oyster meat or
you can test the water in which the

01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:42.910
you can test the water in which the
 

01:27:42.910 --> 01:27:48.870
you can test the water in which the
oyster is grown and there have been

01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:48.880
oyster is grown and there have been
 

01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:51.900
oyster is grown and there have been
violent disagreements about what's the

01:27:51.900 --> 01:27:51.910
violent disagreements about what's the
 

01:27:51.910 --> 01:27:54.060
violent disagreements about what's the
right way to do it but at the end of the

01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:54.070
right way to do it but at the end of the
 

01:27:54.070 --> 01:27:58.110
right way to do it but at the end of the
day the question is you know are they

01:27:58.110 --> 01:27:58.120
day the question is you know are they
 

01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:00.060
day the question is you know are they
wasters safe to eat and I think you know

01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:00.070
wasters safe to eat and I think you know
 

01:28:00.070 --> 01:28:02.520
wasters safe to eat and I think you know
so we need to focus on outcomes one of

01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:02.530
so we need to focus on outcomes one of
 

01:28:02.530 --> 01:28:04.710
so we need to focus on outcomes one of
the things I mentioned is this notion of

01:28:04.710 --> 01:28:04.720
the things I mentioned is this notion of
 

01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:06.210
the things I mentioned is this notion of
you know really strengthening regulatory

01:28:06.210 --> 01:28:06.220
you know really strengthening regulatory
 

01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:08.580
you know really strengthening regulatory
capacity and I think that in from the

01:28:08.580 --> 01:28:08.590
capacity and I think that in from the
 

01:28:08.590 --> 01:28:10.380
capacity and I think that in from the
FDA perspective that is really really

01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:10.390
FDA perspective that is really really
 

01:28:10.390 --> 01:28:11.940
FDA perspective that is really really
key and I think it has huge

01:28:11.940 --> 01:28:11.950
key and I think it has huge
 

01:28:11.950 --> 01:28:14.160
key and I think it has huge
ramifications that go beyond just what

01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:14.170
ramifications that go beyond just what
 

01:28:14.170 --> 01:28:15.030
ramifications that go beyond just what
matters for the

01:28:15.030 --> 01:28:15.040
matters for the
 

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:17.100
matters for the
da and I'm very excited about that

01:28:17.100 --> 01:28:17.110
da and I'm very excited about that
 

01:28:17.110 --> 01:28:20.370
da and I'm very excited about that
opportunity and I think that when we can

01:28:20.370 --> 01:28:20.380
opportunity and I think that when we can
 

01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:23.850
opportunity and I think that when we can
engage in that kind of activity which is

01:28:23.850 --> 01:28:23.860
engage in that kind of activity which is
 

01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:26.670
engage in that kind of activity which is
proactive and constructive and really

01:28:26.670 --> 01:28:26.680
proactive and constructive and really
 

01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:28.230
proactive and constructive and really
makes a difference to the countries that

01:28:28.230 --> 01:28:28.240
makes a difference to the countries that
 

01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:32.190
makes a difference to the countries that
we're working with then I think there's

01:28:32.190 --> 01:28:32.200
we're working with then I think there's
 

01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:35.190
we're working with then I think there's
a greater willingness to collaborate in

01:28:35.190 --> 01:28:35.200
a greater willingness to collaborate in
 

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:38.190
a greater willingness to collaborate in
other ways you know for example sharing

01:28:38.190 --> 01:28:38.200
other ways you know for example sharing
 

01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:41.540
other ways you know for example sharing
of specimens has been an issue sometimes

01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:41.550
of specimens has been an issue sometimes
 

01:28:41.550 --> 01:28:45.510
of specimens has been an issue sometimes
you know in the context of pandemic flu

01:28:45.510 --> 01:28:45.520
you know in the context of pandemic flu
 

01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:47.610
you know in the context of pandemic flu
certainly the unwillingness of certain

you know they you know serve what's in
 

01:28:56.260 --> 01:28:57.410
you know they you know serve what's in
it for us and it's an understandable

01:28:57.410 --> 01:28:57.420
it for us and it's an understandable

reaction that concerned that that the
 

01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:03.240
reaction that concerned that that the
virus that might have been found in

01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:03.250
virus that might have been found in
 

01:29:03.250 --> 01:29:06.120
virus that might have been found in
their country would go to helping make a

01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:06.130
their country would go to helping make a
 

01:29:06.130 --> 01:29:09.450
their country would go to helping make a
better vaccine for others but what about

01:29:09.450 --> 01:29:09.460
better vaccine for others but what about
 

01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:13.500
better vaccine for others but what about
of their populations and so I think you

01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:13.510
of their populations and so I think you
 

01:29:13.510 --> 01:29:16.020
of their populations and so I think you
know we also need to think about how can

01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:16.030
know we also need to think about how can
 

01:29:16.030 --> 01:29:21.270
know we also need to think about how can
we both collaborate and share

very much for coming today two questions
 

01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:54.270
very much for coming today two questions
the first one is when you spoke about

01:29:54.270 --> 01:29:54.280
the first one is when you spoke about
 

01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:56.310
the first one is when you spoke about
the h1n1 vaccine you said that tens of

01:29:56.310 --> 01:29:56.320
the h1n1 vaccine you said that tens of
 

01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:57.570
the h1n1 vaccine you said that tens of
millions of Americans had it I'm

01:29:57.570 --> 01:29:57.580
millions of Americans had it I'm
 

01:29:57.580 --> 01:29:59.280
millions of Americans had it I'm
wondering why there wasn't hundreds of

01:29:59.280 --> 01:29:59.290
wondering why there wasn't hundreds of
 

01:29:59.290 --> 01:30:01.290
wondering why there wasn't hundreds of
millions of Americans that had it and

01:30:01.290 --> 01:30:01.300
millions of Americans that had it and
 

01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:03.030
millions of Americans that had it and
then the second question which may be

01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:03.040
then the second question which may be
 

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:05.130
then the second question which may be
seen as related which may not be seen as

01:30:05.130 --> 01:30:05.140
seen as related which may not be seen as
 

01:30:05.140 --> 01:30:06.660
seen as related which may not be seen as
related is I've learning too good to

of vaccines and are concerned about
 

01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:20.160
of vaccines and are concerned about
potential side effects and vaccination

about are we achieving vaccination

targets and certainly with h1n1 we had a

01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:44.050
targets and certainly with h1n1 we had a
 

01:31:44.050 --> 01:31:46.140
targets and certainly with h1n1 we had a
higher goal the other problem with the

01:31:46.140 --> 01:31:46.150
higher goal the other problem with the
 

01:31:46.150 --> 01:31:50.690
higher goal the other problem with the
h1n1 response was that the vaccine came

01:31:50.690 --> 01:31:50.700
h1n1 response was that the vaccine came
 

01:31:50.700 --> 01:31:53.070
h1n1 response was that the vaccine came
later than we had hoped and it came

01:31:53.070 --> 01:31:53.080
later than we had hoped and it came
 

01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:56.430
later than we had hoped and it came
after the peak and it came at a time

01:31:56.430 --> 01:31:56.440
after the peak and it came at a time
 

01:31:56.440 --> 01:32:00.210
after the peak and it came at a time
when some of the concerns about the

01:32:00.210 --> 01:32:00.220
when some of the concerns about the
 

01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:05.070
when some of the concerns about the
severity of the epidemic had begun to

01:32:05.070 --> 01:32:05.080
severity of the epidemic had begun to
 

01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:07.380
severity of the epidemic had begun to
wane and so people that probably would

01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:07.390
wane and so people that probably would
 

01:32:07.390 --> 01:32:10.500
wane and so people that probably would
have have eagerly taken the vaccine

01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:10.510
have have eagerly taken the vaccine
 

01:32:10.510 --> 01:32:12.780

it was underutilized and we we in fact
 

01:32:23.260 --> 01:32:28.080

we're left with with unused vaccine the

01:35:41.289 --> 01:35:43.949
we have to make but the fact that it's
not arbitrary and capricious which may

01:35:43.949 --> 01:35:43.959
not arbitrary and capricious which may
 

01:35:43.959 --> 01:35:46.369

sometimes see if you're just looking

01:35:46.369 --> 01:35:46.379
sometimes see if you're just looking
 

01:35:46.379 --> 01:35:50.419
sometimes see if you're just looking
from the outside in and you know to me

01:35:50.419 --> 01:35:50.429
from the outside in and you know to me
 

01:35:50.429 --> 01:35:54.179
from the outside in and you know to me
you know i feel just very very strongly

01:35:54.179 --> 01:35:54.189
you know i feel just very very strongly
 

01:35:54.189 --> 01:35:59.159
you know i feel just very very strongly
that the FDA is an agency that has been

01:35:59.159 --> 01:35:59.169
that the FDA is an agency that has been
 

01:35:59.169 --> 01:36:02.250
that the FDA is an agency that has been
so neglected in many ways over decades

01:36:02.250 --> 01:36:02.260
so neglected in many ways over decades
 

01:36:02.260 --> 01:36:05.119
so neglected in many ways over decades
in terms of the investment of resources

01:36:05.119 --> 01:36:05.129
in terms of the investment of resources
 

01:36:05.129 --> 01:36:08.459
in terms of the investment of resources
to support the the critical set of roles

01:36:08.459 --> 01:36:08.469
to support the the critical set of roles
 

01:36:08.469 --> 01:36:10.319
to support the the critical set of roles
and responsibilities that we have and

01:36:10.319 --> 01:36:10.329
and responsibilities that we have and
 

01:36:10.329 --> 01:36:13.559
and responsibilities that we have and
that year after year we are given new

01:36:13.559 --> 01:36:13.569
that year after year we are given new
 

01:36:13.569 --> 01:36:17.250
that year after year we are given new
mandates and new responsibilities but we

01:36:17.250 --> 01:36:17.260
mandates and new responsibilities but we
 

01:36:17.260 --> 01:36:20.329
mandates and new responsibilities but we
are not given the resources that we need

01:36:20.329 --> 01:36:20.339
are not given the resources that we need
 

01:36:20.339 --> 01:36:23.309
are not given the resources that we need
correspondingly to really do our job and

01:36:23.309 --> 01:36:23.319
correspondingly to really do our job and
 

01:36:23.319 --> 01:36:24.659

I was just looking at the numbers

01:36:24.659 --> 01:36:24.669
I was just looking at the numbers
 

01:36:24.669 --> 01:36:28.609
I was just looking at the numbers
yesterday in terms of the 2011 budget

01:36:28.609 --> 01:36:28.619
yesterday in terms of the 2011 budget
 

01:36:28.619 --> 01:36:30.959
yesterday in terms of the 2011 budget
and in some ways I can't complain

01:36:30.959 --> 01:36:30.969
and in some ways I can't complain
 

01:36:30.969 --> 01:36:35.309
and in some ways I can't complain
because over the past couple of years we

01:36:35.309 --> 01:36:35.319
because over the past couple of years we
 

01:36:35.319 --> 01:36:37.799
because over the past couple of years we
have gotten significant budget increases

01:36:37.799 --> 01:36:37.809
have gotten significant budget increases
 

01:36:37.809 --> 01:36:40.049
have gotten significant budget increases
but I view it that we're still sort of

01:36:40.049 --> 01:36:40.059
but I view it that we're still sort of
 

01:36:40.059 --> 01:36:42.569
but I view it that we're still sort of
digging out of a hole and we're still in

01:36:42.569 --> 01:36:42.579
digging out of a hole and we're still in
 

01:36:42.579 --> 01:36:44.759
digging out of a hole and we're still in
that hole but we have gotten increases

01:36:44.759 --> 01:36:44.769
that hole but we have gotten increases
 

01:36:44.769 --> 01:36:48.029
that hole but we have gotten increases
but at a time with the 2011 budget which

01:36:48.029 --> 01:36:48.039
but at a time with the 2011 budget which
 

01:36:48.039 --> 01:36:49.770
but at a time with the 2011 budget which
was just resolved and some of you may

01:36:49.770 --> 01:36:49.780
was just resolved and some of you may
 

01:36:49.780 --> 01:36:51.959
was just resolved and some of you may
have tracked the government almost shut

01:36:51.959 --> 01:36:51.969
have tracked the government almost shut
 

01:36:51.969 --> 01:36:56.939
have tracked the government almost shut
down in getting to yes on a budget but

01:36:56.939 --> 01:36:56.949
down in getting to yes on a budget but
 

01:36:56.949 --> 01:36:59.250
down in getting to yes on a budget but

we actually got a very we got a real
 

01:36:59.260 --> 01:37:01.950
we actually got a very we got a real
increase in our budget when many

01:37:01.950 --> 01:37:01.960
increase in our budget when many
 

01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:05.880
increase in our budget when many
agencies including the NIH which usually

01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:05.890
agencies including the NIH which usually
 

01:37:05.890 --> 01:37:08.400
agencies including the NIH which usually
is the one that gets the significant

01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:08.410
is the one that gets the significant
 

01:37:08.410 --> 01:37:11.340
is the one that gets the significant
increases got a an actual cut compared

01:37:11.340 --> 01:37:11.350
increases got a an actual cut compared
 

01:37:11.350 --> 01:37:13.830
increases got a an actual cut compared
to their 2010 budget we got an increase

01:37:13.830 --> 01:37:13.840
to their 2010 budget we got an increase
 

01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:16.650
to their 2010 budget we got an increase
but I don't expect to be so lucky for

01:37:16.650 --> 01:37:16.660
but I don't expect to be so lucky for
 

01:37:16.660 --> 01:37:18.420
but I don't expect to be so lucky for
the 2012 budget which is being debated

01:37:18.420 --> 01:37:18.430
the 2012 budget which is being debated
 

01:37:18.430 --> 01:37:21.150
the 2012 budget which is being debated
now and we're looking at at a very

01:37:21.150 --> 01:37:21.160
now and we're looking at at a very
 

01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:23.700
now and we're looking at at a very
significant cut on based on what the

01:37:23.700 --> 01:37:23.710
significant cut on based on what the
 

01:37:23.710 --> 01:37:26.010
significant cut on based on what the
house just passed but but I was looking

01:37:26.010 --> 01:37:26.020
house just passed but but I was looking
 

01:37:26.020 --> 01:37:30.360
house just passed but but I was looking
at the 2011 budget in terms of how much

01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:30.370
at the 2011 budget in terms of how much
 

01:37:30.370 --> 01:37:33.720
at the 2011 budget in terms of how much
we get and what it means across the

01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:33.730
we get and what it means across the
 

01:37:33.730 --> 01:37:36.690
we get and what it means across the
population of this country and its

01:37:36.690 --> 01:37:36.700
population of this country and its
 

01:37:36.700 --> 01:37:39.209
population of this country and its
dollars that every American pays each

01:37:39.209 --> 01:37:39.219
dollars that every American pays each
 

01:37:39.219 --> 01:37:42.270

year to support the budget of the FDA

01:37:42.270 --> 01:37:42.280
year to support the budget of the FDA
 

01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:44.880
year to support the budget of the FDA
and considering what we do and how much

01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:44.890
and considering what we do and how much
 

01:37:44.890 --> 01:37:47.400
and considering what we do and how much
it matters I really think we need to

01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:47.410
it matters I really think we need to
 

01:37:47.410 --> 01:37:49.380
it matters I really think we need to
take another look and I really feel it's

01:37:49.380 --> 01:37:49.390
take another look and I really feel it's
 

01:37:49.390 --> 01:37:52.229
take another look and I really feel it's
a very important aspect of what I do to

01:37:52.229 --> 01:37:52.239
a very important aspect of what I do to
 

01:37:52.239 --> 01:37:54.780
a very important aspect of what I do to
try to to be an advocate for the

01:37:54.780 --> 01:37:54.790
try to to be an advocate for the
 

01:37:54.790 --> 01:37:57.209
try to to be an advocate for the
importance of the agency the unique

01:37:57.209 --> 01:37:57.219
importance of the agency the unique
 

01:37:57.219 --> 01:38:03.060
importance of the agency the unique
contribution that we make and the the

01:38:03.060 --> 01:38:03.070
contribution that we make and the the
 

01:38:03.070 --> 01:38:07.080
