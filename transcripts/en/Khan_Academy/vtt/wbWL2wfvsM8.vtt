00:00:00.202 --> 00:00:02.466
- [Voiceover] In the video on the sodium-potassum pump,

00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:06.204
we talk about how it helps a cell establish its

00:00:06.204 --> 00:00:08.061
resting membrane potential.

00:00:08.061 --> 00:00:11.265
And it does that by pumping, actively pumping,

00:00:11.265 --> 00:00:14.423
three sodium ions out for every two potassium ions

00:00:14.423 --> 00:00:17.383
it pumps in, and that by itself, that ratio of three to two

00:00:17.383 --> 00:00:19.589
by itself doesn't establish the full

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:22.038
resting membrane potential, but then

00:00:22.038 --> 00:00:24.581
the potassium ions are allowed to start

00:00:24.581 --> 00:00:27.762
diffusing down their concentration gradient

00:00:27.762 --> 00:00:29.863
from the inside back to the outside.

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:32.022
And of course there's a balancing force there,

00:00:32.022 --> 00:00:34.762
or a balancing factor, and that's the charge.

00:00:34.762 --> 00:00:37.397
Because if the outside is more positive than the inside,

00:00:37.397 --> 00:00:42.157
a positively-charged ion, which the potassium ions are,

00:00:42.157 --> 00:00:44.502
well, they're not gonna want to go up here so much

00:00:44.502 --> 00:00:46.185
because of their charge.

00:00:46.185 --> 00:00:48.542
It's more positive here than it is over here.

00:00:48.542 --> 00:00:50.805
They'd actually want to go back, but their concentration

00:00:50.805 --> 00:00:52.721
gradient, they're going to be bumping into the bottom

00:00:52.721 --> 00:00:55.043
of this channel more than the top,

00:00:55.043 --> 00:00:56.401
and so you're going to have a balance.

00:00:56.401 --> 00:00:57.980
They're going to start diffusing through,

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.336
but you're not going to have equal concentrations

00:01:00.336 --> 00:01:02.925
because the charge is going to keep them back here.

00:01:02.925 --> 00:01:04.620
But what about the sodium ions?

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.036
The sodium ions are getting more and more

00:01:06.036 --> 00:01:08.056
concentrated up here, and up here is getting

00:01:08.056 --> 00:01:09.705
more and more positive.

00:01:09.705 --> 00:01:11.644
If the sodium ions were left to their own devices,

00:01:11.644 --> 00:01:13.501
if there was no membrane over here, they

00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:15.346
would naturally, if we just looked at the concentration

00:01:15.346 --> 00:01:18.396
gradient, they would naturally want to diffuse down.

00:01:18.396 --> 00:01:21.136
We have a high concentration over here,

00:01:21.136 --> 00:01:23.457
we have a low concentration over there.

00:01:23.457 --> 00:01:26.557
So if there was no membrane, then they would just naturally

00:01:26.557 --> 00:01:28.101
diffuse from high to low.

00:01:28.101 --> 00:01:29.877
That's their concentration gradient.

00:01:29.877 --> 00:01:32.013
And also if there was no membrane, we've

00:01:32.013 --> 00:01:34.753
already talked about it being much more positive

00:01:34.753 --> 00:01:38.131
on this side than it is on this side.

00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:40.511
Or you could say we have a positive potential difference

00:01:40.511 --> 00:01:42.693
between here and here.

00:01:42.693 --> 00:01:45.874
So the positively charged ions, like the sodiums up here,

00:01:45.874 --> 00:01:48.753
would want to go down because of their charge.

00:01:48.753 --> 00:01:50.576
And so there's two reasons why they would want

00:01:50.576 --> 00:01:53.339
to go from this side of the membrane to that side

00:01:53.339 --> 00:01:54.477
of the membrane.

00:01:54.477 --> 00:01:58.075
Their concentration gradient and their charge,

00:01:58.075 --> 00:01:59.236
the electric potential.

00:01:59.236 --> 00:02:00.595
There's this potential energy of them wanting

00:02:00.595 --> 00:02:02.974
to get away from all the positive charges.

00:02:02.974 --> 00:02:05.830
And so that combined motivation for the

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.172
sodium ions to go in that direction, we call that

00:02:10.172 --> 00:02:13.105
the electrochemical gradient.

00:02:13.105 --> 00:02:16.465
Electrochemical

00:02:19.185 --> 00:02:20.285
gradient.

00:02:20.285 --> 00:02:22.414
And I already said it once, but I'll say it again.

00:02:22.414 --> 00:02:25.583
It's a combination of the electric gradient and

00:02:25.583 --> 00:02:26.419
the chemical gradient.

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:27.951
The chemical gradient, you have higher concentration

00:02:27.951 --> 00:02:30.482
here, lower here, you would want to diffuse down,

00:02:30.482 --> 00:02:32.037
more things are going to bump on this side

00:02:32.037 --> 00:02:35.253
than on this side, so you're going to have a net flow down,

00:02:35.253 --> 00:02:37.076
if you didn't have this membrane here.

00:02:37.076 --> 00:02:39.212
And then when you think about the electric potential,

00:02:39.212 --> 00:02:40.953
more positive on this side than on this side,

00:02:40.953 --> 00:02:44.157
so positive ions would want to go down.

00:02:44.157 --> 00:02:46.630
And so you could view this gradient as a source

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.418
of potential energy.

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:50.449
And cells, in fact, use this gradient,

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:53.537
in fact, the sodium electrochemical gradient as

00:02:53.537 --> 00:02:55.093
a source of energy.

00:02:55.093 --> 00:02:57.891
And so let's say this protein

00:02:57.891 --> 00:02:59.876
right over here, this is what we're going to

00:02:59.876 --> 00:03:01.818
call a symporter.

00:03:01.818 --> 00:03:04.116
This is a symporter.

00:03:04.116 --> 00:03:07.169
And what it does is, it uses the electrochemical

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:11.871
gradient of one ion, in this case sodium,

00:03:11.871 --> 00:03:14.135
so it uses the fact that sodium really wants to

00:03:14.135 --> 00:03:16.851
go through the membrane, and it uses that energy.

00:03:16.851 --> 00:03:19.405
Imagine like water falling down a waterfall

00:03:19.405 --> 00:03:23.735
and it can turn a turbine or turn a water mill

00:03:23.735 --> 00:03:24.734
type of thing.

00:03:24.734 --> 00:03:27.473
And so it uses that energy of the sodium

00:03:27.473 --> 00:03:30.294
flowing down its electrochemical gradient,

00:03:30.294 --> 00:03:32.372
it wants to go in this direction for two reasons,

00:03:32.372 --> 00:03:35.809
concentration and electric potential, or I guess

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:37.956
you'd say its electrostatic charge, and then it

00:03:37.956 --> 00:03:40.371
uses that energy to transport other things.

00:03:40.371 --> 00:03:43.215
And the most famous symporter with sodium

00:03:43.215 --> 00:03:44.748
is glucose.

00:03:44.748 --> 00:03:46.895
It's going to use that, the sodium and the glucose

00:03:46.895 --> 00:03:48.277
are going to go together.

00:03:48.277 --> 00:03:49.867
And the glucose is being transported

00:03:49.867 --> 00:03:52.433
against its concentration gradient.

00:03:52.433 --> 00:03:53.733
And so if you're going to transport something

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:57.076
against its concentration gradient, you're going to

00:03:57.076 --> 00:03:59.630
have to use active transport.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.672
So this concentration gradient, so let me

00:04:02.672 --> 00:04:05.551
be clear on glucose's concentration gradient,

00:04:05.551 --> 00:04:06.549
it looks like this.

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.486
You have high concentration over here and you have

00:04:09.486 --> 00:04:10.589
low right over here.

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:11.971
And the cell might not want to waste all this glucose,

00:04:11.971 --> 00:04:14.571
it wants to get as much glucose into the cell,

00:04:14.571 --> 00:04:16.986
or across the membrane, as possible.

00:04:16.986 --> 00:04:18.855
And so it's going to have to do some active transport

00:04:18.855 --> 00:04:21.130
to go against its concentration gradient.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.487
To go in this direction.

00:04:23.487 --> 00:04:25.205
And over here, the source of energy

00:04:25.205 --> 00:04:27.109
to go against the concentration gradient,

00:04:27.109 --> 00:04:30.684
is the stored potential energy from the

00:04:30.684 --> 00:04:33.343
electrochemical gradient of the sodium.

00:04:33.343 --> 00:04:36.106
And so this type of active transport, where you're

00:04:36.106 --> 00:04:40.053
using the energy that was stored up through another

00:04:40.053 --> 00:04:42.723
form of active transport, the sodium-potassium pump,

00:04:42.723 --> 00:04:45.625
we call this Secondary Active Transport.

00:04:45.625 --> 00:04:48.144
So what's going over here, this sodium-glucose

00:04:48.144 --> 00:04:51.800
symporter, this is Secondary Active Transport.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.339
Secondary Active Transport.

00:04:56.339 --> 00:05:01.049
It's using the stored energy from the

00:05:01.423 --> 00:05:04.941
electrochemical gradient of one molecule, it's

00:05:04.941 --> 00:05:09.503
using that stored energy to drive the active transport

00:05:09.503 --> 00:05:12.440
of another molecule, glucose, going against

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.047
its concentration gradient.
