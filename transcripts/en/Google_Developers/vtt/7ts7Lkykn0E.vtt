PENG YING: Hi, my name
is Peng Ying.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.250
And I'm a developer programs
engineer on Google Commerce.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.310
And speaking with me today are
Mihai Ionescu, a developer

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.250
advocate with a storied history
on Google Chrome and

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.180
our product manager for Google
Checkout, Satyajeet Salgar.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.660
I'm really excited and nervous
about today, mostly nervous.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.000
This marks our first-ever
commerce track at Google I/O.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.130
And we hope to kick it
off with a bang.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.960
We have a lot of great
information to share with you.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.620
And if you want to rate
us, you can use the

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.130
speaker meter link.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:42.690
And if you want to shout us out
on Twitter, use #commerce.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.330
So today we'll be covering a
little bit of everything.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.390
First, we'll cover what Checkout
is and the benefits

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.040
that it provides to developers
like yourself.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.900
Then since Checkout is an
e-commerce enabler for many

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.430
Google products and APIs, we'll
show you the various

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.270
ways of implementing Checkout.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.440
Then we'll dive into how
Checkout works and

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.600
the APIs behind it.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.190
Once you've established a
foundation of knowledge, we'll

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.380
show you how these tools
and APIs are

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.030
used in the real world.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.100
Finally we'll finish with the
challenges that Checkout has

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.960
faced and provide a preview
of commerce at Google.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.090
So let's get started with
a brief overview of what

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.320
Checkout is.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.770
Checkout is an alternative
purchase flow.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.140
And what that means is that
instead of just sending the

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.190
payment credentials and the
amounts to your payment

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.090
processor instead you'll need
to define the items a

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.330
customer's purchasing, any
discounts, and your tax and

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.880
shipping settings.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.410
And send that to Google
Checkout.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.590
And what this allows Checkout
to do is control the entire

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.240
purchase flow from a customer
creating an account or signing

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.500
in to them choosing the shipping
methods, adding new

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.500
payment methods and specifying
where they want to ship it to,

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.660
then confirming the order and
viewing the receipt page.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.990
Since the merchant defines all
of the customer information as

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.440
well or all of the order
information, a customer can

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.180
easily log in to Google Checkout
and view their order

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.710
history from multiple stores.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.500
And just so you know, The Ping
Pong Super Store is in no way

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.900
related to myself.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.450
The merchant can also log in
and see a history of sales.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.950
And since the orders take place
on Google Checkout, they

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.955
can use the Google Checkout
merchant center to process

00:02:28.955 --> 00:02:29.860
these orders.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.590
Or they can use the notification
and order

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.080
processing APIs to process
them from their server.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.270
So put your hand up if you've
purchased something from the

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.460
web in the past two weeks?

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.145
It could be an app.

00:02:42.145 --> 00:02:43.870
It could be something retail.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.490
It looks like a lot of you.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.760
And then how many of you
are selling online?

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.550
Sold something from the web
in the past two weeks?

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.260
Wow, you guys are all attending
the right session.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.480
You've all probably encountered
a few really

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.890
annoying parts of purchasing
and selling online.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.230
Well, other than paying your
credit card bills.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.410
And this is just a short
anecdote from my personal

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.630
experiences.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.960
So a majority of my
team is here.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.040
And then some of us are going to
go to Yosemite this weekend

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.060
to go hiking.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.760
I think we're going to go
try to hike Half Dome.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.760
My friends told me it's pretty
scenic, so I wanted to buy a

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.720
pretty nice camera to bring
with me and take

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.620
some awesome photos.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.350
I found this one
at Ritz Camera.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.600
And it had the best price I
could find online, so I

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.890
purchased it there.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.450
I also wanted a pair
of hiking shoes.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.000
Last time I was at Yosemite,
I slipped and fell once.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.060
And it was kind of
embarrassing.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.820
I found this pair at a mom and
pop shop that I didn't really

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.810
know, but I still bought
them anyway.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.370
And lastly, I wanted to buy a
camera bag because I didn't

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.880
want this camera just swinging
around my neck while I hiked.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.270
I was in the store the other
day, and I found one that I

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.230
liked, but it was a little bit
expensive in the store.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.810
So I pulled out my cell phone
and I purchased it--

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.940
well, I did comparison shopping
first. And then I

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.240
purchased it through my cell
phone in the store.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.100
And here are some of
the pain points.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.630
For most separate sites, you
needed to fill in the same

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.840
information over and over
again, creating numerous

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.720
separate accounts at
multiple merchants.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.610
I don't know about you, but
sometimes I have to try two to

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.340
three different login password
combinations before I'm

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.680
actually logged in at sites
I don't often use.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.360
And if I don't recognize the
store, it's very difficult for

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.200
me to provide my payment
credentials even if they have

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.120
the best price by far.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.140
Lastly, the mobile purchases
is a market that's growing

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.710
very quickly.

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.090
And not all stores have a
mobile-specific purchase flow.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.700
And if you've tried purchasing
something from your cell

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.040
phone, you probably know that
it's not a great experience.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.850
Entering your credentials on a
virtual keyboard is not the

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.120
most pleasant of experiences.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.010
So Google Checkout can help
solve these problems.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.300
For buyers, take a look at
what Google has done

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.240
internally.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.870
Almost all of Google's products

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.690
use Checkout to monetize.

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.240
And a single account can be
used across all of them.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.650
Not only can one account be used
to purchase from Google,

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.300
but it can be used to purchase
from external sites, such as

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.270
B&amp;H Photo, Buy.com, eBags,
and thousands more.

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.280
Like Open ID and OAuth, a
single account to enable

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.380
transactions from across the
web is a powerful tool.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.780
This account also enables you to
purchase with a few clicks

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.750
across multiple platforms from
all merchants that have

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.350
implemented Checkout.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.700
Purchasing from a Xoom, Nexus S,
Google TV is now simple and

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.300
easy with only a few clicks.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.230
Lastly, Checkout serves as an
intermediary to the merchant

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.790
so that they never receive
your payment credentials.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.860
This means that should they be
hacked, you don't have to go

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.600
out and get a new credit card.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.800
For developers and merchants,
implementing the API enables

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.300
tens of millions of buyers to
purchase from your site with a

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:53.930
few simple clicks.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.540
And regardless of the device
that your buyer may be using,

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.520
the Checkout flow automatically
scales and

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.160
handles device limitations.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.540
Instead of having to spend time
coding out buy flows and

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.020
multiple device formats,
Checkout allows you to focus

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.330
on your core products.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.760
We also have the payment
guarantee, which ensures

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.570
payments for orders covered.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.660
And 98% of all Checkout
orders are covered by

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.370
this payment guarantee.

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.600
There's also a powerful risk
engine that analyzes each

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.700
order and, should it be deemed
fraudulent, automatically

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.600
cancels it.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.010
An added benefit of having
Checkout serving as the

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:34.720
intermediary is that we handle
PCI compliance for you.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.890
How many of you know what
PCI compliance is?

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.190
Please put up your hands.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.440
That's a lot of you.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.800
That's more than I expected.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.230
But for those of you who don't,
you don't even need to

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.630
know what PCI compliance is.

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.460
Since you never receive the
customer's credit card

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.110
information to receive payments,
you don't need to be

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.900
certified for PCI compliance.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.570
And just in case you're curious,
it's certification

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:57.570
that ensures your security
systems are up to the

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.760
standards set by the
Payment Card

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.490
Industry Standard Council.

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:08.060
And it can be expensive and
time-consuming to acquire.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.920
Lastly, we want to ensure that
each API is simple to use and

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.702
easy to implement.

00:07:13.702 --> 00:07:16.060
We provide tools and client
libraries to make

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.620
integration a breeze.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.240
But that's not the limit of
Checkout's functionality.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.820
Checkout is an e-commerce
enabler.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.090
It allows for purchases across
a variety of products.

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.960
Did you know that if you've
ever purchased an Android

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.720
application, a Chrome Web Store
application, an Apps

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.200
Marketplace app, or even
purchased storage for Picasa

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.400
that you already have a Google
Checkout account?

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.030
And this is just a small sample
list of Google products

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.740
that use Checkout to monetize.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.435
E-commerce in general is growing
by leaps and bounds.

00:07:48.435 --> 00:07:50.730
And it seems like new
e-commerce sites are

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:51.600
opening every day.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.910
Group buys, sample sales, app
stores, music, video,

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:57.820
vacation, services, more
and more things

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.310
are being sold online.

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:02.070
And more importantly, more and
more people are purchasing

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:03.260
these things.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.670
Leveraging our own products,
we've seen tremendous growth

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:06.650
in Checkout.

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:10.230
So tremendous that I don't even
have PR-approved hard

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:11.730
numbers I can share with you.

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:15.390
So I have to use the abstract
unit of measure of a rainbow.

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:18.050
And I can only say that the
number of transactions has not

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:20.660
only increased to a double
rainbow, but it's increased to

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.790
a triple rainbow.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:23.770
What does it mean?

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.100
It means that the number of
transactions has grown

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.640
three-fold in the six
months between June

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.430
and December of '10.

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:33.200
And the graph, while a little
bit artsy, is an accurate

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.490
representation of the daily

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:37.539
transaction volume of Checkout.

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:41.090
So now that you're hopefully
interested in implementing

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:43.330
Checkout, Mihai is going
to show you the

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:44.740
various ways to integrate.

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:50.500
MIHAI IONESCUE: Thank
you, Peng.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.360
How are you guys doing?

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.070
All right.

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:56.180
Welcome to the first-ever
Commerce Track at Google I/O.

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:12.460
So you are excited about
e-commerce, right?

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:12.770
OK.

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:14.190
You're at the right session.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.500
And I know e-commerce is
fun especially when

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.190
you're making money.

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:22.240
Now Peng gave you a good
overview of what Google

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.130
Checkout is all about.

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:27.880
Now let's see how we can put
all that together and build

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.130
e-commerce solutions.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:35.110
There are quite a few ways to
integrate Google Checkout from

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:39.830
very simple implementations all
the way to advanced ones.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:43.170
The simple implementations
abstract the way the

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:48.540
complexities of the Checkout
API, while the advanced ones

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.220
take full advantage of it.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:54.900
For the rest of the talk, we'll
go over these popular

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:59.250
integrations, have some fun with
sample code, then learn

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:04.130
more about the Checkout API, and
finally see how everything

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:07.645
comes together in a real case
e-commerce implementation.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:14.680
Let's start with the Buy Now
button, the simplest way to

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.810
implement Google Checkout.

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:20.210
The Buy Now button was
specifically designed to sell

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:24.210
a single item in one
transaction.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:26.830
Only minimal programming
skills are required.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:28.610
You just copy and paste a

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:30.710
pre-generated HTML code snippet.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.380
Next we have the Store Gadget.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:40.940
With a Store Gadget, you get
to sell multiple items per

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:45.220
transaction, and you also get a
simple inventory management

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.470
through Google Docs
spreadsheet.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:51.730
Adding a Store Gadget
is as simple as

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:53.330
adding a Buy Now button.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:57.680
Copy and paste a code snippet.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.670
You get all that through an
online wizard, which generates

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:06.730
the online store and the
inventory spreadsheet.

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:09.980
Now the Store Gadget and the Buy
Now button are simple and

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.000
easy to use.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.790
But what if you want more
features or more options?

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:20.990
Let's say you want more control
over your website's

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:26.200
look and feel, or you want to
use your own order processing

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:30.450
system instead of the Google
Merchant Center.

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:34.830
For that, you need a Shopping
Cart solution.

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:38.570
Implementations vary from very
basic, where you have a

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:42.930
pre-integrated shopping cart, to
very complex, custom-built

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:46.790
carts where you have full
control over every aspect of

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.950
the implementation.

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:52.830
You decide which solution is
right for you based on your

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.000
e-commerce site.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.680
You can implement
a cart yourself.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.400
You can use a shopping
cart from Google.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.690
Or you can use a shopping
cart from one of

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:06.450
our integration partners.

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:09.210
If you want to learn more about
advanced e-commerce

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:13.160
solutions or custom-built carts,
we actually have quite

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.510
a few partners here
at Google I/O.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:17.680
And I encourage you to
go talk to them.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.850
They're in the Developer's
Sandbox area right here on

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:23.720
this floor.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.945
Now to show you how simple it
is to add a shopping cart to

00:12:26.945 --> 00:12:31.070
your site, we added one right
here on this page.

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:32.950
This is not a screen shot.

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:36.670
It's a real shopping cart
provided by Google.

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.260
I can add items to the cart.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.480
I can change my mind and
update the cart.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.050
And then I can buy all this
stuff with one click.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.980
Now, how easy was it to add
that shopping cart?

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.930
It was just a simple
two-step process.

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:05.010
First, include a Google
Shopping Cart script,

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:08.650
basically one line of code.

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:12.970
Next, annotate your products
with various attributes.

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:15.400
Just a few more lines of code.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:19.810
The annotations are used by the
Shopping Cart script to

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:24.010
identify the items for sale and
update the shopping cart.

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:26.830
And that's all it takes to
add a simple shopping

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:28.550
cart to your site.

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:30.730
Now, how about customizing
the shopping cart?

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:34.870
Making it fit nicely
with your web site?

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:37.790
Well, you can also do that.

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:41.080
The Google Shopping Cart is
built with JavaScript and CSS.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.460
And thus, it's very
customizable.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:46.210
For example, you can control
the cart location.

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:48.920
Place it anywhere on
the page not just

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.570
the default top corner.

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:56.030
You can also change the
appearance of the cart.

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:59.540
Use your own images,
colors, borders,

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:01.810
backgrounds, and so forth.

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:05.150
And finally, you have full
control over the entire

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:06.575
behavior of the cart.

00:14:06.575 --> 00:14:09.690
As I mentioned, the cart is
built with JavaScript.

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:12.520
And it offers you JavaScript
functions

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:13.630
which you can control.

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:18.340
For example, you can query or
change the items in the cart.

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:22.300
Or you can use JavaScript
callbacks to handle all kinds

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:23.550
of cart events.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.010
Now this is very powerful.

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:34.710
And later in the talk, we'll
see how we can you use they

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:37.510
JavaScript Shopping Cart
functions together with the

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:41.990
Checkout API to build a real
e-commerce solution.

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:46.990
But before that, let's have a
quick recap of the integration

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:48.810
solutions we've seen so far.

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:52.660
From easier to advanced, the Buy
Now button is the simplest

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.640
to implement.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:59.820
Specifically designed to sell a
single item per transaction.

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:02.480
The Store Gadget allows you
to sell multiple items per

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:06.810
transaction while maintaining
the simplicity and ease of the

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:08.060
implementation.

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:12.390
And finally, shopping carts
come in a variety of

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:16.660
implementations from very basic,
as we just saw, where

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:20.930
you can add a shopping cart with
simple HTML and CSS to

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:27.172
very complex, custom-built carts
with powerful features.

00:15:27.172 --> 00:15:30.430
With that said, now it's a good
time to take a deep dive

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:32.540
into the Checkout API.

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:36.040
Peng will take over again
and give you a

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:37.779
Checkout API crash course.

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:45.490
PENG YING: Thanks Mihai.

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:47.260
It's pretty simple and
powerful, right?

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:53.570
Now let's understand how these
tools work and to continue

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:55.330
building out your foundation
of knowledge of

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:57.690
the Checkout API.

00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:00.490
So Checkout is comprised
of several APIs.

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:02.430
There are APIs that
enable purchases.

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:04.840
The Cart API, which allows you
to define the items being

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.810
purchased and your tax and
shipping settings.

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:10.500
The Merchant Calculations API,
which allows you to define a

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:14.330
URL that will call back to join
your customer's buy flow

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.900
that allows you to custom
calculate discounts, taxes,

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:19.680
shipping, and shipping values.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.085
We have APIs for fulfillment.

00:16:22.085 --> 00:16:24.980
The Notification API, where
Checkout will send your server

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:29.600
notifications for syncing
and order processing.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.550
There's a Notification History
API that allows your server to

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:35.740
pull for notifications should
you miss any or encounter any

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:37.570
errors processing them.

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:39.950
And there's an Order Processing
API, which allows

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:42.510
you to make requests to process
orders, such as

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:46.420
Charge, Ship, Cancel, Archive,
Refund, and so on.

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:51.135
Lastly, we have an API
for reporting.

00:16:51.135 --> 00:16:54.330
The Order Report API allows
you to make requests and

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:56.630
download CSVs of orders.

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:59.750
So the three main APIs that
you need to know about and

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:02.570
that we're going to cover today
are the Cart API, the

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:06.770
Notification API, and the
Order Processing API.

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:10.319
And here we have some example
Cart API XML.

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:12.690
I stated previously, since
Checkout is an alternative

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:15.150
purchase flow, you're going
to need to convert your

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:18.940
representation of the buyer's
cart into the Cart API XML.

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:22.390
And we have client libraries to
help you in this process.

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:24.349
There's a couple components
of this cart.

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:27.660
The first is the items. And for
each item, the required

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:30.800
tags are item name, name of the
item, their description,

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.900
the price of the item and
currency, and the number of

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.550
items being sold, the
quantity of it.

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:38.650
Next there's shipping
and taxes.

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:40.610
With shipping, you have
several options.

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:43.190
With flat-rate shipping, you
basically define a flat rate

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:44.980
for a given geographic area.

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:48.310
For carrier-calculated, we'll
try to calculate the shipping

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:51.220
rate on your behalf by querying
the carriers,

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:55.680
provided that you provided the
origin, destination, weight,

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.230
and size of the package.

00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:59.300
And lastly is
merchant-calculated shipping.

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:02.800
And as spoken before, we'll call
back to your server, and

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.780
your server will need to
determine the rate and then

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.920
respond to the request.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.490
Next, there's tax tables.

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:10.680
And tax tables are
pretty simple.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.330
It's just basically a fixed
percentage for a given

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:14.590
geographic area.

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:17.050
And you can have multiple tax
tables for different types of

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:22.790
items. Next, once you've created
the cart, you need to

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:24.310
post the cart to our server.

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:25.990
And there's two methods
of doing this.

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:29.300
There is the client-to-server
cart posts, which is basically

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.870
an HTML form post where you
generate the cart content on

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:34.510
the request. And then once the
customer is ready to check

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:36.970
out, they click the Google
Checkout button, which then

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:38.430
posts the cart to
Google Checkout.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.320
The form post is composed
of two name-value pairs.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.980
You have the cart, which
is a base64-encoded XML

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:56.080
representation of the cart API
XML, and the signature, which

00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:00.530
is a base64 representation of
the cart HMAC-SHA-1 hash using

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:04.430
that merchant's merchant
key to sign the hash.

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:07.140
The server to server post
has a few more steps.

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:08.955
Here, the customer requests
your cart page.

00:19:08.955 --> 00:19:11.865
And once they click the Google
Checkout button, it makes the

00:19:11.865 --> 00:19:16.360
request to your server, which
then posts the Cart API XML to

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.040
Google Checkout.

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:20.580
Google Checkout processes this
and returns a redirect URL to

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:21.560
your server.

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.350
Your server then needs to pass
on the redirect URL back to

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:25.080
the client.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:28.090
And your client code needs to
302 redirect the customer to

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:30.130
Google Checkout.

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:32.350
So once your customer has
completed the purchase, it's

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:34.190
time to fulfill the order.

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:36.420
The first piece of fulfilling
an order is to

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:37.710
find out about it.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:40.710
And Checkout will automatically
send you an

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:44.470
email notifying you of the order
and will also have the

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:45.545
notification API.

00:19:45.545 --> 00:19:48.370
So notifications are important
to sync between Checkout and

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:49.430
your server.

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:52.560
And today we'll be talking about
version 2.5 of the API.

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.900
And 2.5 is the latest version.

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.430
With it, a few things
have changed.

00:19:56.430 --> 00:20:00.270
So instead of sending a full
notification to your server

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:03.445
directly, instead we'll send
your server a token.

00:20:03.445 --> 00:20:06.310
And what your server needs
to do is then pull Google

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:08.640
Checkout using a Notification
of History API

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:09.660
provided in the token.

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:12.610
And we'll respond with
a full notification.

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:16.145
What this does is it removes
the requirement of a SSL

00:20:16.145 --> 00:20:18.380
certificate for your server.

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:23.270
We've also simplified order
processing down to two

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:26.760
notifications and one order
processing request. The New

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.740
Order Notification tells you
that an order has been placed

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.110
and the order details.

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:34.230
The Authorization Amount
Notification tells you that

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:37.250
the order is now chargeable,
for how much, and when the

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:38.320
offer will expire.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.670
Once you've received these two
notifications, you can fulfill

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:44.410
the order and then send the
charge and ship requests to

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:45.240
Google Checkout.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.740
And what this does
is it charges the

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.140
request in Google Checkout.

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:52.800
And then it also marks it as
shipped for your customer.

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.930
If this were an older version
of the API, there would

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:56.090
probably a lot more arrows.

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:57.820
And then so many arrows
that it might not

00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:58.900
even fit on this page.

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:03.530
But luckily, we've simplified
it in the past year.

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:05.940
And this is the New Order
Notification.

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:08.380
So New Order Notifications
contain a unique

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:09.560
Google order number.

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.340
The buyer's billing and
shipping addresses.

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:14.810
The buyer ID, which is
persistent between orders.

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:16.800
So your can use it to track your
buyers and the purchases

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.090
that they make.

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:20.050
The shopping cart, which
contains the items that a

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:21.690
customer has purchased.

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:24.050
The order adjustment, which
contains information about any

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:26.720
discounts, shipping, and taxes
that are applied to an order.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.300
And finally the order total.

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:32.700
Next, we have the Authorization
Amount

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:33.125
Notification.

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:37.780
And what this contains is
information about the total

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:39.890
amount that's been authorized
for charge, and

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:41.440
when it will expire.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.730
The order summary contains
a copy of the newer

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:44.480
notification.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.670
And you can use it to quickly
pull order information without

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:48.920
making a query to
your database.

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.600
So the final step in fulfillment
is the Charge and

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:57.280
Ship Order Request. In this
request, you'll define the

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.200
total amount to charge up to
the chargeable amounts.

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:02.600
And if you're delivering
physical goods, the shipping

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.520
information.

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:07.710
We also have requests to
granularly process orders,

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:10.620
such as charge, ship,
refund, and archive.

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.930
All of the API documentation,
including requests,

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:17.210
notifications, and cart
API, can be found at

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:21.450
code.google.com/APIs/Checkout.

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:25.700
There you'll also find sample
code and client libraries.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:30.410
So now that we have a basic
foundational knowledge of

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:33.220
Checkout from easy-to-use tools
to the APIs that power

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:36.830
them, let's see how they're
used in the real world.

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:40.260
Please welcome Rett Clevenger
and Marco Rodriguez from the

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:41.510
Steal Network.

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:46.920
RETT CLEVENGER: Thanks Peng.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.410
The Steal Network is a
collection of deal of the day

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:51.090
sites targeted towards women.

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:54.340
We launched babysteals.com
three years ago and then

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:57.760
launched kidsteals and
scrapbooksteals a year later.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.540
This last year we launched
kidcrawl.com, which is a

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:03.730
comparison shopping engine for
moms that crawls the web for

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:07.390
the lowest prices on baby, kid,
and maternity products.

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:10.050
Marco and I will be walking you
through our implementation

00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:11.480
of Google Checkout on
babysteals.com.

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:16.140
So what is babysteals.com?

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:18.960
No, we do not steal babies.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:22.690
Babysteals.com is a website that
features one new steal

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:26.740
every day at 9:00 AM and 9:00
PM Mountain Standard Time.

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.970
The community doesn't know what
the item will be or how

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:31.490
many will be available, but they
do know that it'll be a

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:36.210
boutique-quality item that
is relevant to them

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:38.310
and up to 80% off.

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:41.270
We offer appointment-based
viewing and utilize product

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:44.670
expertise, scarcity, and a
community of like-minded moms

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:47.280
to entertain women
around the world.

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.320
We all know women
love to shop.

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.320
They have a social need to
try something new and

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.710
to get a good deal.

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:54.720
We combined them.

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:57.090
For all you ladies in the
audience who have kids, be

00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:58.190
careful with the site.

00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:59.440
It's awfully addicting.

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:08.600
As Peng and Mihai mentioned,
Google Checkout has a lot of

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:09.790
functionality.

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:13.340
But you do need to build some
sort of interface to organize

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:16.010
all the information required
to make a purchase.

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:18.810
This is a look at what we've
built at our internal admin.

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:20.960
As you can tell, there's
different tabs for the

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.300
different critical
elements that are

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:23.880
required to make a purchase.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:26.240
This is where we store the
information related to the

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:32.440
product weight, the images, the
description, and a lot of

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.090
other features.

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:37.090
We can't go through it in
complete detail, but I chose

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:41.190
to focus on the Shipping tab
here because, as many of you

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:44.360
know, shipping can make or break
any e-commerce business.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.885
Shipping is especially important
for us because all

00:24:46.885 --> 00:24:50.230
of the items that we feature
each day are very unique in

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:52.840
size and shape and
availability.

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:57.110
So we built this interface to be
able to modify the shipping

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:59.300
for each feature that
we present.

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:02.210
We use carrier-calculated most
often, but we also have the

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:05.680
ability to offer flat-rate and
free shipping, as well as add

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:09.190
additional carriers like FedEx
and MediaMail for books and

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:10.910
videos depending
on the product.

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:17.240
We also designate the country
of origin and the customs

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:20.760
description to help expedite
shipping orders to Canada.

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:23.430
In the future, we plan to expand
our shipping options by

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:26.460
being able to easily edit
the Ship From address to

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:29.640
accommodate external drop
ship locations.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.910
Marco will now walk you through
this same thing from a

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:33.160
coding perspective.

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:38.320
MARCO RODRIGUEZ: As you can you
imagine, programming all

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.780
this chip combination
is not simple.

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:43.940
However, with Google
Checkout, we have

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:45.540
simplified the problem.

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:49.310
They provide a Checkout HTML API
where we can include the

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:52.250
shipping methods according
to our needs.

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:55.270
For every customer, we can
indicate the available

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:58.130
shipping options for that
specific order.

00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:01.680
To use the custom API
instructions, what you need to

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:07.120
do is you need to place them
inside a form tag with the ID

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.370
googlecart-checkout.config.

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:13.420
This form will be submitted
along with the

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.560
contents of the cart.

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.290
The most common scenario for us
is that we send the order

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:20.770
information to Google along with
the request to calculate

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:23.510
the shipping based on weight.

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:26.190
Like this example.

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:30.830
USPS Priority Mail, Parcel Post,
FedEx Home Delivery are

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:33.010
some of the shipping methods
available just

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:34.080
to mention a few.

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:37.840
There are more than that.

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:41.110
If you need something different
like a special

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:44.450
shipping method not offered by
Google, that's not a problem.

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:48.280
It is possible to calculate the
shipping fee and include

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.060
it as a shipping option
before sending the

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:51.890
information to Google.

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:55.760
We offer USPS First Class and
First Class Mail International

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:59.780
package to our customers for
orders below 13 ounces.

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:02.930
If you need to also offer free
shipping for some of your

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:04.520
products, that's
not a problem.

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.140
It is possible to do it.

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:10.690
Just include a custom shipping
method with a CRS value.

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:13.940
And if you need to offer also
local pick-up, you can do it.

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:16.080
That's easy.

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:19.020
Google offers the possibility
to include shipping

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:19.740
restrictions.

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:23.490
So you can instruct
Google where

00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:25.400
this option is available.

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:28.680
We offer only local pick-up
for Utah residents.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:31.960
RETT CLEVENGER: OK.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:35.110
So let's look through the
process from the customer's

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:37.660
shopping experience.

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:38.800
So the first thing
to note, we're

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:40.370
designed for speed shopping.

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:43.250
It only takes three clicks to
buy an item start to finish

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:45.260
using Google Checkout.

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:47.770
We start out with a cart that is
out of sight, out of mind.

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:50.670
As you'll notice in the top
right corner, we've used CSS

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:53.640
to modify the color band of the
cart to match the design

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.150
of our website.

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:59.240
As you add items to the cart,
it expands over non-critical

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.450
elements of the page.

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:05.290
As soon as the consumer clicks
Google Checkout, we validate

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:08.470
the inventory and the max order
limit that we set to

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:10.500
prevent resellers.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:13.610
If the item has already sold
out by the time they click

00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:16.800
Check Out, we display a pop-up
window that tells them that

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:19.510
we've adjusted their cart
accordingly and allow them to

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:22.560
continue on.

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.330
At this point, as soon as they
enter into Google Checkout,

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:29.330
they have four minutes to
complete their purchase.

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:32.770
We set that four-minute
limitation due to the nature

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:34.020
of our business.

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.530
Google Checkout does an
excellent job of keeping it

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:41.760
extremely simple and making it
very quick to place an order.

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:45.390
They specify the default
payment and the default

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:48.080
shipping address based
on your user setting.

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:50.750
Do note, though, that having a
default shipping address can

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:53.890
be problematic for fulfillment
because a lot of people forget

00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:56.210
to change their address
after they've moved.

00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:58.500
They've actually made it so
quick and easy to place the

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.960
order that it's easy to gloss
over an address that you

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.050
recognize, but not necessarily
realize that

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:03.930
it's your old address.

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:07.140
And we have run into that
problem a few times.

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:10.770
But the benefits far outweigh
the cost of that.

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:13.130
I can't reiterate enough how
important it is and how

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:16.680
valuable it is to have Google
process and store all of the

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:19.010
payment information.

00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:22.240
It relieves merchants like us
from a huge burden from PCI

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.520
compliance and other
security risks.

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:28.350
It really allows us to focus on
our core business, not on

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:30.720
processing payments.

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.120
Once the order is submitted,
Google Checkout sends an email

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.040
to the consumer with
the confirmation.

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:37.940
And it also has a 15-minute
buyer's remorse window where

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:41.050
the customer can cancel their
order without contacting our

00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:46.260
customer service team, which
is a very nice feature.

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:48.890
We currently get about 10% of
our traffic through the mobile

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:50.700
version of our website.

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:54.810
Here's a look at what Google
has offered for

00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:55.970
their mobile cart.

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:58.260
It's even more clean
and more simple

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:01.690
than the browser version.

00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:04.540
But it does have a couple of
shipping method bugs that

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:05.810
they're currently working on.

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:08.090
And it doesn't give you
the option to enter

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:09.420
in a promotion code.

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:12.810
Which isn't a real big deal for
our business model, but it

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:15.590
does cause frustration and
confusion with consumers when

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:18.850
we do offer a promotion code,
and they can't enter it in

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:20.020
through the mobile device.

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:23.010
I have complete faith that all
those things will be fixed

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:28.460
quickly, but do be aware
of those things.

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:29.310
All right.

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:31.980
So now that we've covered the
ordering process, let's take a

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:34.460
look at another critical
component to online business,

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:36.830
which is inventory control.

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:39.150
Inventory control is very
important because the user

00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:41.360
doesn't have the ability to walk
around the store with the

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:43.080
product in-hand.

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.980
We feel very strongly that if a
consumer places an order and

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:47.640
gives us payment, we
need to ship that

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.670
order as soon as possible.

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:53.710
We ship orders same day
95% of the time.

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:56.670
Come to find out, pregnant
women really like fast

00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:57.920
deliveries.

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:02.530
Without proper inventory
control, shipping same day

00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:04.890
becomes nearly impossible.

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:06.930
Like I said earlier, we're
all about speed shopping.

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:13.430
So we've had to create this
buffer system to help create a

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:18.620
buffer that can allow us to
monitor the speed of sales and

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:23.890
adjust the sold-out status on
our page without adjusting the

00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:25.840
actual inventory.

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.670
When a customer clicks Place
Order Now in Google Checkout,

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:32.090
it doesn't have the ability
to validate the

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:33.720
inventory at that time.

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:36.000
Like I said earlier, we have
that four-minute cart timeout.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.750
So within those four minutes,
you do have the ability to

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:42.250
have some orders come through
that had valid inventory when

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:42.800
they placed it.

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.640
But there's several other people
in cart during that

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:45.590
four minutes.

00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:47.520
And it can create
some oversells.

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:52.290
So we created this buffer to
help mitigate that and also to

00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:54.710
help adjust for cancellations
that are caused during that

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:56.800
15-minute buyer's
remorse window.

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.360
When items are cancelled, we
don't necessarily want our

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.080
site to go back up available
for sale.

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:03.630
So we use this to be able to
see what's going on and be

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:06.580
able to control all the
aspects of that.

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:08.200
Setting the buffer is
certainly not easy.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:10.870
It depends on a lot of
uncontrollable variables: the

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:13.030
site traffic, the number of
variants that we have for

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:16.260
sale, the price of the item,
a lot of different things.

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:19.730
So what we've done is made it
so that we can at least

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:24.120
monitor and watch efficiently
and be able to react

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:25.200
accordingly.

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.980
If an order contains
a sold-out item, we

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:28.260
still accept the order.

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:34.000
But we create a status called
a pending oversale and ship

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.540
the rest of the remaining items,
validate our inventory,

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:39.710
and then take a look at them and
try to fulfill them if we

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:41.570
can or cancel them
if we can't.

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:43.720
Marco will now walk you through
this same process from

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:46.300
a coding perspective.

00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:49.040
MARCO RODRIGUEZ: To prevent
oversells, we utilize the

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:52.210
Shopping Cart JavaScript API
to validate inventory just

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:55.140
before sending the order
to Google Checkout.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:58.360
A JavaScript hook has been set
up by implementing the Google

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.500
Cart and Checkout
click function.

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:03.180
So when the user clicks on the
Google Checkout button, it

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:07.940
actually, before going to
Google, makes and Ajax call to

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:11.740
our server to do a final review
of the cart contents.

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:18.670
This will decrease the number
of oversales by like 80%.

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:19.530
RETT CLEVENGER: So now
let's talk about

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:20.700
how we manage orders.

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:23.860
As Peng mentioned, Google
Checkout has an interface that

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:27.140
allows you to place orders in
four different statuses.

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:28.080
You have Pending.

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:28.850
You have Charged.

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:29.610
You have Shipped.

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:31.010
And you have Archived.

00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:33.790
For babysteals, we need more
statuses than that, so we

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:35.030
added quite a few.

00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:37.780
You'll notice here we added
Ready To Print and Printed

00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:40.530
between the Charged and
Shipped status.

00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:43.330
We also have different statuses
for orders that we're

00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:45.560
waiting for a response
from a customer.

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:48.550
And we use these statuses
to manage our

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:51.080
local pick-up queues.

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:57.790
We use the filter on the left
here to select like orders to

00:33:57.790 --> 00:34:02.590
help expedite the fulfillment
and the shipping of orders.

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:04.920
We've found that it makes it a
lot easier and a lot quicker

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.330
to ship orders--

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:08.020
since we are a deal of
the day website--

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:11.980
that have similar items rather
than shipping orders in the

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:13.120
sequence that they come in.

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:17.610
It allows us to batch process
a lot of our fulfillment.

00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:20.560
We also use these queues
to batch shipped order

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:22.600
notification and archive

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:24.139
notifications to Google Checkout.

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:31.500
Google Checkout provides a
really nice peer-to-peer

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:34.510
resource as well for those
that use Google Checkout.

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:37.840
As you can see from this demo,
the simplicity of our site

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:40.350
matches well with the simplicity
of Google Checkout.

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:43.360
And the majority of our
customers are satisfied.

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:46.550
We've got a 4.8 out of
5 star rate review.

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:50.570
We've had over 23,000 user
reviews on babysteals.com

00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:54.320
alone, 89% of which have
been a 5-star review.

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:57.010
Moms love babysteals and they
love Google Checkout.

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:03.620
So let's wrap it up with the
lessons learned over the last

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:06.360
three years of using Google
Checkout exclusively.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:08.070
First off, it's easy
to implement.

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:11.510
Like Mihai said, it can be set
up in less than one day.

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:14.770
Google Checkout is simple,
affordable, and reliable.

00:35:14.770 --> 00:35:18.410
We've processed over $13 million
in revenue within our

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:21.460
three sites and have processed
over 500,000 orders from

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:24.340
babysteals alone in the
last three years.

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:27.070
We've had less than 10
performance issues over that

00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:30.630
period of time, all of which
have been resolved and fixed

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:32.570
the same day.

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:34.730
Google is a trusted brand.

00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:39.880
We've had very few customers
mention to us that they didn't

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:41.950
want to create a Google
account in order

00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:43.480
to order from us.

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:48.020
And, most importantly, Google
allows us to keep it simple.

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:51.820
Our business model is based
on marketing and building

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:54.280
community, not on technology.

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:56.940
Google allows us to
stay focused.

00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:58.190
Thank you.

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:06.890
SATYAJEET SALGAR: Hi.

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:09.330
My name is Satyajeet Salgar and
I'm a product manager on

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:11.310
the Google Checkout Team.

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:15.110
Now Peng and Mihai gave you a
sense of what the product is

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:17.530
and some of the tools
we have available.

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:20.040
And Rett and Marco talked about
what it's like to run a

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:23.680
successful e-commerce business
on top of Google Checkout.

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:27.550
I'd like to step back a little
bit, talk a little bit about

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:30.550
some of the challenges that we
see in the payments business,

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:34.330
what our plan for success is,
and why we really want succeed

00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:37.170
to make this a better
product for you.

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:39.480
Finally, I want to announce
a few new things.

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:40.730
And then we want to open
it up for Q&amp;A.

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:48.440
Payments, like many other
businesses, requires you to

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:50.060
crack a chicken and
egg problem.

00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:52.060
Now what do I mean by that?

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:55.160
Buyers continually tell us that
they love the simplicity

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:55.550
of Checkout.

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:58.430
They love the security, they
love the user experience.

00:36:58.430 --> 00:37:01.310
Sellers tell us that they
like the fraud controls.

00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:05.440
They love to implement it, but
they have a limited amount of

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:09.100
time and want to invest in the
payment solution that will

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:10.940
give them the most buyers.

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:13.470
Buyers, on the other hand, tell
us again and again they

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:16.280
wish Google Checkout was
available everywhere they

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:17.990
wanted to transact.

00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:21.020
So more buyers makes it more
useful to sellers.

00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:22.750
Having more sellers is actually

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:25.270
what most buyers want.

00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:27.100
So what do you do?

00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:29.050
The answer, of course, is you
do a little bit of both.

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:37.700
Peng described to you our
triple rainbow growth.

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:39.650
We're proud of that, but
this is important

00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:41.210
for a couple of reasons.

00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:44.440
Now traditionally, we've relied
on you, our developers,

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:48.290
our sellers, our merchants to
grow our buyer network.

00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:51.210
People like Rett and Marco,
sites across the web, hundreds

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:52.850
of thousands of merchants.

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:58.090
But now as Commerce and Google
grows, this is something that

00:37:58.090 --> 00:38:00.970
Google can help with directly.

00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:04.380
Over the last year, a huge
part of our growth of

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:07.150
Checkout, as well as our buyer
base, has been through

00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:08.540
Commerce and Google.

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:10.510
Through Android Market, through
Google Voice, the

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:14.410
Chrome Web Store, YouTube,
which relaunched

00:38:14.410 --> 00:38:16.370
their rental site.

00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:17.290
Google eBooks.

00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:19.440
And many, many more.

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:23.200
And this is important because
when someone transacts on

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.590
Google Commerce, they
have created a

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:25.910
Google Checkout account.

00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:28.280
So when they come to your site,
they're already signed

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:30.420
up and a couple of
clicks away from

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:33.020
completing their purchase.

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:36.670
We believe this makes Google
Checkout a more valuable

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:39.370
product to developers.

00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:40.620
But that's not enough.

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:45.030
We think about how
we want to serve

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:48.200
developers in three ways.

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:50.800
The first, we want to make
the tools we have

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.760
much easier to use.

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:56.400
We want to offer you new and
more powerful tools.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.310
And finally, we want
to grow and support

00:38:58.310 --> 00:39:00.920
our developer community.

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:04.250
On the first bucket, making it
easier to use the tools we

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:07.030
have, we're proud of the work
we've done the last year and

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:09.320
actually delighted to see the
impact that it's had on you,

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:10.950
the developer community.

00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:15.330
Launching APID 2.5, actually
we've seen how it's made

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:17.450
integration with Checkout
much easier.

00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:20.040
Similarly, we're glad to see the
growth in the use of Buy

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:22.860
Now merchants and
Shopping Carts.

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:24.970
I'll talk a little bit more
about the new tools we're

00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:27.030
going to make available to
you, and you can find out

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:30.740
about a lot of them here
at Google I/O.

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:33.440
Finally, we're committed,
through our developer forums

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.570
and through the Developer
Relations team led by Peng and

00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:38.880
Mihai, to your success and to
helping you succeed with

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:41.310
Google Checkout.

00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:44.640
So what's new?

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.750
Developers often tell us they
wish that they could have a

00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:52.100
button where they could have
their users actually support

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:54.120
their projects, their blog, or
something they were were

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:54.970
working on.

00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:57.260
Now, for a number of reasons,
our Donate button is

00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:59.560
restricted to non-profits.

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:02.660
However, in the next couple of
weeks, on Google Blogger,

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:05.400
we'll be making available the
Support button, which you can

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:09.627
actually use to have your users
support your blog or

00:40:09.627 --> 00:40:10.877
your sites.

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:16.900
If you can stay in this room,
you'll learn more

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:18.000
about Google One Pass.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.780
This a product, which you can
use to control access to your

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:22.300
digital content.

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:24.810
The team had a lot of success
with the news vertical, and

00:40:24.810 --> 00:40:27.000
they're excited to talk to
you about their product.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.410
Tomorrow you can learn about
In-App Payments for the web,

00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:34.460
which is a simplified buy flow
for HTML and Flash developers.

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:43.170
So what is your takeaway
from here?

00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:44.600
First, I don't want to
talk about payments.

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:50.420
I want you to remember
that monetization

00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:51.580
is more than payments.

00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:55.370
Google offers tons of tools
for you to help

00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:57.700
monetize your sites.

00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:59.530
People tell me we have
a relatively

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:02.080
successful ads business.

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:05.970
So think about ad sense and
display ads on your site.

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:09.770
Think about using ad words to
get more users to your site.

00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:12.320
Think about using Google
Analytics to understand what

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:14.960
users are actually doing on
your site and uncover new

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:16.810
sources of revenue.

00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:19.640
Think about Shopping APIs to
improve discoverability.

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.510
There are tons of tools
that Google

00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:24.540
offers to help you monetize.

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:29.310
But finally do think about
Commerce and Payments.

00:41:29.310 --> 00:41:32.110
There has never been a better
time to think about

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:33.210
e-commerce.

00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:37.220
Last year, the industry in the
United States was estimated at

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:40.440
about $175 billion.

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:43.930
It's estimated to grow to $300
billion in a few years.

00:41:43.930 --> 00:41:45.850
And globally, in a couple
of years, it will

00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:49.110
cross over $1 trillion.

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:52.520
There is tons of opportunity
there.

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:57.680
However, the challenges
remain the same.

00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:01.650
Fraud continues to be a huge
challenge on online commerce.

00:42:01.650 --> 00:42:03.790
We're convinced we have
the best fraud

00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:06.340
system available online.

00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:09.360
Compliance is a huge challenge,
especially

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.150
internationally, and especially

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:13.950
if you aren't compliant.

00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:16.010
But again, this is something
that Google Checkout

00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:17.320
can help you with.

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:18.140
Conversions.

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:21.930
Making sure that once the user
intends to buy, nothing gets

00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:24.290
in their way from completing
their purchase.

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:26.760
Again, this is something
that Google Checkout

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:28.010
can help you with.

00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:33.150
So we have a flexible
API and tools to

00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:35.380
help you build a business.

00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:36.560
What does that mean?

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:38.750
Get started.

00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:40.910
Create a Google Checkout
account.

00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:42.420
Download some sample code.

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:44.410
Check out our Docs
and our website.

00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:47.640
Engage with us on Twitter,
online, and, of

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:49.930
course, right now.

00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:52.470
So let's start the questions.

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:53.790
And, by the way,
one more thing.

00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:56.730
If you hang around a little bit,
on your way out, Jessica

00:42:56.730 --> 00:43:02.200
Smallen will have some swag for
you to carry home as well.

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:03.890
And why doesn't everyone
come up for questions?

00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:05.410
Yeah.

00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:06.080
Sure.

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:10.390
If you can come up here, or we
can repeat your question.

00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:12.842
Why don't we start there.

00:43:12.842 --> 00:43:14.542
AUDIENCE: I'm from
Montreal, and we

00:43:14.542 --> 00:43:17.702
have a weird tax system.

00:43:17.702 --> 00:43:19.646
They have a tax.

00:43:19.646 --> 00:43:21.104
And they've got the
[INAUDIBLE].

00:43:21.104 --> 00:43:23.534
And then the province charges
tax on everything.

00:43:23.534 --> 00:43:27.940
Is there a way to make that
simple [INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:32.240
SATYAJEET SALGAR: So right now,
actually Google Checkout

00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:33.750
isn't available in Canada.

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:34.550
AUDIENCE: What?

00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:34.970
SATYAJEET SALGAR: Yes.

00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:37.190
Except for digital goods
and Android market.

00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:41.280
And one of the many reasons
was the back system.

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.060
So again, that's something
we're working on.

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:44.812
And we do want to expand
internationally.

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:51.340
Why don't we start at the back
and then move forward?

00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:52.048
The gentleman there.

00:43:52.048 --> 00:43:52.333
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:43:52.333 --> 00:43:52.526
Thank you.

00:43:52.526 --> 00:43:54.916
I'm kind of new to the
commercing, but I understand

00:43:54.916 --> 00:43:58.750
that selling online goods will
be directionally shifted.

00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:01.670
One of the things that I would
like to be able to do is

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:03.450
recurring payments.

00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:05.530
Is that something that Google
Checkout is for?

00:44:05.530 --> 00:44:07.970
SATYAJEET SALGAR: Yes, we have
a Recurring Payments API that

00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:10.110
allows you to do recurring
payments.

00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:12.500
We've had it in beta
now for over a

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:13.603
year and a half, actually.

00:44:13.603 --> 00:44:14.350
PENG YING: A long time.

00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:15.370
SATYAJEET SALGAR: We should
take it out of beta.

00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:18.550
But yeah, we support
recurring payments.

00:44:21.250 --> 00:44:24.200
AUDIENCE: So how do
you get the money?

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:26.520
So people run through
the flow, and then

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:28.130
they make the purchase.

00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:29.890
Is it attached to
some accounts?

00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:31.550
SATYAJEET SALGAR: Rett, how
do you get the money?

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:32.840
RETT CLEVENGER: How do
you get the money?

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:35.350
Well, you set up
direct deposit.

00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:37.790
So at all times in Google
Checkout, in the interface,

00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:41.580
you can look at the Payments
tab and see what you

00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:42.920
transacted for the day.

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:45.280
And then a few days later, that
same amount will end up

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:47.850
in your checking account after
they've done all the fraud

00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:49.945
verification and processed
all the credit cards and

00:44:49.945 --> 00:44:50.810
that sort of thing.

00:44:50.810 --> 00:44:53.960
So there is a little bit of a
lag, of a delay, but once you

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:57.060
get moving, it all just moves
with the speed of business.

00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:03.410
The gentleman back there.

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:04.973
AUDIENCE: How much
does it cost?

00:45:04.973 --> 00:45:08.917
And can a customer with a
credit card use Google

00:45:08.917 --> 00:45:13.272
Checkout without creating
a Google account?

00:45:13.272 --> 00:45:15.107
SATYAJEET SALGAR: Do you
want to take that?

00:45:15.107 --> 00:45:16.500
PENG YING: Can we have a mic
or something down here?

00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:23.300
Well, it's a tiered
fee structure.

00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:24.730
And it's very similar
to PayPal.

00:45:24.730 --> 00:45:27.940
Actually, I think it's kind
of identical to PayPal's.

00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:29.800
The lowest is 2.9%.

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:31.110
And what is it?

00:45:31.110 --> 00:45:34.270
SATYAJEET SALGAR: The highest
goes up to 1.9 depending upon

00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:36.710
your transaction volume
per month.

00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:37.920
You get put in a tier.

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:42.290
And it goes from 1.9 to 2.9%.

00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:44.080
PENG YING: He's right.

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:45.490
SATYAJEET SALGAR: And the second
question was about

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:47.210
creating a Google account?

00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:47.790
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:50.370
You have a customer with a
credit card [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:51.220
SATYAJEET SALGAR: So, no.

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:53.110
So right now you do need to
create a Google account in

00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:54.360
order to complete
a transaction.

00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:00.069
The gentleman right
next to you.

00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:02.334
AUDIENCE: Do you support
micropayments?

00:46:02.334 --> 00:46:04.890
Like $1 or less?

00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:07.650
SATYAJEET SALGAR: We do
support a dollar.

00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:08.700
So we do support it.

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:11.730
And you'll actually find lots
of goods in Android Market

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:13.280
that are priced at $0.99.

00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:18.930
MIHAI IONESCUE: All of my
testing orders are for $0.01.

00:46:18.930 --> 00:46:20.650
PENG YING: For micropayments,
you should probably attend

00:46:20.650 --> 00:46:24.075
tomorrow's talk about
In-App Payments.

00:46:24.075 --> 00:46:29.010
I think that's probably a better
venue of purchasing.

00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:29.940
SATYAJEET SALGAR: The
gentleman in front.

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:33.090
Oh, he's had his hand
up for a while.

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:37.455
AUDIENCE: Do you guys support
Level 3 [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:37.455 --> 00:46:37.940
pass through?

00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:40.607
So that item level transactions
to the credit

00:46:40.607 --> 00:46:45.215
cards and the categorization
of [INAUDIBLE PHRASE]

00:46:45.215 --> 00:46:47.170
the government?

00:46:47.170 --> 00:46:48.500
SATYAJEET SALGAR: I'm not sure
I understand the question.

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:51.080
But we should chat
after this later.

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:55.390
So you mean, will we basically,
based on the credit

00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:59.700
card transaction, back out
the elements, the items?

00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:02.170
AUDIENCE: Are you a Level 1
provider, or do you go down to

00:47:02.170 --> 00:47:03.030
Level 2 or 3?

00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:04.680
SATYAJEET SALGAR: No, we
are a Level 1 provider.

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:05.170
AUDIENCE: Level 1?

00:47:05.170 --> 00:47:08.600
And then how do you guys handle
the chargeback process?

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:11.050
I looked online, and there
was just like emails.

00:47:11.050 --> 00:47:12.520
As a merchant, how
does that happen?

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:15.460
And how does that work
with your back end

00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:17.330
system that you have?

00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:19.880
SATYAJEET SALGAR: So to repeat
the question, how do we handle

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:22.180
the chargeback process?

00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:24.530
RETT CLEVENGER: Yeah,
it does happen.

00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:26.730
But if you do good business, it
doesn't happen very often.

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:31.910
So it becomes one of those
things where it's somewhat of

00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:32.910
a subjective thing.

00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:35.060
You try to do as good a job
that you can with your

00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:38.790
tracking and all the other
elements that can prove that

00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:39.920
you've done what
you need to do.

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:41.670
But at the end of the day,
it does come up.

00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:43.250
It doesn't happen very often.

00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:46.110
A lot of people, at least in our
business, they really did

00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:46.770
want the item.

00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:49.990
And as long as you did
everything you could in a

00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:52.560
correct way, then they're
satisfied.

00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:54.544
But yeah, it does come up.

00:47:54.544 --> 00:47:56.005
PENG YING: Gentleman
behind him.

00:47:56.005 --> 00:47:57.709
AUDIENCE: I'm one of
those bloggers who

00:47:57.709 --> 00:47:58.927
wanted a Donate button.

00:47:58.927 --> 00:48:01.605
And I'm confused about the
difference between a Donate

00:48:01.605 --> 00:48:02.823
button and a Support button.

00:48:02.823 --> 00:48:05.750
Can I call it a Donate button?

00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:07.290
SATYAJEET SALGAR: No,
so you should call

00:48:07.290 --> 00:48:08.400
it a Support button.

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:11.130
And the reason is because of the
way we're set up, Donate

00:48:11.130 --> 00:48:13.690
has a certain connotation
and is applied only to

00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:15.100
non-profits.

00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:17.290
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:18.320
SATYAJEET SALGAR: Yep.

00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:21.770
I had the same reaction and
expression on my face.

00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:23.710
AUDIENCE: Can you explain why?

00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:25.280
SATYAJEET SALGAR: Legally, it
has certain implications

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:27.360
because of money transferring
licenses and the

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:28.730
way we're set up.

00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:32.310
So Donate, as we're set up,
applies to nonprofits

00:48:32.310 --> 00:48:32.630
[INAUDIBLE]

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:33.880
legal.

00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:38.630
Remember I talked about
compliance?

00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:41.450
This is part of it.

00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:42.683
Gentleman behind you.

00:48:42.683 --> 00:48:43.933
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:50.620
SATYAJEET SALGAR: All right.

00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:54.080
So we'll get better at repeating
the question or

00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:54.380
coming to the mic.

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:56.090
Gentleman at the mic?

00:48:56.090 --> 00:48:59.220
AUDIENCE: What does it mean if
it's using Google Checkout

00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:02.470
compared to PayPal?

00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:04.490
SATYAJEET SALGAR: So I think
there are similarities within

00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:09.740
the product, but Google Checkout
is really meant to

00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:13.360
simplify the shopping
experience.

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:15.540
PayPal provides a couple of
products that end up doing

00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:16.860
something similar.

00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:20.200
We believe that we have the best
in class fraud system and

00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:22.470
provide a better user
experience.

00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:27.010
And we have a lot of merchants
that support what we say.

00:49:27.010 --> 00:49:28.250
So you're right.

00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:29.530
There are pieces of
functionality

00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:30.210
that are very similar.

00:49:30.210 --> 00:49:33.250
And I think experiences as a
merchant, experiences as a

00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:34.710
buyer will speak to the

00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:36.830
differences between the products.

00:49:36.830 --> 00:49:37.695
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:49:37.695 --> 00:49:40.170
SATYAJEET SALGAR: Sure.

00:49:40.170 --> 00:49:41.690
AUDIENCE: Hi, I work at NPR.

00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:44.600
And we have a lot of donations
that we would like to process,

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:47.830
but there's a lot of different
entities within our system

00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:49.780
that the money would
need to go to.

00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:53.520
Is it possible for us to have
one entry point that would

00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:56.560
actually go out to many
different sources in the end

00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:00.340
without us ever actually
touching the money?

00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:01.460
PENG YING: Disbursements.

00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:04.480
To the best of my knowledge, we
don't have the Disbursement

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:07.070
API that allows you to
distribute the income.

00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:10.730
Do you know anything
like that?

00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:13.370
SATYAJEET SALGAR:
No, there is--

00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:15.610
I'd love to talk to you about
your use case, but in essence

00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:19.116
there's one bank account that
we push the money to.

00:50:19.116 --> 00:50:22.020
AUDIENCE: He's talking about
split payments, what PayPal

00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:23.550
calls split payments.

00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:24.020
SATYAJEET SALGAR: I got it.

00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:28.170
No, we don't support
split payments.

00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:30.510
AUDIENCE: So UPS delivers
Saturday service

00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:31.730
to certain zip codes.

00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:36.270
And if a user wants to ship
to certain zip codes on a

00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:42.310
Saturday, is there a call to go
to a no, you can't deliver

00:50:42.310 --> 00:50:45.860
there on Saturday type deal?

00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:49.350
I thought there was an API
that goes there, and it

00:50:49.350 --> 00:50:50.770
calculates the shipping.

00:50:50.770 --> 00:50:51.920
PENG YING: I think what you're
talking about is a

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:55.300
carrier-calculated
shipping API.

00:50:55.300 --> 00:51:02.500
Right now, Saturday delivery
service is a different option

00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:03.970
than like UPS Ground.

00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:06.110
Would it be UPS Ground with
Saturday service?

00:51:06.110 --> 00:51:08.385
Or is it just UPS Ground?

00:51:08.385 --> 00:51:08.840
RETT CLEVENGER: It's
a separate service.

00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:10.180
PENG YING: It's a separate
service?

00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:12.310
Then I don't think, at this
point, we might not support

00:51:12.310 --> 00:51:14.470
that service.

00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:17.318
But we're always looking to
improve our functionality.

00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:22.630
AUDIENCE: This is a question
for the Steal Network guys.

00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:25.400
You mentioned you had a buffer
between, I'm assuming, your

00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:27.700
back end business system that's
managing your inventory

00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:29.050
and the Google Checkout
process.

00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:33.100
Can you speak to your process
there a little bit in terms of

00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:35.410
how many items you're dealing
with, and how you actually get

00:51:35.410 --> 00:51:37.090
those things up into
Checkout and

00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:38.930
manage that buffer process?

00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:40.530
RETT CLEVENGER: Sure.

00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:41.890
It changes every day.

00:51:41.890 --> 00:51:44.830
We've toyed with a couple
different algorithms to try to

00:51:44.830 --> 00:51:48.330
do predictive analysis for how
many the right number is based

00:51:48.330 --> 00:51:49.920
on all the different
variables.

00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:53.570
But when it came down to it,
the human interaction with

00:51:53.570 --> 00:51:57.540
being able to visually predict
before this deal goes live--

00:51:57.540 --> 00:52:00.400
so five minutes before this deal
goes live, we go in and

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:01.490
set the buffer.

00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:03.740
And no matter what we
set, we're wrong.

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:06.560
And so what we created is a
dashboard to at least be able

00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:07.730
to see what's going on.

00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:10.200
Because one of the things that's
unique about us is that

00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:13.970
we have one product, but we
could have several sizes or

00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:16.550
several colors available
at the same time.

00:52:16.550 --> 00:52:17.915
All of those different
variants sell

00:52:17.915 --> 00:52:19.050
at different speeds.

00:52:19.050 --> 00:52:23.500
And so one buffer for all
doesn't work, but what we did

00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:26.540
is surface the information so
that we can visually see.

00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:28.130
And we know within minutes.

00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:32.550
We've actually had products sell
at 180 orders per minute.

00:52:32.550 --> 00:52:34.730
So you can watch very
quickly what's taken

00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:35.600
off and what's not.

00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:36.770
And then you just sit
and adjust the

00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:37.870
buffer in real time.

00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:41.030
So you can increase it if you
low-balled it, or you can

00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:44.110
start to decrease it if the
speed in which the sales are

00:52:44.110 --> 00:52:46.450
happening are slower than
what you predicted.

00:52:46.450 --> 00:52:49.260
So on that slide that I had,
you saw two graphs.

00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:52.620
And one of them is to show the
orders per minute to help you

00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:55.740
gauge OK, if I'm at 50 orders
per minute and my buffer's

00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:58.260
only 20, I don't have
a chance, right?

00:52:58.260 --> 00:52:59.840
I need to equal those out.

00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:03.140
But if my orders per minute are
10 orders per minute, and

00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:06.590
I have a buffer of 20, then the
probability of that many

00:53:06.590 --> 00:53:08.700
people being in Checkout
for that four-minute

00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:10.650
timeframe is less.

00:53:10.650 --> 00:53:13.160
But at the end of the day,
you don't know until

00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:14.340
it's finally over.

00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:21.740
And I have to say, it's one of
the only things that made us

00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:24.180
work a little bit harder
than what we expected.

00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:27.740
And it's all because of that
inability to validate the

00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:30.190
inventory when they hit
Place Order Now.

00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:32.530
You can validate the inventory
before they go into it, but

00:53:32.530 --> 00:53:34.020
there is a timeframe.

00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:36.490
And then the other thing to be
aware of is that 15-minute

00:53:36.490 --> 00:53:37.800
buyer's remorse window.

00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:41.120
That introduces cancellations
back into your system that you

00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:42.900
have to figure out something
to deal with.

00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:46.175
And for us, we make judgment
calls for whether we're going

00:53:46.175 --> 00:53:48.530
to make the product available
for sale or not.

00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:51.280
Sometimes those cancellations
offset the oversells, and

00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:52.255
everything washes out.

00:53:52.255 --> 00:53:53.940
And everybody's happy.

00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:56.430
MARCO RODRIGUEZ: Something I
want to add for you is that it

00:53:56.430 --> 00:53:59.850
is important for us because
we don't take back orders.

00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:03.550
If you are able to take back
orders, it doesn't matter if

00:54:03.550 --> 00:54:05.160
you have oversales.

00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:05.440
RETT CLEVENGER: Right.

00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:08.610
We have what we have,
and it's gone.

00:54:08.610 --> 00:54:09.265
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:54:09.265 --> 00:54:13.650
On certain carriers on the
Android Market, you can choose

00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:17.180
to pay with your billing.

00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:21.455
Does Google plan to do that with
Checkout, maybe like Big

00:54:21.455 --> 00:54:24.250
Coins or PayPal or anything?

00:54:24.250 --> 00:54:27.140
SATYAJEET SALGAR: So right now,
that feature is available

00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:28.140
only in Android Market.

00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:30.190
And the idea is-- it's
through Checkout--

00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:34.140
but the idea is we support
carrier billing for Android

00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:35.300
Market only.

00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:37.850
AUDIENCE: What about like
carrier billing for Checkout?

00:54:37.850 --> 00:54:39.660
You think that's
ever possible?

00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:41.230
SATYAJEET SALGAR: So at least
the way we think about it is

00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:43.970
we have carrier billing for
Checkout, but for now there

00:54:43.970 --> 00:54:45.631
are no plans to take it
beyond Android Market.

00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:49.850
Sure.

00:54:49.850 --> 00:54:51.330
Do you mind coming
up to the mic?

00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:54.248
Or I can repeat your question,
that's fine.

00:54:54.248 --> 00:54:56.921
AUDIENCE: So Apple and PayPal
released a kind of accounts in

00:54:56.921 --> 00:54:58.622
force number.

00:54:58.622 --> 00:55:02.024
Do you guys ever talk about
that, about how many accounts

00:55:02.024 --> 00:55:03.000
are [INAUDIBLE]?

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.510
SATYAJEET SALGAR: Sure, so the
question was Apple and PayPal

00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:06.800
had released a number.

00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:07.870
Do we talk about it?

00:55:07.870 --> 00:55:08.840
We don't.

00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:11.160
The only number I think we have
right now are hundreds of

00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:13.780
thousands of merchants and
millions of buyers.

00:55:17.050 --> 00:55:19.250
AUDIENCE: Can you mention
what merchant

00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:20.720
countries you support?

00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:22.900
RETT CLEVENGER: Yeah,
so US and Canada.

00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:26.450
You'd be amazed at how many
orders we ship to Canada.

00:55:26.450 --> 00:55:29.800
It is one of those things, like
Marco had mentioned, the

00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:33.020
way that they've built Google
Checkout is that you can

00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:36.050
manipulate the shipping
options, do a lot

00:55:36.050 --> 00:55:36.730
of different things.

00:55:36.730 --> 00:55:41.220
And so we've been able to offer
carrier-calculated or

00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:43.320
flat-rate to Canadians.

00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:46.440
And we've found that they really
do appreciate it when

00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:48.760
US companies will go
to the extra effort

00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:49.940
of shipping to Canada.

00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:51.190
It is more work on our end.

00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:53.630
You've got to fill out customs
forms and different things.

00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:56.010
But at the end of the day, they
have limited options,

00:55:56.010 --> 00:55:57.410
especially for boutique-quality

00:55:57.410 --> 00:55:59.320
items like we sell.

00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:01.692
We'll have 20 to 30%
of our orders in a

00:56:01.692 --> 00:56:03.070
day going up to Canada.

00:56:03.070 --> 00:56:05.540
They have to wait quite a bit
longer for the delivery, but

00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:06.450
they're used to it.

00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:09.160
There's an exchange at the
border and their Canadian post

00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:13.230
isn't extremely fast. But at the
end of the day, they are

00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:16.480
appreciative that we will sell
to them up there because a lot

00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:19.720
of the brands that we sell
themselves will not ship

00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:20.920
directly to Canada.

00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:22.300
So they can get the products
through us.

00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:24.920
PENG YING: I think you're
talking about for developers,

00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:26.766
which countries can actually
sell through Checkout, right?

00:56:26.766 --> 00:56:27.440
AUDIENCE: Very sorry.

00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:28.601
Yes.

00:56:28.601 --> 00:56:30.020
RETT CLEVENGER: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:30.860
AUDIENCE: It was a
very kind reply.

00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:33.650
I just didn't articulate the
question well enough.

00:56:33.650 --> 00:56:36.110
Thank you.

00:56:36.110 --> 00:56:41.330
The question I meant to ask
was what merchant bank

00:56:41.330 --> 00:56:43.290
accounts you guys support.

00:56:43.290 --> 00:56:46.160
PENG YING: So for Checkout
right now, for web-based

00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:49.100
Checkout, it's just in
the US and UK still.

00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:52.280
But for things like Android
Market, we support a number of

00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:53.380
additional countries.

00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:54.740
AUDIENCE: Do you have
a road map for

00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:56.860
other merchant countries?

00:56:56.860 --> 00:56:57.990
SATYAJEET SALGAR: We don't
have a timeline,

00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:59.620
a road map as yet.

00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:05.440
But again, we do want to grow
Checkout internationally.

00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:08.175
Through starting with Android
Market, we've removed a lot of

00:57:08.175 --> 00:57:10.060
the roadblocks to do that.

00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:11.726
We don't have a timeline
yet to talk about.

00:57:14.310 --> 00:57:14.810
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:57:14.810 --> 00:57:18.520
I would like to know if Google
gets a cut of every sale, a

00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:20.600
commission?

00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:23.790
SATYAJEET SALGAR: We do have
a transaction fee, so

00:57:23.790 --> 00:57:26.000
that's the cut for--

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:27.380
AUDIENCE: What is the amount?

00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:28.720
SATYAJEET SALGAR: It ranges
depending upon

00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:29.680
volume on your site.

00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:32.450
It ranges from 1.9% to 2.9%.

00:57:32.450 --> 00:57:33.310
AUDIENCE: Oh, was that
the question before?

00:57:33.310 --> 00:57:33.630
SATYAJEET SALGAR: Yeah.

00:57:33.630 --> 00:57:34.760
AUDIENCE: Yeah, OK, I
think I've got it.

00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:35.240
Thank you.

00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:37.340
RETT CLEVENGER: But I can tell
you, no matter what you do, if

00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:38.910
you're processing credit cards,
you're going to have a

00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:40.160
credit card transaction fee.

00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:42.450
The fact that you can use
Google Checkout in the

00:57:42.450 --> 00:57:45.570
interface for free,
essentially--

00:57:45.570 --> 00:57:46.480
it really is free.

00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:48.770
No matter what you do, you're
going to pay a fee to process

00:57:48.770 --> 00:57:51.800
credit cards unless you're
the bank yourself.

00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:53.680
It is very competitively priced
and one of the main

00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:56.160
reasons why we selected
Google Checkout.

00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:58.410
PENG YING: Let's go
to the back first.

00:57:58.410 --> 00:58:00.030
AUDIENCE: One of the questions
earlier asked, whether you

00:58:00.030 --> 00:58:01.645
need to create a Google
account, and

00:58:01.645 --> 00:58:02.320
the answer was yes.

00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:05.600
But I'm wondering if you could
say more about why that is.

00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:07.880
It seems like a big barrier
to conversion.

00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:10.100
It's definitely not the
three-click process you're

00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:10.840
hoping for.

00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:12.820
I've got my credit
card in hand--

00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:14.505
oh, I guess I'd have to--

00:58:14.505 --> 00:58:16.280
Nah, maybe not.

00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:17.730
SATYAJEET SALGAR: There's
a trade-off.

00:58:17.730 --> 00:58:18.810
That's the first purchase.

00:58:18.810 --> 00:58:21.190
But think about the
second, right?

00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:22.370
Which is you're signed up.

00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:24.170
You're literally a couple
of clicks away.

00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:25.970
And you don't have to enter
your credit card again.

00:58:25.970 --> 00:58:27.830
AUDIENCE: On our site, we allow
you to create a login

00:58:27.830 --> 00:58:29.140
after you give us
a credit card.

00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:30.790
And that's one of the things
you should do.

00:58:30.790 --> 00:58:32.040
That way I've got your money.

00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:34.010
And if you want to purchase
with us again, you'll

00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:36.420
be able to do so.

00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:37.830
Let me rephrase my question.

00:58:37.830 --> 00:58:41.010
Does Google want to remove that
restriction, or is this

00:58:41.010 --> 00:58:42.160
restriction something
that Google

00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:44.420
believes is a good thing?

00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:48.100
SATYAJEET SALGAR: We believe it
helps the user experience.

00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:50.390
I lifted it off our feedback,
we think this is the right

00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:55.420
combination for the
user in this case.

00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:56.110
AUDIENCE: I disagree.

00:58:56.110 --> 00:58:57.840
Thank you.

00:58:57.840 --> 00:58:59.840
RETT CLEVENGER: From the
merchant's perspective, we did

00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:02.750
battle this, especially three
years ago when Google Checkout

00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:03.870
wasn't very well known.

00:59:03.870 --> 00:59:06.050
We did get a lot of feedback,
I do not want to have to

00:59:06.050 --> 00:59:08.520
create a Google account in
order to order from you.

00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:10.700
In hindsight, now they
thank us because it

00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:11.790
is that much faster.

00:59:11.790 --> 00:59:14.260
And the platform itself
has grown wider.

00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:16.740
And now they're seeing more
usefulness of that account.

00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:19.030
So you're right, there was
a significant resistance.

00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:20.830
And we second-guessed
it a little bit.

00:59:20.830 --> 00:59:22.720
We let it go long enough.

00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:26.520
And our site is addicting enough
that once they do get

00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:29.760
that second and third, they do
appreciate the functionality

00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:30.750
after the fact.

00:59:30.750 --> 00:59:33.540
MARCO RODRIGUEZ: I can tell you
from experience that one

00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:35.980
year ago, we offered
both credit card

00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:39.550
payment and Google Checkout.

00:59:39.550 --> 00:59:44.600
And the maximum day was like
3% transactions over the

00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:45.150
credit card.

00:59:45.150 --> 00:59:47.450
People still preferred
Google Checkout.

00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:51.210
And we had a couple days where
Google Checkout had troubles.

00:59:51.210 --> 00:59:55.050
And people were waiting for
Google Checkout, even when the

00:59:55.050 --> 00:59:57.100
credit card was enabled.

00:59:57.100 --> 00:59:57.710
PENG YING: Last question.

00:59:57.710 --> 00:59:59.580
SATYAJEET SALGAR: Last question
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:00.030
AUDIENCE: I saw

01:00:00.030 --> 01:00:03.090
that you can specify the
currency in the APIs.

01:00:03.090 --> 01:00:05.650
And you said that Google
Checkout is only available in

01:00:05.650 --> 01:00:07.100
the US right now?

01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:09.160
I'm kind of confused.

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:12.270
If I have an international
site and I'm offering in

01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:15.050
Euros, can I use Google
Checkout to

01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:17.020
specify that currency?

01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:20.690
And do you convert the amount?

01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:22.910
SATYAJEET SALGAR: I'm not sure
which slide it was, but--

01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:26.690
So we actually don't offer
things beyond the United

01:00:26.690 --> 01:00:27.940
States and the UK.

01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:31.100
I'm not sure what's--

01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:34.380
and I guess your currency
was the US and the UK.

01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:34.870
AUDIENCE: I see.

01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:37.110
So it's only limited to those
two currencies right now.

01:00:37.110 --> 01:00:37.483
OK.

01:00:37.483 --> 01:00:37.856
Got it.

01:00:37.856 --> 01:00:38.230
Thanks.

01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:39.500
PENG YING: Unless you're doing
the Android Market or

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:42.215
something else, then we also
support additional currencies.

01:00:42.215 --> 01:00:43.290
SATYAJEET SALGAR: I believe
we're done.

01:00:43.290 --> 01:00:43.450
PENG YING: Yeah, sorry.

01:00:43.450 --> 01:00:43.530
SATYAJEET SALGAR: But you should
ask your question.

01:00:43.530 --> 01:00:44.780
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:51.670
SATYAJEET SALGAR: And to be
clear, buyers can pay in any

01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:54.140
currency as long as their
credit card supports it.

01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:57.630
It's the currency
that you charge.

01:00:57.630 --> 01:01:00.180
So you can be in another country
and pay for something

01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:01.800
in dollars.

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:06.146
It's more the currency that
we'll actually charge your

01:01:06.146 --> 01:01:06.998
credit card in.

01:01:06.998 --> 01:01:09.100
PENG YING: Thank you guys.
