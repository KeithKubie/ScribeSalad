00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.830
&gt;&gt; Poverty and disease are major problems
in emerging markets.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.650
Poverty and disease are major problems in
Africa.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.981
They are major problems in India, they are
major problems in the

00:00:12.981 --> 00:00:19.390
so-called Third World countries.
Lack of access to education is a major challenge

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.060
in these communities.
With better education, better information,

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.559
we can go a long way in
addressing poverty and disease in emerging

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:30.949
marketing.
But unfortunately, currently not enough money

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.579
is being spent in the
efforts to address poverty and disease in

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.510
Africa, to address poverty
and disease in the emerging market.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.800
Why is this the case?
The major problem is that developed countries

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.880
feel about AIDS -
HIV/AIDS, poverty, as African problems, as

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.399
emerging market problems.
They don't realize that global challenges

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:59.640
are interconnected.
If we don't address poverty in Africa there's

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.390
no way we can have
Africans embrace the climate change agenda.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.170
If we don't address HIV/AIDS, HIV/AIDS in
the emerging markets, there's

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.549
no way those communities are going to be part
of the agenda to serve

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:21.360
the orphans, the agenda to serve the environment.
In other words, we must understand the need

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.540
to address these global
challenges in an interconnected manner.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.509
We must understand interdependence of communities
because if Africa is

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.600
not on board on the climate change agenda,
if the poor countries are

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.000
not on board on serving the oceans, the oceans
cannot be served.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.810
The climate change agenda cannot be adopted.
So what we need to do is to understand that

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:51.180
HIV/AIDS, poverty, nuclear
weapons, climate change, the oceans -- all

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.300
these global challenges are
interconnected.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:03.899
What we need is a global approach to poverty.
You can not be a rich nation when there's

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.789
a poor nation of Haiti next
door.

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:11.650
You cannot be a poor European nation, when
there's starvation in

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.590
Darfur, when there's poverty in Zimbabwe.
In other words, the sustainability of the

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.390
globe requires all of us,
developed and developing nations, to work

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.470
together in attempting to
address the poverty challenge, in addressing

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.440
the education challenge,
in addressing the challenge around disease.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:41.660
Because if we do not do that, the poverty
of Sudan will be the poverty

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.000
of America.
The poverty of Liberia, the poverty of Zimbabwe

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.820
would define the
poverty of Germany, of Switzerland.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:58.180
No nation can ever claim two worlds, a claim
to success when the levels

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:06.860
of poverty are dismal within the same globe.
So given this new approach of interdependency

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.560
of nations,
interconnectedness of global challenges, we'll

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.930
be able to then have a
much more sustainable answer to the issues

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.650
of poverty, to the issues of
disease, and people who take a vested interest

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.830
approach in wiping out
the disease like malaria, tuberculosis, and

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:33.450
also reducing the incidents
of HIV/AIDS in Africa and elsewhere.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.700
This is what we need to do.
And also we have said education is a key driver

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.160
in addressing poverty
and disease.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.910
Hence, the provision of access to education,
the provision of

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.580
information, the leveraging of the ICT revolution
is a unique

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.060
opportunity by which developing nations can
reach out to poor nations.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.890
So that the poor nations with information
and education can address

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.420
their problems around poverty, their problems
around HIV/AIDS, their

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.830
problems around economic development.
There's an opportunity here using science

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.530
and technology to leapfrog
from the 19th century, where African economies

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.140
are, to the 21st
century.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.299
Technology is a big equalizer.
But that technology must be shared.

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.229
There must be technology transfer from the
North to the South.

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:29.449
There must be technology transfer from the
West to the East, so that we

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.889
empower and develop ourselves, and in doing
so, by the way, is not

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:37.860
charity.
When Ghana is successful, when Zimbabwe is

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.289
successful, when Liberia is
successful, when Sudan is successful, that

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.870
will be a key driver for
global success.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.770
So we are saying we must redefine the meaning
of national success.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:57.990
We must talk about regional success.
We must talk about global success because

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.569
we are going to sink or swim
together as a globe.

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:05.991
This is the new way forward around poverty
and disease.
