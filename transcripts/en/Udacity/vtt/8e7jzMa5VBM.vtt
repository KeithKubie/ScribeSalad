00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.190
So thus far what we have done, is we have

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.440
defined the class Movie and then we went ahead and defined

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.220
a couple of instances of that class, namely Toy Story and

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.590
Avatar. Next, what I want to do is I want to

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.110
run a quick little part experiment which is, what do you

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.430
think will happen if I remove the keyword self. From in

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.860
front of one of the instance variables. So let me just

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.320
go ahead and do that right now. There. Now I

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.920
want to think about this question. Here is the code for

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.660
the class Movie one more time, and this is the self

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.480
I'm wanting to remove from in front of storyline. And I

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.060
want you to think about this question especially in the context

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.110
of running this code, which is print(avatar.storyline). Once you have a

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.970
hypothesis, I want you to enter it in this box. After

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.950
you've submitted this response, I want you to make this change

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.490
on your own computer and see if your hypothesis matches your result.
