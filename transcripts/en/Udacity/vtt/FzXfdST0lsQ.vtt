Now that you've tried a number problem and a geometry problem, let's try a ratio

00:00:04.097 --> 00:00:08.170
and proportion problem. This time we have a recipe that calls for 8 ounces of

00:00:08.182 --> 00:00:11.955
chocolate chip cookies for each two dozen cookies. We want to know how many

00:00:11.967 --> 00:00:15.790
ounces of chips you would need to make 42 cookies. You can put your answer in

00:00:15.802 --> 00:00:16.225
this box.
