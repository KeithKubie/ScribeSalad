1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,030
There's some fucking,
you go into that deep country music.

2
00:00:03,031 --> 00:00:06,330
What were you just telling me about
country music that some giant country rap.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,220
What is the song? It's called Old
Town road. Old Town road. Old Town.

4
00:00:11,221 --> 00:00:13,440
Like one of the biggest
songs out of it's at the,

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,620
it's number one on the regular church
in the country. Took charge, right?

6
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:20,670
You put it together, little nausea x, is
that right? Everyone's a little licks.

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,200
Little Nas. What? A little nausea
but so he was on the country charge.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,660
They took him off because
like this isn't country man,

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,920
but then he linked up with Miley Cyrus's
dad. What's his name? Billy Ray. Cyrus.

10
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:33,480
Billy Ray Cyrus.
How dare you.

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,800
I think what also has to do with this
is he used at whether he did it or not,

12
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:39,600
I don't know,
but he used the video game,

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,070
red dead redemption and some of the
cool graphics and then made a rap song.

14
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,610
Country rap song. It's called called
country trap is what they're calling it.

15
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:50,400
That's why it's a different
thing, but it's got, it's got,

16
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,810
it's catchy and it's based around
this kind of stuff. It got it got hot,

17
00:00:54,811 --> 00:00:56,610
it caught, they're
caught. The wave country,

18
00:00:56,611 --> 00:00:59,760
like the djs on all the stations were
like just ripping it off of youtube and

19
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:03,000
playing it. That's why it made it on the
billboard. And then build board is like,

20
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,080
no, this isn't a country song. Take
it off. And then because that almost,

21
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:10,620
it's like Streisand effect.
It got bigger. So they um,

22
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,320
they who, who, who took it off
billboard did, why did they take it off?

23
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:17,131
Because it doesn't,

24
00:01:17,131 --> 00:01:21,270
and there third a description was that
it doesn't meet the qualifications to

25
00:01:21,271 --> 00:01:22,740
meet country with Billy Ray.

26
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:26,130
Cyrus jumped on board and then there's
video of him and Billy Ray Cyrus in the

27
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,510
studio. No, it's so interesting
when you're looking at the
footage of it. How cool.

28
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:34,380
That fucking game. This is just a game.
This is, that's a huge game, right? Yeah.

29
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:39,410
Red Redemption two but what a great idea
to wrap over real smart Dempson that's

30
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:43,230
a genius idea.
I think that game is played in here.

31
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:46,560
Jamie and I would play that game.
Yeah. You guys beat the Shit on me.

32
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:48,990
Whatever game we played last
than that was quick as, fuck.

33
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,650
You don't want to fuck with that game.
Do we just talk a little about us?

34
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,130
Tom Papa walked in, Jeff and
I were in battle into the
death. Tom Papa don't play.

35
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,820
You know, he was just watching us
going, what the fuck are you doing?

36
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,230
What are you doing? What are you
doing? Tom Pop is so funny, man.

37
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,350
He just wants everything to be old school.
He's still wants to go to the,

38
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,910
to the paper vendor and get a newspaper
and bake his own bread. I take that.

39
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,200
What does this Manson, what does
that, they've made a remix stuff,

40
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,290
but now with Billy Ray, it's just like
a real video. Now they've got money.

41
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:18,780
They know. Oh Wow. I'm not
feeling the real video too.

42
00:02:18,781 --> 00:02:22,630
I liked the way you just do dances
with a cowboy hat on. No, but he's low.

43
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,230
He's become a star because of this.
It's getting played. All the festivals,

44
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:27,660
all the last couple of weeks.
The crowds are loving it.

45
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,320
Why didn't he open up at Coachella? It
was already booked. It's more along.

46
00:02:31,321 --> 00:02:35,100
It's just happened so quick. You could
sneak them in. Billy Ray Cyrus slip bit,

47
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,830
your mind ready to get his whistle wet at
Coachella might've played it, I'm sure.

48
00:02:37,831 --> 00:02:41,430
But like I saw that little like the
Yodel kid was singing this song.

49
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:43,500
Like he's even taught
on all kinds of shit.

50
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,560
Do you know who Billy Ray Cyrus is
until you know his big hit? Oh yeah.

51
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:51,000
Don't keep breaking my heart. Keep her
in a weird, his daughter's way bigger.

52
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,130
Um, he was really huge for a
brief moment in time. But yeah,

53
00:02:56,131 --> 00:02:59,580
he was never like what
she is. She, she, she,

54
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,540
she can sound to fuck. And she was
on that crazy. Disney hit forever.

55
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:07,090
Hannah, my Hannah Montana
forever, which made no sense.

56
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,760
I put a wig on and nobody knows
this video together. This strange.

57
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,110
That's so ridiculous. Like
Batman, there is glorious locks.

58
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,200
God looks like Joe's brother.
Yeah.

59
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:20,950
So how from everybody was doing the
Achy breaky heart back then, 53 million.

60
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:25,150
I bet that must have fucking freaked
him out, man. Take his famous,

61
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:30,151
he was back then for that brief moment
in time to sweared are now almost could

62
00:03:30,361 --> 00:03:34,660
be famous like back then you could get
away with things and now it's a nightmare.
