through experimentation that's what we

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510
through experimentation that's what we
 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.430
through experimentation that's what we
do as human beings and we do that more

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440
do as human beings and we do that more
 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.900

is if I discover a scientific idea

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659

in that regard the arts are more

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040
in that regard the arts are more
 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.420
