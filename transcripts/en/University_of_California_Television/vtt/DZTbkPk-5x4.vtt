00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.360
- [Woman] This program is a presentation

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.583
of UCTV for educational
and noncommercial use only.

00:00:11.075 --> 00:00:13.825
(exciting music)

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.010
- Welcome to a Conversation with History.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.180
I'm Harry Kreisler in

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.270
the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.090
Our guest today is Robert Reich

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.610
who is the Chancellor's
Professor of Public Policy

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.890
at UC Berkeley.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.501
He has served in three
national administrations.

00:00:50.501 --> 00:00:52.980
Most recently as secretary of labor

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.260
under President Bill Clinton.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.050
He has written 13 books,

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.262
including the Work of Nations,
Locked in the Cabinet,

00:01:00.262 --> 00:01:05.262
Supercapitalism, and his most
recent book is Aftershock.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.121
Bob, welcome to our program.

00:01:08.121 --> 00:01:08.954
- Thank you, Harry.

00:01:08.954 --> 00:01:11.300
- [Harry] Where were you born and raised?

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.540
- I was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.650
I was raised in South Salem, New York.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.260
Little town about 60 miles
north of New York City.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.640
At that time, farm country.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.060
My friends were mostly farmers.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.170
My father had a little
woman's clothing shop.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.910
- And, looking back, how
do you think your parents

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.826
shaped your thinking about the world?

00:01:30.826 --> 00:01:33.190
- Well, my father, for most of that time,

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.810
was a Republican.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.370
Rockefeller Republican.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:37.950
A liberal Republican.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.020
An oxymoron today.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.346
There aren't any liberal Republicans left.

00:01:41.346 --> 00:01:44.320
He was very concerned
about the budget deficit.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.480
I remember the first thing he told me

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.310
when I must have been
about four years old.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.910
He said, "Bobby, you and your children

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.660
and your grandchildren
will be repaying the debt

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.280
that Franklin D. Roosevelt created."

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.780
And I had no idea what a debt was,

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.080
but I was scared to death.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.970
But my boys have never
mentioned FDR's debt.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.150
And I have a new granddaughter

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.930
who has not yet talked about it.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.280
So, I don't think that my father was right

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.113
in that instance.

00:02:14.113 --> 00:02:16.385
Although he was right about most things.

00:02:16.385 --> 00:02:21.385
And my mother didn't have
strong political beliefs

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.040
one way or another.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.750
But she had a very strong
kind of moral compass

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.420
in terms of what was right and wrong

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.500
and kind of social responsibility.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.730
- And was there discussion of politics

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.030
around the dinner table?

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.863
- Not much.

00:02:35.863 --> 00:02:38.630
The big issue we talked
about around the dinner table

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.630
was the sales of blouses
and slacks and brassieres.

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.790
- But I believe I read somewhere that

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.550
your grandmother was a real organizer

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.310
in the small community that she lived.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.280
- Oh, she was.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.618
My mother's mother was
a tremendous organizer.

00:02:58.618 --> 00:03:00.390
Community organizer.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.820
I don't think she would style herself

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.810
as a community organizer.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.133
But, wherever she went,

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:08.285
if something didn't seem right to her

00:03:08.285 --> 00:03:10.380
or the community needed to do something,

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.841
she'd just get everybody involved.

00:03:12.841 --> 00:03:15.691
- Where were you educated?

00:03:15.691 --> 00:03:18.620
- Public high school in South Salem.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.770
Actually Cross River, New York.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:22.740
John Jay High School.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.500
Louisborough Elementary
School before that.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.440
Wonderful little public elementary school.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.560
Miss Bouton's Nursery School before that.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.856
Not a good experience.

00:03:33.856 --> 00:03:35.190
(laughter)

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.018
And then, after high school,
I went to Dartmouth College.

00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:41.630
After that, I was fortunate enough

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.196
to get a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford.

00:03:44.196 --> 00:03:47.280
And then I went to law school at Yale.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.893
- And when were you bitten
by the economics bug?

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.840
- I was always fascinated by economics.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.800
Not so much as economics, per se.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.743
But as sort of one key into understanding,

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.168
you might say, the
macroorganization of society.

00:04:07.168 --> 00:04:12.168
Law and political science,
politics, economics.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.560
It all was very interesting to me,

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.830
because I really wanted to
understand the substructure.

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:23.830
I mean, what was the system
that held us together

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.490
or didn't held us together?

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.690
And that was from a very early age.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.060
I had some very brilliant
teachers, in retrospect,

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.167
who got me interested in all this.

00:04:35.167 --> 00:04:40.167
And then, the summer
before I went to college,

00:04:41.561 --> 00:04:45.675
one friend, a mentor a few years older,

00:04:45.675 --> 00:04:49.330
who had been very involved in civil rights

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.365
went to Mississippi and he was murdered

00:04:51.365 --> 00:04:54.800
trying to register Black voters.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.687
- This was Schwerner?

00:04:57.687 --> 00:04:59.300
- Mickey Schwerner.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.370
And I think kind of shocked
me into the realization that

00:05:04.553 --> 00:05:06.900
these issues that I had been playing with

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.196
were not really playthings.

00:05:09.196 --> 00:05:13.186
They were very large questions.

00:05:13.186 --> 00:05:15.260
Life and death struggles going on

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.650
in terms of civil rights.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.061
And then, after that,
Vietnam and so forth.

00:05:22.061 --> 00:05:24.969
Remember, this is an era
of Martin Luther King.

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:27.440
John F. Kennedy had been president.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.403
Bobby Kennedy.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:31.050
I was not alone.

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.116
I think most people who were my age

00:05:34.116 --> 00:05:37.930
were bitten by this bug.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.700
That society had wrongs.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.503
And it was our obligation
to try to right them.

00:05:44.446 --> 00:05:46.360
- Just a side point here,

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.350
'cause one of the things that
emerges in your many works

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.460
is your skills as a writer.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.460
Where did you hone that craft as a writer?

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.290
Did this...

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.240
Where did you learn to write so well?

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.900
Is it just a natural gift?

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.500
- Well, you're very kind to say,

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.379
ask that question or to
make that implication.

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:17.379
I always wrote, even,
I remember, as a child.

00:06:19.093 --> 00:06:21.250
Six, seven, eight years old.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.300
I was always writing.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.450
I can't say...

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.710
I can't point to a particular influence.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.050
I can't say that there was anything that

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.920
I felt was particularly unusual about it.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.373
I just always enjoyed writing.

00:06:37.373 --> 00:06:38.310
I don't think there was a time

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.410
when I didn't feel like I had to write.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.670
- What about your sense of humor?

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.663
That's the other thing
that really stands out.

00:06:48.627 --> 00:06:53.627
Did you always have that or
can you pinpoint a source?

00:06:59.306 --> 00:07:04.306
- Let's see, my father, who,
by the way, just turned 97.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.070
And he still is very funny.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.903
He's very...

00:07:08.903 --> 00:07:10.741
In fact, he's getting funnier.

00:07:10.741 --> 00:07:12.730
Intentionally, not unintentionally.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:13.960
I mean, there's some 97 year olds

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.040
who are unintentionally funny.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.210
But he is really very funny.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:21.190
He's very sarcastic, but
with a real glint in his eye.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:25.030
So, I credit him with a lot of that.

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:28.723
And his father was, also, very funny.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.840
It wasn't jokes.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:36.313
But there was a kind of sardonic humor.

00:07:37.655 --> 00:07:38.997
Not slapstick.

00:07:38.997 --> 00:07:42.250
But exaggeration sometimes.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:47.250
And, again, a kind of
friendly, good natured sarcasm

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:48.980
that I grew up with.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.340
- Now, when did you meet the Clintons?

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:55.000
Bill you met when you
were a Rhodes Scholar?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.533
- Yes, in those days,
we took a boat together.

00:07:59.533 --> 00:08:01.980
A ship across the Atlantic.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.265
It disembarked from New York.

00:08:04.265 --> 00:08:06.830
I mean, embarked from New York.

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:10.370
Went to London ultimately.

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:13.860
And it was a miserable
journey that October.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:17.270
I don't recommend anybody
cross the Atlantic,

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:19.253
if they can avoid it, by ship.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:22.530
I don't know why we all did it.

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:23.420
That was the tradition.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.730
I guess that's how you met
the other Rhodes Scholars.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:28.580
And Bill Clinton...

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:32.760
I got terribly seasick,
as I think most of us did.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.660
And there was a knock on my door.

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:37.980
And he appeared there with
chicken soup in one hand

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.260
and some crackers in the other.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:44.040
And he said, "I hear you
weren't feeling too well."

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:46.580
I didn't know him at all.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.650
I met him very briefly in New York.

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:51.700
And we started a friendship.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:55.790
He did not say, at that
time, "I feel your pain."

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:58.140
That came later for him.

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:02.681
But we enjoyed talking.

00:09:02.681 --> 00:09:05.210
Talking with Bill Clinton in those days

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.455
was very much like
talking with Bill Clinton

00:09:07.455 --> 00:09:09.200
later in my life.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.870
It wasn't really talking with.

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:12.143
It was listening to.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.563
He was a great recounter,
great storyteller.

00:09:16.521 --> 00:09:19.390
He basically wanted...

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:21.130
He loved audiences.

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:25.550
And I was delighted to
give him an audience.

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:27.020
I was amazed at that time.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.060
I mean, on that trip, he told me that

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:32.050
he planned to become governor of Arkansas.

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:34.460
Now, for a 22 year old...

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.724
I mean, I didn't know what
I was doing next week.

00:09:36.724 --> 00:09:41.724
And the idea that he had already plotted

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:45.070
at least the beginning
of a political career

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.290
struck me as absolutely amazing.

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:51.470
- And then you met Hillary
at the Yale Law School

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:53.340
where both you and Bill attended?

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:54.870
- Actually, I'd known Hillary before.

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:58.380
I met her when she was an
undergraduate at Wellesley.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.770
And I was an undergraduate at Dartmouth

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:02.433
I think a year ahead of her.

00:10:02.433 --> 00:10:04.570
I had forgotten this.

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:06.530
During the presidential campaign,

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:08.690
when she ran in the Democratic primary,

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:10.710
some reporter from the
New York Times called me

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:14.886
and said he had found some
of her undergraduate letters

00:10:14.886 --> 00:10:17.860
alluding to the fact she
had come up to Dartmouth

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:19.063
as my date.

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.634
I completely forgot.

00:10:22.634 --> 00:10:25.870
It was not, obviously, terribly memorable.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:26.877
But the reporter asked me,

00:10:26.877 --> 00:10:29.240
"Is there anything you can
remember about that occasion?"

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.770
And I just...

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:34.410
First of all, I was
stunned that it happened.

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:36.190
And I thought back.

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:39.563
It gradually dawned on me
that we did go to a movie.

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:42.760
She was president of her freshmen class.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.660
I was president of my sophomore class.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.770
I think I had ensnared her to come up

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:49.643
by talking about it as
a presidential summit.

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:52.770
I was very clever in those days.

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.870
And the only thing I
could say to the reporter

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:58.157
was she wanted an inordinate amount

00:10:58.157 --> 00:11:00.113
of butter on her popcorn.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:03.950
Which I thought I did it tongue in cheek.

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:06.220
And then there was a long pause.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.670
And I thought "Hello,
are you still there?"

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:11.390
He said, "I'm just writing this down."

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:14.040
And it appeared in the New York Times.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.330
- And, looking back...

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.280
- The quality of the
American political reporting.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.830
- How do you compare Bill and Hillary

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:25.943
as policy wonks and as politicians?

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.727
- Well, that's a very
complicated question, Harry.

00:11:30.727 --> 00:11:35.727
Bill is just a huge extrovert.

00:11:37.969 --> 00:11:42.969
I mean, you have to be a wild
extrovert to enjoy politics.

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:46.560
And, by that, I mean
every human interaction

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:50.400
has to give you more energy
than you put into it.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.340
So that, by the end of a day,

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:55.407
after you've talked or shaken hands with

00:11:55.407 --> 00:11:57.520
thousands of people,

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.270
you actually end up with more
energy than at the start.

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:02.140
I could never do that.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.040
I once ran for office.

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.360
And I would be exhausted
by the end of the day.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.780
So, he's, really, he's an extrovert.

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.410
He loves to, as I said
before, tell stories.

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:13.300
He loves to interact.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:16.484
He has a voracious appetite and energy.

00:12:16.484 --> 00:12:19.370
A little bit undisciplined.

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:20.890
That's not a new insight.

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:24.170
Many of his biographers have found that.

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:25.660
Hillary is much more disciplined.

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:29.250
She's a linear thinker.

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:33.683
He's kind of surveys the terrain.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:38.769
She is careful about her time.

00:12:38.769 --> 00:12:41.963
She listens much more carefully.

00:12:42.962 --> 00:12:47.962
I would say, overall, she is
not only more disciplined,

00:12:48.606 --> 00:12:52.090
but, I dare say, although
she's an extrovert,

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:54.390
she's not nearly as much of one.

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:57.160
- Were these differences
apparent when they were

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.700
both students with you
at the Yale Law School?

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:02.540
Or do these insights come later?

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.060
- Well, I wouldn't have been able to talk

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:09.490
with as much certainty about them.

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:12.080
You know, at the age of 22, 23,

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.250
all of these things are embryonic.

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:19.250
Their tendencies, I think
I would have said then that

00:13:20.595 --> 00:13:25.200
she, in terms of sheer
intellectual firepower,

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:30.200
she was probably ahead of Bill Clinton.

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:35.370
- When you teach in the
School of Public Policy here,

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:37.430
what do you teach your students

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:42.430
is the difference between
policy and politics?

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:47.220
- I try to integrate the two.

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:52.220
That is, I've been a policy
official, let's put it that way,

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:57.573
in Washington three times.

00:13:57.573 --> 00:14:00.420
Actually four times.

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:05.420
Once under Robert Bork in
the Ford administration.

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.060
I argued Supreme Court cases

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:11.900
and I reviewed Supreme Court briefs.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.730
And then, in the Carter administration,

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:16.100
I was director of policy planning

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.947
for the Federal Trade Commission.

00:14:17.947 --> 00:14:22.947
And then I came in as Bill
Clinton's secretary of labor.

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:28.923
And I've had advisory roles since then.

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:32.770
And what I've learned about policy making

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:35.463
is you cannot separate it from politics.

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:43.090
There's a kind of hubris
that some policy makers have

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:46.400
that, somehow, it's all about
finding the best policy.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:50.847
And then doing end runs
around democracy and politics

00:14:50.847 --> 00:14:53.905
to get it done.

00:14:53.905 --> 00:14:57.330
I think that's hubris,
because I think democracy

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:00.850
really does have a lot to
tell us as policy makers.

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:03.130
Politics has a lot to tell us about

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:04.635
what is the nature of the good.

00:15:04.635 --> 00:15:06.833
It's not just analysis.

00:15:07.855 --> 00:15:10.850
- Let me show your book,

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:13.380
'cause I went back for
this interview and read,

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:16.500
and I recommend very highly,
Locked in the Cabinet.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:20.670
The story of your tenure in
the Clinton administration.

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:22.670
And I guess what I want to ask you is

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:27.170
what did you learn about
the interface between

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:31.430
theory and practice as you took the role

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.720
of secretary of the labor?

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:37.360
Were you surprised as
you learned these things

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.767
about this idealism, this theory

00:15:40.767 --> 00:15:43.113
when the tire hits the road?

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:46.410
- Well, I didn't learn that.

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:49.310
I didn't learn that
idealism is sort of foolish

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:50.990
or has to take a backseat.

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:52.744
I thought quite the contrary.

00:15:52.744 --> 00:15:54.680
It was very important to
hold onto your ideals.

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:58.450
Because there are such powerful headwinds

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:03.450
constantly forcing you into
some sort of compromise that,

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:06.588
unless you remember your ideals

00:16:06.588 --> 00:16:11.588
and go back to them like
you go back to a well,

00:16:11.729 --> 00:16:15.510
you can easily be completely sidetracked.

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:16.590
You can be worse than sidetracked.

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:18.140
You can be just off in a ditch.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.980
So, idealism is very important.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:25.980
I had been teaching kind of public policy

00:16:26.493 --> 00:16:29.750
at the Kennedy School
at Harvard for 12 years

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:32.510
before I took the labor secretary job.

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:37.123
So, I had a wealth of theory and,

00:16:39.212 --> 00:16:41.900
let's put it this way, what one teaches

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.350
in public policy schools behind me.

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:47.933
The biggest surprise, I think, Harry,

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:53.780
was how exhausting those jobs are.

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:57.140
Nobody, I mean, I never taught about

00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.543
how to maintain your energy.

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:06.410
Not just idealism, but
just stay fully functioning

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:12.470
and not be torn apart
by all of these forces.

00:17:16.902 --> 00:17:21.902
And not come home late at
night and just be overwhelmed.

00:17:22.151 --> 00:17:26.380
Resilience, physical
and mental resilience,

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:29.600
is tremendously important if
you wanna make a difference.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.594
Now, believe me, there
are people in Washington,

00:17:32.594 --> 00:17:37.540
I'm sad to say, who like the job title

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:41.188
or like having the power
who don't take the jobs,

00:17:41.188 --> 00:17:45.630
perhaps, as seriously as they should.

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:48.250
Washington is a funny town, Harry.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:51.290
It's a town where people don't take issues

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:52.730
as seriously as they should.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:55.440
In many instances, take
themselves too seriously.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.080
I tried desperately to do the opposite.

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.420
I tried not to take myself too seriously,

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.900
but to take the issues really seriously.

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.800
- You write, in Locked in the Cabinet...

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:05.840
Let me read you.

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.820
Politicians cannot be pure by definition.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:10.590
Their motives are always mixed.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.910
Ambition, power, public adulation

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:14.720
always figure in somehow.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.520
Means get confused within.

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.500
And now you're talking about Bill Clinton.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.750
Will Bill stick to his ideals in the pinch

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:24.130
or will I find myself compromised

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:28.193
simply by virtue of being
connected to his compromises?

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.980
Sort of an insightful view of politics

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:33.410
and where things might go.

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:37.480
Do you still stick with that description?

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.093
- Well, yes, in the sense that

00:18:39.093 --> 00:18:44.093
there is a continuous tug
between means and ends

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:48.363
to the point where some
people in political life

00:18:48.363 --> 00:18:50.490
simply lose track.

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:51.870
It all becomes means.

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:54.314
They forget what the ends are.

00:18:54.314 --> 00:18:56.270
This is what I was
referring to a moment ago

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:59.740
when I said just reminding
yourself of your ideals,

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:02.070
reminding yourself why you're there.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.000
Because, unless you have the capacity

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.250
to continuously refresh
that deep understanding,

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:11.150
then you can become trapped in the means.

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:16.150
Then you can become trapped
in subtle ulterior motives

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.203
that gradually take over your brain.

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:24.307
- When I read your account of those years

00:19:24.307 --> 00:19:28.473
and the influence of Reuben and Greenspan,

00:19:28.473 --> 00:19:33.473
I had the following thought which was

00:19:36.365 --> 00:19:39.970
whenever a liberal is elected president

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:42.550
or somebody that the progressives

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:44.382
might put a great deal aside,

00:19:44.382 --> 00:19:47.960
your book should be required reading

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:52.690
to lower the expectations of the change

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:54.580
that you hope they're going
to be able to bring about.

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.675
So, I guess my question is this.

00:19:56.675 --> 00:19:58.803
Because you had experienced this,

00:19:58.803 --> 00:20:03.580
were you less surprised by
some of the disappointments

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.860
that progressives felt
about President Obama

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.030
when he dealt with the crisis?

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:09.930
- Well, I think that,

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:12.360
regardless of where you are
on the political spectrum...

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:16.304
I think there are many conservatives

00:20:16.304 --> 00:20:21.304
who are continuously disappointed
by Republican presidents.

00:20:21.415 --> 00:20:23.540
The fact of the matter is that

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:27.643
presidents have a very
difficult time leading.

00:20:27.643 --> 00:20:30.900
As that old metaphor goes,

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.570
it's like drinking out of a fire hose.

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:37.348
You're lucky if you can even take a gulp.

00:20:37.348 --> 00:20:40.323
Let alone find your balance.

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:45.860
Nothing good happens in
Washington, in my experience.

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.920
Unless people outside Washington

00:20:49.716 --> 00:20:51.120
are mobilized and energized and activated

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.750
and pushing on elected leaders.

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:57.250
Even a president with the best of motives,

00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:00.260
if there is not that pressure,

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:03.606
if all the pressure is coming
from, say, corporations

00:21:03.606 --> 00:21:06.412
or very wealthy people who are supporting

00:21:06.412 --> 00:21:08.140
through campaign donations,

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:11.350
then that president is
not going to be able to

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:16.350
overcome that powerful trajectory.

00:21:17.274 --> 00:21:20.420
There is nothing more important

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:22.970
than organizing, mobilizing, activating,

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:25.970
energizing people who share your views

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:30.970
if you want the people in
Washington to act on those views.

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:34.923
- Now, as secretary of labor,

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:41.140
how did you try to mobilize constituencies

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:43.980
for the programs that you sought?

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.810
Was it only the labor
unions you could turn to

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:49.910
to get the kind of policies that

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:53.270
you were advocating in the administration?

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:55.730
For example, training of workers

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:58.100
for new kinds of jobs and so on.

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:00.880
- Well, it was difficult to
mobilize from Washington.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:01.713
That's my point.

00:22:01.713 --> 00:22:05.973
I used every possible
handle lever I could.

00:22:06.905 --> 00:22:10.050
You know, I traipsed around
the capitol every day

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:11.740
talking to members of Congress.

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:14.920
I met with every interest
group you can imagine.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:17.440
I went out into the
country, talked to people.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:21.692
I tried to use the media a lot.

00:22:21.692 --> 00:22:22.525
Talk shows.

00:22:22.525 --> 00:22:23.970
In terms of just making the arguments.

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:28.970
But I, personally, as a cabinet official,

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:31.730
could not go out and organize people.

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:34.440
I mean, they had to take
that responsibility.

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.820
So, for example, the day that

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:39.570
Bill Clinton signed his welfare bill,

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:42.360
which I thought was, at the time...

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.750
And I still worry about it.

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:44.583
I thought it was wrong.

00:22:44.583 --> 00:22:47.810
I think that it still subjects

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:51.480
too many people to the
vagaries of the economy.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:54.920
And we need some fundamental safety net

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.210
that is not there now.

00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:57.813
The day he signed that,

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:03.140
I expected, as I walked
out of the White House,

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:06.150
to see some people on the streets.

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:10.815
Everybody knew he was going
to make a decision that day.

00:23:10.815 --> 00:23:11.648
And I don't mean signing it.

00:23:11.648 --> 00:23:12.870
I mean the day he made the decision.

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:14.180
He signed it subsequently.

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:15.013
Everybody knew.

00:23:15.013 --> 00:23:16.750
The papers were filled with the fact that

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:18.880
this was the day he was
making this decision.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.960
He was meeting with his cabinet.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.180
We all were going to have our say.

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:27.100
But, on the streets of
Washington, there was nobody.

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:29.910
I walked up Pennsylvania Avenue, Harry,

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:31.900
and I will never forget the silence.

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:33.760
Deafening silence.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:34.593
And I thought to myself,

00:23:34.593 --> 00:23:39.593
"Well, it's foreordained, you know."

00:23:39.671 --> 00:23:43.610
The advocates for the poor and the poor...

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:45.440
There is no national
association of poor people

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.550
in this country.

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:51.160
How are we ever going
to do the right thing

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.109
by the nation's poor?

00:23:53.109 --> 00:23:56.086
- As I read Locked in the Cabinet,

00:23:56.086 --> 00:23:59.387
the thought that came to my mind that was

00:23:59.387 --> 00:24:04.220
were you the George
Ball of domestic policy?

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:06.570
And I should remind our younger audience

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:10.253
that George Ball opposed the Vietnam War.

00:24:11.351 --> 00:24:14.230
And he was sort of
integrated into the process

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:15.630
in such a way that,

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:17.570
when they would go around the table

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:21.560
in the Johnson administration
to talk about the war,

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.690
he would get a time to be listened to,

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:25.660
but nobody was really listening.

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:26.900
Was that your dilemma?

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:28.730
What was the frustration like?

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:30.700
- Well, one has to be very careful

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:33.750
not to fall into the George Ball trap.

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:36.380
Because, if you are predictable in

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:38.180
what you are going to say,

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:39.853
you can easily be marginalized.

00:24:40.939 --> 00:24:42.330
People will stop listening.

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:45.510
You have to be true to your own values,

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:50.090
but take every opportunity
to be unpredictable.

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:51.490
That is, to come out...

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:53.310
Again, true to your own values.

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:55.250
With something that
people find interesting

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:59.993
or a little bit different
than they would have expected.

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:05.253
Otherwise, nobody's gonna listen.

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:08.300
And there was that potential problem.

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:11.233
I mean, I found myself,

00:25:11.233 --> 00:25:14.407
certainly after several
years in that office,

00:25:14.407 --> 00:25:19.407
as a fairly lonely voice.

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.860
I tried to make alliances
with others in the cabinet

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:29.860
and other in government who
shared my views, my values,

00:25:30.931 --> 00:25:33.020
which I thought at the
time, and I still believe,

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:34.640
were basically correct.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:38.820
We have to build the wages and incomes

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:40.606
of working people in this country.

00:25:40.606 --> 00:25:44.600
They have been stagnating for 30 years.

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:45.750
The rich are getting richer.

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:47.270
I'm talking about people at the very top.

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:49.550
I'm not blaming them.

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:52.650
But we are becoming a less
and less equal society.

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:55.331
And I saw it beginning to happen.

00:25:55.331 --> 00:26:00.331
And I wanted to do everything I could

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:05.980
to enlist others in the mission
of reversing that trend.

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:09.040
And it was very frustrating

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.433
not to have many allies.

00:26:15.648 --> 00:26:19.763
- It's interesting, as I
re-read Locked in the Cabinet,

00:26:19.763 --> 00:26:23.220
it was quite amazing
how many of the issues

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:24.930
that have come up now

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:29.930
in trying to understand the
Great Recession, as you call it,

00:26:31.947 --> 00:26:32.920
the issues were there back then.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:35.050
I mean, the economy hadn't collapsed.

00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:39.930
But the problems of the
structural inequality and so on.

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:44.930
Let's talk now about your
argument in Aftershock.

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:50.060
And then I guess I just
read your paperback edition

00:26:50.897 --> 00:26:52.660
of Supercapitalism is coming out,

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:53.785
so I'll show that.

00:26:53.785 --> 00:26:55.170
- [Bob] Oh, you show everything.

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:57.175
- Yeah, yeah, that's right.

00:26:57.175 --> 00:26:59.005
- Actually, the paperback
of Aftershock is coming out

00:26:59.005 --> 00:27:01.620
very, very shortly.

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:03.693
Supercapitalism has been out already.

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:09.890
But, sometimes, writing
a book has its own,

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.180
for me, pleasure.

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:16.213
Marketing a book is not
particularly pleasurable.

00:27:18.489 --> 00:27:19.322
I really feel like...

00:27:19.322 --> 00:27:21.320
- Chalmers Johnson, the
late Chalmers Johnson

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:22.650
tole me to show the books.

00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:25.240
So, we're doing that.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:30.237
So, you're really making an argument about

00:27:30.237 --> 00:27:32.960
structural changes in the economy.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:37.300
You're trying to tell us that

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:41.580
what happened was not the
result of a business cycle,

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:44.545
but rather sort of basic changes.

00:27:44.545 --> 00:27:46.190
Help us understand it.

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:50.010
Because we had a great
prosperity and we lost it.

00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:51.500
Why?

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:55.270
- The Great Prosperity,
as I define the period

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:57.000
after the Second World War that

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.968
went on for about 30
years, was not perfect.

00:28:00.968 --> 00:28:04.300
There was a struggle to
bring women into the economy,

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:06.850
to bring Blacks and
minorities into the economy.

00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:07.910
But at least we were struggling.

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:10.820
At least we were making every effort.

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:12.853
And it was a period of time in which

00:28:12.853 --> 00:28:17.560
people in the bottom 20%,
bottom 40% of the income ladder

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:20.823
actually saw their incomes double.

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:24.200
Sometimes better than that.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.064
There was a great deal of upward mobility.

00:28:26.064 --> 00:28:31.010
We, as a country, invested
in education like mad.

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:32.910
We invested in infrastructure.

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:35.120
The National Defense Highway Act.

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:40.120
We dedicated ourselves to the
ideal of equal opportunity.

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:44.580
And we actually began
moving in that direction.

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:48.100
We had a marginal income tax
on the top income earners

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.060
during the Eisenhower administration.

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:52.070
91%.

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:53.930
Nobody would have
accused Dwight Eisenhower

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:55.660
of being a socialist.

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:56.603
I assure you.

00:28:57.526 --> 00:29:02.526
But then we reversed course.

00:29:02.821 --> 00:29:05.820
We reversed course for
a number of reasons.

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:09.360
And it happened in the
late '70s and early '80s.

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:13.338
Partly it was because globalization,

00:29:13.338 --> 00:29:17.100
technological change began to take away

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:19.570
a lot of the good jobs.

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:22.200
It began to undermine unions.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.680
These forces...

00:29:25.759 --> 00:29:28.660
I'm not in favor of protectionism.

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:30.889
I'm not in favor of being a neo-Luddite

00:29:30.889 --> 00:29:32.760
and smashing all the machinery.

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.900
But we, as a nation, did not
adapt to these new forces.

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:39.085
We didn't adapt our workforces
to these new forces.

00:29:39.085 --> 00:29:43.473
We didn't Adapt our tax systems.

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:45.970
We didn't provide wage subsidies.

00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:48.500
We didn't provide different
kinds of safety nets.

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.690
We basically allowed all this to happen

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:52.990
and we turned our back on all of it.

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:54.330
We unleashed Wall Street.

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:55.320
We privatized.

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.650
We deregulated.

00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:59.310
We actually made the situation

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:01.631
more perilous for American workers

00:30:01.631 --> 00:30:04.940
beginning in the late
'70s and early 1980s.

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:08.390
We lowered marginal income
taxes on the very rich.

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:10.500
We found ourselves, not surprisingly,

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.500
with structural budget deficits.

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:14.900
We pulled in our horns
with regard to programs

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:17.453
that were so important to
average working people.

00:30:18.424 --> 00:30:21.580
And we made a bad situation far worse.

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:24.530
When the sad irony is that,

00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:27.040
if we had understood what was happening

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:28.890
and if we had the right leadership,

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:31.490
we could have, it seems to me,

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:34.840
enabled the vast majority of Americans

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:37.583
to prosper in this new world.

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:42.150
- The argument, as I understand
it, in Supercapitalism

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:47.010
is that, during this
period from the '70s on,

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:52.010
what you had was we put a lot in making

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:55.659
the investor and the consumer better off.

00:30:55.659 --> 00:30:58.300
So, there were a lot of aspects to

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:01.440
the technological and economic changes

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:05.240
that you see as positive and as benefiting

00:31:07.074 --> 00:31:08.541
the consumer and the investor.

00:31:08.541 --> 00:31:10.200
But the citizen was left behind,

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:15.200
because what you call supercapitalism
overwhelmed democracy.

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:20.580
- The citizen and the worker
were both left behind.

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:22.290
We are both workers and citizens.

00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:25.510
So, as consumers and to the
extent there were investors,

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:27.370
we did wonderfully well.

00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:28.858
We had the world.

00:31:28.858 --> 00:31:31.240
We had new technologies.

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:33.666
But, as citizens and as working people,

00:31:33.666 --> 00:31:37.950
we were overwhelmed.

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:40.345
Many of us lost ground.

00:31:40.345 --> 00:31:43.237
Most of us stagnated in terms of

00:31:43.237 --> 00:31:45.635
if you adjust for inflation.

00:31:45.635 --> 00:31:50.450
And politics became overwhelmed, in turn,

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:54.873
by money from the very wealthy
and from big corporations.

00:31:54.873 --> 00:31:59.873
So that the power structure of our society

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:06.280
was no longer capable of responding to

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:10.693
the needs of us as
citizens and as workers.

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:17.810
And not only did that cause problems

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:19.800
in terms of stagnating
wages and everything else,

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:23.703
but what I began to realize is that

00:32:23.703 --> 00:32:25.930
it was a dead end strategy.

00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:27.240
It was a dangerous strategy.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.013
The only way most people

00:32:29.013 --> 00:32:31.690
could maintain their living standards

00:32:32.968 --> 00:32:36.280
was by, first, having wives and mothers

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:37.800
go into the paid workforce.

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:39.970
And then everybody working longer hours.

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:41.300
And then, finally,

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:43.580
going deeper and deeper
and deeper into debt.

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:45.430
Which seemed painless as long as

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:46.940
housing values were going up.

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:48.390
You could have home equity loans.

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:50.360
You could refinance your home.

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:53.543
But, inevitably, that
debt bubble would burst.

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:59.700
And that is what happened to
bring on the Great Recession.

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:03.693
The Wall Street's excesses, Harry,

00:33:03.693 --> 00:33:05.550
were the proximate cause.

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:07.900
But the underlying cause was that

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:12.900
we just couldn't keep up
this charade any longer

00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:16.650
of the vast middle class and working class

00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:19.663
having enough money to maintain
their living standards.

00:33:20.684 --> 00:33:22.600
And, when that debt
bubble really did burst,

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:23.780
people could no longer spend.

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:25.393
If they could no longer spend,

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:30.523
the wheels of commerce basically
come grinding to a halt.

00:33:32.147 --> 00:33:33.580
Unemployment goes skyrocketing.

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:36.595
You have to rely more and
more on foreign markets.

00:33:36.595 --> 00:33:38.780
And that's where we are today.

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:41.240
We're not really coming out
of this Great Recession.

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:43.370
This is the most anemic recovery

00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:44.670
from the deepest recession

00:33:45.688 --> 00:33:47.538
we've had since the Great Depression.

00:33:48.773 --> 00:33:51.460
- And the key to understanding the change

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:55.470
is the enormous inequality in income

00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:58.710
which developed over this period?

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:01.970
- Yes, in the 1970s, by the late 1970s,

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:06.970
the top 1% by income was getting
about 9% of total income.

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:14.830
But then income began concentrating
more and more and more.

00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:16.360
Partly because globalization.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:17.470
Partly because technology.

00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:19.824
Partly, therefore,
because all the advantages

00:34:19.824 --> 00:34:22.630
adhered to people with the right education

00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:24.080
and right connections.

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:25.430
But it was more than that.

00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:29.040
It was also a lot of money flowing

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.883
to Wall Street and to CEOs.

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:37.080
So that, by 2007, almost a quarter

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:38.780
of all the nation's income...

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:41.750
Remember it had been 9% in the late '70s.

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:46.750
By 2007, 23.5% of the nation's
income went to the top 1%.

00:34:49.371 --> 00:34:51.240
During this 30 year period,

00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:54.710
they doubled their share
of the nation's income.

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:57.500
If you look at the top 1/10 of 1%,

00:34:58.420 --> 00:34:59.963
they tripled their share.

00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:03.760
Everybody else basically stagnated.

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.790
Adjusted for inflation.

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:08.710
The only way others could
maintain their standard of living,

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:09.700
as I said, was by going

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:11.470
deeper and deeper and deeper into debt,

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:13.270
which is not a sustainable strategy.

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:18.720
But, you see, you can't
keep an economy going

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:22.160
on the basis of the spending
of people at the top.

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:23.694
They just don't...

00:35:23.694 --> 00:35:25.730
For one, they don't spend enough.

00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:27.450
I mean, being rich means you already have

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:29.220
most of what you want.

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:33.090
- In the book, you make
the point, in Aftershock,

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:36.130
that we need to relearn the lessons

00:35:37.095 --> 00:35:39.170
that we learned in the aftermath
of the Great Depression.

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:43.350
And you focus on the head
of the Federal Reserve

00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:48.050
appointed by Roosevelt
who basically saw that

00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:53.050
you need to have demand
to match mass production.

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:54.880
- Marriner Eccles.

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.822
His name is on the Federal
Reserve building in Washington.

00:35:56.822 --> 00:35:58.730
It is the Eccles Building.

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:03.730
He was the Federal Reserve
chair from 1934 to 1948.

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:08.530
And he understood the economy.

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:13.490
Earlier and better than
Roosevelt or John Maynard Keynes

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:14.700
or any of the advisors.

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:15.920
Rexford Tugwell.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:19.810
I mean, he was saying,
Marriner Eccles in 1933,

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:22.520
January of '33, before
Roosevelt even got there...

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:27.520
He was saying, "Look, we've
got to restructure the economy

00:36:27.762 --> 00:36:29.598
so that average working people

00:36:29.598 --> 00:36:32.510
get a larger share of the benefits

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:34.790
of the growth of the economy."

00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:38.340
Roosevelt put many of
those ideas into effect.

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:40.521
You had the National Labor Relations Act.

00:36:40.521 --> 00:36:43.690
Really empowering labor unions.

00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:46.480
Requiring employers to
bargain in good faith.

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:49.090
You had a minimum wage,
a 40 hour work week.

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:50.520
With time and a half for overtime.

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:53.340
Social security, unemployment insurance.

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:56.210
All the things we take for granted today.

00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:58.540
The foundation's laid in that period.

00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:02.320
And then, on top of that,
major public investments,

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:05.820
particularly in the 1950s and 1960s

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:07.618
in infrastructure and education.

00:37:07.618 --> 00:37:10.505
You had a high income
tax on people at the top

00:37:10.505 --> 00:37:12.480
to finance a lot of this.

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:14.940
You had huge economic growth.

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:18.640
But, again, it was economic
growth widely shared.

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:19.760
Widely shared.

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.260
Which sustained itself and meant that

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:23.312
most people could, again,
turn around and buy.

00:37:23.312 --> 00:37:24.670
But it was not just

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:27.190
consumption and consumption
and consumption.

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:29.360
It was also public goods.

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:30.777
Public goods.

00:37:30.777 --> 00:37:34.420
Again, parks and playgrounds
and public highways

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:37.550
and public transportation
and public schools

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:40.330
and great universities that
were public universities.

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:43.462
Like the one we are
privileged to be a part of.

00:37:43.462 --> 00:37:48.462
And that's how we created a period

00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:52.620
of unbridled prosperity.

00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:57.100
- Your three books really
can help us walk through

00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:00.200
this period of drastic changes

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:02.890
where we went from the Great Prosperity

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:04.580
to the present dilemma.

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:06.153
And I wanna ask you.

00:38:06.153 --> 00:38:11.153
What makes the difference in
whether things can change?

00:38:11.161 --> 00:38:13.630
First thing that comes to mind.

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:17.073
Is it the personnel that
the presidents appoint

00:38:17.073 --> 00:38:20.630
that are so influential?

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:24.158
Is it the ideas that
have developed so that...

00:38:24.158 --> 00:38:26.460
We have to worry about deficits.

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:31.380
We have to worry about things that

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:35.060
keep us from focusing on the issues

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:36.650
that you're trying to raise.

00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:38.460
- Well, for one thing,
it is the personnel,

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:40.936
which are a function of
the president's values.

00:38:40.936 --> 00:38:45.310
Number two, it is the dominant idea

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:47.870
or the dominant ideas at a given time

00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:50.000
in terms of what is the essential problem,

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.444
what is the deep problem.

00:38:51.444 --> 00:38:54.890
Third, it's what people out
there are concerned about.

00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:56.214
What they're hollering about.

00:38:56.214 --> 00:39:01.214
You know, is there a movement
out there in the public

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.056
to do something about something?

00:39:04.056 --> 00:39:09.056
And, finally, and this is the
toughest thing to understand.

00:39:10.898 --> 00:39:14.090
I go back and forth as somebody

00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:17.000
who is very interested in
political and economic history.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.150
I'm trying to understand.

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:19.787
It's almost the zeitgeist.

00:39:19.787 --> 00:39:24.740
It's something that is deeper than

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:27.760
the two or three or
four year period marking

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.845
a presidential term of office.

00:39:29.845 --> 00:39:34.063
It's something that characterizes an era.

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:40.310
Attitudes, understandings, assumptions.

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:43.050
- So, deficits are important.

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:47.176
Deregulation must be done
to unleash capitalism.

00:39:47.176 --> 00:39:49.690
Those kinds of ideas.

00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:50.637
- Well, those ideas.

00:39:50.637 --> 00:39:52.673
Worrying about deficits.

00:39:53.528 --> 00:39:55.650
You know, they've been
around for a long time.

00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:58.250
I mean, even when Franklin D.
Roosevelt became president,

00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:01.019
he promised, first thing he promised

00:40:01.019 --> 00:40:03.030
was to balance the budget.

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:05.190
That's what Herbert Hoover tried to do.

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:08.260
I mean, it had no bearing at all

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:10.330
on getting out of the Depression.

00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:11.670
In fact, trying to balance the budget

00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:14.090
when you have that much
underutilized capacity

00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:15.400
is the last thing you wanna do.

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:18.900
I mean, government is the
spender of last resort.

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:20.440
But he didn't understand that.

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:23.810
And it's very easy to,
particularly in times of stress,

00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:27.360
to analogize a family budget
to the nation's budget.

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:29.180
And say, "Okay, the
reason we're in trouble

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:31.280
is we spent too much.

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:33.001
That's the reason a family's in trouble.

00:40:33.001 --> 00:40:35.180
They lived beyond their means.

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:37.680
And so, we, as a nation,
have lived beyond our means."

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:39.549
But you see the same theme cropping up

00:40:39.549 --> 00:40:43.420
every 15, 20, 30 years.

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:46.719
And the Republicans, of
course, since Ronald Reagan

00:40:46.719 --> 00:40:50.010
and, in England, Margaret Thatcher,

00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:51.700
have really glommed onto that.

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:54.096
Barry Goldwater talked about that.

00:40:54.096 --> 00:40:59.096
But, of course, experience
should teach us otherwise.

00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:02.380
The same thing about privatization.

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:06.240
Privatization has been
a conservative theme,

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:10.590
major theme, for 50, 60, 70 years.

00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:12.756
You see Herbert Hoover talking about it.

00:41:12.756 --> 00:41:17.060
But then it gains prominence in 1980.

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:19.398
Ronald Reagan, in terms of his values,

00:41:19.398 --> 00:41:21.990
his abilities to communicate to people

00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:23.980
who he brought along.

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:25.840
The exhaustion of Keynesianism.

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:27.840
I mean, remember, by the late '70s,

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:30.006
we had double digit inflation.

00:41:30.006 --> 00:41:35.006
Nobody believed in Keynesianism
any longer or seemingly.

00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:40.340
It just seemed like we
were in a terrible state.

00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:41.538
Stagflation.

00:41:41.538 --> 00:41:44.650
So, we were prepared to
believe something else.

00:41:44.650 --> 00:41:46.560
Privatization and deregulation

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:49.360
seemed like it would deliver us.

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:54.360
Lower taxes on the wealthy will
have trickle down benefits.

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:59.480
All of that proved to
be just a pipe dream.

00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:03.672
But the country was ready for it.

00:42:03.672 --> 00:42:05.640
- In the Clinton administration,

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:10.640
you describe in your book
the idea that was afoot

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:16.040
among the politicos that we
have to worry about the center.

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:18.350
We have to find the center.

00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:21.120
And you make the interesting point that,

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:26.120
if you're a leader, you
don't act from the center.

00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:29.300
You're actually moving the center.

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:32.310
Today, we talk about marshaling

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:34.010
the support of the independents.

00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:37.080
And that, really, I
think you're suggesting

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:41.750
locks us in to not moving
to a new set of ideas.

00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:45.230
- Well, a true leader cannot
lead people to the center,

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:46.340
'cause they're already there.

00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:47.290
I mean, you can't lead people

00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:48.740
to where they already are.

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:50.650
Because they are already there.

00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:52.820
It's not very profound.

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:55.700
If you want to lead, you
can't look at the polls.

00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:57.020
You've got to lead the polls.

00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:59.060
You've got to change the polls.

00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:04.060
And we have presidents like Ronald Reagan

00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:08.760
or even George W. Bush
who have very strong ideas

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:10.820
and who essentially say,

00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:14.163
partly because they are
pigheaded and very stubborn

00:43:14.163 --> 00:43:17.660
and will not listen to
their political advisors,

00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:18.810
they say, "Well, I don't care.

00:43:18.810 --> 00:43:21.550
I believe this and I'm gonna
lead people in this direction."

00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:24.670
And a lot of people come along.

00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:27.611
On the other hand, we have presidents,

00:43:27.611 --> 00:43:30.380
very intelligent presidents...

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:31.610
I mean, Bill Clinton is one.

00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:34.363
And Barack Obama is an
extraordinarily intelligent man.

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:39.253
But they are so intelligent that

00:43:39.253 --> 00:43:43.730
they see too many sides of an issue.

00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:48.010
And, therefore, they're willing to listen

00:43:48.010 --> 00:43:49.287
to the political advisors who say,

00:43:49.287 --> 00:43:51.810
"Well, the public, really, is over here.

00:43:51.810 --> 00:43:52.970
You can't go there.

00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:53.970
This is where you have to go,

00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:55.300
because this is where the public is."

00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:59.570
And they, therefore, lose, by default,

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:01.701
their capacity to lead.

00:44:01.701 --> 00:44:06.701
- You look at sort of the
opportunities for change

00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:15.143
and you focus a lot on the
backlash that's building.

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:20.550
People resenting the
change in their status.

00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:25.550
They're looking at how the
wealthy are doing very well.

00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:29.423
They resent the way the rules of the game

00:44:29.423 --> 00:44:34.423
seem to be written to, really,

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:38.700
not do justice to what the expectations

00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:40.047
of the middle class and so on.

00:44:40.047 --> 00:44:44.300
So, my understanding,
and please correct me,

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:49.300
is that you really see it important

00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:54.070
to educate the people who
are the great beneficiaries

00:44:54.070 --> 00:44:59.070
of the present system to
see this backlash coming

00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:01.080
and change their ways.

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:02.300
Is that fair?

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:04.681
- Well, I would say
it's slightly different.

00:45:04.681 --> 00:45:07.563
That is there's a lot of anger out there.

00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:12.770
The Tea Party was born out of anger

00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:15.510
toward the bailout of Wall Street.

00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:18.060
It's very interesting to me that

00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:20.860
we had many people on
the left who were furious

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:22.180
about the bailout of Wall Street.

00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:24.446
Many people on the so-called right.

00:45:24.446 --> 00:45:28.870
But that bailout, for many
so-called Tea Partiers,

00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:33.470
became emblematic of the fact
you can't trust government.

00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:34.590
You can't trust big business.

00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:35.760
You can't trust Wall Street.

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:37.160
But you can't trust government in part

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:38.240
because government's going to be

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:40.750
co-opted by big business and Wall Street.

00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:43.045
And what you want is a small government

00:45:43.045 --> 00:45:46.960
to avoid that kind of co-optation.

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:50.680
And, on the surface of it,
that's not totally illogical.

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:52.370
The problem there is, if
you don't have government,

00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:56.180
all you have left is big
business and Wall Street.

00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:58.630
And then you have total co-optation.

00:45:58.630 --> 00:46:01.533
You have no potential
countervailing power.

00:46:01.533 --> 00:46:04.490
But, when people are that angry, Harry,

00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:07.730
I think that they are willing
to listen to demagogues

00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:12.730
who use their anger and direct
it in all kinds of places.

00:46:16.270 --> 00:46:19.340
Toward people who become,
essentially, scapegoats.

00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:21.427
Whether we're talking about immigrants.

00:46:21.427 --> 00:46:25.373
Extraordinary anti-immigrant
feeling in this country now.

00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:30.469
The Chinese, to some
extent, are scapegoats.

00:46:30.469 --> 00:46:34.400
Public employees have become scapegoats.

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:35.723
Unionized workers.

00:46:37.124 --> 00:46:41.630
The anger is looking for people.

00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:43.530
Looking for groups.

00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:46.880
And, to that extent, it
can be very dangerous

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:48.350
for a society.

00:46:48.350 --> 00:46:49.693
The rich are not immune.

00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:54.640
And so, what I've argued and
I argue in Aftershock is that,

00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:59.640
in economic terms, the very, very rich

00:46:59.657 --> 00:47:02.852
actually have more to gain from

00:47:02.852 --> 00:47:07.852
having a smaller share of
a rapidly growing economy

00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:11.332
than a big share of an
economy that's anemic

00:47:11.332 --> 00:47:13.550
because there's not enough demand.

00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:14.820
Because the middle class doesn't have

00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:17.540
the purchasing power to
keep the economy going.

00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:19.110
And, by the same token,

00:47:19.110 --> 00:47:22.240
the rich have much more
to gain from an economy

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:26.410
and a politics that are
based on collaboration

00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:29.811
and more goodwill than they do from

00:47:29.811 --> 00:47:32.350
an economy and a politics that

00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:37.350
succumbs to partisanship, rancor, anger.

00:47:38.945 --> 00:47:42.030
Not just because the
rich themselves could be

00:47:43.682 --> 00:47:45.003
the victims of anger.

00:47:45.003 --> 00:47:47.960
But, no, more because
a kind of society that

00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:52.960
is that fractured cannot, by definition,

00:47:57.308 --> 00:48:02.308
do what it needs to do
to make itself whole.

00:48:03.250 --> 00:48:04.980
To embrace progress.

00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:07.770
To adapt to a different world.

00:48:07.770 --> 00:48:12.770
- What will push us to see this reality

00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:17.503
in a way that changes the system?

00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:23.080
I don't yet see myself the vehicle

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:26.480
that will make this possible.

00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:28.660
The political leadership seems to be

00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:30.800
focused on the independents.

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:33.751
And not moving from the center.

00:48:33.751 --> 00:48:38.751
And the unions, as you point out,

00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:44.150
do not have the power in society

00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:46.130
that they had during the Great Prosperity.

00:48:46.130 --> 00:48:49.978
So, on the one hand, we're moving toward

00:48:49.978 --> 00:48:52.900
educating the public about issues.

00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:56.430
On the other hand, we have
this emerging backlash.

00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:58.880
What will make the difference so that

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:01.860
we'll come up with the kinds of solutions

00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:02.899
that you're talking about?

00:49:02.899 --> 00:49:05.920
You propose a reversed income tax,

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:08.495
higher marginal tax rates on the wealthy,

00:49:08.495 --> 00:49:10.560
a re-employment system,

00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:13.640
college loans linked
to subsequent earnings,

00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:14.677
Medicare for all.

00:49:14.677 --> 00:49:19.677
I mean, it's all very clear
what lies behind your argument.

00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:22.000
But how do you see that happening?

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.780
- Well, let me just say,
I don't think we face

00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:29.480
a dearth of ideas on the left
or the right or anywhere.

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:31.180
I mean, there are ideas out there.

00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:35.670
I think the real question
is political will.

00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:37.407
That's what you're asking.

00:49:37.407 --> 00:49:42.407
I, in my experience, have been surprised

00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:45.550
at moments at which the public

00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:48.501
seems to be galvanized by something.

00:49:48.501 --> 00:49:51.430
It may be deficit reduction.

00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:53.145
It may be anger at Wall Street.

00:49:53.145 --> 00:49:57.650
It may be disgust with the Vietnam War.

00:49:57.650 --> 00:49:59.100
It may be civil rights.

00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:01.270
Whatever it is, there is a tipping point.

00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:02.550
A set of tipping points.

00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:06.790
Where the public does become galvanized.

00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:08.520
Positively or negatively.

00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:09.890
And those are opportunities.

00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:14.690
I think, after Wall
Street began to implode

00:50:14.690 --> 00:50:18.361
at the end of 2008,

00:50:18.361 --> 00:50:21.490
just as Barack Obama
was becoming president,

00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:25.060
that was a real opportunity.

00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:26.570
Let's call it a teaching opportunity,

00:50:26.570 --> 00:50:27.550
a learning opportunity.

00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:28.610
But it was more than that.

00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:32.483
And the public was really
open to an explanation.

00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:36.850
And desperately wanted one and needed one

00:50:36.850 --> 00:50:39.240
for what was happening

00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:43.000
and where Barack Obama, the
new president, would lead them.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.663
I don't think he fully took
advantage of that moment.

00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:49.730
When will the next moment be?

00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:51.100
Very difficult to tell.

00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:54.360
My great fear is that we stay in

00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:57.110
the gravitational pull of the
Great Recession for years.

00:50:57.110 --> 00:51:00.049
High unemployment, anemic economic growth,

00:51:00.049 --> 00:51:03.750
a kind of angry, disgruntled politics.

00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:07.660
And we never, or we don't for many years,

00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:11.720
get to the point where
the public understands,

00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:14.960
is given a narrative, is
given a kind of picture

00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:19.960
of what happened, why it
happened, and where we need to go.

00:51:20.970 --> 00:51:24.150
One of the most important
things a president can do

00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:28.620
is to provide that clear narrative.

00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:31.430
And, although I have tremendous admiration

00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:35.813
for President Obama, he has not done that.

00:51:36.830 --> 00:51:38.593
- One final question, Bob.

00:51:38.593 --> 00:51:41.060
If students are watching this program

00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:46.060
and they actually believe
in progressive ideals

00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:48.750
and would like to see them implemented,

00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:51.853
how would you advise them
to prepare for the future?

00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:54.280
- Well, whether they're interested

00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:56.060
in progressive ideals or not,

00:51:56.060 --> 00:52:01.060
I mean, in terms of my capacity
as a professor at Berkeley,

00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:07.500
I do not try to make students

00:52:08.610 --> 00:52:11.430
believe something that they don't believe.

00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:16.430
I don't try to inject them
with progressive ideals.

00:52:16.690 --> 00:52:18.180
I want them to think hard.

00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:20.620
I want them to question their assumptions.

00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:23.490
Often, in class, I play devil's advocate

00:52:23.490 --> 00:52:25.139
and I'm the conservative.

00:52:25.139 --> 00:52:29.510
My responsibility here at
Berkeley is to get them

00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:34.510
to give up their conventional views

00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:38.530
that are not based on hard thought

00:52:38.530 --> 00:52:40.500
and to really shake them up so that

00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:44.300
they think much more profoundly
about important issues.

00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:46.530
But I would like them
to go into public life.

00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:49.150
I do think that public
service is important.

00:52:49.150 --> 00:52:51.535
Regardless of what their values are.

00:52:51.535 --> 00:52:53.863
And I do urge them,

00:52:56.530 --> 00:53:01.530
whether it's some aspect of a
portfolio, of their careers,

00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:06.310
their days, their weeks,

00:53:06.310 --> 00:53:09.060
whether it's a matter
of running for office

00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:14.060
or becoming a legislative
aide or becoming an officer

00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:17.360
or an activist in a not for profit

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:20.113
or an advocate, an organizer,

00:53:21.570 --> 00:53:25.617
I ask them to take an active role.

00:53:25.617 --> 00:53:27.500
For the good of the country.

00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:28.450
For their own good.

00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:32.690
- Bob, on that note, I'm
gonna show one of your books.

00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:34.820
Robert Reich Aftershock.

00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:38.250
But I do wanna say that I recommend, also,

00:53:38.250 --> 00:53:39.630
Locked in the Cabinet.

00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:43.150
Which I think is still a great read.

00:53:43.150 --> 00:53:46.510
Thank you very much for
taking the time to be here.

00:53:46.510 --> 00:53:47.343
- Thank you, Harry.

00:53:47.343 --> 00:53:49.090
- And it was a great pleasure to have you.

00:53:49.090 --> 00:53:49.923
- [Bob] My pleasure.

00:53:49.923 --> 00:53:51.970
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:53:51.970 --> 00:53:53.963
for this Conversation with History.

00:53:55.572 --> 00:53:58.322
(exciting music)
