00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.080
&gt;&gt; Can India become a superpower?
I guess I would have two primary responses.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:19.310
Number one, yes.
In fact, not only can India become a superpower,

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.260
it is well on its way
to getting there.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.099
And given the weight of its population, given
its geopolitical

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:37.120
situation, given the resources it has, and
given, belatedly, the

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.730
significant improvement it is starting to
see in its governance, and

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.560
given the world we live in where it's difficult
to suppress good ideas

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:54.739
and difficult to suppress the expectation
of a population, and given it

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:01.450
being a liberal democracy -- in my mind, it
is absolutely inevitable.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.190
So not only can India become a superpower,
it will definitely become a

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:13.060
superpower.
The second point I would add is becoming a

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.430
superpower, I think, in the
future is going to mean very different things

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.229
than it has meant in the
past.

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.650
And in some ways you could argue that just
the concept of a superpower

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.830
is going to become a little irrelevant because
there be 3, 4, 5,

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.510
perhaps, economic powers that will anchor
the world.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:39.000
And if all of them are superpowers, then I'm
not sure any of them is a

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.030
superpower in that sense.
Thank you.
