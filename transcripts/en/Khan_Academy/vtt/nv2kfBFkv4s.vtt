00:00:00.483 --> 00:00:03.191
- [Voiceover] So I've got two arbitrary amino acids here.

00:00:03.191 --> 00:00:05.987
We recognize the telltale signs of an amino acid.

00:00:05.987 --> 00:00:08.727
We have an amino group right over here

00:00:08.727 --> 00:00:10.980
that gives us the amino and amino acid.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.393
We have a carboxyl group right over here.

00:00:13.393 --> 00:00:15.831
This is the acid part of an amino acid.

00:00:15.831 --> 00:00:17.527
And in between we have a carbon,

00:00:17.527 --> 00:00:21.084
and we call that the alpha carbon.

00:00:21.084 --> 00:00:22.983
And that alpha carbon is gonna be bonded

00:00:22.983 --> 00:00:26.444
to a hydrogen and some type of a side chain,

00:00:26.444 --> 00:00:28.882
and we're just gonna call this side chain R1,

00:00:28.882 --> 00:00:31.342
and then we're gonna call this side chain R2.

00:00:31.342 --> 00:00:33.177
And what we're gonna concern ourselves with

00:00:33.177 --> 00:00:36.172
in this video is, how do you take two amino acids

00:00:36.172 --> 00:00:38.286
and form a peptide out of them?

00:00:38.286 --> 00:00:41.157
And just as a reminder, a peptide is nothing more...

00:00:43.927 --> 00:00:46.150
than a chain of amino acids.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.786
And so, how do you take these two amino acids

00:00:59.786 --> 00:01:01.992
and form a dipeptide like this?

00:01:01.992 --> 00:01:03.920
A dipeptide would have two amino acids.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.963
That would be the smallest possible peptide,

00:01:05.963 --> 00:01:07.797
but then you could keep adding amino acids

00:01:07.797 --> 00:01:09.631
and form polypeptides.

00:01:09.631 --> 00:01:12.761
And a very high-level overview of this reaction is

00:01:12.761 --> 00:01:15.181
that this nitrogen uses its lone pair

00:01:15.181 --> 00:01:20.012
to form a bond with this carbonyl carbon right over here.

00:01:20.382 --> 00:01:24.143
So this lone pair goes to this carbonyl carbon,

00:01:24.143 --> 00:01:27.278
forms a bond, and then this hydrogen,

00:01:27.278 --> 00:01:31.432
this hydrogen, and this oxygen could be used net net

00:01:31.432 --> 00:01:33.738
to form a water molecule...

00:01:35.208 --> 00:01:39.235
that's let go from both of these amino acids.

00:01:39.235 --> 00:01:41.161
So this reaction, you end up

00:01:41.161 --> 00:01:44.319
with the nitrogen being attached to this carbon,

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.732
and a release of a water molecule.

00:01:47.732 --> 00:01:50.356
And because you have the release of this water molecule,

00:01:50.356 --> 00:01:52.818
this type of reaction, and we've seen it many other times

00:01:52.818 --> 00:01:55.698
with other types of molecules,

00:01:55.698 --> 00:01:57.995
we call this a condensation reaction,

00:01:57.995 --> 00:02:00.178
or a dehydration synthesis.

00:02:00.178 --> 00:02:03.314
So condensation...

00:02:04.734 --> 00:02:06.764
condensation reaction

00:02:07.264 --> 00:02:10.134
or dehydration synthesis.

00:02:11.515 --> 00:02:12.820
We saw this type of reaction

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.681
when we were putting glucoses together,

00:02:14.681 --> 00:02:17.351
when we were forming carbohydrates.

00:02:17.351 --> 00:02:21.484
Dehydration synthesis.

00:02:21.484 --> 00:02:23.133
But whenever I see a reaction like this,

00:02:23.133 --> 00:02:24.874
it's somewhat satisfying to just be able

00:02:24.874 --> 00:02:27.057
to do the counting and say, "All right, this is gonna bond

00:02:27.057 --> 00:02:29.170
"with that, we see the bond right over there,

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.305
"and I'm gonna let go of an oxygen and two hydrogens,

00:02:32.305 --> 00:02:35.950
"which net net equals H2O, equals a water molecule."

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.854
But how can we actually imagine this happening?

00:02:37.854 --> 00:02:39.178
Can we push the electrons around?

00:02:39.178 --> 00:02:42.306
Can we do a little bit of high-level organic chemistry

00:02:42.966 --> 00:02:44.309
to think about how this happens?

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:45.374
And that's what I wanna do here.

00:02:45.374 --> 00:02:47.560
I'm not gonna do a formal reaction mechanism,

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.928
but really get a sense of what's going on.

00:02:49.928 --> 00:02:51.994
Well, nitrogen, as we said, has got this lone pair,

00:02:51.994 --> 00:02:53.433
it's electronegative.

00:02:53.433 --> 00:02:55.663
And this carbon right over here, it's attached

00:02:55.663 --> 00:02:58.450
to two oxygens, oxygens are more electronegative.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.049
The oxygens might hog those electrons.

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.210
And so this nitrogen might wanna do

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.950
what we call in organic chemistry a nucleophilic attack

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.294
on this carbon right over here.

00:03:08.294 --> 00:03:09.849
And when it does that,

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.102
if we were doing a more formal reaction mechanism,

00:03:12.102 --> 00:03:13.657
we could say, "Hey, well, maybe one

00:03:13.657 --> 00:03:16.978
"of the double bonds goes back,

00:03:16.978 --> 00:03:19.346
"the electrons in it go back to this oxygen,

00:03:19.346 --> 00:03:23.177
"and then that oxygen would have a negative charge."

00:03:23.177 --> 00:03:24.316
But then that lone pair

00:03:24.316 --> 00:03:27.484
from that double bond could then reform,

00:03:27.484 --> 00:03:30.505
and as that happens,

00:03:30.505 --> 00:03:35.415
this oxygen that's in the hydroxyl group will take back both

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:37.087
of these electrons.

00:03:37.087 --> 00:03:40.940
Would take back both of those electrons,

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.088
and now it's going to have an extra lone pair.

00:03:45.088 --> 00:03:47.884
Let me do that by erasing this bond

00:03:47.884 --> 00:03:50.972
and then giving it an extra lone pair.

00:03:50.972 --> 00:03:54.344
It already had two lone pairs,

00:03:54.344 --> 00:03:55.430
and then when it took that bond,

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.467
it's gonna have a third lone pair.

00:03:57.467 --> 00:04:01.234
And then it's going to have a negative charge.

00:04:01.234 --> 00:04:02.489
And now you could imagine it's going

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.554
to grab a hydrogen proton someplace.

00:04:04.554 --> 00:04:06.274
And now it could just grab any hydrogen proton,

00:04:06.274 --> 00:04:09.082
but probably the most convenient one would be this one,

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:12.472
because if this nitrogen is going to use this lone pair

00:04:12.472 --> 00:04:14.006
to form a bond with carbon,

00:04:14.006 --> 00:04:16.303
it's going to have a positive charge,

00:04:16.303 --> 00:04:18.951
and it might wanna take these electrons back.

00:04:18.951 --> 00:04:21.041
So you could imagine where one

00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:23.966
of these lone pairs is used to grab this hydrogen proton,

00:04:23.966 --> 00:04:27.796
and then the nitrogen can take these electrons,

00:04:27.796 --> 00:04:29.576
can take these electrons back.

00:04:29.576 --> 00:04:31.652
So hopefully you didn't find this too convoluted,

00:04:31.652 --> 00:04:32.581
but I always like to think,

00:04:32.581 --> 00:04:33.881
what could actually happen here?

00:04:33.881 --> 00:04:37.038
And so you see, this lone pair of electrons

00:04:37.038 --> 00:04:39.849
from the nitrogen forms this orange bond with the carbon.

00:04:43.239 --> 00:04:44.421
Let me do that in orange color

00:04:44.421 --> 00:04:46.140
if I'm going to call it an orange bond.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.950
It forms this orange bond.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.409
What we call this orange bond,

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:54.821
we could call this a peptide bond, or a peptide linkage.

00:04:54.821 --> 00:04:59.418
Peptide bond,

00:04:59.418 --> 00:05:01.228
sometimes called a peptide...

00:05:03.508 --> 00:05:05.378
peptide linkage.

00:05:05.388 --> 00:05:10.238
And then we have the release of a water molecule.

00:05:10.238 --> 00:05:12.676
And so you have this oxygen is this oxygen,

00:05:12.676 --> 00:05:16.089
and you could imagine that this hydrogen is this hydrogen,

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:19.897
and this hydrogen is this hydrogen right over here,

00:05:19.897 --> 00:05:21.802
and so net net it all works out.

00:05:21.802 --> 00:05:23.380
Now when I first saw this reaction,

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.447
I was like, "OK, that kind of makes sense."

00:05:25.447 --> 00:05:28.906
Except for the fact that in physiological pHs,

00:05:28.906 --> 00:05:32.203
amino acids don't tend to be in this form.

00:05:32.203 --> 00:05:35.792
In physiological pHs, you are more likely

00:05:35.792 --> 00:05:38.635
to find this form of the amino acids,

00:05:38.635 --> 00:05:42.489
to find them as zwitterions.

00:05:42.489 --> 00:05:44.557
Zwitterions. Let me write down that word.

00:05:44.557 --> 00:05:45.829
It's a fun word to say.

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:48.828
And it's one word, but I'm gonna write the two parts

00:05:48.828 --> 00:05:50.616
of the word in different colors so you can see.

00:05:50.616 --> 00:05:52.404
It's a zwitterion.

00:05:52.404 --> 00:05:53.425
So what does that mean?

00:05:53.425 --> 00:05:55.702
Well, zwitter in German means hybrid.

00:05:55.702 --> 00:05:56.769
It's a hybrid ion.

00:05:56.769 --> 00:06:00.647
It's an ion, it has charge on different ends of it,

00:06:00.647 --> 00:06:03.781
parts of the molecule have charge,

00:06:03.781 --> 00:06:06.776
but when you net 'em out, it is neutral.

00:06:07.386 --> 00:06:10.446
Parts are charged, but is neutral overall.

00:06:10.446 --> 00:06:14.974
And so at physiological pHs, the amino,

00:06:14.974 --> 00:06:17.481
the nitrogen end of the amino acid,

00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:20.940
tends to grab an extra proton, becomes a positive charge,

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.306
and the carboxyl group tends to let go of a proton

00:06:25.306 --> 00:06:27.048
and has a negative charge.

00:06:27.048 --> 00:06:29.462
And this is actually going to be in equilibrium

00:06:29.462 --> 00:06:31.343
with the forms that we just saw before,

00:06:31.343 --> 00:06:33.781
but at physiological pHs, it will actually tend

00:06:33.781 --> 00:06:37.240
to the zwitterion form.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.006
And so how do you get from this form

00:06:39.006 --> 00:06:42.094
to form a peptide bond?

00:06:42.094 --> 00:06:46.342
Well, you could imagine this character over here,

00:06:46.342 --> 00:06:49.407
after giving its hydrogen protons, has an extra lone pair.

00:06:49.407 --> 00:06:53.888
So it's got one lone pair, two lone pairs,

00:06:53.888 --> 00:06:57.962
and then it's got, I'll do the extra lone pair in,

00:06:57.962 --> 00:07:00.152
I'll do the extra loan pair in purple.

00:07:00.152 --> 00:07:01.738
It's got an extra lone pair.

00:07:01.738 --> 00:07:04.547
Well, maybe it could use an extra lone pair

00:07:04.547 --> 00:07:08.123
to either grab a proton from the solution

00:07:08.123 --> 00:07:10.793
or maybe just for accounting convenience we could say,

00:07:10.793 --> 00:07:12.140
"Well, maybe just bumps in the right way

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.807
"to grab this proton and then allows the nitrogen...

00:07:19.347 --> 00:07:21.612
"to take back these electrons."

00:07:21.612 --> 00:07:25.305
And if it did that, well, then you're getting,

00:07:25.305 --> 00:07:27.604
at least when you're looking at this carboxyl group

00:07:27.604 --> 00:07:29.391
and this amino group,

00:07:29.391 --> 00:07:31.319
you're going to get to the form that we just saw.

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:32.526
If this gets a hydrogen here,

00:07:32.526 --> 00:07:34.313
this is gonna become a hydroxyl,

00:07:34.313 --> 00:07:37.588
and if this nitrogen takes back these two electrons

00:07:37.588 --> 00:07:39.980
from this pair, then it's just going to be NH2.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.625
So it's going to be, at least this part of the molecules,

00:07:43.625 --> 00:07:45.737
are gonna be just what we started with up here,

00:07:45.737 --> 00:07:47.921
and so you could imagine how you get back

00:07:47.921 --> 00:07:51.756
to the peptide linkage

00:07:51.756 --> 00:07:53.966
which we have right over here.

00:07:53.966 --> 00:07:55.421
This is the peptide linkage.

00:07:55.421 --> 00:07:59.460
And then the only difference between the resulting peptide

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.759
that I have in this reaction,

00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:03.246
I guess you could say, in the previous one,

00:08:03.246 --> 00:08:05.195
is this is a zwitterion.

00:08:05.195 --> 00:08:09.212
The zwitterion form, where this carboxyl group...

00:08:10.232 --> 00:08:12.579
having donated its proton to the solution,

00:08:12.579 --> 00:08:15.575
and over here the nitrogen, this nitrogen,

00:08:15.575 --> 00:08:17.850
has taken a proton from the solution,

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:19.383
so it has a net neutral charge,

00:08:19.383 --> 00:08:22.029
even though you do have a charge at either end.

00:08:22.029 --> 00:08:24.282
So hopefully you found that fun.
