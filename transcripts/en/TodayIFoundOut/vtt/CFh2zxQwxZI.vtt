00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.570
The tiny mountainous country of Switzerland
has been in a state of “perpetual neutrality”

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.820
since the major European powers of the time
declared it as such during the Congress of

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.030
Vienna after the end of the Napoleonic wars
in 1815.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.930
Why did they do this?

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:59.479
The French conquered Switzerland in 1798,
establishing the Helvetic Republic in attempt

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:03.820
to make Switzerland something of a strategically
positioned French satellite state.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.910
Not long after, Austrian and Russian forces
invaded the country in their war against France.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.580
The Swiss, rather than fighting alongside
their French overlords, largely refused.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.520
This ultimately led to the Act of Mediation,
giving the Swiss back much of their former

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.520
independence.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.520
Twelve years later, they got the rest thanks
to the aforementioned Congress of Vienna in

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.119
which their neutrality in the wars of their
neighbors was officially recognised.

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.759
Beyond the Swiss themselves having long tried
to stay out of the conflicts of Europe (since

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.470
the early 16th century after a devastating
loss at the Battle of Marignano), part of

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.869
the reason Switzerland was granted neutrality
in perpetuity in 1815 is because the European

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:46.270
powers of the time deemed that the country
was ideally located to function as a “a

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.700
valuable buffer zone between France and Austria”.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.800
Thus, granting their neutrality in wars, so
long as they continued to stay out of them,

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.760
would “contribute to stability in the region”.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.860
Since that time, with a few minor exceptions,
Switzerland has steadfastly refused to compromise

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.860
its neutrality for any reason, though on the
war-front they did suffer an exceptionally

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.480
brief civil war in the mid-19th century resulting
in only a handful of casualties.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.170
While minor in its scale, this civil war drastically
changed the political landscape of the Swiss

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.390
government, including the establishment of
a constitution partially borrowing from the

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.700
then less than a century old United States
constitution.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.239
In any event, as for those aforementioned
“minor exceptions”, Switzerland has occasionally

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:34.340
taken part in some global peacekeeping missions
and prior to 1860 Swiss troops did sometimes

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.070
take part in various skirmishes, despite their
neutrality.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.500
In more modern times, Switzerland needed to
defend its borders from both Allied and Axis

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.599
(see: How Did the Axis and Allies Get Their
Names) air incursions during WW2.

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.940
For instance, they shot down nearly a dozen
German planes in the spring of 1940 alone,

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.819
as well as shot down some American bombers
and forced down countless others on both sides.

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.439
This included grounding and detaining the
crews of over a hundred Allied bombers that

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:00.230
tried to fly over the country.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.950
When Hitler tried to counter Swiss measures
at keeping the Luftwaffe from their skies

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.469
by sending a sabotage team to destroy Swiss
airfields, the Swiss successfully captured

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:11.629
the saboteurs before they could carry out
any bombings.

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.849
You might think it a bit silly for the Swiss
to risk war with both sides by shooting or

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:20.639
forcing down foreign aircraft from their skies,
but on several occasions Allied bombers accidentally

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:23.819
attacked Swiss cities, mistaking them for
German ones.

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.920
For instance, on April 1, 1944, American bombers,
thinking they were bombing Ludwigshafen am

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.700
Rhein, bombed Schaffhausen, killing 40 Swiss
citizens and destroying over fifty buildings.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.040
This was not an isolated incident.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.159
So how exactly did Switzerland, surrounded
on all sides by Axis (or Central in WW1) and

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:42.349
Allied powers during the wars to end all wars,
manage to keep enemy troops at bay without

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.049
much in the way of any fighting?

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.040
Officially Switzerland maintains a policy
of “Aggressive Neutrality” meaning that

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.640
although it actively avoids taking part in
conflicts, as evidenced by their air-force

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.469
activities during WW2, it will defend its
own interests with vigour.

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:01.719
How vigorous?

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:06.620
To ensure other countries respect its neutral
stance, Switzerland has long put itself into

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.849
a terrifyingly over prepared position to fight,
and made sure every country around them was,

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:14.670
and is, well aware of this fact.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.660
As for specifics, to begin with, a common
misconception about Switzerland is that because

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.431
it doesn’t actively take part in global
military conflicts, that it doesn’t have

00:04:22.431 --> 00:04:24.590
a strong or well prepared military.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.740
In reality the Swiss military is a highly
trained and competent fighting force, and

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.280
due to the country’s policy of compulsory
conscription of males (today women may volunteer

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.590
for any position in the military, but are
not required to serve) is surprisingly large

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.080
for a country of only around eight million
people.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.710
In fact, approximately two-thirds of all males
are ultimately deemed mentally and physically

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.680
fit enough to serve in the Swiss military,
meaning a huge percentage of their population

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.770
is ultimately military trained.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.050
(Those who are not, and aren’t exempt because
of a disability, are required to pay additional

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.770
taxes until they are 30 to make up for not
serving.)

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.419
As for what fighting force is actively maintained,
the Swiss military today is only around 140,000

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.889
men strong and just this year it has been
voted to reduce that to 100,000.

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:15.400
This is a major downsize from just two decades
ago when it was estimated the Swiss military

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.599
had some 750,000 soldiers.

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:23.110
For reference, this latter total is about
half the size of the United States military

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.669
today, despite Switzerland having only about
eight million people vs. the United States’

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:29.710
three hundred million.

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.169
In addition to this, Switzerland has one of
the highest rates of gun ownership in the

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:38.230
world and many Swiss people are highly competent
in handling said firearms due to both compulsory

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:43.520
military service and a strong culture of recreational
shooting (half a million Swiss children are

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.940
said to be part of a gun club of some kind).

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.580
This said, in recent years the rate of gun
ownership has declined somewhat after a series

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.060
of gun related incidents, such as one where
a man shot his estranged wife with his old

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.650
military issued rifle.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.979
Prior to the shooting, military conscripts
would take their rifle home with them after

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:04.770
their service ended and were expected to keep
it ready for use in defending the country

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.819
should the need arise.

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:10.199
After these incidents, the military curbed
this and implemented a new policy stating

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:14.699
that any conscript wishing to keep their gun
after service must buy it and apply for a

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:15.699
permit.

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:19.889
As part of this new policy, the Swiss military
also no longer provides ammunition with the

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:24.550
guns, instead keeping it in secure locations
that citizens must get to in the event of

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:25.550
an emergency.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.889
Speaking of emergencies, generally speaking,
Switzerland is prepared for near any global

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:34.740
catastrophe from nuclear fallout to a surprise
invasion from an enemy force thanks to a defensive

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:40.629
plan it has been implementing since 1880,
but which was doubled-down upon during WW2

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:42.199
and later during the Cold War.

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:46.139
Dubbed the Swiss National Redoubt, in a nutshell
Switzerland has taken advantage of it unique

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:50.680
natural geography, which includes mountains
that surround it on nearly all sides, to build

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.770
countless bunkers, fortifications and warehouses
across the country that can be accessed at

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:56.820
a moment’s notice.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.659
The full scale of the fortifications is a
closely guarded secret, but some of them are

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:05.080
kept in plain view as part of a comprehensive
campaign of deterrence.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.659
Initially the National Redoubt consisted of
tunnels bored into the many mountains of Switzerland

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:14.300
in key strategic positions for retreating
troops and citizens to take shelter in, but

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:19.270
over the years these have evolved to encompass
a host of ingenious defensive and offensive

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:20.270
structures.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.509
Along with tunnels and bunkers (which are
fully stocked and contain everything from

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:28.310
bakeries and hospitals to dormitories), the
mountains of Switzerland also hide countless

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:33.449
tanks, aircraft, and hidden artillery guns
(some of which are pointed directly at Switzerland’s

00:07:33.449 --> 00:07:36.520
own roads to destroy them in the event of
invasion).

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:41.050
Oddly for a landlocked country, Switzerland
does maintain an active navy of sorts, though

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:44.480
they don’t store any boats in its mountains
as far as we could find.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.419
The naval branch of the Swiss forces’ primary
role is in patrolling the country’s lakes

00:07:48.419 --> 00:07:53.139
on the border and providing aid in search
and rescue operations.

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:57.490
As for more specifically how they kept themselves
out of the world wars, during WW1, the Swiss

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:03.169
military, under freshly appointed General
Ulrich Wille, mobilised well over 200,000

00:08:03.169 --> 00:08:08.210
Swiss soldiers and deployed them across its
major entry points to deter any outside forces

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.640
from considering waging war on the country.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.639
After it became apparent that Switzerland’s
neutrality would be recognised by all powers

00:08:14.639 --> 00:08:18.840
in the first Great War, the vast majority
of the Swiss troops were sent home.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.740
(In fact, in the final year of the war, the
Swiss military had shrunk its numbers to just

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:23.840
12,000.)

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.509
Nothing further was required to keep the Swiss
out of WW1.

00:08:27.509 --> 00:08:32.250
WW2 was a different beast altogether with
Switzerland not banking on Hitler respecting

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:35.300
their long-held neutral stance in European
conflicts.

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:40.870
Thus, newly appointed Swiss General Henri
Guisan was given the unenviable task of trying

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:46.140
to figure out a way to defend the small country
from their neighbors, Hitler and his allies,

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:51.090
despite that said powers drastically outmatched
the Swiss army in a variety of ways.

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:54.490
Towards this end, leading up to the war, the
Swiss withdrew from the League of Nations

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:58.680
to help ensure their neutrality, began to
re-build their military (bringing the number

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:05.380
up to 430,000 combat troops within three days
of the start of the war), and strongly encouraged

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:10.389
its citizens to keep at minimum two months’
worth of supplies on hand at any given time.

00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:15.500
On top of that, they also began secret negotiations
with France to join forces against Germany,

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:20.410
should Germany attack Switzerland (a risky
move that was discovered by the Germans after

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:21.700
France fell to them).

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:25.450
But even with all that, knowing the Swiss
couldn’t win if Hitler really wanted to

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:30.610
invade, Guisan and co. made the decision to
drastically ramp up their WW1 era strategy

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:34.680
of making invading Switzerland as unsavory
an option as possible.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:40.060
Guisan noted that by utilizing Switzerland’s
harsh terrain, a comparatively small amount

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:45.579
of Swiss soldiers in a secure defensive position
could fight off a massive fighting force if

00:09:45.579 --> 00:09:47.200
the need ever arose.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:52.110
So the plan was essentially to perpetually
defend and retreat to some fortified position

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:57.140
over and over again, ultimately conceding
the less defensible populated areas of the

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:01.760
country once the government and citizens had
managed a retreat into secret fortified positions

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:02.760
in the Alps.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.260
They’d then use the Alps as a base from
which to both launch guerrilla attacks to

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.800
make life miserable for any successful invasion
force and to use highly defensible positions

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:10.800
there to keep crucial supply lines from the
invaders.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.310
More controversially, Switzerland continued
to trade with Nazi Germany during the war

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:17.320
in order to further de-incentivise Hitler
from invading.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:21.260
(There is some speculation that some of the
Allies’ “accidental” attacks on Switzerland

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:25.300
were really not accidents at all, given that
some of the buildings that were blown up were

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.870
factories supplying the Axis powers.)

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:33.631
The multi-pronged plan worked and, while Hitler
did have a detailed plan in place to invade

00:10:33.631 --> 00:10:37.690
Switzerland eventually, the cost of doing
so was always too high given the Axis power’s

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:40.380
troubles both on the Eastern and Western fronts.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:45.850
Thus, Switzerland was largely ignored by both
Allies and the Axis throughout WW2, despite

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:51.320
its amazingly well placed location right next
to Germany, Italy, France, and Austria.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:55.139
Switzerland stepped up their level of defence
during the Cold War, again mostly out of a

00:10:55.139 --> 00:10:57.560
desire to deter any potential invaders.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:02.170
This time, however, the focus was on “aggressively”
defending Switzerland’s borders instead

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:07.310
of defending them only long enough to cover
a retreat into the well fortified mountains.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:11.699
Towards this end, Switzerland’s roads, bridges
and train lines were rigged with explosives

00:11:11.699 --> 00:11:13.860
that could be detonated at any time.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:17.860
In many cases, the engineers who designed
the bridges were required to come up with

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:22.560
the most efficient way, using explosives,
to ensure the complete destruction of those

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.000
same bridges.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.240
Once the destruction plan was developed, hidden
explosives were installed at the appropriate

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.940
locations in the bridges.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:35.130
On top of that, the military also lined hundreds
of mountains flanking major roads with explosives

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:36.760
to create artificial rockslides.

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:42.110
All total, over three thousand points of demolition
are publicly known to have been implemented

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:43.900
throughout the small country.

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.589
With ground attacks covered, the Swiss looked
to the skies.

00:11:46.589 --> 00:11:50.949
Unfortunately for them, attack by air is much
harder to defend against for a country so

00:11:50.949 --> 00:11:55.400
small that enemy air forces could penetrate
anywhere within its borders before an adequate

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.170
defence could be mustered to defend its cities.

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:02.320
To protect against this, the Swiss government
constructed thousands of bomb shelters in

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.670
homes, towns and cities to such a degree that
it’s estimated that anywhere between 80

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:11.910
to 120 percent of the country’s population
could hide in them for extended periods.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:16.160
Many of these shelters also included small
hospitals and the necessary equipment to set

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.779
up independent command centers.

00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:23.270
In fact, homes built after WW2 were often
made with over 40 cm (16 in.)

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:26.220
thick concrete ceilings to help them survive
aerial bombings.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:31.310
If your home didn’t accommodate such a shelter,
you had to pay a tax to support places that

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:32.310
did.

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:35.949
It’s also rumoured that much of Switzerland’s
gold supply as well as vast supplies of food

00:12:35.949 --> 00:12:40.140
stores have been similarly squirreled away
somewhere in the Alps, which comprise just

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.759
over half of the country’s total land area.

00:12:42.759 --> 00:12:47.860
As a further example of how ridiculously well
prepared the Swiss are for any and all threats,

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:52.459
there are things like hidden hydroelectric
dams built inside of unmarked mountains so

00:12:52.459 --> 00:12:56.910
that in the event of mass bombings, they’ll
still have electricity from these secret facilities.

00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:01.010
And, remember, these are the things the Swiss
government has let us know about.

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:05.970
It is thought that there are probably more
fortifications and hidden goodies scattered

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:07.570
about the country’s landscape.

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.410
Since the end of the Cold War (see How Did
the Cold War Start and End), similar to how

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:14.399
the Swiss government has been slowly disarming
its population and reducing its standing army,

00:13:14.399 --> 00:13:18.800
decommissioning some of these fortifications
has begun in order to reduce government spending.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:23.040
The Swiss government is somewhat coy about
the extent of this disarming, but it has been

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:27.269
reported that many of the more extreme defences,
such as the explosives that used to be hidden

00:13:27.269 --> 00:13:31.639
inside the country’s bridges and along its
road and railways, have been removed.

00:13:31.639 --> 00:13:35.720
As for the bunkers, unfortunately, simply
abandoning many of these facilities is not

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.740
an option, and it’s fairly expensive to
decommission them.

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:42.759
As such, as the head of security policy for
the federal Department of Defense, Christian

00:13:42.759 --> 00:13:46.779
Catrina, said “…in most cases we’d be
glad if someone would take them off our hands

00:13:46.779 --> 00:13:47.940
for no price”.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:51.990
In some cases, this has resulted in companies
using the ridiculously well protected and

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:55.900
secure mountain facilities as data repositories
and server farms.

00:13:55.900 --> 00:14:00.070
In one such converted bunker, the servers
inside are even completely protected from

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:05.170
outside electromagnetic impulses that result
from nuclear explosions.

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:09.680
In another, detailed instructions on how to
build devices for reading all known data storage

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:14.339
formats, even older formats like floppy disks,
are kept, so that if that knowledge is otherwise

00:14:14.339 --> 00:14:19.110
lost, future generations can still decode
our data storage devices to access the data

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:20.110
within correctly.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:23.850
Essentially, the researchers involved in this
particular project have attempted to create

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:29.040
a “Rosetta Stone” of data formats and
are using a ridiculously secure Swiss bunker

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.560
as the storage point for that knowledge.

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:35.949
As a result of military downsizing, the fate
of the rest of the fortifications is unclear

00:14:35.949 --> 00:14:41.009
and there are calls to decommission all of
them, despite the estimated billion dollar

00:14:41.009 --> 00:14:42.820
price tag to do so.

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:47.200
There is even a growing minority of the Swiss
population who would like to see the entire

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.490
military disbanded, including ceasing mandatory
conscription.

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:55.680
But for now, at least, any country that wishes
to ignore Switzerland’s long-held neutrality

00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:00.949
in military conflicts will find the tiny country
an exceptionally difficult one to conquer

00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:02.110
and occupy.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:06.509
And presumably if war ever again threatens
Swiss’ borders, regardless of how small

00:15:06.509 --> 00:15:10.640
they make their military today, they’ll
likely keep themselves in a position to rapidly

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:49.610
ramp back up their defences 

00:15:49.610 --> 00:18:28.120
as they did for WW1 and WW2.
