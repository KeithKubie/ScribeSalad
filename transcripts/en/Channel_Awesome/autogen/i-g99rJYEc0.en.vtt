it's just the way more than any way uh

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560
it's just the way more than any way uh
 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.359
it's just the way more than any way uh
so eventually it turns out what's

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369
so eventually it turns out what's
 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.950
so eventually it turns out what's
happening takes dad is a he's actually

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960
happening takes dad is a he's actually
 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.450

given birth to Jake and then the mother

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460
given birth to Jake and then the mother
 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.710

gives birth to the brother
 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.020
gives birth to the brother
and that's why Jake can't turn anything

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030
and that's why Jake can't turn anything
 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.850
and that's why Jake can't turn anything
cuz he's actually the product of one of

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860
cuz he's actually the product of one of
 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.020
cuz he's actually the product of one of
those things that can turn it to

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030
those things that can turn it to
 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.370
those things that can turn it to
anything I think there was only one

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380
anything I think there was only one
 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.840
anything I think there was only one
that's my guess I think there was just

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850
that's my guess I think there was just
 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.560
that's my guess I think there was just
only actually one well one it just kept

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570
only actually one well one it just kept
 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.389
only actually one well one it just kept
changing another stuff he that's be

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399
changing another stuff he that's be
 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.760
changing another stuff he that's be
really fast but again we saw he could

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770
really fast but again we saw he could
 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.100
really fast but again we saw he could
teleport to different places you know he

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110
teleport to different places you know he
 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.710
teleport to different places you know he
actually he's separated into two yeah

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720
actually he's separated into two yeah
 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.840
actually he's separated into two yeah
that's two so that very well could be

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850
that's two so that very well could be
 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.459
that's two so that very well could be
