later so that you know you could

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870
later so that you know you could
 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.630

practice merging and that sort of thing
 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.750

and you got to build a plan say with 20

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760
and you got to build a plan say with 20
 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.240
and you got to build a plan say with 20
degrees of difficulty with the highest

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250
degrees of difficulty with the highest
 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.610
degrees of difficulty with the highest
degree of difficulty maybe being merging

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620
degree of difficulty maybe being merging
 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.010

onto a busy four-lane highway and you

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020
onto a busy four-lane highway and you
 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.020
onto a busy four-lane highway and you
could go at night and practice merging

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030
could go at night and practice merging
 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.790

onto the busy highway because it won't

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800
onto the busy highway because it won't
 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.189
onto the busy highway because it won't
be busy at night so I would say what you

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199
be busy at night so I would say what you
 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.319
be busy at night so I would say what you
do is you break it down into small steps

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329
do is you break it down into small steps
 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.420
do is you break it down into small steps
and then practice each step until you're

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430
and then practice each step until you're
 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.639
and then practice each step until you're
bored with the step and when you're

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649
bored with the step and when you're
 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:02.810

bored with it that means you're no

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820
bored with it that means you're no
