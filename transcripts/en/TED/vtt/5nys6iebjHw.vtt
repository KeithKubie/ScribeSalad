00:00:12.853 --> 00:00:14.571
What do you think would happen

00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:18.153
if you invited an individual
who had been living on the street

00:00:18.177 --> 00:00:19.723
for many years,

00:00:19.747 --> 00:00:21.464
had mental health issues

00:00:22.457 --> 00:00:24.144
and was an alcoholic

00:00:24.168 --> 00:00:26.253
to move directly from the street

00:00:26.277 --> 00:00:27.670
into housing?

00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:31.150
We had heard this was being done
in New York City,

00:00:31.174 --> 00:00:33.175
and it was called the Housing First model.

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.477
We wondered if it would work in Utah.

00:00:36.038 --> 00:00:39.703
So to make that determination,
we decided to create a pilot,

00:00:39.727 --> 00:00:44.978
and Keta was one of the 17
chronically homeless individuals

00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:46.882
we included in this pilot.

00:00:46.906 --> 00:00:50.344
She had been on the street
for 20-plus years,

00:00:50.368 --> 00:00:52.333
had mental health issues

00:00:52.357 --> 00:00:54.341
and was a severe alcoholic.

00:00:55.193 --> 00:00:57.279
The first night in her apartment,

00:00:57.303 --> 00:00:59.796
she put her belongings on the bed

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.581
and slept on the floor.

00:01:01.605 --> 00:01:04.296
The next three nights,
she slept out by the dumpster

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.930
near the apartment building.

00:01:06.815 --> 00:01:08.706
With the aid of her case manager,

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.843
she moved back into her apartment

00:01:10.867 --> 00:01:14.059
but continued to sleep on the floor
for several nights.

00:01:14.688 --> 00:01:19.265
It took over two weeks for her
to develop enough trust and confidence

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.368
that this apartment was hers

00:01:22.392 --> 00:01:24.458
and would not be taken away from her

00:01:24.482 --> 00:01:26.696
before she would start
sleeping in the bed.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.338
Homelessness is a continuing
challenge for many cities

00:01:30.362 --> 00:01:31.694
throughout our country.

00:01:32.174 --> 00:01:35.780
Our homeless population falls
into three major categories:

00:01:35.804 --> 00:01:37.947
those that are temporarily homeless,

00:01:37.971 --> 00:01:39.698
about 75 percent;

00:01:39.722 --> 00:01:41.603
those that are episodically homeless,

00:01:41.627 --> 00:01:43.185
about 10 percent;

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:45.255
and those that are chronically homeless,

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:46.771
about 15 percent.

00:01:47.653 --> 00:01:51.434
Chronic homelessness is defined
as an unaccompanied adult

00:01:51.458 --> 00:01:54.660
who has been continuously
homeless for a year or more

00:01:54.684 --> 00:01:57.574
or more than four times
homeless in three years

00:01:57.598 --> 00:01:59.801
that totals 365 days.

00:02:00.325 --> 00:02:03.896
This small 15 percent
of the homeless population

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.172
can consume 50 to 60 percent
of the homeless resources

00:02:08.196 --> 00:02:09.500
available in a community.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.711
In addition, they can cost the community

00:02:13.735 --> 00:02:17.881
20,000 to 45,000 dollars a year per person

00:02:17.905 --> 00:02:19.888
in emergency services costs,

00:02:20.554 --> 00:02:22.471
such as EMT runs,

00:02:22.495 --> 00:02:25.634
emergency room visits,
as many of you will be aware,

00:02:25.658 --> 00:02:28.671
addictions, interactions with the police,

00:02:28.695 --> 00:02:29.897
jail time.

00:02:30.551 --> 00:02:34.802
Simply put, this small
population costs a lot.

00:02:36.147 --> 00:02:40.615
Based on this reality, the US government
began an initiative in 2003

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:43.775
inviting states and cities and counties

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.822
to develop a plan to end
chronic homelessness

00:02:46.846 --> 00:02:48.225
in a 10-year period.

00:02:48.798 --> 00:02:50.964
The state of Utah accepted
this invitation,

00:02:50.988 --> 00:02:53.144
and I was asked to lead this effort.

00:02:54.485 --> 00:02:57.634
In 2005, we approved a 10-year plan,

00:02:57.658 --> 00:03:00.795
and 10 years later, in 2015,

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.885
we reported a reduction
in our chronic homeless population

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.399
of 91 percent statewide.

00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:12.938
(Applause)

00:03:12.962 --> 00:03:14.278
That's amazing.

00:03:15.437 --> 00:03:18.915
When I began this process,
and we began this process,

00:03:19.471 --> 00:03:24.112
I realized that I had a limited
understanding of homelessness

00:03:24.136 --> 00:03:26.376
and the factors that impacted it,

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.813
and that I needed a fairly major change
in my belief, in my thinking,

00:03:30.837 --> 00:03:34.653
because I had been raised
with the theory of rugged individualism

00:03:34.677 --> 00:03:36.767
and "pull yourself up by the bootstraps."

00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:39.977
That philosophy came from being raised
on our family's cattle ranch

00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:42.456
in a small town
in the western desert of Utah.

00:03:43.113 --> 00:03:46.660
On the ranch, you learned
that nothing takes priority

00:03:46.684 --> 00:03:48.179
over caring for the cattle,

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.880
something always needs fixing

00:03:50.904 --> 00:03:52.728
and most importantly,

00:03:52.752 --> 00:03:55.167
hard work makes the world right.

00:03:55.805 --> 00:03:58.618
It was through that lens
that I would see homeless people.

00:03:58.642 --> 00:04:01.661
When I was a teenager, our family
would go into Salt Lake City,

00:04:01.685 --> 00:04:05.145
and I would see these homeless people --
"hobos" we called them then --

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:06.575
sitting around on the street,

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:07.764
and I would think,

00:04:07.788 --> 00:04:12.037
"You lazy bums, get a job.
Pull yourself up by the bootstraps."

00:04:13.926 --> 00:04:15.976
After high school, I left the ranch,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.092
graduated from college,

00:04:18.116 --> 00:04:21.667
went to work for Ford Motor Company
for several years,

00:04:21.691 --> 00:04:24.991
then got a job at the Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints

00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:26.798
and moved back to Salt Lake City.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.609
During that employment,
I had the opportunity to be loaned out

00:04:30.633 --> 00:04:32.552
to the state's largest homeless shelter

00:04:32.576 --> 00:04:34.642
to assist them in developing and improving

00:04:34.666 --> 00:04:36.901
their financial
and management capabilities.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.855
While there, I became aware
of a new approach

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:44.066
to dealing with homeless individuals

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.342
and drug addicts.

00:04:46.486 --> 00:04:48.972
It was called the harm reduction model,

00:04:48.996 --> 00:04:52.609
and it consisted of passing out
clean needles and condoms.

00:04:52.633 --> 00:04:55.341
And I thought, "Now that
is one stupid idea."

00:04:55.365 --> 00:04:56.588
(Laughter)

00:04:56.612 --> 00:04:59.607
"That's just going to encourage them
to continue that behavior.

00:04:59.631 --> 00:05:01.282
Just tell them to stop."

00:05:03.323 --> 00:05:06.317
Several years later, I read
some of the early 10-year plans

00:05:06.341 --> 00:05:07.716
to end chronic homelessness

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.697
promoted by the federal government.

00:05:09.721 --> 00:05:12.029
As I read through those plans,
and I thought,

00:05:13.041 --> 00:05:14.696
"Pfft! This is unrealistic.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.247
You can't end homelessness.

00:05:16.271 --> 00:05:19.744
There's too many personal choices
and factors beyond our control."

00:05:21.724 --> 00:05:24.218
My perspective changed, however,

00:05:24.242 --> 00:05:27.189
when I attended a conference in 2003,

00:05:27.213 --> 00:05:31.602
where I learned the reason
behind the 10-year plan.

00:05:31.626 --> 00:05:35.775
First was this small population
of the homeless group

00:05:35.799 --> 00:05:38.565
that was 15 percent
and were very expensive.

00:05:39.216 --> 00:05:40.517
That made sense

00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:42.498
for a conservative state like Utah.

00:05:43.663 --> 00:05:47.040
The second insight was learning
about this Housing First,

00:05:47.064 --> 00:05:48.909
or low-barrier housing.

00:05:48.933 --> 00:05:51.062
There had been an agency in New York City

00:05:51.086 --> 00:05:54.272
that had been inviting
mentally ill homeless individuals

00:05:54.296 --> 00:05:57.582
to move directly
from the street into housing.

00:05:58.487 --> 00:06:02.712
And they were also allowed to continue
to use drugs and to drink,

00:06:02.736 --> 00:06:04.377
just like we can in our homes.

00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:09.125
They were, in addition, offered
services -- not required to use them --

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:10.552
by on-site case managers

00:06:10.576 --> 00:06:13.457
to assist them to adjust
to their new living arrangements

00:06:13.481 --> 00:06:15.620
and to stabilize their lives.

00:06:15.644 --> 00:06:17.941
They were using the harm reduction model.

00:06:19.322 --> 00:06:24.331
And despite my initial low expectations
about hearing about this model,

00:06:24.355 --> 00:06:26.725
they were having
an astonishing success rate:

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:31.356
85 percent were still housed
after 12 months.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.745
The third insight

00:06:33.434 --> 00:06:36.584
was the importance of developing
a trusting relationship.

00:06:37.239 --> 00:06:40.423
Because of the abuse
these individuals have had

00:06:40.447 --> 00:06:42.431
throughout most of their lives,

00:06:42.455 --> 00:06:44.483
they hardly trust anybody,

00:06:46.031 --> 00:06:50.114
and the clean needles and condoms
and low-barrier housing

00:06:50.138 --> 00:06:53.688
was a means to begin to develop
a relationship of trust.

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.473
Vital.

00:06:59.472 --> 00:07:01.730
So as I flew home from this conference,

00:07:03.048 --> 00:07:05.451
sitting in the plane
looking out the window,

00:07:06.121 --> 00:07:09.904
I realized that my understanding
and perspective about homelessness

00:07:09.928 --> 00:07:11.104
was shifting.

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:13.941
And as I stared out that window,

00:07:13.965 --> 00:07:16.804
this very strong feeling
and thought came to me

00:07:16.828 --> 00:07:18.777
that if there's any state in the union

00:07:18.801 --> 00:07:20.786
that could end chronic homelessness,

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.479
it was the state of Utah,

00:07:23.155 --> 00:07:25.957
because there's an underlying feeling

00:07:25.981 --> 00:07:30.787
and desire and willingness
to collaborate to serve our neighbors,

00:07:30.811 --> 00:07:32.852
including those who are homeless.

00:07:35.376 --> 00:07:39.652
A new vision was becoming clear to me
how this could be done.

00:07:41.214 --> 00:07:43.664
Now, those of us that attended
the conference said,

00:07:43.688 --> 00:07:45.589
"Yeah, these models will work in Utah."

00:07:45.613 --> 00:07:48.076
But when we got back home,
there were many who said,

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:51.232
"Nah, those aren't going to work.
They won't succeed here."

00:07:51.256 --> 00:07:54.306
But there was, however,
an affordable housing organization

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.177
who was willing to build
our first 100 units.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.763
But they had concerns about having
100 chronically homeless people

00:08:01.787 --> 00:08:03.570
in one location.

00:08:03.594 --> 00:08:06.716
To address that concern,
we decided to create a pilot

00:08:08.097 --> 00:08:11.565
to test that idea while we built
the first 100 units.

00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:15.311
We would use existing units
scattered throughout Salt Lake City.

00:08:16.523 --> 00:08:17.944
Then we debated:

00:08:17.968 --> 00:08:21.760
Should we select fairly
high-functioning homeless persons

00:08:21.784 --> 00:08:24.041
or the most challenging
ones we could find?

00:08:24.693 --> 00:08:27.673
And this is where my background
on the ranch came into play.

00:08:28.753 --> 00:08:31.226
Back then, my mother cooked our meals

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.318
and heated the water for our weekly bath

00:08:34.342 --> 00:08:36.671
on a wood-burning and coal-burning stove.

00:08:37.663 --> 00:08:40.746
And after chopping wood
for that stove all those years,

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.151
I'd learned to chop
the big end of the log first,

00:08:43.175 --> 00:08:44.716
when I had the most energy.

00:08:45.907 --> 00:08:49.656
We decided to use the "big end
of the log first" approach

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:53.027
and selected 17 of the most challenging,

00:08:53.051 --> 00:08:56.117
difficult, chronically homeless
people we could find,

00:08:56.903 --> 00:09:00.282
because we knew we would learn
the most from them.

00:09:01.438 --> 00:09:03.168
Twenty-two months later,

00:09:04.287 --> 00:09:06.362
all 17 were still housed,

00:09:09.148 --> 00:09:10.908
including Keta,

00:09:10.932 --> 00:09:13.591
who today, 11 years later,

00:09:13.615 --> 00:09:15.824
is sleeping in her own bed

00:09:15.848 --> 00:09:17.262
and is sober.

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.492
At the end of this pilot,
one of the young case managers said,

00:09:21.516 --> 00:09:23.812
"We used to debate
up at our university classes

00:09:23.836 --> 00:09:26.691
which theory of case management
was the most effective.

00:09:27.275 --> 00:09:29.649
Now our theory of case management is:

00:09:29.673 --> 00:09:32.673
anything necessary to keep them housed."

00:09:33.868 --> 00:09:35.689
We became believers,

00:09:35.713 --> 00:09:39.197
and built hundreds of units
over those next 10 years,

00:09:39.221 --> 00:09:43.295
leading to the reduction of our statewide
chronic homeless population

00:09:43.319 --> 00:09:44.676
of 91 percent.

00:09:45.445 --> 00:09:47.060
Now, who are homeless people?

00:09:48.116 --> 00:09:51.167
Many people just want them
to go away, to disappear,

00:09:51.191 --> 00:09:52.801
not disrupt our lives.

00:09:53.427 --> 00:09:56.668
Through this 10-year, 11-year process,
I gained many insights

00:09:56.692 --> 00:09:58.628
of why people become homeless.

00:09:59.247 --> 00:10:01.635
One of those insights
came to me a few years ago

00:10:01.659 --> 00:10:04.270
when I was visiting
with our medical outreach team.

00:10:04.294 --> 00:10:05.818
These are our frontline workers

00:10:05.842 --> 00:10:08.700
that go out and visit
the street homeless and the prostitutes

00:10:08.724 --> 00:10:11.693
to check on their medical health.

00:10:12.588 --> 00:10:14.160
One of the team members mentioned

00:10:14.184 --> 00:10:18.108
that eight of the prostitutes
had given birth to 31 children

00:10:18.132 --> 00:10:20.568
that had become wards of the state.

00:10:20.592 --> 00:10:23.524
They also shared that some of the pimps
were their husbands,

00:10:23.548 --> 00:10:24.742
and worse yet,

00:10:24.766 --> 00:10:26.190
their parents.

00:10:28.151 --> 00:10:29.940
These prostitutes,

00:10:29.964 --> 00:10:33.090
in their late teens, 20s, early 30s,

00:10:33.114 --> 00:10:36.629
were expected to earn
enough money a day to support

00:10:36.653 --> 00:10:38.834
a hundred-dollar-a-day heroin addiction,

00:10:38.858 --> 00:10:40.215
their living expenses

00:10:40.239 --> 00:10:41.623
and their pimp.

00:10:42.615 --> 00:10:45.474
And with unprotected sex,
they were paid more,

00:10:45.498 --> 00:10:48.078
and predictably,
this would lead to a pregnancy.

00:10:50.219 --> 00:10:55.163
Children born under these circumstances
many times end up becoming homeless.

00:10:55.763 --> 00:11:00.428
And it's not helpful to look at
those born under those circumstances,

00:11:00.452 --> 00:11:04.018
or a parent that makes their child
a drug addict at age seven,

00:11:04.042 --> 00:11:06.728
or a generation of babies
born through drug addiction,

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:09.630
and not feel some despair.

00:11:10.184 --> 00:11:14.763
For me, I believe
every person is of value,

00:11:15.379 --> 00:11:16.978
no matter who you are.

00:11:18.827 --> 00:11:22.881
And it's not helpful to look
at somebody with this start in life

00:11:22.905 --> 00:11:25.001
and blame them for where they are.

00:11:27.843 --> 00:11:32.657
(Applause)

00:11:33.666 --> 00:11:37.846
No one grows up saying,
"My goal in life is to become homeless."

00:11:39.798 --> 00:11:44.197
And that's the beauty of the harm
reduction and Housing First model.

00:11:44.877 --> 00:11:48.612
It recognizes the complexities
of the different factors

00:11:48.636 --> 00:11:50.546
that can shape a human life.

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:54.102
These models meet people where they are,

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:56.297
not where we are

00:11:56.807 --> 00:11:58.601
or where we think they should be.

00:12:00.891 --> 00:12:06.152
The pilot we did with our 17
taught us many lessons.

00:12:06.953 --> 00:12:09.753
When people have been living
on the street for many years,

00:12:09.777 --> 00:12:11.470
moving back into housing

00:12:12.218 --> 00:12:14.334
requires lots of things to learn.

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:16.842
And Donald

00:12:18.417 --> 00:12:21.044
taught us some
of these transition lessons.

00:12:21.068 --> 00:12:24.003
His case manager asked him
why he had not turned up the heat

00:12:24.027 --> 00:12:25.265
in his cold apartment.

00:12:25.986 --> 00:12:27.608
Donald said, "How do you do that?"

00:12:28.412 --> 00:12:30.485
He was shown how to use a thermostat.

00:12:31.694 --> 00:12:33.612
The case manager also observed

00:12:33.636 --> 00:12:37.051
that he was heating the beans
in the can on the stove,

00:12:37.075 --> 00:12:39.576
like he had done over
the campfires for many years.

00:12:40.902 --> 00:12:42.917
He was shown how to use pots and pans.

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:47.413
We also learned that he had a sister
that he had not seen in 25 years,

00:12:47.437 --> 00:12:48.873
who thought he was dead.

00:12:49.643 --> 00:12:51.510
She was happy to learn otherwise,

00:12:51.534 --> 00:12:53.129
and they were soon reconnected.

00:12:53.833 --> 00:12:58.071
Hundreds of people like Keta
and Donald are now housed

00:12:58.095 --> 00:13:00.171
and reconnecting with their families.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:03.236
Also, many of our
communities are incurring

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.506
fewer emergency services costs.

00:13:06.919 --> 00:13:09.709
I have learned over and over again

00:13:10.395 --> 00:13:13.771
that when you listen to somebody's story
with an open heart,

00:13:14.466 --> 00:13:16.683
walk in their shoes with them,

00:13:16.707 --> 00:13:19.594
you can't help but love and care for them

00:13:20.721 --> 00:13:22.135
and want to serve them.

00:13:24.595 --> 00:13:27.229
This is why I'm committed

00:13:27.253 --> 00:13:32.727
to continuing to bring hope and support
to our homeless citizens,

00:13:32.751 --> 00:13:36.711
who I consider to be
my brothers and sisters.

00:13:36.735 --> 00:13:37.891
Thank you.

00:13:37.915 --> 00:13:43.553
(Applause)
