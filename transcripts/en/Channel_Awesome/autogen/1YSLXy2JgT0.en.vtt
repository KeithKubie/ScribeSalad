00:15:29.699 --> 00:15:29.709
it's completely different and that's
 

00:15:29.709 --> 00:15:34.710
it's completely different and that's
pretty difficult to do I mean it's easy

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:34.720

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:36.940
you're I would imagine to come up with
 

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:41.100
you're I would imagine to come up with
different sounding voices which I'm not

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:41.110

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:48.569
would imagine you can do a low voice and
you can do a high voice and you can do a

00:15:48.569 --> 00:15:48.579
you can do a high voice and you can do a
 

00:15:48.579 --> 00:15:50.040
you can do a high voice and you can do a
little girl's voice and that's kind of

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:50.050
little girl's voice and that's kind of
 

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:53.370
little girl's voice and that's kind of
cool but to do the same voice but still

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:53.380
cool but to do the same voice but still
 

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:55.170
cool but to do the same voice but still

if you will and then the Ice King which

00:16:10.019 --> 00:16:10.029
if you will and then the Ice King which
 

00:16:10.029 --> 00:16:12.480
if you will and then the Ice King which
is a bit more crazy and kooky non-human

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:12.490
is a bit more crazy and kooky non-human
 

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:15.180
is a bit more crazy and kooky non-human
sounding to the exact same but at the

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:15.190
sounding to the exact same but at the
 

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:17.220
sounding to the exact same but at the
same time they're completely different

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:17.230
same time they're completely different
 

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:19.380
same time they're completely different
opposite ends of the spectrum and he

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:19.390
opposite ends of the spectrum and he
 

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:21.420
opposite ends of the spectrum and he
pulls it off so well that I think if you

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:21.430
pulls it off so well that I think if you
 

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:24.300
pulls it off so well that I think if you
looked away and he came up and he was

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:24.310
looked away and he came up and he was
 

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:27.300
looked away and he came up and he was
doing like each voice switching off kind

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:27.310
doing like each voice switching off kind
 

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:29.160
doing like each voice switching off kind
of jumping around you probably would it

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:29.170
of jumping around you probably would it
 

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:31.350
of jumping around you probably would it
be like oh that's Simon oh that Simon

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:31.360
be like oh that's Simon oh that Simon
 

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.310
be like oh that's Simon oh that Simon
again Ice King you know I think he it's

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:34.320
again Ice King you know I think he it's
 

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:38.310
again Ice King you know I think he it's
that different and that's well done that

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:38.320
that different and that's well done that
 

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.690
that different and that's well done that
you'd be able to pick it up that easily

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:39.700
you'd be able to pick it up that easily
 

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:42.690
you'd be able to pick it up that easily
well and it's very much like even with

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:42.700
well and it's very much like even with
 

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.190
well and it's very much like even with
ice King's voice and ice King's voice

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:44.200
ice King's voice and ice King's voice
 

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.240
ice King's voice and ice King's voice
you know it's not there you know where

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:45.250
you know it's not there you know where
 

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:47.340
you know it's not there you know where
that top voice but like I said it's I

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:47.350
that top voice but like I said it's I
 

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:49.199
that top voice but like I said it's I
think that makes it in some ways even

00:16:49.199 --> 00:16:49.209
think that makes it in some ways even
 

00:16:49.209 --> 00:16:51.150
think that makes it in some ways even
trickier to make a connection because it

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:51.160
trickier to make a connection because it
 

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.000
trickier to make a connection because it
is so over-the-top and so goofy but like

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:54.010
is so over-the-top and so goofy but like
 

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:57.329
is so over-the-top and so goofy but like
