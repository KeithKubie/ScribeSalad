twist out just nothing popped out at me
 

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:00.639
twist out just nothing popped out at me
at all so it's not a film I think is

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:00.649
at all so it's not a film I think is
 

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:02.559
at all so it's not a film I think is
like terrible because this is getting

00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:02.569
like terrible because this is getting
 

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:05.139
like terrible because this is getting
really panned by critics I don't think

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:05.149
really panned by critics I don't think
 

00:07:05.149 --> 00:07:07.479
really panned by critics I don't think
it's necessarily worth that I also agree

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:07.489
it's necessarily worth that I also agree
 

00:07:07.489 --> 00:07:08.769
it's necessarily worth that I also agree
I don't think it's that bad either but

00:07:08.769 --> 00:07:08.779
I don't think it's that bad either but
 

00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:10.809
I don't think it's that bad either but
but it's just there's nothing that

00:07:10.809 --> 00:07:10.819
but it's just there's nothing that
 

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:12.850
but it's just there's nothing that
interesting about it yeah I think that

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:12.860
interesting about it yeah I think that
 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.619
interesting about it yeah I think that
really is what boils down to it for me

00:07:14.619 --> 00:07:14.629
really is what boils down to it for me
 

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:16.479
really is what boils down to it for me
it's a film that could have been really

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:16.489
it's a film that could have been really
 

00:07:16.489 --> 00:07:19.059
it's a film that could have been really
cool and has some investing scenes and

00:07:19.059 --> 00:07:19.069
cool and has some investing scenes and
 

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:21.159
cool and has some investing scenes and
has some investing character moments and

00:07:21.159 --> 00:07:21.169
has some investing character moments and
 

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:24.159
has some investing character moments and
it does have a slight moral twist in

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:24.169
it does have a slight moral twist in
 

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:26.619
it does have a slight moral twist in
there about their romance and it gives

00:07:26.619 --> 00:07:26.629
there about their romance and it gives
 

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:29.109
there about their romance and it gives
you sort of a what-if scenario where

00:07:29.109 --> 00:07:29.119
you sort of a what-if scenario where
 

00:07:29.119 --> 00:07:30.609
you sort of a what-if scenario where
you're like man what if I was in this

00:07:30.609 --> 00:07:30.619
you're like man what if I was in this
 

00:07:30.619 --> 00:07:32.649
you're like man what if I was in this
scenario and it makes you ask those

00:07:32.649 --> 00:07:32.659
scenario and it makes you ask those
 

00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:34.119
scenario and it makes you ask those
questions but then it doesn't really

00:07:34.119 --> 00:07:34.129
questions but then it doesn't really
 

00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:37.329
questions but then it doesn't really
have the guts to really push it farther

00:07:37.329 --> 00:07:37.339
have the guts to really push it farther
 

00:07:37.339 --> 00:07:39.459
have the guts to really push it farther
and so in the long run I'm not really

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:39.469
and so in the long run I'm not really
 

00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:40.359
and so in the long run I'm not really
