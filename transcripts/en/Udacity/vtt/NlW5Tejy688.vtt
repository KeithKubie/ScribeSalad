00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.783
We've simplified terms by combining
factors within them, and we've combined

00:00:03.783 --> 00:00:08.984
like terms. So, let's try to do both of
those things at the same time. Here, we

00:00:08.984 --> 00:00:16.332
have a very long expression, 15x squared
plus 3x to the 7th minus 7x times 2x minus

00:00:16.332 --> 00:00:22.473
4 times 2x minus 5 times 4 plus x times 3.
That took a really long time to write and

00:00:22.485 --> 00:00:26.859
a really long time to say. So it would be
awesome if we could simplify this. That is

00:00:26.871 --> 00:00:31.096
what I would like you to try to do. Now if
this looks daunting, no big deal, just

00:00:31.108 --> 00:00:35.548
give it a try. You have absolutely nothing
to lose. Writing your work on paper first

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.144
will definitely help you. Also, remember
to try to simplify within each term first,

00:00:40.238 --> 00:00:44.976
and then once you've done that, to
identify what the like terms are in this

00:00:44.976 --> 00:00:48.053
expression, then you can work on combining
them together. Good luck.
