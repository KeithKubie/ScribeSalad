00:00:00.371 --> 00:00:02.798
- Andrei has a glass tank.

00:00:02.798 --> 00:00:04.845
First, he wants to put some marbles in it,

00:00:04.845 --> 00:00:06.389
all of the same volume.

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:08.224
Then, he wants to fill the tank with water

00:00:08.224 --> 00:00:10.267
until it's completely full.

00:00:10.267 --> 00:00:12.322
This is the formula
for the volume of water

00:00:12.322 --> 00:00:16.002
Andrei should use W, measured
in liters, as a function

00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:18.683
of the number of marbles used n.

00:00:18.683 --> 00:00:21.142
And we see that the amount
of water he needs to put in

00:00:21.142 --> 00:00:24.047
as a function of the marbles used, n,

00:00:24.047 --> 00:00:28.996
is equal to 32 minus 0.05n.

00:00:29.406 --> 00:00:30.881
That's interesting.

00:00:30.881 --> 00:00:32.197
Complete the following sentences

00:00:32.197 --> 00:00:33.957
with the appropriate missing values.

00:00:33.957 --> 00:00:36.538
The glass tank's volume is blank liters.

00:00:36.538 --> 00:00:40.114
The volume of each marble is blank liters.

00:00:40.114 --> 00:00:41.716
So, one thing that we could do

00:00:41.716 --> 00:00:43.875
to think about the glass tank's volume is,

00:00:43.875 --> 00:00:45.886
is well, let's use this
function to figure out

00:00:45.886 --> 00:00:50.179
how much water would we need
if we had no marbles in it,

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:52.141
because that amount of
water would be the volume

00:00:52.141 --> 00:00:53.207
of the entire tank.

00:00:53.207 --> 00:00:55.765
Remember, we're gonna fill
up the entire tank with water

00:00:55.765 --> 00:00:58.203
based on how many marbles are
in it, but if we figure out

00:00:58.203 --> 00:01:03.160
what W of zero is, this is
the amount of water we need

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.171
if we had no marbles.

00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:07.479
This would be the volume
of the entire tank

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:08.896
and what is this going to be?

00:01:08.896 --> 00:01:13.040
Well W of zero, when n is equal
to zero, this term goes away

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.176
and we're left with 32.

00:01:15.176 --> 00:01:19.773
So, W of zero would be
volume of entire tank.

00:01:19.773 --> 00:01:24.741
Volume of tank, which
is equal to 32 liters

00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:30.426
and so, we could write
32 right over there.

00:01:30.426 --> 00:01:33.003
And then they ask us,
the volume of each marble

00:01:33.003 --> 00:01:34.617
is blank liters.

00:01:34.617 --> 00:01:37.558
Well, what's going on here
in this function definition?

00:01:37.558 --> 00:01:40.086
So, the highest that this could be is 32,

00:01:40.086 --> 00:01:42.245
'cause that's the most
water you would put in.

00:01:42.245 --> 00:01:44.822
If you had no marbles, you
would just fill up the tank

00:01:44.822 --> 00:01:46.691
and put in 32 liters.

00:01:46.691 --> 00:01:48.938
Then, every marble that you put in,

00:01:48.938 --> 00:01:53.922
you're going to have to
put in 0.05 less liters.

00:01:53.922 --> 00:01:58.001
You see that, you have minus 0.05 times n.

00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:00.854
So, every time n grows by one,

00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:04.831
you have to put in 0.05 less

00:02:04.831 --> 00:02:06.776
fewer liters of water,

00:02:06.776 --> 00:02:11.424
which implies that the
marble is 0.05 liters.

00:02:11.424 --> 00:02:16.424
That's it's volume, so let's
write that down, 0.05 liters.

00:02:17.946 --> 00:02:19.318
And, you could test this assumption.

00:02:19.318 --> 00:02:21.837
If you said, look, if you had one marble,

00:02:21.837 --> 00:02:23.995
if you had one marble, then you would have

00:02:23.995 --> 00:02:27.815
to put 0.05 less than 32 liters in

00:02:27.815 --> 00:02:29.138
and why would that be the case?

00:02:29.138 --> 00:02:32.725
Well, that would mean because
that one marble is taking up

00:02:32.725 --> 00:02:37.375
0.05 liters, that's how
much space it's taking up.
