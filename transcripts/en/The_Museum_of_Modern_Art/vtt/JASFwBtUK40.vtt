00:00:02.336 --> 00:00:06.215
When we see Queens
and Long Island City from above,

00:00:06.381 --> 00:00:08.593
we don't see a big part of it.

00:00:09.718 --> 00:00:10.886
It’s pipes.

00:00:11.095 --> 00:00:13.515
Pipes are something
that we tend to hide.

00:00:14.223 --> 00:00:17.235
Therefore, it becomes
kind of the realm of experts,

00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:19.728
and something
that is never criticized,

00:00:19.895 --> 00:00:22.940
understood
or even discussed by people.

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:27.111
At this moment
that we are defining and re-defining

00:00:27.278 --> 00:00:30.656
the way we relate to water,
in a scenario of water scarcity,

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.285
there’s a great opportunity
to re-think infrastructures

00:00:34.618 --> 00:00:37.080
to transform
the way we relate to water.

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:44.086
We found, through our research,

00:00:44.253 --> 00:00:47.256
that there were people out there
testing new ways of treating water,

00:00:47.465 --> 00:00:50.593
and didn't rely
on methods like chemicals

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:54.613
and energy intensive processes
like heating the water

00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:58.141
or using mechanical
UV filtration.

00:00:58.768 --> 00:01:01.145
So we decided
to incorporate plants into the system

00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:04.356
as a means of purifying
the water in a sustainable way.

00:01:07.151 --> 00:01:09.486
Plants are really part
of architecture,

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.030
like humans are.

00:01:11.196 --> 00:01:14.575
They are basically performing
many of the things that we need

00:01:14.825 --> 00:01:17.828
to create an environment
in which we feel comfortable,

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:21.415
and we are thinking
that architecture

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:25.336
can do a lot by redefining
the way it relates with nature.

00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:27.380
Look at this one.

00:01:28.798 --> 00:01:30.133
Can you lift it higher?

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.138
I can. The higher I lift it,
the faster the explanation goes.

00:01:35.513 --> 00:01:36.806
That’s good?

00:01:37.765 --> 00:01:40.310
So basically, this is the hose

00:01:40.476 --> 00:01:43.020
that’s being used
in the upper part of Cosmo.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.040
On a very basic level,
it’s an ad hoc assemblage of parts

00:01:49.193 --> 00:01:51.955
that all are able
to host and provide

00:01:52.121 --> 00:01:54.823
a place for different
ecosystems to exist.

00:01:55.658 --> 00:01:58.033
This is a perspective
from the ground...

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.080
The water starts
in the system here at the base,

00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:02.711
and then it’s pumped up

00:02:02.873 --> 00:02:05.335
in the transparent hoses
all the way to the top,

00:02:05.543 --> 00:02:08.295
and then it comes down
by gravity to the algae bags,

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:11.131
the turf scrubber
and then back into the tank,

00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:16.261
and the hanging gardens are fed
by the purified water from the base.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.605
For a long time, people thought
that architecture

00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:27.398
was kind of neutral

00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:30.943
but when we look in detail,
architecture is never like that.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.486
Architecture is playing
key political roles.

00:02:34.238 --> 00:02:37.783
The way we design
locks or windows or doors,

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:40.536
all these material decisions
are decisions

00:02:40.703 --> 00:02:42.663
that are shaping society.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.961
To see the way
that space and technology...

00:02:49.128 --> 00:02:50.970
when they come together
through design

00:02:51.136 --> 00:02:52.256
they produce a curiosity

00:02:52.423 --> 00:02:54.466
for people
to want to come inside.
