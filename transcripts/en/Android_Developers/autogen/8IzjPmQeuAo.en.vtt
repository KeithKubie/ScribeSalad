you said maybe some of the developers or

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:41.970 align:start position:0%
like you you might be able to find a
 

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:43.340 align:start position:0%
like you you might be able to find a

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:43.350 align:start position:0%
niche by looking at some of them I think
 

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:44.690 align:start position:0%

so<00:20:43.500><c> I</c><00:20:43.529><c> think</c><00:20:43.799><c> that</c><00:20:43.919><c> if</c><00:20:44.009><c> I</c><00:20:44.100><c> was</c><00:20:44.279><c> going</c><00:20:44.610><c> to</c>

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:44.700 align:start position:0%

but then I think that ultimately there's
