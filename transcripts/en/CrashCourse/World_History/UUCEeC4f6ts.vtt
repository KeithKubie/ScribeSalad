00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.200
Hi I’m John Green, and this is Crash Course
World History and today we’re going to return

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.320
— sadly for the last time on Crash Course
— to China.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.780
By the way, Stan brought cupcakes. That’s
good. I wish I could draw some parallel between

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.860
this and China, but I got nothing. It’s
just delicious.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.700
I’ll sure miss you, piece of felt Danica
cut out in the shape of China using blue because

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.080
we felt red would be cliché.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.440
Mr. Green, Mr. Green, Mr Green!

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.160
You don’t get to talk until you shave the
mustache, Me From The Past.

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.159
So the 20th century was pretty big for China
because it saw not one but two revolutions.

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:32.220
China’s 1911 revolution might be a bigger
deal from a world historical perspective than

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.100
the more famous communist revolution of 1949,
but you wouldn’t know it because:

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.760
1. China’s communism became a really big
deal during the Cold War, and

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.120
2. Mao Zedong, the father of Communist China,
was really good at self-promotion. Like, you

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.980
know his famous book of sayings? Pretty
much everyone in China just had to own it.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.640
And I mean, had to.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:59.500
[theme music]

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.980
So as you no doubt recall from past episodes
of Crash Course, China lost the Opium Wars

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.240
in the 19th century, resulting in European
domination, spheres of influence, et cetera,

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.960
all of which was deeply embarrassing to the
Qing dynasty and led to calls for reform.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.229
One strand of reform that called for China
to adopt European military technology and

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.380
education systems was called self-strengthening,
and it was probably would have been a great

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.979
idea, considering how well that worked for
Japan. But it never happened in China-- well,

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:23.609
at least not until recently.

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:28.149
Instead, China experienced the disastrous
anti-Western Boxer Rebellion of 1900, which

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.789
helped spur some young liberals, including
one named Sun Yat Sen, to plot the overthrow

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:35.429
of the dynasty. Oh, it’s already time for
the Open Letter…

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.000
An open letter to Sun Yat Sen.

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.740
Oh, but first, let’s see what’s in the
secret compartment today.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.969
Oh, more champagne poppers? Stan, at this
point aren’t we sort of belaboring the fact

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:54.779
that China invented fireworks? Wow! That is
innovation at work right there. We used to

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:58.929
not be able to fire off one of these, and
now we can fire off six at a time if you count

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:00.749
the two secret ones from behind me.

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:04.319
Dear Sun Yat Sen, You were amazing! I mean
the Republic of China calls you the father

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.330
of the nation. The People’s Republic of
China calls you the forerunner of the democratic

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.470
revolution. You’re the only thing they can
agree on! You lived in China, Japan, the United

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.470
States, you converted to Christianity, you
were a doctor, you were the godfather of an

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.060
important science fiction writer.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.220
But the infuriating thing is that you never
actually got much of a chance to rule China,

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.570
and you would have been great at it. I mean,
your three principles of the people, Nationalism,

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.560
Democracy, and the People’s Livelihood,
are three really great principles. I mean

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.140
the problem, aside from you not living long
enough is that you just didn’t have a face

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.650
for Warhol portraits. Huh, it’s too bad.
Best wishes, John Green

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.770
So the 1911 revolution that led to the end
of the Qing dynasty started when a bomb accidentally

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.030
exploded, at which point the revolutionaries
were like, “we’re probably going to be

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.410
outed, so we should just start the uprising
now”. The uprising probably would’ve been

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.070
quelled like many before it, except this time
the army joined the rebellion, because they

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.570
wanted to become more modern.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.590
The Qing emperor abdicated, and the rebels
chose a general, Yuan Shikai, as leader, while

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.950
Sun Yat Sen was declared president of a provisional
republic on Jan 1, 1912. A new government

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.420
was created with a Senate and a Lower House,
and it was supposed to write a new constitution.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.430
And after the first elections, Sun Yat Sen’s
party, the Guomindang were the largest, but

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.910
they weren’t the majority. So Sun Yat Sen
deferred to Yuan, which turned out to be a

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.260
huge mistake because he then outlawed the
Guomindang party and ruled as dictator.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.440
But when Yuan Shikai died in 1916, China’s
first non-dynastic government in over 3000

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.400
years completely fell apart. Localism reasserted
itself with large-scale landlords with small-scale

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.230
armies ruling all the parts of China that
weren’t controlled by foreigners. You might

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.270
remember this phenomenon from earlier in Chinese
history, first during the Warring States period

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.630
and then again for three hundred years between
the end of the Han and the rise of the Sui.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.850
So the period in Chinese history between 1912
and 1949 is sometimes called the Chinese Republic,

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.180
although that gives the government a bit too
much credit. The leading group trying to re-form

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.040
China into a nation state was the Guomindang,
but after 1920 the Chinese Communist Party

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.650
was also in the mix. And for the Guomindang
to regain power from those big landlords and

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.330
reunify China, they needed some help from
the CCP.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.260
Now if an alliance between Communists and
Nationalists sounds like a match made in hell,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.260
well, yes. It was. That said, the two did
manage to patch things up for a while in the

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.460
early 1920s, you know, for the sake of the
kids.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.720
But then Sun Yat Sen died in 1925 and the
alliance fell apart in 1927 when Guomindang

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.310
leader Chiang Kai-Shek got mad at the communists
for trying to foment socialist revolution,

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.360
to which the communists were like, “But
that’s what we do, man. We’re communists.”

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.880
Anyway, this turned out to be a bad break
up for a bunch of reasons, but mainly because

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.240
it started a civil war between the Communists
and the Nationalists. We’re not going to

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.440
get into exhausting detail on the civil war
but, spoiler alert: the Communists won. But

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.590
there are a few things to point out.

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.900
First, even though Mao emerged victorious,
he and the communists were almost wiped out

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.470
in 1934 except that they made a miraculous
and harrowing escape, trekking from southern

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.200
China to the mountains in the north in what
has become famously known as the Long March,

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.910
a great example of historians missing an opportunity
since it could easily have been called the

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.510
Long Ass March, as it featured donkeys.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.770
Second, for much of the time the Kuomintang
was trying to crush the CCP, significant portions

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.500
of China were being occupied and/or invaded
by Japan.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.220
Thirdly, the Communists were just better at
fighting the Japanese than the Nationalists

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.630
were. In spite of the fact that Chiang Kai-Shek
had extensive support from the U.S. And each

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.500
time the Nationalists failed against the Japanese,
their prestige among their fellow Chinese

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.490
diminished. It wasn’t helped by Nationalist
corruption, or their collecting onerous taxes

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.660
from Chinese peasants, or stories about Nationalist
troops putting on civilian clothes and abandoning

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:34.060
the city of Nanking during its awful destruction
by the Japanese army in 1937. Meanwhile, the

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.990
Communists were winning over the peasants
in their northwestern enclave by making sure

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.430
that troops didn’t pillage local land and by
giving peasants a greater say in local government.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.000
Now, that isn’t to say everything was rosy
under Mao’s communist leadership, even at

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.770
its earliest stages. By the way, that is an
actual chalk illustration. Very impressed.

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.169
In a preview of things to come, in 1942 Mao
initiated a “rectification” program, which

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:58.580
basically meant students and intellectuals
were sent down into the countryside to give

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.389
them a taste of what “real China” was
like in an effort to re-educate them. We try

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:07.480
to be politically neutral here on Crash Course, but we
are always opposed to intellectuals doing hard labor.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.040
But anyway, within four years of the end of
World War II the Communists routed Chiang

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.389
Kai-Shek’s armies and sent them off to Taiwan,
and these military victories paved the way

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:19.150
for Mao to declare the People’s Republic
of China on October 1, 1949.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.120
So once in power, Mao and the PRC were faced
with the task of creating a new, socialist

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.530
state. And Mao declared early on that the
working class in China would be the leaders

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.480
of a “people’s democratic dictatorship.”
Oh democratic dictatorships. You’re the

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.610
BEST. It’s all the best parts of democracy,
and all the best parts of dictatorship. You

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.270
get to vote, but there’s only one choice.
It takes all the pesky thinking out it.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:45.510
The PRC promised equal rights for women, rent
reduction, land redistribution, new heavy

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:51.560
industry and lots of freedoms, including freedoms
of “thought, speech, publication, assembly,

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.800
association, correspondence, person, domicile,
moving from one place to another, religious

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.580
belief, and the freedom to hold processions
and demonstrations.” Yeah, NO. Even putting

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.360
aside the PRC’s failure to protect any of
those rights, Mao’s China wasn’t much

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.680
fun if you were a landlord or even if you
were a peasant who’d done well. Land redistribution

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.479
and reform meant destroying the power of landlords,
often violently.

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:16.900
But centralizing power and checking individual
ambition proved difficult for the government,

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:21.110
and it was made harder by China’s involvement
in the Korean War, which helped spur the first

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:25.330
mass campaign of Mao’s democratic dictatorship.
Designed to encourage support for the War,

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.729
the campaign was called the “Resist America
and Aid Korea campaign,” and it resulted

00:07:29.729 --> 00:07:32.080
in almost all foreigners leaving China.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:36.800
A second campaign, against “counterrevolutionaries”
was much worse. People suspected of sympathizing

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.320
with the Guomindang, or anyone insufficiently
communist, was subject to humiliation and

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:49.139
violence. Between October 1950 and August
1951, 28,332 people accused of being spies

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:52.900
or counterrevolutionaries were executed in
Guandong city alone.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:57.080
A third mass campaign, the “Three Anti Campaign”
was aimed at reforming the Communist party

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.990
itself. And the final mass campaign, the Five
Anti Campaign was an assault on all bourgeois

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:05.949
capitalism, which effectively killed private
industry in China. Very few of the victims

00:08:05.949 --> 00:08:10.440
of this last campaign actually died, but capitalism
was weakened and state control bolstered.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.780
OK, let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:15.759
Mao and the CCP set out to turn China into
an industrial powerhouse by following the

00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:19.280
Soviet model. We haven’t really talked about
this, but under the Soviet system, Russia

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:24.150
was able to accomplish massive industrialization--
not to mention tens of millions of deaths

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:28.620
from starvation-- through centralized planning
and collectivization of agriculture, following

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.140
what were known as Five Year Plans.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:35.720
The Chinese adopted the model of Five Year
Plans beginning in 1953 and the first one

00:08:35.729 --> 00:08:39.240
worked, at least as far as industrialization
was concerned. In fact, the plan worked even

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:44.500
better than expected, with industry increasing
121% more than projected. In order for this

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:49.300
to work though, the peasants had to grow lots
of grain and sell it at extremely low prices.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:53.350
This kept inflation in check, and saving was
encouraged by the fact that the Five Year

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:57.670
Plan didn’t have many consumer goods, so
there was nothing to buy. For urban workers,

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:01.830
living standards improved and China’s population
grew to 646 million.

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:05.160
So far, Mao’s plan seemed to be working,
but there was no way that China could keep

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:10.640
up that growth, especially without some backsliding
into capitalism. So Mao came up with a terrible

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.920
idea called the Great Leap Forward. Mao essentially
decided that the nation could be psyched up

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.899
into more industrial productivity.

00:09:16.899 --> 00:09:21.010
Among many other bad ideas, he famously ordered
that individuals build small steel furnaces

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:26.200
in their backyard to increase steel production.
This was not a good idea. First off, it didn’t

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:30.200
actually increase steel production much. Secondly,
it turns out that people making steel in their

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.100
backyard who know nothing about making steel…
make bad steel.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:38.790
But the worst idea was to pay for heavy machinery
from the USSR with exported grain. This meant

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:45.240
there was less for peasants to eat — and
as a result, between 1959 and 1962, 20 million

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:50.440
people died, probably half of whom were under
the age of 10. Jeez, Thought Bubble, that was sad.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:54.020
And then in happier news came the Cultural
Revolution! Just kidding, it sucked. By the

00:09:54.029 --> 00:09:57.430
middle of the sixties, Mao was afraid that
China’s revolution was running out of steam,

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:01.649
and he didn’t want China to end up just
a bureaucratized police state like, you know,

00:10:01.649 --> 00:10:05.330
most of the Soviet bloc. And the Cultural
Revolution was an attempt to capture the glory

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:10.950
days of the revolution and fire up the masses, and
what better way to do that than to empower the kids.

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:15.380
Frustrated students who were unable find decent,
fulfilling jobs jumped at the chance to denounce

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:19.910
their teachers, employers, and sometimes even
their parents and to tear down tradition,

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:23.660
which often meant demolishing buildings and
art. The ranks of these “Red Guards” swelled

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:29.110
and anyone representing the so-called “four
olds” — old culture, old habits, old ideas,

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:33.300
and old customs — was subject to humiliation
and violence. Intellectuals were again sent

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:37.890
to the countryside as they were in 1942; millions
were persecuted; and countless historical

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:39.920
and religious artifacts were destroyed.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.980
But the real aim of the Cultural Revolution
was to consolidate Mao’s revolution, and

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:48.870
while his image still looms large, it’s
hard to say that China these days is a socialist

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:52.640
state. Many would argue that Mao’s revolution
was extremely short-lived, and that the real

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:57.350
change in China happened in 1911. That’s
when the Chinese Republic ended 3,000 years

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:02.149
of dynastic history and forever broke the
cyclical pattern the Chinese had used to understand

00:11:02.149 --> 00:11:07.400
their past. I mean at least in some senses, those
Nationalist revolutionaries literally put an end to history.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:12.380
That sense of living in a truly New World
has made many great and terrible things possible

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:17.000
for China, but the legacy of China’s two
revolutions is mixed at best. China, for instance,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.339
made most of the camera we use to film this
video. And China made most of the computers

00:11:21.339 --> 00:11:25.430
we use to edit. But no one in the People’s
Republic of China will legally be able to

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:30.680
watch this video, because the government blocks
YouTube. Thanks for watching. I’ll see you next week.

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:34.959
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller. Our script supervisor is Meredith

00:11:34.959 --> 00:11:38.730
Danko. Our associate producer is Danica Johnson.
The show is written by my high school history

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.690
teacher Raoul Meyer and myself, and our graphics
team is Thought Bubble.

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:44.520
Last week’s phrase of the week was "Disco
Golf Ball." If you want to guess at this week’s

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.730
phrase of the week or suggest future ones,
you can do so in comments, where you can also

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:51.029
ask questions about today's videos that will
be answered by our team of historians. If

00:11:51.029 --> 00:11:53.070
you like Crash Course, make sure you’ve
subscribed.

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:56.550
Thanks for watching, and as we say in my hometown,
Don’t Forget To Be Awesome.
