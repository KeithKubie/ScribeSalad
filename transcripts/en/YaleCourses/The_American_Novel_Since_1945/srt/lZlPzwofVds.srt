1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:01,663
All right.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,680
So today we're going to talk about
everything is illuminated and Eli has

3
00:00:06,811 --> 00:00:11,520
actually agreed to stand next to me
for the whole lecture and translate my

4
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:15,570
lecture into Ukrainian
dialect. Thank you, Eli.

5
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:16,710
I'll call you up in a minute

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,620
for anyone visiting the class today,

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,540
what we are doing is talking
about a Jonathan Safran fours.

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,010
Everything is illuminated.

9
00:00:29,011 --> 00:00:33,480
This book was chosen by the class
as the last book of the syllabus.

10
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,260
And Eli here gave a wonderful
presentation, a reading
from it in a very, uh,

11
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,470
funny Ukrainian accent. Um, and I
think that's why everybody chosen. Um,

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,600
God knows if there would be another
reason. No, just kidding. Um,

13
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,230
now when you meet a new novel,

14
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,260
when you meet a new novel, uh, there
are various things you need to do, uh,

15
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,590
after you've decided whether
you like it or not. If that is,

16
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:12,591
if you're either a professor in an English
class having to teach it or you are a

17
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:17,510
student having to talk about it or
write about it in your papers. Uh,

18
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,550
beyond that,
even beyond vocational necessity,

19
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,240
there is the desire.
Uh,

20
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,250
I hope that many people have to understand
how new work fits into the body of

21
00:01:29,251 --> 00:01:31,740
existing literature.
And especially,

22
00:01:31,741 --> 00:01:36,741
I think that's the case when an author
is as openly ambitious as Jonathan Safran

23
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:39,960
Foer is.

24
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,950
It is very clear the minute you open
this up and you start reading a,

25
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:49,980
that four is aiming at a conversation
with literature that has proceeded him.

26
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:56,250
Uh, it's also clear from
his interviews and, uh,

27
00:01:56,251 --> 00:02:01,140
I was particularly struck by something
he said in an interview about his second

28
00:02:01,141 --> 00:02:06,090
novel, um, extremely loud and incredibly
close, which is about nine 11.

29
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,300
And I'll, I'll say a little bit more
about that novel, which I haven't read,

30
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:12,640
but I've read enough reviews of it,
uh, to know a few facts about it,

31
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,860
which I think are relevant to
this novel. Um, he said about it,

32
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,900
he was asked by an interviewer,
well,

33
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:23,100
doesn't it seem risky
to take on nine 11 as a,

34
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,020
as a subject? And he said, well,

35
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,440
what seems risky to me is not taking
on the important subjects of your time.

36
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,900
That seems like the risk for a writer.
And he says in another place,

37
00:02:36,901 --> 00:02:37,470
you know,

38
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:42,470
you have to justify the fact that you're
sitting alone in a room writing all

39
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:48,870
day. What you do has to
be somehow world changing.

40
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,600
So, uh, for a 20 something
year old writer, this is a,

41
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:59,560
a heavy task and I think you
can feel the heaviness of it in,

42
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,330
in the novel,
um,

43
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:06,000
partly in its formal ambition and
partly in the subjects that, uh,

44
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,930
it takes on. It doesn't take on nine 11,
uh, but it does take on the Holocaust.

45
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:15,931
So I will have a whole argument about
that aspect of the novel and how it fits

46
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:21,580
into literature of the post 45
period because, uh, lucky you,

47
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:24,750
I happen to have written
a book on this. Uh, I'm,

48
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,170
Vic came out in 2000 to three,
uh, about genocide and literature.

49
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:33,160
So this is actually perfect novel for
me to lecture on. Uh, in that respect,

50
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:38,560
when you first meet a novel of
this kind with these ambitions,

51
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,880
there are certain things that you do.
And for me,

52
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:47,881
those things include noticing just about
everything I possibly can about the

53
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:53,281
novel and then thinking about what
other things that I've read seem to be

54
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:58,560
speaking to it or it seems to
be speaking to those things. Um,

55
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,890
now I promised that I would not
conduct this entire lecture in Q and a,

56
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,730
but I did not promise that I wouldn't
ask any questions. So here goes, um,

57
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:10,780
what novels seem related to this
novel from our syllabus to you?

58
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,280
Well, you can see, you can go
outside our syllabus. That's okay.

59
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:19,810
Did you have another
idea? Yes. Yes. That's,

60
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,320
that's certainly in dialogue
with this novel. Yes.

61
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:28,090
And four talks about that as a novel
that really was important to him. Okay.

62
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:32,290
What else? What from our syllabus
seems to be related to this novel.

63
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:33,853
Okay.

64
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,020
You've never seen
anything like this before?

65
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,383
Yes.

66
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,610
Lolita. Why? What in Lily too.

67
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:50,050
Okay. Yes. Some of that
humor. Yes. What else?

68
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,350
What else from our syllabus? Yes. Also.
Oh, I was going to get shuffled on Lolita.

69
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,580
Yes, sure. Experiment. Did the 80 fine.

70
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,920
Speeding through the voice over
character. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.

71
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:07,900
Inhabiting a voice that seems very foreign
to the writer.

72
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,830
Yes.
What else?

73
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,790
Yes. All right. Okay.

74
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:17,280
Yes. And what was it about Barth
that you think for learned from,

75
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,240
I think I've writing about writing.
Yes.

76
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,410
Yeah, absolutely. Yup.
Definitely. What else?

77
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:30,853
Roth.

78
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:37,850
Did anyone not see Rothan
this novel. Okay. Um,

79
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:43,040
Roth is certainly here. Um,
pension is very strongly here.

80
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:48,100
If you think about the episodes in
crying of lot 49 with the paranoids,

81
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:53,930
those all those funny
jokes and their songs, uh,

82
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:58,990
far learned a lot from pension
and even more from pensions,

83
00:05:59,421 --> 00:06:03,200
other novels. Gravity's rainbow
I think particularly. Um,

84
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,460
then from crying flop 49,
which doesn't because of its leg,

85
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:10,880
doesn't quite go to the operatic
playful lengths that a pension,

86
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,090
longer pension novel can go to.
Um,

87
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,460
pigeon is also very interested
in the 18th century.

88
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,380
And so that interest is something
that for our shares in this novel,

89
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:23,803
um,

90
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,960
for is someone who learned a lot from
the group of writers that we would call

91
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,970
postmodernist and that I
would call late modernist. Um,

92
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:39,890
he learned to be very self conscious about
his language and to make that evident

93
00:06:39,891 --> 00:06:41,510
on the surface of the novel.

94
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:47,090
He also learned though from
Toni Morrison come on in.

95
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:52,010
He learned from Tony
Morrison in particular,

96
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:57,011
I think he learned the value
of time travel in an novel.

97
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:03,130
This was something that I brought up with
respect to Edward P. Jones as well. Um,

98
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:07,580
but it's certainly here and
there's one very, very clear,

99
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:08,743
um,

100
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,920
reference to two Morrison.

101
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:18,170
This is on page 51 when,
when they're talking, he's
talking about the name of the,

102
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,790
of the shuttle
and how it was,

103
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:27,440
how it was called. Now, uh, my,
my Ukrainian is not very premium,

104
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:31,880
so I will butcher this name.
Of course,

105
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:34,430
no one in some, uh, suffuse

106
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,510
called, it's called, it's a Fucca
until it had such a disagree,

107
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,790
uh, until it had such a
disagreeable official name,

108
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:47,230
no one felt the need to call it anything.
But now there was that,

109
00:07:47,231 --> 00:07:50,990
there was an offense that the shuttle
should be called that shitheads namesake.

110
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,460
The citizens had to,
had to a name not to go buy some,

111
00:07:55,461 --> 00:07:56,900
even called the Shtetl,

112
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:02,020
not see a sofa and would continue to do
a to even after the new name was chosen.

113
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,640
Um,

114
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,230
in Song of Solomon written in 1979,

115
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,450
I think,
um,

116
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,190
Toni Morrison has a street that's called
not doctor street because it was called,

117
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:21,570
uh, it was given an official name at
odds with what the black community, uh,

118
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:26,120
called it. Um, and so they call
it head called it doctor street.

119
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,420
The town Christen did something else,
I think main street or something.

120
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:32,480
And so then they called it
not doctor street. So this,

121
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:35,750
this little teeny piece is
lifted directly from Morrison.

122
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,750
You can see her footprints
on here in that sense.

123
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,630
Tony Morrison was of course a teacher,
uh,

124
00:08:41,631 --> 00:08:46,130
at Princeton when four was there.
I don't know if he took courses with her.

125
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,240
He certainly studied with
Joyce, Carol Oates. Um,

126
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,760
but Morrison was around and I'm
sure he has read that novel.

127
00:08:52,761 --> 00:08:55,620
It would be surprising
to me if he has not. Um,

128
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:01,500
so the other thing that he takes from
Morrison is that sense of collective

129
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:02,334
history,

130
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:07,850
that history is something passed down
in oral tradition in an intensely verbal

131
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,893
culture.

132
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:15,830
So the Jewish shtetl culture that far
imagines and the black community that

133
00:09:18,961 --> 00:09:22,560
Morrison imagines are both
intensely verbal cultures.

134
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:29,150
Now the Jewish community of forest novel
is also intensely literary in the sense

135
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:34,300
of literate. They write
everything down also. Um,

136
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:39,350
so that's a slight difference
between Morrison's vision and force.

137
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:47,870
I want to go into some detail about
what I think for has learned from Roth

138
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:51,840
because Roth is the person I see
most strongly behind his writing.

139
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:57,170
We didn't see the playful metaphysical
side of Roth very much in the human

140
00:09:57,871 --> 00:09:58,500
stain.

141
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,500
Roths work is straddling both sides of
that line between realism and very hyper

142
00:10:05,881 --> 00:10:10,230
metaphysics banality. So some of
his novels have alternate endings.

143
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:14,640
Um, he has several novels
that, uh, feature Philip Roth.

144
00:10:14,641 --> 00:10:19,200
So four takes the, um,
conceit of naming himself,

145
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,370
uh, in naming character after
himself directly from Roth.

146
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:29,060
So there are ways that he is
on the surface sighting Roth,

147
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:34,410
but there's a more profound way
that he's working in Ross terrain.

148
00:10:34,411 --> 00:10:36,450
And that is in the terrain of desire.

149
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,130
So thinking back to Roths,

150
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,100
first novel Portnoy's complaint,

151
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,830
which is all about masturbation,
Alex Portnoy's masturbation,

152
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:54,390
we see that he's taken the name
Alex, uh, Alexander Portnoy.

153
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,000
Alex appears in this novel as well.

154
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:02,390
And then we have saffron who
is this a sort of love machine.

155
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:07,140
So he is a double of,
um,

156
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,970
Alex Portnoy with a difference though.
So instead of masturbation,

157
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,520
it's sex with the needy,

158
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:19,410
essentially sex with the love
starved virgins, older women,

159
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,860
a widows,
et cetera.

160
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:28,400
So the immediate difference that four
is pointing to is the difference between

161
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,780
something like solipsism or narcissism,

162
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:40,250
desire as the fuel for that narcissism
versus desire as the fuel for community

163
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,510
and connection.

164
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,000
This is not without trouble though.

165
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:56,080
And it's the trouble that interests me.
And that I think he takes from Roth.

166
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:01,770
And that's the impossibility of ever
actually making that connection of it ever

167
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:07,830
finally coming home. And you see that, uh,

168
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,550
in the story of saffron,

169
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:15,050
just in the fact that by the time he
finally gets married and finally has a

170
00:12:16,061 --> 00:12:17,380
proper orgasm,

171
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:23,350
what he falls in love with as that
at that moment is not his wife,

172
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,130
but the baby that he is in
gendering in that moment.

173
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,490
And of course it's a baby, uh,
that is, doesn't even exist yet.

174
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:37,000
So the very absence at
the heart of desire,

175
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:42,060
the blankness or the impossibility is
demonstrated even in those moments of

176
00:12:43,331 --> 00:12:44,980
overwhelming connection.

177
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,423
Okay.

178
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:53,990
And I think it's telling that for imagined
sexual energy as light rather than

179
00:12:59,161 --> 00:13:02,490
some other kind of a phenomenon.

180
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,830
So everything is illuminated.
Remember,

181
00:13:04,831 --> 00:13:09,831
there's that image of the world
being lit up by people making love,

182
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,740
that it actually generates light
that you can see from space.

183
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,150
It's not a concrete in gendering act.

184
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:24,050
Even when it is,
it creates something else.

185
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:29,410
And that's something else seems
to be related to knowledge.

186
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:33,650
How can you know your past?

187
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,420
This is a problem in the novel and
it's a feature of the quest element.

188
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:42,380
And I'll say more about that in my
second lecture on the novel. Um,

189
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:47,590
but I think it has to do with a vague
understanding that is imagined to

190
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:54,350
illuminate the world
as a result of desires,

191
00:13:54,351 --> 00:13:57,740
fulfillment.
We're almost fulfillment.

192
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:04,390
But that theme of sex and desire is
abstracted into lots of other forms.

193
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:12,280
And the couple that I want to look at,
um,

194
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,680
one is a sort of religious,
this is on one 40.

195
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,510
Yeah.

196
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:23,510
Here we're learning about the
veneration of broads husband,

197
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:30,780
the Kulchar who is then
bronzed and made into a, uh,

198
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,480
a statue in the town after he dies.

199
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:37,630
I'm still with the saw blade
embedded in his head. Um,

200
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,510
and this is at the bottom of one 40.

201
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:42,940
Yeah.

202
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:47,940
Those who prayed came to believe less
and less in the god of their creation and

203
00:14:48,131 --> 00:14:53,090
more and more in their belief, the
unmarried kissed the dials, battered lips,

204
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,720
although they were not faithful
to their god, but to the kiss,

205
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:00,770
they were kissing themselves.
And when the bride knelt,

206
00:15:00,771 --> 00:15:03,980
it was not the God they believed in.
It was the Neal,

207
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:08,870
not the God's bronze knees,
but their own bruised ones.

208
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:14,860
This little moment of reflection on
religious ritual or quasi religious ritual

209
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,690
is related to some,
um,

210
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,550
things that I want to say about the
role of Judaism in my next lecture.

211
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,550
But as a practice,

212
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,250
it is a practice of negativity,

213
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:34,030
of acknowledging the impossibility
of connection to that God and the

214
00:15:34,521 --> 00:15:37,250
impossibility of
fulfillment from that God.

215
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,460
But nevertheless,

216
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:45,790
it is committed to the fulfillment of
the effort to make that connection.

217
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,310
So it's belief in belief.
And in fact,

218
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:56,870
the book that I'm writing right
now is all about belief and belief.

219
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:02,650
And so this confirms my sense that this
is an important way of imagining how

220
00:16:02,751 --> 00:16:05,660
belief works in the
current moment. Uh, you,

221
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,360
you believe in the act of belief.

222
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,440
So that's one kind of negativity.

223
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:15,560
Then there's a visual image
that we get over and over again,

224
00:16:15,561 --> 00:16:17,990
and that's of the whole,
the empty hole.

225
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,420
There are a couple of
examples here. Um, on one 35,

226
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:30,550
this is after broad and the Colker have
separated themselves with a wall because

227
00:16:30,921 --> 00:16:34,310
the coker keeps beating
her up. He's uh, uh,

228
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:38,480
deranged in part part saying
part d arranged by his,

229
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,680
a saw blade embedded in his head.
And so they have this whole,

230
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:46,880
between them, uh, through
which they can communicate.

231
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:50,480
But the wall protects
broad from his rages.

232
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:55,520
So he won't beat her up. They lived, this
is only 35. They lived with the whole,

233
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:00,410
the absence that defined,
it became a presence that defined them.

234
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:06,160
Life was a small negative space
cut out of the eternal solidity.

235
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,010
And for the first time it felt precious.

236
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,890
Not like all of the words
that had come to me,

237
00:17:12,891 --> 00:17:16,970
nothing but like the last
breath of a drowning victim.

238
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:20,330
So here were offered two
versions of negativity.

239
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:23,510
One is all the words that had come to me,
nothing.

240
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,920
And the other is this physical emptiness,
the hole.

241
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,650
So the words that mean nothing.

242
00:17:30,651 --> 00:17:35,651
Our an emptiness that ar is
a frustrating a blockage,

243
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:40,100
but the emptiness that is the space,

244
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:45,430
the visual space comes to be a space
of imagination that gets filled with

245
00:17:46,731 --> 00:17:47,564
imagination.

246
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:53,650
So they see each other from a distance
for the first time and are overwhelmed by

247
00:17:55,531 --> 00:17:58,200
the connection that can
then be formed between them.

248
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,260
So it's the very absence of the physical
presence ones, distance from it.

249
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,350
That becomes the
fulfillment for this couple.

250
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:09,643
Yeah.

251
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,553
So this,

252
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:15,120
I hope you can see the
structural similarity or the
logical similarity between

253
00:18:15,121 --> 00:18:18,330
believing in belief
and were told of broad.

254
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,900
Remember also on page 83

255
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:29,330
that she was constitutionally
unable to love anyone.

256
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,090
Uh, this is at the top of 83 when
she said, father, I love you.

257
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,780
She was neither naive nor dishonest,
but the opposite.

258
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,260
She was wise and truthful enough to lie.

259
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:51,920
They reciprocated the great and saving
lie that our love for things is greater

260
00:18:52,561 --> 00:18:54,060
than our love for our love,

261
00:18:54,061 --> 00:18:58,890
for things willfully playing the parts
they wrote for themselves, willfully,

262
00:18:58,891 --> 00:19:03,570
fully creating and believing
fictions necessary for life.

263
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:09,140
So if this is the lie that our love for
things is greater than our love for our

264
00:19:09,151 --> 00:19:09,751
love for things,

265
00:19:09,751 --> 00:19:14,751
the truth is that our love for our love
is greater than our love for actual

266
00:19:15,871 --> 00:19:18,090
things or actual persons.

267
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,900
It's the same structure
as the belief in belief.

268
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,170
Of course,
that

269
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:31,670
story of broad and her father telling
each other stories both about their love

270
00:19:32,491 --> 00:19:35,730
for each other.
And in her father's case,

271
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:38,700
your uncle's case about her mother,

272
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:44,100
her fictional mother who
he says died before. Uh,

273
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,430
she was, uh, old enough to remember her.

274
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:53,300
All the stories that your uncle makes
up become the fullness of his life with

275
00:19:54,001 --> 00:19:54,834
broad.

276
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,200
So they replace the loss of his
first wife who abandoned him.

277
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:06,410
And so this gives fiction a very
powerful brief in the world.

278
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,040
Yeah.

279
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:13,840
This is not unlike the structure that
I was pointing out in the human stain

280
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:19,620
where the blankness of Coleman and Fanya
allows Nathan to re inhabit life by

281
00:20:21,341 --> 00:20:26,140
imagining onto them all the
dynamics of their desire,

282
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,700
all the facts of their life,
all the details of their biography.

283
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,440
So likewise for uses blankness as a
way of pumping up the power of fiction.

284
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,490
It plays this role despite the threat.

285
00:20:44,491 --> 00:20:48,850
It will always pose to
fiction that you get here,

286
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,990
uh, in or on that little, um,

287
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,430
in that little passage I just
quoted before about the, not the,

288
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,450
the nothingness of words.

289
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,050
So the nothingness that gives fiction,

290
00:21:02,051 --> 00:21:06,520
it's blank space to
inhabit also can seep into.

291
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:11,070
And in fact a words as in the
repetition of a word like, um,

292
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,063
Malcovich

293
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:19,280
it is an infection that bothered
critics about this novel.

294
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:25,440
They felt that the postmodern play of
the novel was essentially trivial because

295
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:36,060
these kinds of play had been
conducted in novels 30 years,

296
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:40,960
40 years before,
and many more than that.

297
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,590
If you count Tristram Shandy
in the 18th century. Um,

298
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:48,640
but took powerful hold in
American fiction in the 60s,

299
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:54,780
they felt that far was simply taking out
those tools and deploying them again,

300
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:00,340
but not for any new sort of payoff.

301
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,740
So fiction, some critics were
frustrated with this. Now,

302
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:10,850
this brings me to a second kind of context
that I would bring to this novel, uh,

303
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,860
or I do bring to this novel.
As I think about it. In 2001,

304
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:19,090
Jonathan Franzen's novel, the
correction won the national book award.

305
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:25,620
The corrections attempted
to make a marriage between
the postmodern novel as he

306
00:22:30,491 --> 00:22:31,420
understood it,

307
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:35,950
the novel filled with
those kinds of verbal play

308
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,700
and Franzen,
uh,

309
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:44,470
modeled his novel on
William goddesses novel,

310
00:22:44,471 --> 00:22:46,600
the recognitions,
which is about an art forger.

311
00:22:46,601 --> 00:22:51,601
It's about 900 pages of
incredibly experimental pros.

312
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,370
Um,
it's extremely hard to read,

313
00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:01,230
but for friends in that novel had enough
in it of character development and

314
00:23:02,561 --> 00:23:07,561
human investment to go along with its
verbal playfulness that it made him want

315
00:23:08,741 --> 00:23:12,850
to keep reading it.
So in Omaj to that novel,

316
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:17,851
he called his novel the corrections
and tried to give us a story where the

317
00:23:21,851 --> 00:23:26,470
verbal play would not drain
the sentiment from the novel.

318
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:31,710
So he described it as the social novel
coming to meet the postmodern novel.

319
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,470
He announced this to great
fanfare in an essay. Uh,

320
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:43,500
and of course the novel then became
famous and he became infamous when he was

321
00:23:43,751 --> 00:23:48,751
invited by Oprah to go on Oprah's book
club with the corrections and he refused.

322
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,140
It was quite a, uh, a scandal
in the literary world.

323
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:58,100
And then he tried to go back
on it and say, oh, okay, Oprah.

324
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:02,360
I really wasn't being a snob all come
on your show. But then she was like, no,

325
00:24:02,361 --> 00:24:06,260
sorry, we're scheduled
for that week now. Um,

326
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:10,040
it was really a, uh, a
mistake on Franzen's part,

327
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:14,960
but it also demonstrated
his own ambivalence about
the very project he had set

328
00:24:14,961 --> 00:24:16,760
out to accomplish,

329
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,630
which is to make a novel that people
really want to read that has some

330
00:24:20,631 --> 00:24:25,631
sentimental purchase on you that has
characters you could care about as well as

331
00:24:26,571 --> 00:24:29,900
being extremely ambitious in this way,
in this formal way.

332
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,060
Now that novel,

333
00:24:32,061 --> 00:24:37,061
the way it tried to get sentiment and
verbal play to line up was in part by

334
00:24:38,931 --> 00:24:42,260
making one of the central
characters and Alzheimer's patient.

335
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,580
So it's about a man,
it's about a family in Midwestern family.

336
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:51,940
And the two parents gets extended
treatment in the novel as do the three

337
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:56,630
children in the grown children in the
family. And the father has Alzheimer's.

338
00:24:56,631 --> 00:25:00,620
And so there's a very
pinching esque scene. When,

339
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:04,730
uh, his actually his, his, uh,

340
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:09,610
shit starts talking to him and
this is taken right out of, uh,

341
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:13,280
gravity's rainbow. There's a scene very
similar to this in gravity's rainbow,

342
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:19,390
so France and tried to make that
poignant by making it something that the

343
00:25:22,911 --> 00:25:24,560
modernist tried to do,

344
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:29,710
which is the representation of the actual
workings of a human mind in a daily

345
00:25:30,831 --> 00:25:31,664
situation.

346
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:36,110
And the terror of it for that character.

347
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:39,890
I thought when I read the novel
came across quite powerfully.

348
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,080
So for me in part it worked

349
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:47,440
far is doing something that is related.

350
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:53,530
He is trying to have both
sentiment and formal play.

351
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:59,270
How many of you felt for these characters,

352
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:06,080
how many of you felt that they were
really inaccessible to you? Flat, uh,

353
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:09,960
on emotionally interesting
to you? Okay. Just one.

354
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:14,460
So he, I think he succeeded, uh,

355
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,470
probably two greater degree.

356
00:26:16,471 --> 00:26:21,471
If you read the critics and you can read
that in this incredibly bulked up blurb

357
00:26:21,811 --> 00:26:25,680
section, uh, in the
packaging of this novel. Um,

358
00:26:25,681 --> 00:26:29,010
a lot of critics did really like
this novel and I think that's why

359
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,610
that it for most readers,
he did succeed.

360
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:38,680
Now I have a things to say
about that, but in a minute, uh,

361
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:44,040
I want to say that there is another
kind of context that I think you could

362
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:45,510
attend to productively.

363
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:50,930
And that is the quality of
this novel as a campus novel.

364
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,250
Now that's probably not exactly what
you were thinking of when you read this

365
00:26:56,251 --> 00:27:00,810
novel. It's a canvas novel
because it was written on a campus

366
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:07,820
and it's also a campus novel because it
is in part a coming of age novel about

367
00:27:09,271 --> 00:27:14,220
someone who goes from needing a lot of
help with his writing to kind of writing

368
00:27:14,221 --> 00:27:15,054
on his own.

369
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,070
Yeah.

370
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:22,070
So what you see is the displacement of
a narrative that looks very much like

371
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:27,390
fours development or you would imagine
the development of a writer and a writing

372
00:27:27,871 --> 00:27:30,240
program at Princeton over time,

373
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,640
at first needing
suggestions from a mentor.

374
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:39,990
And a lot of the way that we
come to know the character,

375
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:44,820
Jonathan Safran Foer in the beginning
through Alex's letters has to do with

376
00:27:44,821 --> 00:27:49,821
things that he has said to Alex about
how to write suggestions he's made.

377
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:56,810
So Jonathan Safran Foer remains as a
sort of shadowy presence for much of this

378
00:27:58,531 --> 00:27:59,364
novel.

379
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:04,920
But we see his wise sayings
to Alex about writing.

380
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:11,640
It's an interesting inversion of the
situation that the author was in fact in,

381
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,730
he was in the class taking the class,

382
00:28:14,731 --> 00:28:18,270
not teaching the class when
he was an undergraduate.

383
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:23,040
And this was written when he was,
I think it was published when he was 21

384
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:29,760
the bar is not high, don't
know. The bar is very high.

385
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:35,310
Let me say that the bar is very high,
but don't worry. Um, life is long.

386
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,190
You have plenty of time.
Um,

387
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:41,100
okay.

388
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,550
This is not just about
Jonathan Safran Foer,

389
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:50,010
the man and his particular biography of
being a student in the writing program

390
00:28:50,011 --> 00:28:53,520
at Princeton.
It is also about a,

391
00:28:53,521 --> 00:28:56,910
an institutional history of writing in
the second half of the 20th century.

392
00:28:56,911 --> 00:29:01,020
If you remember way back when,
when I lectured on Flannery O'connor,

393
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:05,780
I mentioned to you a critic
named Mark Mcgill at Ucla who uh,

394
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,720
is writing a book called the program
era or has written, I think it's,

395
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,570
it should be out very soon,
called the program era.

396
00:29:12,571 --> 00:29:17,571
And it's an analysis of
how writing programs leave
their mark on the fiction of

397
00:29:18,301 --> 00:29:20,070
the last 50 years.

398
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,640
Because what's particularly striking
and knew about writing in this period is

399
00:29:25,981 --> 00:29:30,981
that a lot of it happens on campuses and
a lot of authors are writing for campus

400
00:29:32,611 --> 00:29:37,350
audiences.
So far is novel,

401
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:40,740
is a version of that kind of fiction.

402
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:44,590
And we can read it that way,
I think quite easily.

403
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:49,770
It fits in that story that Mark McGrail
tells about the development of this

404
00:29:50,051 --> 00:29:52,000
period.
So just as when I read it,

405
00:29:52,001 --> 00:29:56,890
I see that notation about belief
and belief and the love of love,

406
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:01,900
and it fits into a story that I'm telling
about the evolution of religion and

407
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:03,100
literature in this period.

408
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:08,400
So you can ally it to other arguments
that are made about the period two and

409
00:30:09,161 --> 00:30:14,161
that help you to see why certain things
might be in the novel and what kind of

410
00:30:14,621 --> 00:30:17,470
work they do there.
And finally,

411
00:30:17,471 --> 00:30:21,400
there's a last content context that I um,

412
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:22,630
saw pointed out,

413
00:30:22,631 --> 00:30:27,550
I think it was in the review in the
nation and that's of trips of Americans to

414
00:30:27,551 --> 00:30:31,210
post communist Europe and
post communist Russia.

415
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,770
Apparently there is a whole spate of
novels that came out right about the same

416
00:30:35,771 --> 00:30:40,771
time where Americans almost invariably
young men went to the former Soviet

417
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:45,940
republics and had coming
of age experiences.

418
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,430
So this certainly fits that genre.

419
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:51,610
I don't personally have
a lot to say about that.

420
00:30:51,611 --> 00:30:55,660
I think it's interesting to see it as
being aligned with a group of novels that

421
00:30:55,661 --> 00:31:00,540
do that. Um, it doesn't for me
provide any particular onsite,

422
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:05,140
but that's not because it's
because it wouldn't, it just
happens that I'm not, uh,

423
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:10,090
that didn't strike a chord with me or
lead me to other points of analysis.

424
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:15,450
This is another point that I want you to
take away from my engagement with this

425
00:31:16,091 --> 00:31:21,091
novel that is that no matter what
context can be brought to it,

426
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:26,380
you as a reader bring
your own particular one,

427
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,950
your own particular set of knowledge,
your own particular training,

428
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,930
your own life experience.

429
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:36,730
So we're getting to the end
of the course and in a way,

430
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:41,800
uh, you have now the opportunity
to approach these novels,

431
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:46,860
any new novel that's written with several
kinds of stories about the period in

432
00:31:48,401 --> 00:31:50,740
your mind because now you have read,

433
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:54,130
I hope you've read many
novels in this period

434
00:31:55,630 --> 00:32:00,040
and you can see where the connections are.
So you're starting to draw those.

435
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:04,810
You'll need to do that on the exam.
But far more importantly,

436
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:09,730
I hope that you will continue to do it
when you read on your own outside of

437
00:32:09,731 --> 00:32:11,470
class,
a lot of you are seniors.

438
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:16,930
You may not have a lot of time after
you leave school to read novels.

439
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,950
When you do,

440
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:23,370
I hope it will be part of your pleasure
to approach them with a sense of

441
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:28,530
empowerment that you can know where
they fit in the history of the art form.

442
00:32:29,651 --> 00:32:34,450
They're engaging apart from your own
pleasure in reading them, which will,

443
00:32:34,451 --> 00:32:37,960
I'm sure be the primary reason
you'd pick up a novel to read it.

444
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,440
But there is that intellectual
pleasure that you now can have.

445
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:46,850
I went to, to encourage you
to feel that you can do that.

446
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:52,310
It doesn't mean that it will
always produce insight for you.

447
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,330
So I've been thinking about this
novel for approximately two weeks.

448
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:59,180
Most novels that I lecture to you about,

449
00:32:59,181 --> 00:33:02,240
I've been thinking about
for at least two years.

450
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:03,723
Okay.

451
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:09,460
Your insights over time change and you
notice different things and it's nice to

452
00:33:09,891 --> 00:33:11,210
allow time for that.

453
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:15,170
And that's the value of
rereading in a few years,

454
00:33:15,171 --> 00:33:17,180
what you read before as a student.

455
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:21,020
So I hope you'll maybe return to some
of these novels as well. Now, look,

456
00:33:21,021 --> 00:33:26,021
that was my little digression about after
college reading or an outside of the

457
00:33:26,091 --> 00:33:29,890
class reading, but let me return
to this question of sentiment.

458
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,060
Yeah,

459
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,070
far wants it both ways.

460
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:40,370
And one of the ways he has it both
ways is by internalizing in the novel a

461
00:33:41,461 --> 00:33:46,050
reader figure who is our double.
There's actually a couple of, uh,

462
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,350
there are actually three doubles for us,
at least.

463
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:55,260
One is Alex who is reading Johnathan's
story as he sends it to him,

464
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:01,580
embedding a critical reader within
the novel as we've seen with Barth

465
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,760
and in pension where Eto was,

466
00:34:05,761 --> 00:34:10,380
that double allows a certain
set of metta fictional tricks.

467
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:16,790
One of the most reliable functions for
that internalized reader is to cue you,

468
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,453
me,

469
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:25,710
the actual human readers to
notice or feel certain things.

470
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:30,720
Or if you are a off to be
misled in certain ways.

471
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:33,660
Think of the prologue from John Ray Jr,

472
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:36,660
which misleads us in reading that novel.

473
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:40,200
He's our double,
but he's there to trick us.

474
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:45,500
I don't think that Alex is here to trick
us and just to note how he cues us.

475
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:51,390
Let's look on one 40,
uh,

476
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:53,953
two

477
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:57,130
and three.
This is um,

478
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:02,160
one of the letters where the Alex is
less busy with self presentation by this

479
00:35:03,221 --> 00:35:08,221
point in the novel and he's really
responding to what Jonathan has sent him.

480
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,090
This is in the middle of one 43 those
things that you wrote in your letter about

481
00:35:17,091 --> 00:35:21,920
your grandmother made me remember how
you told me on Augustine steps about when

482
00:35:21,921 --> 00:35:26,840
you would sit under her dress and how
that presented you. Safety and peace.

483
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:32,080
I must confess that I became melancholy
then and still am melancholy.

484
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,250
I was also very moved.

485
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:38,520
Is this how you use it by what you wrote
about how impossible it must've been

486
00:35:38,521 --> 00:35:42,720
for your grandmother to be a mother
without a husband is amazing. Yes.

487
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:47,550
How your grandma father survived so much
only to die when he came to America.

488
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,040
It is as if after surviving so much,

489
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:53,310
there was no longer a reason to survive.

490
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,430
When you wrote about the early
death of your grandfather,

491
00:35:56,431 --> 00:36:00,570
it helped me to understand in some manners
the melancholy that grandfather has

492
00:36:00,571 --> 00:36:04,860
felt since grandmother died and not
only because they both died from cancer.

493
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,810
I do not know your mother of course,

494
00:36:06,811 --> 00:36:10,770
but I know you and I can tell you that
your grandfather would have been so,

495
00:36:10,771 --> 00:36:11,604
so proud.

496
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:16,050
It is my hope that I will be a person
that grandmother would have been so,

497
00:36:16,051 --> 00:36:17,040
so proud of.

498
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:23,570
We're being cued to be moved to be moved
by the story in these particular ways

499
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:28,770
to take his reflections
on his grandmother,

500
00:36:28,771 --> 00:36:30,900
which are indeed very lovely

501
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,530
and to be moved by them.

502
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:40,970
But one reservation I guess I have about
the success of this move is just it's

503
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:45,901
baldness.

504
00:36:45,901 --> 00:36:50,901
I guess I'm being told that I
should be moved by these passages.

505
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,733
Okay.

506
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:59,330
There are also moments
when we get reflections

507
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,340
that seam.

508
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,183
Okay.

509
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:10,750
Like they would never stand if they
were not embedded in Alex's voice.

510
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:17,360
And this is on 69 68 69 this is Alex

511
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:23,480
talking about how he came upon
little Igor, his brother crying.

512
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,860
I knew why he was a
little less than crying.

513
00:37:31,861 --> 00:37:36,780
I knew very well and I wanted to go to
him and tell him that I had a little less

514
00:37:36,781 --> 00:37:38,610
than cried too,
just like him.

515
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,420
And that no matter how much it seemed
like he would never grow up to be a

516
00:37:42,421 --> 00:37:47,310
premium person like me with many girls
and so many famous places to go, he would.

517
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:51,300
He would be exactly like me
and look at me a little Igor.

518
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:56,510
The bruises go away and so does how
you hate and so does the feeling that

519
00:37:56,761 --> 00:38:01,761
everything you receive in
life is something you have
earned and then I'm going

520
00:38:01,981 --> 00:38:06,981
to skip down so he starts to laugh then
at his brother and he's not quite sure

521
00:38:07,141 --> 00:38:08,040
why he's laughing.

522
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:12,420
I attempted to rise that
I could walk to my room,

523
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,900
but I was afraid that it would be
too difficult to control my laughing.

524
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,550
I remained there for many,
many minutes.

525
00:38:17,551 --> 00:38:21,240
My brother persevered to
a little less than cry,

526
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,060
which made my silent laughing even more.

527
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:28,740
I am able to understand now that it was
the same laugh I had in the restaurant

528
00:38:28,741 --> 00:38:33,741
and loads the laugh that had the same
darkness as grandfather's laugh and the

529
00:38:33,871 --> 00:38:36,970
heroes laugh.
I ask leniency for writing this.

530
00:38:36,971 --> 00:38:40,540
Perhaps I will remove it before I
post this part to you. I am sorry.

531
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:45,880
As for Sammy Davis Junior, junior, she
did not eat her piece of the potato.

532
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,680
Those reflections on laughing and crying.

533
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,800
I think they might sound quite modeling
if they were not in Alex's voice.

534
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:04,150
That a writer needs to judge
very carefully whether to
reflect in those direct

535
00:39:06,771 --> 00:39:11,771
ways about big themes like laughter
and crying or how you hate.

536
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:21,590
So these are the topics that we'll be a
pitfall for any new writers sitting down

537
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:25,740
to say, I am going to write
about love. I used to,

538
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:30,450
I used to teach creative writing
and one of the, um, one of,

539
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:35,520
one of the exercises that I did was I
would sit my students down and I would

540
00:39:36,031 --> 00:39:40,020
say, okay, we're going to have a
little in class writing today. Um,

541
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,680
here's some topics that I want you
to write about just for 10 minutes.

542
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:49,020
And I would give them love your childhood.
Um,

543
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,620
what else? Death. Uh,
can't remember what else.

544
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:57,390
And so then they'd very earnestly
do it. And then I'd say, okay,

545
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,520
now, now I want you to, uh,

546
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:04,230
take your paper and I want
you to underline every
single cliche that you wrote.

547
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,420
And they would come up with papers full
of cliches and it was a little exercise

548
00:40:09,421 --> 00:40:13,330
just to get them to understand
that choosing a topic, uh,

549
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:17,160
can get you into trouble if
you choose a very abstract,

550
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:19,620
big important question.

551
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:25,910
Of course we want books that move us
and tell us about death and love and

552
00:40:26,971 --> 00:40:28,470
separation and desire.

553
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:32,280
But how do you get there and how
do you talk about those things?

554
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:37,020
So I think that for has,
um,

555
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:39,720
taken a risk of some of the sort here

556
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,760
he can do it because it's in Alex's
voice is the distance achieved the self

557
00:40:48,181 --> 00:40:53,181
distancing achieved by inhabiting a
foreign voice with its little funny jokes

558
00:40:56,251 --> 00:40:59,100
that come up because of
its incorrect usages.

559
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:01,530
Is that enough

560
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,780
to prevent sentimentality
rather than Centamin?

561
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:14,470
Is it powerful enough language in the
abstract that it moves us as a discourse

562
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:21,641
on laughter and loving is the detail
of Little Igor and Alex's love for him

563
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:27,980
enough? Now remember, we know
nothing about Igor as a character,

564
00:41:27,981 --> 00:41:30,200
his brother as a character.

565
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:36,910
Do we feel that the relationship between
the two is earned for us as readers?

566
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:44,480
Maybe we do.
Sometimes I did.

567
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,460
Other Times I didn't.

568
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,110
So this is something that
I'm still thinking about.

569
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:56,840
Does it succeed at what
Franzen too was trying to do,

570
00:41:56,841 --> 00:42:01,841
which is to infuse intellectual
wordplay with human resonance?

571
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,460
Does it succeed?

572
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:15,080
If you look at the
dedication to the novel,

573
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:20,450
I think you learned something too.
This is under the acknowledgements.

574
00:42:20,451 --> 00:42:21,500
Did anybody read this?

575
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:25,653
Yeah,

576
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:29,460
these are the acknowledgements at
least once every day since I met her,

577
00:42:29,461 --> 00:42:32,370
I have felt blessed to know Nicole Roggie.

578
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:35,850
She inspires me not only to
try to write more ambitiously,

579
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:40,590
but to smile more widely and have
a fuller, better heart. I am so,

580
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:45,360
so grateful and you hear
that. So, so again, uh,

581
00:42:45,361 --> 00:42:46,920
from the passage I just read

582
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:52,770
and it is my pleasure and honor to think
of the wonderful people at Ho Houghton

583
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,810
Mifflin as family,
so on and so on,

584
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:59,900
whose advice in literature and life
seems always to boil down to feel more,

585
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,600
which is always the best advice.

586
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:09,680
So feeling is very much on the
surface of the effort here.

587
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:18,430
What would it mean to read
this as a sentimental novel?

588
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:27,070
Does the playful treatment of Shtetl
life disable our connection with those

589
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:30,380
characters.

590
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:35,740
One of the things that I think succeeds
wonderfully about this novel is broad as

591
00:43:36,741 --> 00:43:37,574
a character.

592
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:43,540
I think you do want her to have a good
life as Alex does and you feel the

593
00:43:46,311 --> 00:43:48,410
tragedy of the life she gets.

594
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:54,790
And I think you get that payoff
because she is developed,

595
00:43:55,821 --> 00:43:59,480
she has time to develop in
the course of the story.

596
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:04,990
So for all its time travel back and forth
for all it's playfulness for all the

597
00:44:05,301 --> 00:44:10,301
jokes and rifts broad has time to develop,

598
00:44:10,851 --> 00:44:15,710
especially in relation to her
father and in relation to the coker,

599
00:44:15,711 --> 00:44:17,060
her husband.

600
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:23,660
And we learn things that may
occur more complex over time.

601
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:28,720
And so when we finally learn what she
asked the coker to do after she was raped

602
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:32,790
and before she agreed to be his wife,

603
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,470
when we learned that,

604
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:39,450
and I won't reveal it cause I don't know
if you're all there yet, it gives us,

605
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,673
uh,

606
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:46,290
a much more complex version of what
she is as a person of who she is as a

607
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:51,090
person.
So I think he earns it with broad.

608
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:53,453
Yeah.

609
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:58,490
That to me is a kind of achievement
because of the role that riffing plays in

610
00:45:02,071 --> 00:45:03,450
the development of that story.

611
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:10,220
Riffing on Jewish behavior in a novel
by a Jewish writer is certainly well

612
00:45:13,621 --> 00:45:18,240
trodden ground Roth has been treading
that ground for many decades.

613
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:25,010
I think what four does that Roth didn't
do is fully identify with the community

614
00:45:27,931 --> 00:45:32,270
in a convincing way
while he's doing it,

615
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:39,470
and this is related to what I will
say about his use of the Holocaust,

616
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:41,390
uh,
in my next lecture,

617
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:46,190
I'm going to stop there and I hope you
will be sure to finish the novel by,

618
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:47,120
by Wednesday.
