00:00:00.613 --> 00:00:02.498
- [Instructor] We are told
that a van drives around

00:00:02.498 --> 00:00:06.676
a circular curve of radius
r with linear speed v.

00:00:06.676 --> 00:00:09.542
On a second curve of the same radius,

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:13.197
the van has linear speed 1/3 v.

00:00:13.197 --> 00:00:15.078
And you could view linear
speed as the magnitude

00:00:15.078 --> 00:00:17.179
of your linear velocity.

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:21.228
How does the magnitude of the
van's centripetal acceleration

00:00:21.228 --> 00:00:24.699
change after the linear speed decreases?

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:27.485
So pause this video and see
if you can figure it out

00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:29.679
on your own, and I'll give
you a little bit of a hint.

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:31.734
We know that the magnitude
of centripetal acceleration

00:00:31.734 --> 00:00:35.173
in general is equal to
linear speed squared

00:00:35.173 --> 00:00:37.255
divided by radius.

00:00:37.255 --> 00:00:39.255
The radius of the curve.

00:00:40.381 --> 00:00:42.242
Alright, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:44.889
So let's first think
about the first curve.

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:48.174
So the first curve the
magnitude of our centripetal

00:00:48.174 --> 00:00:51.333
acceleration for curve one,
I have another subscript

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:54.269
one here, this is around the first curve.

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:55.978
They tell us that our linear speed is v.

00:00:55.978 --> 00:01:00.064
So we have v squared over and
the radius of that curve is r.

00:01:00.064 --> 00:01:02.391
This is going to be a
straight up v squared over r

00:01:02.391 --> 00:01:03.480
for that first curve.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.780
The magnitude of our
centripetal acceleration.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.679
Now what about the second curve?

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:09.825
So the magnitude of our
centripetal acceleration

00:01:09.825 --> 00:01:13.585
around second curve,
that's what that two is,

00:01:13.585 --> 00:01:15.292
is going to be equal to,

00:01:15.292 --> 00:01:18.068
they tell us we now have
a linear speed of 1/3 v.

00:01:18.068 --> 00:01:20.426
So in our numerator
we're gonna square that,

00:01:20.426 --> 00:01:23.665
1/3 v squared all of that over

00:01:23.665 --> 00:01:25.311
the curve of the same radius.

00:01:25.311 --> 00:01:27.254
So our radius is still r.

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:29.764
So let's just do a little
algebraic simplification.

00:01:29.764 --> 00:01:32.419
1/3 v times 1/3 v is just going to be

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:34.886
1/9 v squared.

00:01:34.886 --> 00:01:39.053
So it's going to be 1/9 v squared over r.

00:01:40.122 --> 00:01:41.777
All I did is square this numerator here.

00:01:41.777 --> 00:01:45.944
Or I could write this as
1/9 times v squared over r.

00:01:49.373 --> 00:01:51.047
The reason why I wrote
this in green is because

00:01:51.047 --> 00:01:52.843
this is the exact same thing as this.

00:01:52.843 --> 00:01:55.544
And so this is going to be equal to,

00:01:55.544 --> 00:01:58.784
this is equal to 1/9
times, instead of writing

00:01:58.784 --> 00:02:01.508
v squared over r, I could say hey that's r

00:02:01.508 --> 00:02:03.633
the magnitude of our
centripetal acceleration

00:02:03.633 --> 00:02:05.331
around the first curve.

00:02:05.331 --> 00:02:07.501
The magnitude of our
centripetal acceleration

00:02:07.501 --> 00:02:08.979
around the first curve.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.156
So how does the magnitude
of the van's centripetal

00:02:11.156 --> 00:02:14.417
acceleration change after
the linear speed decreases?

00:02:14.417 --> 00:02:15.696
Well around the second curve,

00:02:15.696 --> 00:02:19.692
we have 1/9 the magnitude
of centripetal acceleration.

00:02:19.692 --> 00:02:22.192
So we could say the magnitude,

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:25.577
or I could just say, they already asked us

00:02:25.577 --> 00:02:27.325
how does the magnitude change

00:02:27.325 --> 00:02:29.717
so we could say decreases,

00:02:29.717 --> 00:02:31.467
decreases by a factor

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:36.619
factor of nine.

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:39.196
And I wrote it in this language.

00:02:39.196 --> 00:02:42.765
You could say it got
multiplied by a factor of 1/9

00:02:42.765 --> 00:02:45.123
or you could say decreases
by a factor of nine

00:02:45.123 --> 00:02:47.157
because on the Khan Academy exercises

00:02:47.157 --> 00:02:49.805
that deal with this, they
use language like that.

00:02:49.805 --> 00:02:51.888
Let's do another example.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.468
Here we are told a
father spins his daughter

00:02:57.468 --> 00:03:01.323
in a circle of radius r
at angular speed omega.

00:03:01.323 --> 00:03:04.390
Then the father extends
his arms and spins her

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.557
in a circle of radius two r
with the same angular speed.

00:03:09.745 --> 00:03:12.617
How does the magnitude of
the child's centripetal

00:03:12.617 --> 00:03:17.194
acceleration change when
the father extends his arms?

00:03:17.194 --> 00:03:19.460
Once again pause this
video and see if you can

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.235
figure it out.

00:03:21.235 --> 00:03:25.318
Well the key realization
here and we derived this

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.108
at a previous video, is to
realize that the magnitude

00:03:29.108 --> 00:03:33.025
of centripetal acceleration
is equal to r times

00:03:34.382 --> 00:03:36.549
our angular speed squared.

00:03:38.316 --> 00:03:41.545
And so initially so the
magnitude of our centripetal

00:03:41.545 --> 00:03:45.270
acceleration initially,
I'll do that with a sub i.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.437
That is going to be equal
to, well they're using

00:03:48.437 --> 00:03:49.952
the same notation.

00:03:49.952 --> 00:03:51.575
We have omega as our angular speed.

00:03:51.575 --> 00:03:52.498
And our radius is r.

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:55.510
So it's just going to be r omega squared.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.738
And then when we think about the father,

00:03:58.738 --> 00:04:00.224
he extends his arms.

00:04:00.224 --> 00:04:03.125
So then you have the
magnitude of your centripetal

00:04:03.125 --> 00:04:06.389
acceleration, I could
say final or extended or

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:07.934
I'll just say final sub f.

00:04:07.934 --> 00:04:10.103
What does that going to be equal to?

00:04:10.103 --> 00:04:14.270
Well now our radius, the
radius of our circle is two r.

00:04:15.633 --> 00:04:17.712
So it's going to be two r

00:04:17.712 --> 00:04:19.794
and they say the same angular speed.

00:04:19.794 --> 00:04:22.040
So our angular speed is still omega.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.707
Two r omega squared.

00:04:25.421 --> 00:04:29.828
Well this part right over
here r omega squared,

00:04:29.828 --> 00:04:32.043
that was just the magnitude of our initial

00:04:32.043 --> 00:04:33.660
centripetal acceleration.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.666
That was the magnitude of our initial

00:04:35.666 --> 00:04:37.391
centripetal acceleration.

00:04:37.391 --> 00:04:40.854
And so you see that the magnitude of our

00:04:40.854 --> 00:04:45.728
centripetal acceleration, has
increased by a factor of two.

00:04:45.728 --> 00:04:48.395
Increased, increased by a factor

00:04:52.577 --> 00:04:53.410
of two.

00:04:54.364 --> 00:04:55.697
And we are done.
