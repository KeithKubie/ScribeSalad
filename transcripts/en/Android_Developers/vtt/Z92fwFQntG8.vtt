SPARKY RHODE: Again,
it's Wednesday

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.360
afternoon here in Europe.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.140
And it's time for the Android
Developers Office Hours.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.900
I'm Sparky in Munich, Germany
I'm joined by Rich and Matt in

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.160
London, UK.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.695
Rich and--

00:00:16.695 --> 00:00:16.880
RICH: [LAUGH]

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:17.976
SPARKY RHODE: Nick.

00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:19.200
I'm sorry.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.030
NICK BUTCHER: No
Matt this week.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.020
Matt's off in Amsterdam,
I think it.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.760
RICH: Yeah, J-something
conference.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.360
I do have a conference
in Holland.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.060
SPARKY RHODE: Matt in
a really, really

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.610
convincing Nick costume.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:31.180
RICH: [LAUGH]

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.500
very good.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.283
Hi there from England as well
and welcome to this week's

00:00:37.283 --> 00:00:37.730
office hours.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.110
As usual, we won't be talking
about anything that's not

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.930
previously been announced,
but fortunately--

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.370
NICK BUTCHER: Things that
have been announced!

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.960
SPARKY RHODE: [CHEER]

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.180
RICH: Finally.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.960
We almost pre-announced it two
weeks ago when this started

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.130
ringing in my pocket.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.470
NICK BUTCHER: [LAUGH]

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.473
It's like oh no, no, no, no.

00:00:54.473 --> 00:00:54.896
Let's not do that.

00:00:54.896 --> 00:00:56.090
But we didn't.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.820
And now we are free to talk
about some of the awesome new

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.640
Android devices that are
available on the Play Store.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.000
SPARKY RHODE: But since you are
all developers, you'd much

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.860
rather talk about developing and
writing apps than the new

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:09.855
devices, right?

00:01:09.855 --> 00:01:11.835
RICH: Well, I'm glad you said
that, Sparky, because there's

00:01:11.835 --> 00:01:15.700
some amazing new APIs as
well in Android 4.2.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.840
I hope that we'll be able to
touch on those over the next

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.200
hour as well.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.650
Welcome to all the people to
join us in the Hangout live.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.220
Good to see some familiar faces,
and some new ones, and

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.546
Jelly Bean, a piece of art.

00:01:31.246 --> 00:01:32.690
I guess we should get started.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.430
Does anyone in the
Hangout have any

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.560
questions for us today?

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.110
AL SUTTON: My one's kind
of a big can of worms.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.420
How's multi-user handled with
respect to external storage?

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.380
RICH: OK, so first of all, Al,
congratulations on a changing

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.590
your lower third.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.770
I see that you're a member of
Ouya, the Kickstarter Android

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.070
console gaming awesomeness that
hopefully we will all be

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.320
using soon.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.430
Multi-user--

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.910
[INAUDIBLE] straight
into one of the new

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.670
features of Android 4.2.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.720
On the Nexus 10, it comes
with multi-user support.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.960
We have.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.710
I do have multi-user on here
at the moment, I can switch

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.660
between two of my profiles.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.900
Regarding external storage?

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.630
AL SUTTON: Yeah a lot of people
have been using it just

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.710
basically as a temporary dump
area for large files.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.770
And a lot of applications
I've seen do that.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.910
What happens if you've got the
same application that's

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.880
running under two
different users?

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.630
Is the application going to see
the same area for those

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.080
two users, and hence--

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.760
NICK BUTCHER: No, each
user will see a

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.370
different view of the data.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.070
So if you [? ask for ?] get
external storage, it'll

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.800
actually get returned
[INAUDIBLE].

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.430
AL SUTTON: Cool, cool.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.420
So we've got user separation
at that level.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.440
NICK BUTCHER: I believe that the
hard coded string/SD card

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.390
has been grandfathered
in as well.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.810
So if you were doing it wrong,
like please don't do that, but

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.980
I think we've catered
for that as well.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.470
RICH: But at the same time,
each app will only be

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.950
installed on some device.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.890
So if you do install an
application and then another

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.570
user goes to install
it, it will just

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.300
instantly be installed.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.350
So you don't have to duplicate
all actual application and

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:12.650
app's data.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.310
It's just the user specific data
that will go into their

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.020
our own private area.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.270
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, from a
developer point of view, it

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.270
should be transparent to you,
like, you shouldn't have to

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.960
write any special code for
handling multiple users.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.910
AL SUTTON: Cool, so when you've
got two users, will

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.060
each user see the applications
the other one's installed?

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.250
RICH: No.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.960
You get to go and install
the application.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.480
If it is already installed, it
will just enable it for you,

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.805
but you don't get to see what
the person has installed, no.

00:03:39.805 --> 00:03:40.690
SPARKY RHODE: Cool, thanks.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.770
I appreciate that.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:48.170
I remember, back in the day, we
had semi proprietary fork

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.470
of Eclipse that could only be
installed per user on Windows

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.490
NT, Windows 32, NT,
XP, whatever.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.400
And man, installing Eclipse
separately for every user

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.820
account that you
wanted it on--

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.300
ouch.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.710
I'm glad we don't
have to do that.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.760
RICH: OK, anything else so I
have and welcome to whoever

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.070
just joined us.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.890
I heard a ping.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.459
No?

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:20.959
NICK BUTCHER: Everyone catch
the announcements this week

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.214
about Android 4.2 and the
Nexus 4, Nexus 10?

00:04:25.214 --> 00:04:26.188
SPARKY RHODE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:26.188 --> 00:04:28.630
NICK BUTCHER: [LAUGH]

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.880
Anyone planning on
picking one up?

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.180
Yeah.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.835
RICH: Just nods generally
across the

00:04:34.835 --> 00:04:35.950
bottom of the Hangout.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:36.530
They're like yeah,
I'll pick one up.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.080
Price points are very, very
competitive, I've got to say.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.360
AL SUTTON: And the resolution
on the 10 seems incredible.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.110
Is it really noticeably
crisper than

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.900
other 10 inch tablets?

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.570
NICK BUTCHER: Text rendering,
for me, is beautiful.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.590
SPARKY RHODE: My favorite
example is, I bring up a

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.160
reader app, like, for instance,
"The Economist," and

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.860
I pull up the exact same article
on the Nexus 10 and

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.550
one of the older generation,
like a Zune or a Galaxy tab.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.005
And just look at the rendering
of the article on those two

00:05:04.005 --> 00:05:06.090
tablets side by side, and
you'll be convinced.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.290
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.650
RICH: I mean, we're almost
up to print ppi's now.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.310
It's incredible.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.530
NICK BUTCHER: If you look
at Roman [? Gi's ?]

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.830
latest post, I think, at the
moment, he's got a photo of

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.470
the corner of the screen.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.560
And you wouldn't believe
that it's not

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.110
superimposed image on top.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.700
It's just phenomenal.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.276
And yeah, it's that good.

00:05:25.276 --> 00:05:26.760
AL SUTTON: OK, that's
one sale made.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.290
[LAUGH]

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.460
AL SUTTON: Another
quick question--

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.810
do you know anything about
the 4.2 running

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.634
on the Nexus 7 itself.

00:05:35.634 --> 00:05:38.290
Is there a 3G version
being made?

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.216
RICH: Hold on a second.

00:05:39.216 --> 00:05:43.640
There are just jump
on a mute here.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.650
Go on, just say that
again please, Al?

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.590
AL SUTTON: The 3G version of
the Nexus 7 was announced.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.540
I don't know if you guys have
had a chance to play with it,

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.750
but is it in the territory
where you get

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:53.700
multi-user on it?

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.790
Or is it considered a non-tablet
device, and you

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.554
don't get multi-user.

00:05:59.554 --> 00:06:02.210
SPARKY RHODE: I think it's not
running multi-user right now.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.267
RICH: The only device I know
of that's got multi-user at

00:06:04.267 --> 00:06:05.570
the moment is the Nexus 10.

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.190
I haven't seen it on the Nexus
7, but it's a good question.

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.510
I will try and resolve
that for you.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:13.780
AL SUTTON: Thanks.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.690
RICH: In the chat window down
the side, Patrick has-- oh no,

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.590
someone before that.

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.100
Francisco, "What do you think
about the battery life of the

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.000
Nexus 10 and the Nexus 4?

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.230
Thanks." Taking those
separately, Nexus 10 has got

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.560
an insanely long standby life.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.990
NICK BUTCHER: I think you leave
it for three months on

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.330
standby, someone told me once.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:34.940
RICH: Someone did
mention that.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:35.950
NICK BUTCHER: I don't know
if they've tested that.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.320
I definitely haven't done
that [? one. ?]

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.000
But based on the draw
and the capacity--

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.250
RICH: Yes.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.770
Generally, have very, very, good
battery lives, very large

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.680
batteries in them, and good
power efficiency from the

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.340
chips we're seeing.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.350
And then Nexus 4 we've both been
using as our main phones

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.830
for a while now, and--

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:56.950
NICK BUTCHER: We're
not at DroidCon.

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.575
RICH: We're not at DroidCon.

00:06:58.575 --> 00:07:01.760
Bigger batteries than all the
previous Nexus handset

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.170
devices, and more efficient
operating system, has made,

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.360
for me, a device that easily
gets through a day.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.126
But we'll just have to see, when
you pick yours up, what

00:07:11.126 --> 00:07:11.520
you think about them.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:12.820
NICK BUTCHER: And silly things,
like the inductive

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.350
charging is amazing.

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.560
So I have an inductive charger
on my desk and

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.470
on my bedside table.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.210
And so every time I sit down, I
just put the phone down, and

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:20.700
it's charging.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.780
So it stays charged because
it's so easy.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.573
I don't have to think about
plugging it in and or

00:07:24.573 --> 00:07:26.102
unplugging it when I get
up, I just put it

00:07:26.102 --> 00:07:27.200
down, and pick it up.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.040
AL SUTTON: Does the 10 have
inductive charging as well?

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:30.660
NICK BUTCHER: No.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:31.960
AL SUTTON: Only the 4.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.440
NICK BUTCHER: Just the four.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.940
RICH: So mine's currently set at
82% full after 6 hours and

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.040
14 minutes without any charge.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.000
Not that you can see that,
but it's doing

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.320
very well right now.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.520
SPARKY RHODE: I mean, really the
make or break is whether

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.790
it gets through a day, right?

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:48.190
RICH: Yeah.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:48.590
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:49.970
RICH: I haven't had that
problem with it yet.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.730
I was concerned about switching
to a device that

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:53.690
doesn't have a removable
battery, but the tradeoff

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:55.920
being that it has a bigger
battery inside it.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.703
And of course, it has inductive
charging coils

00:07:57.703 --> 00:07:59.236
somewhere in the back.

00:07:59.236 --> 00:08:01.420
I can switch in between the
back and the battery.

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.850
And I've been happy with it.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:05.830
NICK BUTCHER: I love mine.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.640
RICH: No issues, yeah,
I love mine too.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.990
AUDIENCE: What's the inductive
charging like?

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:10.690
Is it just as quick, well,
obviously, it won't be as

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:14.090
quick, but is it still pretty
speedy compared a cable?

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:14.890
NICK BUTCHER: I don't
really know.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.080
Yeah, I think so.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.183
I tend to leave it put down
overnight, and it's charged.

00:08:20.183 --> 00:08:22.990
Yeah, I don't know, if you were
just going to put it down

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.800
for an hour, would it
do a full battery

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.410
charge, I'm not sure.

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:28.810
RICH: I really want someone to
bring a really nice range of

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:30.890
furniture with inductive
charging built into it.

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:32.909
Coffee tables with little
inductive charging points in

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:34.919
the colors and things, that you
can just, you don't have

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:36.590
to have these wires around.

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:38.380
AL SUTTON: Nokia did a pillow
for their Lumia

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.429
for inductive charging.

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:41.799
And you kind of sit there and
think, like, what would you do

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:43.070
carrying this phone
around on pillow.

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.620
It looks like something from
the royal household, yeah.

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.170
RICH: So yeah, the other thing
is, the games on the Nexus 10

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:52.565
look amazing.

00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:54.030
Oh, that's great.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.530
I saw the EA games "Mass Effect
Infiltrator" and "Need

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:59.770
for Speed: Most Wanted," just
look inside at 2500.

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:02.590
And the scary thing is, when
you use the HDMI out, or

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:06.250
wireless display, it has to
scale down for a full HDTV.

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:08.320
Scale it down to 1080p.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.763
So it's absolutely flying
as well, very good

00:09:10.763 --> 00:09:11.300
frame rates on it.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.320
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, I've got a
massive 30 inch monitor at my

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.860
desk, and it's got the same
resolution as that--

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:16.480
RICH: 10 inch tablet.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.580
NICK BUTCHER: On a
10 inch tablet.

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.782
RICH: The A15 chip cooks.

00:09:18.782 --> 00:09:20.228
Not in a hot way.

00:09:20.228 --> 00:09:20.710
NICK BUTCHER: Love it.

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:20.930
RICH: Yeah.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:23.800
OK, let's do some development
questions, unless there's one

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:24.640
more in the--

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.280
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah,
in the sidebar.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.500
Patrick, I'm pronouncing it
right, a question about screen

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:30.770
sharing in 4.2.

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:34.670
"Will it require some kind of
device in between?" So yeah,

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.630
it's based on Miracast.

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:38.660
Is the wireless screen sharing,
I guess that's what

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:40.130
you're talking about.

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:44.260
So if your TV supports Miracast,
which I'm not sure

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.960
if there are any out there
now, but I here it's an

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.350
emerging standard of which
people are going to adopt,

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:49.710
then the answer would be no.

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:52.050
Until then, I believe there's
a range of dongles either on

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:55.920
the market now or coming out
which you can use to retrofit

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.180
that Miracast support into
your existing TV.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.600
So yeah, right now the answer
is, probably most people will

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.596
have to buy some kind of
dongle to do that.

00:10:04.596 --> 00:10:07.100
But in the future, hopefully no

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:10.110
additional devices required.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.900
RICH: Yeah, you mentioned
standards like DLNA, but

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:15.170
usually they just do media
streaming, sharing videos and

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:17.830
audio, they won't allow
entire desktop

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:19.150
sharing off of the device.

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:21.640
Whereas this is, you can do
mirroring, or you can send a

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:26.130
separate stream to the
second screen.

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:28.860
Now in Android 4.2, with the
second screen APIs, you get

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.080
notified when a second screen's
plugged in connected,

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.484
and you can send a completely
separate set of

00:10:33.484 --> 00:10:34.320
views to that screen.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.010
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, and the cool
thing is that DLNA piggy

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:40.410
backs on a network, whereas
Miracast, I believe, is built

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:43.680
on top of the Wi-Fi, so you can
have a direct connection

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.060
between, say, your TV and your
device without having to have

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:49.900
another Wi-Fi access
point in between,

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.170
which is kind of cool.

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:55.640
SPARKY RHODE: Ah, I see Pavel
has asked us an actual

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:56.920
programming question.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:00.530
"What is the density, screen
size bucket or N10, and will

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:03.950
we see more buckets introduced
in the near future?" Correct

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:04.400
me if I'm wrong--

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.660
I believe it will be an extra
large XHDPI, is that right?

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.410
Correct.

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:17.680
And as of API level 16, there
exists a constant for XXHDPI,

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:22.210
but we haven't really
done a lot with it.

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:24.020
NICK BUTCHER: So I heard a post
on Google+ yesterday,

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.870
which some people might've seen,
saying that yes, the

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:31.560
tablet is an x-large
XHDPI screen.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:36.850
But launcher tablet devices
picks a launcher icon for your

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:41.490
app from one density bucket up,
so that it can render it

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.770
slightly larger and
see a larger icon

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:45.260
and on the home screen.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:50.430
So for that reason, yeah, you
need to provide an XXHDPI icon

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:54.850
in order to get a really
beautifull crisp icon.

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:56.340
AL SUTTON: I got a kind of
development question.

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:59.950
It's one that you might not be
able to answer, so do you know

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:04.520
when the 4.2 SDK is going
to be available?

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.100
NICK BUTCHER: Generally,
historically, it tends to get

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:11.280
shipped when we launch a device,
or open source, or

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.740
erase the factory image.

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:14.090
So historically, that's
what's happened.

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:17.060
So when that happens, I guess.

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:18.546
But I don't have a date.

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:23.580
RICH: OK, yes you'll
see XXHDPI.

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:28.620
NICK BUTCHER: Where
will it end?

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.550
SPARKY RHODE: I believe
that's nominally 480

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:31.920
dpi, is that right?

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:32.650
480, yeah.

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:33.190
That's nothing.

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:39.080
Actually XX is just a redirect
for a number.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:42.300
I think it gets even turned
into 480 dpi by our APTT.

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:43.490
By our APT.

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:46.510
So you can actually just
use drawable-480 dpi.

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:48.000
Rather, than drawable
expectations.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.870
There's nothing like being
prepared for the future.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:51.700
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, although,
a couple of benefits, it's

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.750
like, where is it going to end
if you keep on adding X's.

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:54.670
It's kind of silly.

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:57.830
But the other thing
is also, make sure

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:00.560
resources, nice and ordered.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.270
In a clutch.

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:03.410
RICH: Does anyone what the
dpi of the HTC was?

00:13:06.592 --> 00:13:08.280
SPARKY RHODE: The actual,
I think, was more 440.

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.860
RICH: OK, so it's still
not quite 480.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:14.000
But that said, I mean,
these are all

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.470
kind of elastic ranges.

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:18.150
So it may very well be that
something with an actual

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:21.445
density of 440 might sort
into 480 bucket anyway.

00:13:21.445 --> 00:13:23.260
And it might be an XX.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.024
NICK BUTCHER: Sure.

00:13:25.024 --> 00:13:27.020
RICH: Right on.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.510
One of the other nice features
of 4.2 is, when you're

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:31.460
developing for multiple screens,
you can put a virtual

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:35.610
second screen on your device and
see what we it will render

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:37.360
like inside your application.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.040
So in the developer settings,
there's now a new setting,

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:43.960
which I'll bring up, in the
developer options for--

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:49.895
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, this is
one of the APIs I'm really

00:13:49.895 --> 00:13:52.910
excited about, actually having
an actually API to draw things

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:54.420
separately to a secondary
screen.

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.232
So you can have your game
controllers on your phone, and

00:13:57.232 --> 00:13:59.100
the game output up
on your big TV.

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.795
RICH: You can't really see it,
but you can simulate a second

00:14:01.795 --> 00:14:02.640
screen here on the side
of your screen.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:06.510
And the second screen would be
what appears onto the TV set

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.920
or the other screen that
you connect it to.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.070
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, so you can
develop against that without

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:12.720
having to have second
screens and stuff.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.810
SPARKY RHODE: So now how long do
we have wait for Nexus DS?

00:14:18.454 --> 00:14:19.861
RICH: [LAUGH]

00:14:19.861 --> 00:14:20.960
What's that?

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:21.830
I don't get it, Sparky.

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:22.650
NICK BUTCHER: Dual screen.

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:26.500
RICH: Oh, is that what DS stood
for in the Nintendo.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.484
I never knew that.

00:14:27.484 --> 00:14:27.976
SPARKY RHODE: Yeah.

00:14:27.976 --> 00:14:28.960
[LAUGH]

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:29.950
RICH: Go figure.

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:32.890
OK, so should we hit the
Moderator and get on with some

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:33.970
of the questions
for this week?

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:35.060
NICK BUTCHER: Unless-- we've
got a few new joiners.

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.853
Any other questions from
people in the Hangout?

00:14:37.853 --> 00:14:39.825
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Can
you hear me now?

00:14:39.825 --> 00:14:40.318
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:14:40.318 --> 00:14:42.783
RICH: Yeah hey, Yossi.

00:14:42.783 --> 00:14:44.810
YOSSI ELKRIEF: I had
a few questions.

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:49.800
First of all, I wanted to try
something with the Google

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:58.910
Calendar, maybe do something
very, very simple, but without

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:03.150
showing an intent to the user,
and basically schedule an

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:05.085
appointment into the calendar.

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:10.840
I know it's possible.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.782
I saw some code.

00:15:13.782 --> 00:15:18.680
But is it considered a good
convention, or I must show the

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.520
user the exact appointment
I'm scheduling?

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:25.360
NICK BUTCHER: It depends,
really.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.110
Like if you have a screen,
basically, showing the same

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:31.260
information that would go into
the create event screen, then

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.285
I think it's fine to just have
that within your UI, and have

00:15:34.285 --> 00:15:35.730
that add to [? calendar ?]

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:36.155
[? or just ?]

00:15:36.155 --> 00:15:38.500
[INAUDIBLE].

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.040
If you're just basically
recreating what the calendar

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.690
UI shows, then I would
probably say

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:45.990
just use the intent.

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:50.720
YOSSI ELKRIEF: The basic idea
was to just use the calendar

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:55.580
as a sort of time stamp for
actions you do, like, went to

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:59.830
the market, 10:15, answer
the phone, 10:20, and

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:01.300
so on, and so on--

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:04.170
just use it as a time stamp
for all events you want to

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:06.130
record on your--

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:07.540
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, so
you probably would

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:08.400
create your own calendar.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.090
So you probably wouldn't want to
write those into the user's

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:13.010
kind of like Google [INAUDIBLE],
or whatever, you

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:14.160
want to create your
own [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.880
or whatever calendar.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.550
And then create your events in
that so then the user can

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:20.280
wholesale, turn that calendar
on and off and hide and show

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:20.900
those events.

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.770
I think it probably sounds
like a good solution.

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:25.650
There's actually a great article
on Rockin' Android, if

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:27.460
you know that blog.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:29.980
By Wolfram, yeah, he's just been
doing a couple of posts

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:32.250
lately about working
with the calendar.

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:37.010
So I encourage you to
check those out.

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:40.870
RICH: And I actually had an
example right, when you pinned

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:43.086
an item from the conference
to fit it into

00:16:43.086 --> 00:16:44.300
your calendar as well.

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.920
Yeah, there's a sample code in
the Goolge I/O app as well.

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.330
YOSSI ELKRIEF: OK, I'll
check it, thanks.

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:52.960
RICH: I just wonder what you
guys thought of the photo

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.236
sphere that you've been
seeing on Google+.

00:16:56.236 --> 00:16:59.150
Did you see Hugo's video on how
to create a Photosphere

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:03.140
from outside building 44?

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:03.520
AUDIENCE: I saw yours.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.339
You put two up, didn't you?

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:07.349
RICH: Yeah, I did a couple more
last night as well, but I

00:17:07.349 --> 00:17:08.359
haven't posted them yet.

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:09.920
I might do one from this
Hangout, so you can get to see

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.270
everything in the room.

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:12.811
And then--

00:17:12.811 --> 00:17:14.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:14.859
RICH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:17.060
what are we both looking out--

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:17.890
there'd be a big blank thing.

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:18.910
It's a good point.

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:19.760
I could do one--

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:20.119
NICK BUTCHER: Censored.

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:23.132
RICH: Oh no, I could just
do a 2/3 photosphere.

00:17:23.132 --> 00:17:26.020
That's a photo hemisphere?

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:28.590
OK, I'm just looking through
the what's new for Android

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.795
4.2, and of course
photospheres is

00:17:30.795 --> 00:17:31.340
right at the top.

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.595
SPARKY RHODE: So you guys know
that the right way to make

00:17:33.595 --> 00:17:38.690
photosphere is not to turn
your body around, right?

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:41.840
If you do sort of swivel your
body around and move the phone

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.710
in a cylinder, you're going to
get parallax effects that make

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:45.880
for bad stitching.

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.380
If you want it to stitch
properly, you need to actually

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.790
pivot the camera around the
focal point of the lens.

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:55.230
RICH: But then you're going to
get your own face in it.

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:56.096
[INAUDIBLE] head.

00:17:56.096 --> 00:17:56.592
SPARKY RHODE: Right.

00:17:56.592 --> 00:17:57.390
RICH: Well, I don't know.

00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:59.500
Honestly I think it's good to
depend on how far away the

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.310
thing is that you're making
the photosphere of.

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:04.000
So the ones I've taken from
very large buildings and

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.365
outside don't seem to have
a problem, I guess.

00:18:06.365 --> 00:18:08.330
But the ones I've taken in
the office maybe have

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:10.200
more of that from--

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.800
you have to be slight more
careful taking it.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:12.660
SPARKY RHODE: That's
exactly right.

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:15.460
The parallax is way worse
on nearby objects.

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:18.440
RICH: Yes, exactly.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:22.985
OK, can we move to the
moderator now?

00:18:22.985 --> 00:18:25.880
Excellent.

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:28.360
SPARKY RHODE: I have not had as
much time to go through the

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.290
Moderator this week
as I usually do.

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:34.750
Fortunately, some of the other
readers have done it for me.

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:35.745
RICH: Yeah, thanks Chris.

00:18:35.745 --> 00:18:36.160
Cheers, guy.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:36.860
SPARKY RHODE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:37.990
giving some answers.

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:41.310
So thanks, Chris, yes.

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:45.100
"I'm running an app that listens
to incoming SMS, and

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:48.680
if the SMS contains special
text, I want to prevent it

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:52.270
from being received by a
third-party apps, eg Handset.

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:54.820
I tried abort broadcast and
setting Android priority.

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:55.820
It didn't work.

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.030
How can I do this?"

00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:03.770
And Chris basically said that
these other applications all

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:06.420
set their receivers to maximum
priority, which

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:08.110
means they get it first.

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:11.190
So there's no way you can
deterministically jump in line

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:12.340
in front of them.

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:15.434
In other words, sorry, but no.

00:19:15.434 --> 00:19:17.700
So no.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.796
NICK BUTCHER: Unless you
want to overflow int.

00:19:19.796 --> 00:19:21.250
RICH: Unless you--

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:22.530
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:22.640
SPARKY RHODE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.430
Moderator is a question
from Nick Butcher.

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:27.930
It's not really a question.

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:30.640
NICK BUTCHER: Oh, sorry, I put
that in there because we had a

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.250
problem with the GDL event,
and we couldn't

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:34.210
update it with the links.

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:36.275
So I added it in the moderator,
so it would appear

00:19:36.275 --> 00:19:37.880
on the right page.

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.410
SPARKY RHODE: And it did the job
because, without that, I

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:41.660
wouldn't be here.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.285
"Is there a way to alter the
standard font used, say,

00:19:48.285 --> 00:19:51.385
Roboto light, across a whole
application, including action

00:19:51.385 --> 00:19:54.290
bar, et cetera, or do you have
to do this manually in each

00:19:54.290 --> 00:20:01.080
activity and fragment." And he
also says, "Changing the font

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.130
is fairly difficult, Jelly Bean
allows you to use Roboto

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:08.000
light condensed via the new
font family XML attribute.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.390
Pre-Jelly Bean, it creates
a [INAUDIBLE] code."

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:14.620
Then he goes on to say, "I'd
like to create a custom text

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:18.750
view and override set typeface
to inject your custom font,

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:21.840
then use that text view instead
of the standard one."

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:22.400
I don't know.

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.920
Nick, what do you
think of that?

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.240
RICH: I don't know a better
way of doing it across the

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.180
entire application in
one fell swoop.

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:34.320
NICK BUTCHER: You could do it
in Jelly Bean not too bad.

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.376
You could basically use
the style-- create a

00:20:36.376 --> 00:20:37.170
custom style, right?

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:41.650
Where you find out where the
where font family is set and

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:42.310
override it.

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:44.000
RICH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.450
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, to using
the font family thing.

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:49.120
But to retrofit that onto a
pre-Jelly Bean world, yeah

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:50.520
it's not going to be easy.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:54.590
SPARKY RHODE: I know last week
I talked about sticking

00:20:54.590 --> 00:21:00.270
animate layout attributes in
the style at the top level.

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:02.110
Would this work, or this
not work for that?

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:07.370
NICK BUTCHER: So yeah, that
would totally work in the

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:10.260
post-Jelly Bean world where you
can set the font family

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:12.070
attribute for the
entire thing.

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:14.770
But in pre-Jelly Bean, before
the font family attribute, no.

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:19.180
But why would you ever
want to do that.

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:23.390
I think part of the reason an
action and everything is good

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:24.410
is because it's familiar.

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:27.210
If you start wholesale changing
everything-- is this

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:28.210
your question, Chris.

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:29.000
AUDIENCE: No, [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.700
NICK BUTCHER: Another Chris in
London, and then answered by

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:35.075
another Chris in London.

00:21:35.075 --> 00:21:38.570
Or there's a conversation with
yourself, perhaps, going on.

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:41.300
SPARKY RHODE: What can I
say, I'm schematically.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.080
I'm an engineer,
not an artist.

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.770
And I would never want to
screw with the stock UI.

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:46.500
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.150
SPARKY RHODE: I just want the
app to do what it does.

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:49.400
I don't care what
it looks like.

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:55.200
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, this
is setting off

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:59.110
alarm bells, this question.

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:01.350
Question why you need to
do this, is my advice.

00:22:04.654 --> 00:22:10.760
SPARKY RHODE: OK Peter in
Belgium says, "I'm integrating

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:11.960
a plus 1 button.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.900
But I want to use a
token returned by

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:17.580
google.authutil.getToken with
one of the scopes--

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:18.830
googleapis/on/plus.mean.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:25.340
But a first plus 1 interaction
still shows an extra

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:26.955
authorization dialogue.

00:22:26.955 --> 00:22:30.340
Is this possible?" I presume
he means is it possible to

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:31.525
show it without getting--

00:22:31.525 --> 00:22:33.350
RICH: To reuse the auth token,
yeah, so they don't need to

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:35.160
get the second authorization
dialogue.

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.700
Um, I'm slopey shoulders that
straight up to the Google+

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:41.060
developer office hours.

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:45.210
They manage their own APIs,
and libraries and things.

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:47.870
I haven't put a plus 1
button in my app yet.

00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:48.870
I know, right?

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:51.220
Why [INAUDIBLE] put a plus one
button for your whole app?

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:55.130
You're supposed one button on
the things that have real

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:57.360
world URLs.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.330
NICK BUTCHER: Right.

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:01.560
You can plus 1 the whole app,
and it would plus 1 the app

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.670
the listing in Play Store.

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:03.010
NICK BUTCHER: The Play
Store URL, yeah.

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:05.100
RICH: But I think it would be
more beneficial to if you had

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:06.680
a recipes app, and you were plus
1-ing the recipes, and

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:09.150
the recipes on the

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:11.260
because then, someone sees the
plus 1 in Google+, and they

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.240
can click on it.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.640
And there's somewhere
to go to.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.632
NICK BUTCHER: Got it.

00:23:15.632 --> 00:23:16.130
RICH: I don't know.

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:16.990
Makes more sense.

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:17.550
NICK BUTCHER: Plus
1 all the things.

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:18.686
RICH: Haven't tried
it, thought.

00:23:18.686 --> 00:23:21.190
Plus one-ing your app with the
Play Store URL, though, seems

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:23.230
like a very good thing
to do too, though.

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:24.630
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, I can see
that being in your about

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:25.540
screen also.

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:27.639
And if you had some kind
of screen like that?

00:23:27.639 --> 00:23:29.960
You could have a
little plus 1.

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.771
Well, this is speculation, of
course, because we haven't

00:23:32.771 --> 00:23:33.550
actually tried it.

developers.google.com/live.

00:23:38.761 --> 00:23:40.530
SPARKY RHODE: That's right.

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:43.180
We've got a couple of new
people in the Hangout.

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:43.620
Welcome newcomers.

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:46.490
Do you have anything that you'd
like to bring up for

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:47.900
discussion?

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:51.530
RICH: I recognize Leslie there
in the purple shirt.

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:53.627
Good to see you, any questions
this week, Leslie?

00:23:53.627 --> 00:23:56.112
No, yes.

00:23:56.112 --> 00:23:57.220
No, OK.

00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:00.090
Anyone else?

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:00.940
OK?

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:02.190
Next muffin.

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.230
SPARKY RHODE: "Are there best
practices or guidelines for

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:13.170
using Roboto light, Sans Serif
light font family in the app,

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:15.830
combining with other
font families.

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:18.710
For instance, using a light font
family for headers, big

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:21.725
text, and normal for
ordinary text.

00:24:21.725 --> 00:24:22.240
RICH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:23.160
physically sick.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.520
NICK BUTCHER: So we don't have
any official guidelines yet.

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:28.930
It's something I'd like
to see us lead on

00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:29.360
a little bit better.

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:33.210
In my personal opinion, I
like it for big text.

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:34.530
I like headers, like say there,
I think that it can

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:37.600
work really well if you provide
some contrast and

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.310
relief by using the
Roboto light.

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:41.390
And also if there's secondary
text as well.

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:43.260
So if there's a piece of
information which isn't of

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:46.920
primary importance, rather than
using a different font

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:50.570
color or the size, per se, you
can use a different weight to

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:52.640
give relative importance.

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.715
My caution there is using light
fonts at smaller sizes.

00:24:56.715 --> 00:25:00.150
You might end up affecting
legibility, especially on

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:01.100
smaller screens.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:04.240
So be cautious with
using it too much.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:07.610
So I'd say stick with Roboto
normal weight for most of your

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:10.570
body text, as it were because
that's a font that's been

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:13.740
optimized for most of these
general reading operations.

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:16.260
And it works for a variety
of densities.

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:20.640
And then use something like
Roboto light or thin.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:25.950
Yeah, in less often, in kind
of places to give relief.

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:28.450
SPARKY RHODE: So you're saying
use the lighter weight

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:30.920
typefaces in the larger sizes,
where they won't get

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:31.960
anti-aliased away.

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.150
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:34.650
SPARKY RHODE: Yeah.

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:37.950
I know from pretty much the
earliest days of WYSIWYG

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:44.810
topography, the general
guidance has been, use

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:47.330
multiple appearances in
your type sparingly--

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:49.535
think accent, not mishmash.

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:56.180
I don't know about you guys,
but there were definitely

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:59.080
times early on when I
was like, ooh, this

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.880
computer has 25 fonts.

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:05.220
I must use every one in my
documents, otherwise, I might

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:07.120
be missing an opportunity.

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.840
And I think the opportunity
I missed was legibility.

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:12.780
NICK BUTCHER: [LAUGH]

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:16.200
Yeah, well, one of the things I
always think as well that--

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.940
a screen can get too busy if you
have multiple font sizes.

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:21.410
So I've seen screens where
people are trying to use the

00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:24.030
size of font to basically
determine the importance of

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:24.630
the information.

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:26.610
So you might have like a
headline in a list item, and

00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:28.990
then some secondary text, and
then it might be like a count

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:30.900
in a third font size,
and so on.

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:33.840
And that can get really busy if
you're basically having all

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.480
these different line heights.

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.630
Essentially, it doesn't really
scan very easily.

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:39.100
It's quite hard to process,
and it makes you

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:40.930
think about it more.

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:43.500
So what you can do instead is
either use color or even a

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:46.180
lighter font face, so you will
maintain the same kind of line

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:47.360
height or X height.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:50.720
And just have some slight
contrast in the weight of the

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:51.390
font instead.

00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:54.314
So that makes it a bit
easier to read.

00:26:54.314 --> 00:26:57.120
SPARKY RHODE: Yeah, I think a
lot of HTML renders are kind

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:00.790
of annoying in the way they deal
with H1, H2, H3, H4, et

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:04.140
cetera because they do
scale in size and

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:05.200
weight quite a lot.

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.515
And it kind of makes for a
little busy appearance.

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:16.000
RICH: OK, so before we move on
to the next one, one other

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.970
nice new developer that's
come along with

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:21.990
Android 4.2 is the Daydream.

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:24.290
We now have, I guess, a similar

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:25.980
concept to screen savers.

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:31.580
When the device is plugged in
or docked, or inductively

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:34.730
charging, the device will
kind of go to sleep.

00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:36.362
And you can choose what's going
to be on the screen at

00:27:36.362 --> 00:27:38.685
that time, whether it's going
to be the weather forecasts,

00:27:38.685 --> 00:27:41.500
or news, but, of course, your
applications can make use of

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:44.025
these APIs to show your
own data as well.

00:27:44.025 --> 00:27:47.000
The user can choose to have your
own Daydream showing up

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:47.600
on the screen.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:51.020
Right now I have one
from Currents.

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:53.140
SPARKY RHODE: I love
the photostream.

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:56.260
RICH: And you can see the--

00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:57.702
not very well.

00:27:57.702 --> 00:28:00.366
We definitely, when we get off
studio, I need to have the

00:28:00.366 --> 00:28:01.680
HDMI around here.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:02.570
You can interact with the
currents as well as they're

00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:06.310
coming across onto the screen
and see all the latest news.

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:09.465
It just sits there, once it's
charge, giving you the latest

00:28:09.465 --> 00:28:10.170
up to date information.

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:13.055
It's a similar API to
live wallpapers.

00:28:13.055 --> 00:28:16.750
And you'll be seeing that in
the SDK when it comes out.

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:18.712
NICK BUTCHER: It's
called Daydreams.

00:28:18.712 --> 00:28:19.320
Daydreams.

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:20.530
Is the consumer features.

00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:23.100
I think it's just called
Dream in the SDK.

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:26.910
So I once the 4.2 SDK comes out,
just search for Dream.

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:28.880
In fact, there's already in
the compatibility SDK.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:31.620
There's a basic dream in there
which you can probably take a

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:35.850
loot at and have a look at some
of the APIs it offers.

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:37.540
It's going to similar to
something like the widget.

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:38.830
It's this kind of pervasive
awareness.

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:42.600
So if your application is
updating the background and

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.000
offering up new content, it's
another way to surface that.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.480
It's kind of cool.

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.330
If someone is like a big
football fan or something like

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:51.580
that, you might have transfer
new or something, whenever you

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:53.725
put your phone down, and it's
charging, you might just kind

00:28:53.725 --> 00:28:54.394
of [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:54.394 --> 00:28:57.358
It's kind of cool.

00:28:57.358 --> 00:28:58.840
RICH: Yeah.

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.200
I've switched between having
the weather online, the

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.020
weather forecasts,
and the news.

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:05.050
It's quite nice just to see
things going past that you're

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:07.460
interested in, very configurable
as well.

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:08.700
What was the-- oh,
we've seen that.

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:10.525
OK, next.

00:29:10.525 --> 00:29:12.440
SPARKY RHODE: Pavel's got
a question in sidebar.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:15.660
He says, still no love for 3D
camera in the Nexus line.

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:18.550
I don't want the 3D images,
I just want to see

00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:20.540
the depth of vision.

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:22.160
Interesting.

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:28.110
Well, I've got a lovely
LG Slate tablet

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:31.620
that's got 3D on it.

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:35.260
NICK BUTCHER: They released
an SDK for that, right?

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:35.980
AL SUTTON: Yeah.

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:39.050
SPARKY RHODE: It's
a proprietary--

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:42.180
AL SUTTON: It's quite funny that
every OEM who produced a

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:44.580
3D device never followed
it up with a second

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:47.420
device in same line.

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:49.720
The Optimus 3D was a one-off.

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:51.440
The LG Slate was a one-off.

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:54.500
There was an HTC phone, as
well, that was a one-off.

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:57.810
So I got the feeling it
didn't work well.

00:29:57.810 --> 00:30:01.390
RICH: LG did have the second in
the Optimus 3D phone range

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:04.280
at Barcelona this year, I just
never really saw it launch.

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:05.030
But at least it was thinner.

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:06.200
It didn't have that
big bulk on the

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.510
back for the two cameras.

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:09.470
NICK BUTCHER: Still
made my brain hurt

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:10.010
after a little while.

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:11.587
RICH: Still made your brain
hurt if you looked at that

00:30:11.587 --> 00:30:14.065
screen and didn't just freeze.

00:30:14.065 --> 00:30:16.190
NICK BUTCHER: But yeah, if you
are really passionate about

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:18.610
that, I guess the things you
could do would be, petitioner

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:21.180
LG to contribute it to
[INAUDIBLE], perhaps.

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:24.720
Beyond that--

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.080
SPARKY RHODE: Well, and as
far [? just having it ?]

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.680
something, what could
you use for that?

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:30.922
I mean--

00:30:30.922 --> 00:30:35.190
I don't know, maybe infer
something from focus?

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:36.170
That would be interesting.

00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:38.220
Maybe just try to get the focal
distance out of the

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:41.160
camera API or something.

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:48.840
I'm interested in getting
the device.

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.650
It's very easy to
get a device.

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:54.090
But I would like to see this
kind of sensor to be more

00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:55.340
widespread.

00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:02.220
And that's why I ask you about
this eventually being put in

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:07.150
the future Nexus devices because
if it's under 1% of

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:12.890
the market share, what's the
point of creating applications

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:17.325
for such type of use case.

00:31:17.325 --> 00:31:18.290
RICH: Yeah, that's a very
valid question.

00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:20.970
AUDIENCE: If the sensor
is everywhere, then

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:23.720

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:28.500
RICH: Yeah, I mean, the place
where you'd expect it to take

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:31.230
off first would be on the 3D
TVs, and councils, and things

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:32.300
like that, if it
was going to--

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:34.390
They've had a lot of chance
for it to happen.

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:35.400
As yet, it hasn't really.

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:39.510
My best experience with that has
been Gran Turismo 5, on a

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:41.030
PlayStation with a 3D TV.

00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:42.640
That's pretty moving.

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.890
And other people in the room
jumped when we crashed.

00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:45.620
All [? with our ?]

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:48.720

still needs another step

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.435
change in 3D technologies
for--

00:31:50.435 --> 00:31:51.400
NICK BUTCHER: Oh, it's
a screen thing.

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:53.422
I though it was camera thing
so you can see the depth.

create amazing concept.

AL SUTTON: I'd wait for the
Google Now card to pop up that

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:32.410
says, you're about to run into
something in 30 seconds.

00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:34.440
RICH: 30 seconds?

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.605
What, if you're running
really slowly.

00:32:36.605 --> 00:32:40.140
That moment in "Austin Powers"

NICK BUTCHER: [LAUGH]

00:32:42.876 --> 00:32:44.250
Just like that.

00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:45.347

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:51.230
SPARKY RHODE: Next question
on the Moderator.

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:55.450
"I'm trying to monitor the CPU
usage of running processes by

00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:59.100
running ADD shell top.

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:01.630
It works well in general, but
when testing an app that plays

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:04.020
music, CPU usage for the process
of running the service

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:05.590
stays at 0%.

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:10.190
Also on Stack Overflow, link
included." I suppose that's

00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:13.244
probably because it's being
handed off to hardware.

00:33:13.244 --> 00:33:16.130
You know, keep up a sample, you
hand it off to the audio

00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:18.972
subsystems, and the
CPU can step back.

00:33:18.972 --> 00:33:20.990
RICH: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:22.010

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.750
AL SUTTON: The other thing would
be, that, as well as

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:30.530
handing it off to the servers,
if it's not a rooted device,

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:34.120

You won't see systems,
necessarily.

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:44.490
NICK BUTCHER: That's
a good point.

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:46.210
RICH: Yeah, it could be worth
testing on a richer devices to

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:49.950
see if you do get any extra
information that's relevant.

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:51.890
So the next one, "Could you
please suggest a way to create

00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:55.970
a video of your app/game?" We've
had this three or four

00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:57.865
times in the past on
the office hours.

00:33:57.865 --> 00:34:02.090
The recommendations are buy a
Nexus 4 with Wireless Display

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:04.610
and an HDMI record.

00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:06.840
SPARKY RHODE: So I just take
my phone, and I point it at

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:11.590
the screen, and hold still,
hold still, hold still.

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:13.719
RICH: So the most recent videos
I've made have been

00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:17.050
using the hardware accelerated
an OpenGL accelerated

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:20.610
emulators, that seems to work
very well for me, and then

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:23.370
screen capturing software on
whatever system you're using

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:24.929
to create the video.

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:27.046
Otherwise, you can use
HDMI recorders and a

00:34:27.046 --> 00:34:28.170
device with HDMI out.

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:29.630
That works very well as well.

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:32.719
Black magic has some great boxes
for that kind of thing.

00:34:32.719 --> 00:34:33.659
But the cheapest way--

00:34:33.659 --> 00:34:34.884
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Use
two devices.

00:34:34.884 --> 00:34:37.820
RICH: Yep, using two devices.

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:40.220
Taking a video of the screen
isn't ideal , of course.

00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:41.850
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, your best
results are always going to be

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:43.730
HDMI capture.

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:47.770
Second best is proably going
to be emulator and then the

00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:49.225
easy screen capture.

00:34:49.225 --> 00:34:51.010
RICH: Oh, it's just those.

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:53.506
NICK BUTCHER: Emulator also,
like blue stacks even, so you

00:34:53.506 --> 00:34:56.250
can run it on your
host machine.

00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:57.600
SPARKY RHODE: That's an
interesting idea.

00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:01.490
I hadn't even thought of that.

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:03.320
RICH: Yeah, he suggests
Android screencast.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:05.000
I agree, Android screencast.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.290
Anything that's using ADB for
screen capturing is going to

00:35:08.290 --> 00:35:09.620
be a little bit on the sluggish
side, maybe one or

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:11.345
two frames a second.

00:35:11.345 --> 00:35:13.790
So I would probably steer
clear of that.

00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:15.230
SPARKY RHODE: I haven't
really messed around

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:16.200
with blue stack, thought.

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.560
How well does it work?

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:18.110
RICH: Sorry?

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:21.060
SPARKY RHODE: The blue stacks,
how well does that work?

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:23.200
Because I haven't
really tried it.

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.110
RICH: Anybody?

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:25.230
Anybody tried blue stacks?

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:26.720
Al must have done.

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.720
AL SUTTON: I played around with
an early alpha version of

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:31.585
it, and it was a little sluggish
and a little slow.

00:35:31.585 --> 00:35:33.390
They may have improved
it since then.

00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:33.800
But--

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.160
RICH: You could use Andro VM.

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:38.020
That's what [INAUDIBLE] mobile
were talking about at DroidCon

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:41.190
last week, and Gen Y mobile.

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:43.140
NICK BUTCHER: Was it Andro
VM, was that the answer?

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:45.500
It's a virtual box based--

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:46.960
RICH: Android VM.

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:47.990
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:50.010
AL SUTTON: And there was also
a product from a company

00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:53.160
called Lumitrade at DroidCon,
which was kind of a cradle for

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:55.070
a camera that would sit over
the top of the phone.

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:57.200
So you could lay the phone
flat and then just record

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:58.130
straight from that camera.

00:35:58.130 --> 00:36:00.670
And that's about 250
Euros, I think.

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:00.940
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:02.590
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, but then you
obviously get the finger

00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:03.010
in the way.

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:04.700
So it depends on what want.

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:06.715
If you want to demonstrate
people interacting, then

00:36:06.715 --> 00:36:07.570
that's one thing.

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:09.850
I quite like the product videos
which use the show

00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:10.810
touches thing.

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:13.830
So if you do an HDMI app
capture, [? show ?] touches

00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:16.950
from the developer menu, then
you get a little translucent

00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:18.615
white dot where you're touching,
which I think comes

00:36:18.615 --> 00:36:21.420
out quite well in
product videos.

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:23.660
SPARKY RHODE: I see Yossi also
has provided the URL for

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:23.950
androvm.org.

00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:25.200
Thanks for that, Yossi.

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:31.090
And question here, "Will the

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:38.500
How many possible per lock

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:41.770
[INAUDIBLE]?"

00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:43.370
RICH: I don't think we have
a definitive answer on

00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:45.190
that one right yet.

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:47.140
SPARKY RHODE: That
one's a little--

00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:49.710
RICH: Sorry Sparky?

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:51.180
Sparky was just about to
answer the question.

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:54.841
Maybe he had the answer
before dropping out.

00:36:54.841 --> 00:36:56.550
YOSSI ELKRIEF: The answer
was 42, no?

00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:58.720
RICH: 42, was that the answer?

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:03.550
Yeah, 4.2, you've got to read
something into that.

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:05.260
But yes, there will be
a developer API.

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:08.670
You'll be able to add lock

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:13.061
I haven't seen the API myself
yet, so I can't really comment

any more than that.

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:17.470

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:44.420
No, I have not done that.

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:45.570
Without any scrolling
animation.

00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:46.820
Unfortunately [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:51.920
No, I'd have to try that out.

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:53.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:54.000
RICH: Ask it on Stack

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.610
Sorry, is that Chris?

00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:57.380
AUDIENCE: I don't
think you can.

00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:58.580
Because the list view runs in
launcher, and so you can't

00:37:58.580 --> 00:37:59.930
access that at all.

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:02.410
So I can't think of a
way you could do it.

00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:04.610
NICK BUTCHER: But he seems to
be implying that you can

00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:05.920
scroll it with a scrolling
animation.

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:12.020
AUDIENCE: I didn't think you
could that, but I don't know.

00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:13.710
RICH: I just wonder if you can
reinitialize the widget at a

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:14.093
different position.

00:38:14.093 --> 00:38:17.010
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah, you
can, but not without

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:20.020
the scrolling animation.

00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:21.970
RICH: Can you override
the animation?

00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:24.360
YOSSI ELKRIEF: We
didn't try that.

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:28.625
The best thing we did was
imitate a scrolling list.

00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:37.370
So to avoid the scrolling
animation, we divided the

00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:43.260
widget into three parts and
show every time we show a

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:47.850
different part to imitate the
scrolling, basically.

00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:48.455
RICH: Fair enough.

00:38:48.455 --> 00:38:50.228
Sounds like it's not
too impossible.

00:38:50.228 --> 00:38:51.478
[INAUDIBLE]

00:38:56.460 --> 00:39:00.280
NICK BUTCHER: "Anything new with
the action bar in 4.2?" I

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:03.160
don't think so.

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:04.900
RICH: I haven't seen it in the
what's new [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:07.282
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE] have
to wait for the final SDK and

00:39:07.282 --> 00:39:09.370
check the [? dif ?] again,
but I don't think so.

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:09.870
RICH: Nope.

00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:13.130
OK, Sparky is going to join
us as soon as he can.

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:15.955
He's had some technical issues
with his battery running out.

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:24.060
NICK BUTCHER: "Does Nexus
7 support Miracast?"

00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:26.390
AL SUTTON: No.

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:28.755
It doesn't even support
HDMI out, so it

00:39:28.755 --> 00:39:31.840
couldn't support Miracast.

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:35.250
YOSSI ELKRIEF: The new version
will support, no?

00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:37.140
NICK BUTCHER: But you can
get [INAUDIBLE] support?

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:41.430
AL SUTTON: It's most likely
needs the HDCP keys installed.

00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:43.150
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah,
that's very true.

00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:45.520
AL SUTTON: Which wouldn't be on
if it's not HDMI enabled.

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:48.530
So even if it did, it wouldn't
be able to display protected

00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:50.230
content, which would stop
it playing Google

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:51.270
Play movies and stuff.

00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:53.780
And it seems to be the device
of choice for doing

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:55.442
that kind of thing.

00:39:55.442 --> 00:39:58.900
RICH: True, but mirroring the
screen and playing games on a

00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:01.910
TV using the device and things
like that wouldn't require

00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:02.710
those, necessarily.

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:04.330
I don't know.

00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:06.200
AL SUTTON: I also had a look
at the Miracast list of

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:07.480
approved devices.

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.560
And it's not up there
at the moment.

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:13.440
There is currently only the
Samson Echo P TVs, which are

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:20.310
yet to be released, the Nexus
4, Optimus G, and Galaxy S3.

00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:23.060
So I would say no for now.

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:26.190
But if a new one comes out
because the new on that's

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:28.360
launched for 3G has a different
power controller in

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:29.740
it, so it could in the future.

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:33.930
But I wouldn't see it as
possible in the short term.

00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:34.465
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:40:34.465 --> 00:40:35.710
RICH: Yeah, I don't
have any further

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:38.530
comments on it than that.

00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:41.240
But I have lost my moderator.

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:47.450
NICK BUTCHER: Where
are we up to?

00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:50.006
RICH: Next page.

00:40:50.006 --> 00:40:52.530
"My company's developing a
Bluetooth low-energy device.

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:58.360
Will Android 4.2 support BLE
in the SDK?" Don't know.

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:00.580
I think so, haven't checked.

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:05.680
NICK BUTCHER: I think we have
to want till 4.2 launches to

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:08.490
what finally made the
cut and what didn't.

00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:10.310
RICH: [LAUGH]

Did I somehow break the

00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:28.290
More detail on Stack
Overflow."

00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:29.450
NICK BUTCHER: Yes.

00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:30.240
RICH: You did something.

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:31.190
NICK BUTCHER: And it sounds
like you did.

00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:33.800
RICH: The specified child
already has a parent.

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:37.650
You must call remove view
on the parent first.

00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:42.870
NICK BUTCHER: Sounds like
you're inflating

00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:45.850
a fragment or something.

00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:48.290
Are you inflating, I think,
when you were doing your

00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:52.030
inflation of something,
you're doing it wrong.

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:53.280
RICH: Or you're trying to
do it more than once.

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:57.996
NICK BUTCHER: I'm trying to
read on Rich's screen.

00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:04.640
RICH: That's something that--
yeah, we should bounce that

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:06.530
one into next week's
office hours.

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:08.570
That kind of question we need
to get a little bit more in

00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:12.620
advance so that we can have a
good look through the pages of

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:15.160
stack traces and code that
you've attached to the report.

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:18.050
It doesn't make for good
watching to do it lives.

00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:20.350
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, to me, my
first gut instinct is that

00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:22.430
you're probably inflating
something that's already

00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:23.610
attached to something else.

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:25.650
One of the parameters when you
call inflator.inflate, the

00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:28.780
different XML stuff is,
you give it a parent.

00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:30.340
And you say whether or
not to attach it.

00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:33.070
And it sounds like you passing
a true when it's already

00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:34.100
attached to something.

00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:36.350
You should leave that to the
error, or maybe you should

00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:39.080
just pass false.

00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:43.285
So whenever your menu options
create it maybe.

00:42:43.285 --> 00:42:46.490
RICH: Oh, we'll bounce that
one to next week.

00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:47.360
That's fine.

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:48.920
Who just joined us
in the Hangout?

00:42:54.735 --> 00:42:55.750
Hugo, hey there Hugo.

00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:56.110
Good to see you.

00:42:56.110 --> 00:42:57.260
Have you got a question
for us today? day

00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:58.510
AUDIENCE: Yeah, actually
I have.

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:01.750
Can you hear me?

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:03.490
RICH: Yeah, yeah, I
can hear you fine.

00:43:03.490 --> 00:43:03.760
Go ahead, please.

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.725
AUDIENCE: I was at V-hack
this weekend.

00:43:05.725 --> 00:43:11.350
We were hacking on a food app,
and it has a few list views

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:17.450
with check boxes, and I had
some problems there with

00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:21.645
making a checkbook selected
after the data had loaded.

00:43:21.645 --> 00:43:24.560
So I have a cursor loader, where
it has loaded some stuff

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:26.060
from the database.

00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:29.140
And then I wanted to
make it selected.

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:33.350
And of course, it was a V-hack,
so I was hacking and

00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:36.990
doing ugly stuff
in the adapter.

00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:39.470
But that didn't work
on all devices

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:43.360
process for obvious reasons.

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:45.890
And then, in the end, I settled
with just unloading

00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:48.550
the data to the cursor loader,
and then, after the data was

00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:56.220
loaded, iterating the cursor
again to set the checked item

00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:57.640
on the list view.

00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.210
But it feels a little
bit clunky.

00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:02.240
So I was wondering what's
the proper way to do it.

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:04.360
Or is this the proper
way to do it?

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:07.930
Because I asked around to some
other devs and they didn't

00:44:07.930 --> 00:44:10.880
really have a proper answer.

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:11.910
NICK BUTCHER: So you're
extending simple cursor

00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:12.610
adapter, right?

00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:14.320
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.560
NICK BUTCHER: So you're using
your bind view method there.

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:19.930
So that will be the right place
to bind whatever the

00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:23.760
cursor's data is to
your UI, right?

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:27.210
AUDIENCE: I did that, but
then it messed up.

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:30.740
Well, I think what happened
there is that the check boxes

00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:33.680
are maybe selected, but the list
view itself doesn't know

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:35.535
it's selected for some reason.

00:44:35.535 --> 00:44:36.060
[INAUDIBLE]

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:37.235
the separation that I got.

00:44:37.235 --> 00:44:39.870
NICK BUTCHER: Did you try and
synchronize the state of the

00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:44.560
control within the list item
with the selected state of the

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:47.440
entire item?

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:49.890
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I guess that's
what I'm trying to do because

00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:53.430
what makes sense is that the
because you call sets item

00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:57.870
checked, I guess, what the
matter method is called on the

00:44:57.870 --> 00:45:01.050
list, so that, yeah, reflects
the state, and the view also

00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:03.290
gets updated, which
is quite nice.

00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:08.100
And likewise, if you touch
a list item, then it's

00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:11.330
automatically reflected
on the list?

00:45:11.330 --> 00:45:12.070
But yeah.

00:45:12.070 --> 00:45:13.310
I had some problems there.

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:14.320
So I'm not sure.

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:18.620
I want to generally make sure
that the list is in sync with

00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:23.030
the adapter and those kinds of
things, especially for things

00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:25.256
that are checked.

00:45:25.256 --> 00:45:28.650
RICH: Yeah, so if the data in
the adapter is changing

00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:31.620
outside of the list, then you're
got to notify the list

00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:32.430
of what's going on.

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:35.000
And if the user's pressing the
item on the list, you've got

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.880
to notify the adapter, or at
least change the data set

00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:39.030
behind it of what's going on.

00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:39.890
AUDIENCE: Yeah, actually the
pressing on the list

00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:41.070
automatically works.

00:45:41.070 --> 00:45:43.700
It's nothing that you
have to do for that.

00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:48.000
But my problem was loading the
initial values from the cursor

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.800
adapter because it loaded.

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:56.640
And if I would set it on the
view, for some reason, it

00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:58.000
wouldn't reflect.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.080
I'm not sure because

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:01.040
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:03.930
AUDIENCE: I did something
terribly wrong.

00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:06.500
NICK BUTCHER: What multi-set
mode are you

00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:07.120
setting on the list?

00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:08.780
Because it sounds like you've
got multiple items.

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:12.430
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I set
it to multi-select.

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:15.450
NICK BUTCHER: So you're setting
it to multiple.

00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:19.270
RICH: So are you loading all
the data into the list once

00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:20.770
and then going around a second
time for all the

00:46:20.770 --> 00:46:21.980
check boxes, then?

00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:25.400
AUDIENCE: Well, I basically
[INAUDIBLE] on the what is it,

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:27.280
the onload finished?

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:29.650
Or I'm not sure what is
the method in the

00:46:29.650 --> 00:46:31.560
cursor loader itself.

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:35.680
So what I eventually did, and
what worked on all devices was

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:38.320
just to iterate the cursor
again, see what's selected,

00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:40.590
and then call list
set item checked.

00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:43.120
But obviously, I don't
think that's the

00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:43.950
proper way to do it.

00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:46.640
But I wasn't sure.

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:48.242
NICK BUTCHER: No, my gut feeling
is you should be doing

00:46:48.242 --> 00:46:50.000
this in bind view.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:50.960
AUDIENCE: Yeah, OK.

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:53.380
RICH: Yeah, wait until you've
got the data before you.

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:56.910
AUDIENCE: OK, I'll just try it
again to see if I can figure

00:46:56.910 --> 00:47:02.350
out what is the problem, if I
have some more time for it.

00:47:02.350 --> 00:47:06.490
AL SUTTON: So Nick, is the
Nexus 4 made of soap?

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:08.310
NICK BUTCHER: That
was my 7 again.

00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:10.960
It survived this one though.

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:13.680
Yeah, it survived.

00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:15.740
[INAUDIBLE].

00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:17.840
SPARKY RHODE: So it's still an
Nexus 7, it's not a Nexus 6

00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:20.170
and 1/2 now?

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:21.650
NICK BUTCHER: [LAUGH]

00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:22.960
RICH: What was that that
came in on the

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:25.710
chat window from Francisco.

00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:30.220
"I want to buy the Nexus 4 but
I don't know whether to buy

00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:32.930
now or in a couple of months."

00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:34.280
NICK BUTCHER: Maybe Google--

00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:36.950
SPARKY RHODE: I don't think
you can buy now.

00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:38.200
RICH: Oh yeah, we're certainly
not going to--

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:44.892
and then Yossi says just
override the bind view method.

00:47:44.892 --> 00:47:45.776
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:45.776 --> 00:47:46.830
NICK BUTCHER: I'd say buy now.

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:49.230
Like, I got the 8 gig one, and
I haven't really been butting

00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:51.000
up against the storage limit.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.390
I don't play tons
of big games.

00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:55.220
Probably get a 16
gig, big enough.

00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:56.760
RICH: I'd get a 16 gig.

00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:58.660
SPARKY RHODE: Are you talking
about the Nexus 7?

00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:00.140
RICH: Nexus 4s.

00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:00.540
SPARKY RHODE: Oh, OK.

00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:02.940
Because I do have the
8 gig Nexus 7.

00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:07.880
And it's only got about six
gigs of user accessible

00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:10.660
storage, and that goes fast.

00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:13.120
I mean, I think I've got
probably four games, each of

00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:16.450
which has more than a gig and
a half of extra data.

00:48:16.450 --> 00:48:17.770
So there you go.

00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:19.440
There's your storage.

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:20.230
RICH: Yeah, totally.

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:23.900
I'm running a 16 gig Nexus 7,
and I've got an 8 gig Nexus 4

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:24.750
as well, actually,
and I haven't had

00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:25.350
any issues with it.

00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:26.730
But if I was buying one,
I'd definitely go

00:48:26.730 --> 00:48:29.080
for the 16 for myself.

00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:31.590
I use a lot of the Google
services, surprisingly enough.

00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:32.490
[LAUGH]

00:48:32.490 --> 00:48:33.740
So a lot my data's
in the cloud.

00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:37.390
Yeah, all my music's in Google
music and Spotify, so it's not

00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:39.200
much local.

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:41.100
It's the 11 hour flight to San
Francisco, to go to my

00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:43.970
interview will be where
you use it the most.

00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:44.830
RICH: Yeah.

00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:46.550
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:49.480
AL SUTTON: And then the Google
Play services have rolled out

00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:50.720
into more countries,
or are rolling

00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:51.750
out into more countries.

00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:54.312
So you can buy movies and do
things like that, aren't they?

00:48:54.312 --> 00:48:57.110
RICH: Yeah, music's coming,
movies coming.

00:48:57.110 --> 00:48:58.590
Movie purchases are
coming, sorry, we

00:48:58.590 --> 00:49:00.390
already have movie rentals.

00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:01.350
AL SUTTON: That's
just brilliant.

00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:03.690
AUDIENCE: Oh, so music's
coming over?

00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:05.380
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, that got
announced on Monday as well.

00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:07.615
It might have got missed in the
slew of announcements, but

00:49:07.615 --> 00:49:13.976
music is coming to UK, Germany,
France, Italy--

00:49:13.976 --> 00:49:15.510
RICH: We can check, but yeah.

00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:17.220
NICK BUTCHER: Can't remember.

00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:17.790
[INAUDIBLE]

00:49:17.790 --> 00:49:19.120
RICH: Europe.

00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:19.650
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, its good.

00:49:19.650 --> 00:49:22.490
I'm really pleased.

00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:23.330
RICH: [INAUDIBLE]
can be amazing.

00:49:23.330 --> 00:49:25.320
I just can't wait for that.

00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:27.340
I see a lot of the promotions
that go on in Google music on

00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:29.850
the US side, and some of the
promotions are insanely good.

00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:32.065
And I wish I could buy them,
and then I press it, and it

00:49:32.065 --> 00:49:32.440
doesn't work.

00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:34.367
NICK BUTCHER: So especially if
you guys, like us, are kind of

00:49:34.367 --> 00:49:38.600
moving between devices fairly
often, then, yeah, you don't

00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:40.690
have to have the pain
of moving all your

00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:41.590
music over or whatever.

00:49:41.590 --> 00:49:43.730
It just follows you around.

00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:46.150
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I mean, I've had
the cloud bit for a while,

00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:48.890
because I'd signed
up via proxy.

00:49:48.890 --> 00:49:51.340
RICH: Ah, sneaky.

00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:52.040
[INAUDIBLE]

00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:53.848
What were you going
to say, sorry?

00:49:53.848 --> 00:49:55.210
AUDIENCE: No, go on.

00:49:55.210 --> 00:50:00.250
RICH: I always have this play
list called offline on my

00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:02.482
Google Music, and whenever I
sign into a new device, that's

00:50:02.482 --> 00:50:03.570
the one I just pin it offline.

00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:06.490
And then, if I'm on the web, or
on any device, and I move

00:50:06.490 --> 00:50:08.435
anything into the offline Play
list, it instantly syncs down

00:50:08.435 --> 00:50:09.640
to all my devices.

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:09.990
AUDIENCE: Nice.

00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:11.722
RICH: It's kind of cool.

00:50:11.722 --> 00:50:13.500
So if you buy a new track, I
just set it to be in the

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:16.210
playlist offline because I go
on the London Underground a

00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:18.140
lot, I need offline music.

00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:22.610
So I can always set my playlist
up, which is fun.

00:50:22.610 --> 00:50:26.460
OK, Al says he's just read the
blog post, and Google Play

00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:29.730
Music is heading to UK, France,
Germany, Italy, Spain

00:50:29.730 --> 00:50:31.651
this November.

00:50:31.651 --> 00:50:32.725
NICK BUTCHER: Cool, Spain.

00:50:32.725 --> 00:50:33.210
That's what I missed.

00:50:33.210 --> 00:50:35.460
RICH: Yes.

00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:36.985
Do we have anything left
in the Moderator?

00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:43.830
SPARKY RHODE: I don't know what

00:50:43.830 --> 00:50:45.670
happened while I was offline.

00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:46.740
RICH: I'm just looking now.

00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:48.910
There's one about
a chronometer.

00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:51.710
"I would like to use Roboto
light for the chronometer, but

00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:55.520
it seems the width for zero in
light differs from the others

00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:56.220
[? digits ?].

00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:57.820
Hence, there's some
shifting when

00:50:57.820 --> 00:50:59.580
chronometer passes zeroes.

00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:02.510
Is there anyway to solve this
problem other than using

00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:04.580
another font?" I have
the same issue.

00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:07.660
I've been redoing a Chronometer
style application

00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:13.370
recently, and I get a wiggle
in the time when I'm using

00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:15.050
Roboto light.

00:51:15.050 --> 00:51:16.800
So yeah, you can change
the font.

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:18.890
You can choose not just
have it centered.

00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:21.190
If [? you fix ?] the position.

00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:23.030
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Wiggle
is a feature.

00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:24.610
RICH: Wiggle is a feature.

00:51:24.610 --> 00:51:27.140
It drives me insane.

00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:29.560
I'm not quite to sure.

00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:30.830
You know that it's
not fixed-width.

00:51:30.830 --> 00:51:32.480
NICK BUTCHER: You could ask
Christian why it's not fixed

00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:34.572
width, or should it
be fixed width.

00:51:34.572 --> 00:51:35.700
It's open source.

00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:38.790
You could edit the glyphs,
make it fixed width.

00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:39.640
RICH: Especially if
it's just zero.

00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:40.785
I didn't know which
character it was

00:51:40.785 --> 00:51:42.035
that doing the shifting.

00:51:45.042 --> 00:51:46.480
[INAUDIBLE]

00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:47.920
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, I'm not sure
if it's basically fixed

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:49.170
width or not.

00:51:52.734 --> 00:51:55.170
RICH: Can you see it shifting?

00:51:55.170 --> 00:51:58.240
Can you see that bright light?

00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:00.455
At what point is it going to
decide that this isn't all

00:52:00.455 --> 00:52:03.050
just white.

00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:04.690
NICK BUTCHER: Ah, the
wiggle the wiggle.

00:52:04.690 --> 00:52:05.820
RICH: The wiggle, oh my god.

00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:07.396
Sneak preview of the new
ultimate stop watch and timer

00:52:07.396 --> 00:52:09.052
coming soon to the Play Store.

00:52:09.052 --> 00:52:11.500
[INAUDIBLE] this is brilliant.

00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:14.120
Thank you very much, Marie.

00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:16.170
Well, we're out questions
from the

00:52:16.170 --> 00:52:17.780
Moderator, as far as I know.

00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:20.860
NICK BUTCHER: And Patrick says
yeah, what is the benefit of

00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:21.910
Google Play Music.

00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:23.510
Right now, nothing.

00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:24.560
RICH: Well, I wouldn't
say that.

00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:26.343
I would say it drives users
into the Play Store, where

00:52:26.343 --> 00:52:27.710
they will also find
your applications.

00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:27.880
NICK BUTCHER: That's true.

00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:30.670
RICH: It increases traffic to
the place where your apps are.

00:52:30.670 --> 00:52:32.560
NICK BUTCHER: More users with
forms of payment on record.

00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:35.470
So it's easier for you to buy
your apps, this is true.

00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:38.070
RICH: But if you're asking,
directions, creation, APIs,

00:52:38.070 --> 00:52:38.990
things like that, there
aren't any.

00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:40.985
NICK BUTCHER: There's no APIs,
or affiliate schemes, or

00:52:40.985 --> 00:52:43.010
anything like that.

00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:44.610
SPARKY RHODE: It's certainly
true that, several times a

00:52:44.610 --> 00:52:49.070
week, I go to Google Play, and
I look at music, and it says,

00:52:49.070 --> 00:52:50.420
get music for free.

00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:55.090
And I click on music for free
and it says, Google Play Music

00:52:55.090 --> 00:52:56.370
is not available in
your country.

00:52:56.370 --> 00:52:58.530
And I say, OK, fine, I'll go
download an app instead.

00:52:58.530 --> 00:52:59.810
RICH: [LAUGH]

00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:01.250
NICK BUTCHER: Can you use it
to release the original

00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:03.590
soundtrack from your game, yeah,
there's a scheme where

00:53:03.590 --> 00:53:07.120
can sign up to sell the music
that you made, your own, yeah.

00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:09.220
Much like you can as an app
developer, there is a similar

00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:10.740
thing for musicians.

00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:13.260
RICH: Yeah, you can share music
with people for free.

00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:15.120
You can ask people
to buy music.

00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:16.870
There's a good ecosystem
inside Google

00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:20.590
Music for all of that.

00:53:20.590 --> 00:53:21.500
Any other questions?

00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:22.030
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah,
you're right.

00:53:22.030 --> 00:53:23.500
There are benefits
to a developer.

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:26.180
Yeah, it's that whole mall thing
we're trying to develop

00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:27.180
with Google Play.

00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:30.900
We're trying to make Google Play
this place you go to buy

00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:32.690
valuable content.

00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:34.620
And I think it's like a training
thing for users, so

00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:37.200
people get used to going there,
and spending money, and

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:39.670
having a trusted, paid
relationship with the store.

00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:42.500
And I think that's a really
good thing for developers.

00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:45.000
So yeah, I was a bit too
flippant before.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.310
RICH: Actually, I haven't been
checking the comments thread.

00:53:48.310 --> 00:53:50.575
So I'll just have a quick look
to see if anyone's posted any

00:53:50.575 --> 00:53:52.105
questions on Google+.

00:53:52.105 --> 00:53:58.780
"Can you recommend a Bluetooth
keyboard for Nexus 10?" I

00:53:58.780 --> 00:54:00.310
haven't tried any, sorry.

00:54:00.310 --> 00:54:03.290
I have tried a Wacom tablet,
and that worked very nicely

00:54:03.290 --> 00:54:04.530
with markers.

00:54:04.530 --> 00:54:06.890
But I haven't tried--

00:54:06.890 --> 00:54:09.750
SPARKY RHODE: If anybody hasn't
tried it, and you get

00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:11.450
the chance, try out the
gesture typing.

00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:12.700
It's magical.

00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:18.390
NICK BUTCHER: If by anyone,
you mean, you or us.

00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:19.620
RICH: All the people that don't
get access to it for

00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:21.784
next couple of weeks haven't
tried it yet.

00:54:21.784 --> 00:54:23.500
SPARKY RHODE: Yeah, even on the
10 inch tablet, which is

00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:26.727
perfectly big enough for touch
typing, the gestures still

00:54:26.727 --> 00:54:28.210
work wonderfully.

00:54:28.210 --> 00:54:30.610
NICK BUTCHER: I love the fact
that you don't have to switch

00:54:30.610 --> 00:54:31.220
keyboard or anything
like that.

00:54:31.220 --> 00:54:33.750
Because when I have two hands,
I thumb, I tap out.

00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:35.250
And then when I have
one hand, I swipe.

00:54:40.750 --> 00:54:42.730
AL SUTTON: There's a really meta
question in the comments,

00:54:42.730 --> 00:54:44.470
"How do I post questions?"

00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:45.392
RICH: I saw that.

00:54:45.392 --> 00:54:47.240
[LAUGH]

00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:49.010
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:54:49.010 --> 00:54:50.490
RICH: Yeah, no, I think he's
asking about where

00:54:50.490 --> 00:54:51.300
this chat stream is.

00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:53.440
Of course, it's inside the
Hangout, so people from

00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:54.290
outside cant see it.

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:56.380
We always try and read
those questions out.

00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:58.080
But you can ask questions
in the Moderator at

00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:02.845
developers.googl
e.com/live/android.

00:55:02.845 --> 00:55:04.750
NICK BUTCHER: Slash bleh.

00:55:04.750 --> 00:55:06.910
RICH: Or in the comment thread
that you just asked the

00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:09.090
question in.

00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:10.790
SPARKY RHODE: More specifically,
that URL that

00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:13.606
Rich said, and then
find this event.

00:55:13.606 --> 00:55:15.240
And put it in the Moderator
for this event.

00:55:18.130 --> 00:55:20.340
RICH: Jamie was asking, maybe
he missed it , actually,

00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:23.980
because he joined 14 minutes in
about the "Will the cache

00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:27.660
directory from multiple user
accounts get external cache

00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:28.150
directory?"

00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:29.915
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, if you're
doing the right thing, and you

00:55:29.915 --> 00:55:32.955
getting all the system calls to
get the directories, then

00:55:32.955 --> 00:55:36.470
it should just work
transparently to you.

00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:37.870
SPARKY RHODE: And they'
not shared, right?

00:55:37.870 --> 00:55:40.370
NICK BUTCHER: No, yeah, it'd
be individual per user.

00:55:40.370 --> 00:55:41.360
RICH: "When does [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:44.560
come for the Galaxy Nexus?"

00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:47.370
YOSSI ELKRIEF: So basically,
only the external storage is

00:55:47.370 --> 00:55:50.620
shared between users?

00:55:50.620 --> 00:55:52.364
NICK BUTCHER: No,
the whole world.

00:55:52.364 --> 00:55:53.630
The whole everything.

00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:54.880
[INAUDIBLE]

00:55:59.410 --> 00:56:03.370
RICH: No one know about the
release date of Galaxy Nexus.

00:56:03.370 --> 00:56:05.660
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, we can't
comment on release dates for

00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:07.120
Galaxy Nexus because
we don't know.

00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:09.840
But typically, what's happened
in the past is, it tends to be

00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:10.560
a couple of weeks.

00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:13.810
Like, older devices will tend
to get an OTA a couple weeks

00:56:13.810 --> 00:56:18.020
after the new devices
go onsale.

00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:20.110
SPARKY RHODE: Yeah, basically,
let the dust

00:56:20.110 --> 00:56:21.820
settle on the new stuff.

00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:22.240
Because--

00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:25.700
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, so 4.1 came
out with the Nexus 7 in

00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:28.430
Google I/O, and then it was,
what, a couple of weeks

00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:29.340
[INAUDIBLE]

00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:30.985
before it OTA'd to the
Galaxy Nexus, I

00:56:30.985 --> 00:56:32.140
mean, that's been typical.

00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:34.500
But I don't know

00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:38.730
RICH: Most of these devices also
have wired HDMI out of

00:56:38.730 --> 00:56:41.470
some sort or another, as
well as the Miracast.

00:56:41.470 --> 00:56:46.220
The Nexus 10 has a micro
HDMI slot on the side.

00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:48.030
And the Nexus 4 is using--

00:56:48.030 --> 00:56:48.720
NICK BUTCHER: Simport.

00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:52.540
RICH: Yeah, sim variety of
display port, which adapters

00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:55.920
appear to be appearing on
Amazon at the moment.

00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:57.780
NICK BUTCHER: Oh cool, actually,
because the HDMI MHL

00:56:57.780 --> 00:56:59.430
adapters always have to powered
to be powered, right?

00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:01.759
You always have to plug in a
power source as well as an

00:57:01.759 --> 00:57:04.560
HDMI, whereas I believe the
Slimport doesn't require the

00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:06.140
power, so it's just
an adapter.

00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:08.150
RICH: It doesn't require the
power, but it still has power

00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:10.360
socket on, so you can still
charge your phone whilst it's

00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:12.380
plugged in, which is probably
a good idea.

00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:15.390
But yeah, cool, the one
that I've seen so far.

00:57:15.390 --> 00:57:16.570
So I'll be picking one
of those up for

00:57:16.570 --> 00:57:17.440
presentations soon.

00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:18.450
NICK BUTCHER: Another
dongle to buy.

00:57:18.450 --> 00:57:19.960
RICH: Another dongle to buy.

00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:24.049
And a new TV to buy, with
Miracast support because I

00:57:24.049 --> 00:57:25.360
don't want to stick
[INAUDIBLE].

00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:27.600
SPARKY RHODE: It just blows my
mind to think of using a phone

00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:31.530
to drive pictures onto
my 42 inch TV.

00:57:31.530 --> 00:57:32.990
RICH: Yeah, those
TVs are pretty

00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:34.370
high-res these days, right.

00:57:34.370 --> 00:57:36.710
SPARKY RHODE: We are so
living in the future.

00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:39.100
NICK BUTCHER: I'm so excited
about the two-screen API.

00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:40.920
I think it's going to
drive a whole bunch

00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:42.090
of interesting apps.

00:57:42.090 --> 00:57:42.750
RICH: I totally agree.

00:57:42.750 --> 00:57:45.610
The two-screen API, absolutely
awesome for gaming, for apps,

00:57:45.610 --> 00:57:48.220
presentation, even YouTube.

00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:49.820
Even YouTube.

00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:53.680
All these things can benefit a
lot from dual-screen APIs.

00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:54.780
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, the API
hasn't been released yet, but

00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:56.430
if you want to start thinking
about it, basically, you'll

00:57:56.430 --> 00:57:59.340
see the second screen is going
to be a bit like a dialogue.

00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:00.890
So your app completely
contains it.

00:58:00.890 --> 00:58:02.920
It's not like you can have one
thing going on in one screen

00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:05.260
and running, [INAUDIBLE] they
are entirely linked, so your

00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:07.590
app owns, like, a dialogue which
is on the big screen.

00:58:07.590 --> 00:58:11.090
So start thinking about that,
how you might draw to another

00:58:11.090 --> 00:58:12.540
dialogue, as it were.

00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:13.660
And that will have
its own context.

00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:17.760
So it will load the right
resolution, durable, and

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:20.843
things for the screen size, and
whatever of the TV it's

00:58:20.843 --> 00:58:21.810
running on.

00:58:21.810 --> 00:58:24.070
AL SUTTON: Is there any
compatibility layer for Google

00:58:24.070 --> 00:58:27.670
TV's second screen API?

00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:29.880
NICK BUTCHER: Second screen
API is just for passing

00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:32.910
intents and saying, go
run this, right?

00:58:32.910 --> 00:58:35.840
It doesn't actually do a
companion app type thing.

00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:38.040
I think it's a different
problem with a

00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:43.030
similar name, I think.

00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:44.000
Matt?

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.680
RICH: [LAUGH]

00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:46.680
Virtual Matt Android.

00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:47.980
We should have him dialed in.

00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:50.457
I forgot to thank the guys at
Sony, Sony developers, for

00:58:50.457 --> 00:58:52.400
giving me this T-shirt
at DroidCon as well.

00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:54.350
Android Attacks, dum dum dum.

00:58:54.350 --> 00:58:55.525
Thank you very much, Sonny--

00:58:55.525 --> 00:58:58.800
NICK BUTCHER: For that
terrifying T-shirt.

00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:00.170
It's kind of Halloween, right?

00:59:00.170 --> 00:59:01.480
We've got Halloween
theme going on all

00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:02.180
over the office today.

00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:06.020
So a big Android crushing
cities, I don't know, seem to

00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:07.400
work for me.

00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:10.130
And with that, it's the end
of this week's Hangout.

00:59:10.130 --> 00:59:11.980
Thank you all for joining.

00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:16.020
We will see you again next
Wednesday, 2 PM.

00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:18.350
We're slightly shifted out of
the US time zone right now

00:59:18.350 --> 00:59:19.460
because they change
their clocks at

00:59:19.460 --> 00:59:20.530
different time to us.

00:59:20.530 --> 00:59:22.822
NICK BUTCHER: So catch them in
seven hours, I guess, right?

00:59:22.822 --> 00:59:24.766
RICH: Perhaps in seven hours.

00:59:24.766 --> 00:59:27.140
And have a good week.

00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:27.670
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Thanks guys.

00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:30.840
AUDIENCE: Yeah guys,
bye, thank you.

00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:32.090
NICK BUTCHER: Cheers.
