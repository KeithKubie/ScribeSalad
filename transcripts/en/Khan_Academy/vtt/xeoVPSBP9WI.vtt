00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.188
- [Voiceover] We're on the fractions

00:00:01.188 --> 00:00:04.485
on the number line
exercise on Khan Academy,

00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:06.970
and they ask us to move the orange dot

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.965
to three-fourths on the number line.

00:00:09.965 --> 00:00:11.799
Change the number of divisions

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:14.562
to create tick marks on the number line.

00:00:14.562 --> 00:00:16.002
Let's see what's going on here.

00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:19.020
I have the space from zero
to one on the number line.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.738
If I want to move it to three-fourths,

00:00:20.738 --> 00:00:22.178
what I would first want to do

00:00:22.178 --> 00:00:25.127
is divide the space between
zero and one into fourths,

00:00:25.127 --> 00:00:27.031
into four equal sections.

00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:29.492
I would want to have four divisions here.

00:00:29.492 --> 00:00:31.767
And there you have it, four divisions.

00:00:31.767 --> 00:00:34.391
I typed in the number four
and have four equal divisions.

00:00:34.391 --> 00:00:36.342
One, two, three, four.

00:00:36.342 --> 00:00:39.639
This is going to be a fourth,
that's another fourth,

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:41.612
that's another fourth,
and that's another fourth.

00:00:41.612 --> 00:00:44.375
What we care about is three-fourths.

00:00:44.375 --> 00:00:45.861
Once again, that's one-fourth,

00:00:45.861 --> 00:00:47.092
this would be another fourth,

00:00:47.092 --> 00:00:48.753
getting us to two-fourths,

00:00:48.753 --> 00:00:49.971
and then this would be another fourth,

00:00:49.971 --> 00:00:51.573
getting us to three-fourths.

00:00:51.573 --> 00:00:52.920
So, there you have it.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.862
That is three-fourths on the number line.
