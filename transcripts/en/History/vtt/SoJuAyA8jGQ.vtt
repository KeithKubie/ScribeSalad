00:00:01.418 --> 00:00:02.794
- All right, gentlemen.

00:00:02.794 --> 00:00:04.504
Now we're going to get
to the heart of who

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:05.797
is our next "Forged in Fire"
champion by testing your blades

00:00:05.797 --> 00:00:07.841
in a kill test,
a sharpness test,

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:10.218
and, of course, up
first, the strength test.

00:00:10.218 --> 00:00:12.053
Dave?

00:00:12.053 --> 00:00:13.263
All right, gentlemen.

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:14.723
Now here on "Forged
in Fire" we have

00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:16.182
a small elite group
we like to call

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:17.851
the Bulletproof Blade Club.

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:19.519
Hopefully you'll
both be joining.

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:20.770
To test the strength
of your weapon,

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.689
we'll be firing a
.45-caliber round

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.107
at the edge of that blade.

00:00:24.107 --> 00:00:25.650
Now you're both veterans.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.194
The .45's a military weapon,
so the cutlass you made

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:29.946
is a military sword.

00:00:29.946 --> 00:00:32.824
So we're going to use our own
military weapon in this test.

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:34.951
Third ranger battalion
and former Air

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:36.828
Force para-rescuemen,
Will Willis

00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:38.538
will be firing the round.
All right, Jon.

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:39.539
You're up first.
You ready?

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.207
Hell yeah.

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:43.501
The fact that Will
is going to fire

00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:47.046
freehand his pistol at my
blade, I can't believe this.

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:48.757
[bleep] damn.

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:51.134
A sword is not meant to meet
up with a bullet on its edge.

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:54.637
I am sweating bullets,
no pun intended.

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:56.931
[music playing]

00:01:01.352 --> 00:01:03.271
[gunshot]

00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:05.148
There it is.

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:06.483
[gunshot]

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.573
Woo!

00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:14.991
All right.

00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:16.618
Jon, I was running my
fingernail across here,

00:01:16.618 --> 00:01:19.245
and I thought I was feeling
nicks in your blade.

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:21.706
What I'm actually feeling
is material from the bullet

00:01:21.706 --> 00:01:23.625
that's hung up on the edge.

00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:24.834
Congratulations.

00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:25.752
You got a bulletproof sword.

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:26.544
Thank you, sir.

00:01:26.544 --> 00:01:27.378
All right, Mike.

00:01:27.378 --> 00:01:28.087
You ready for this?

00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:28.713
Let's do this.

00:01:28.713 --> 00:01:29.714
OK.

00:01:29.714 --> 00:01:32.550
[music playing]

00:01:37.138 --> 00:01:37.972
[gunshot]

00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:50.318
I think that did it.

00:01:50.318 --> 00:01:54.155
So Mike, your blade
held up really well.

00:01:54.155 --> 00:01:56.574
You can see, right
here, where that bullet

00:01:56.574 --> 00:01:58.743
went right across the blade.

00:01:58.743 --> 00:02:00.829
The edge is still there.

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:01.371
Welcome to the club.

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:08.461
Bladesmiths, this
is the kill test.

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:10.713
Let's see how deadly
your weapons are.

00:02:10.713 --> 00:02:12.131
Jon, you're up first.
You ready?

00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:13.424
Rock and roll.

00:02:13.424 --> 00:02:15.009
I built this thing to kill.

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:19.764
It's not some
flashy museum piece.

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:23.059
[music playing]

00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:40.827
I didn't think
it went that deep.

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:42.078
All right, Jon.

00:02:42.078 --> 00:02:43.746
First up, the
handle construction

00:02:43.746 --> 00:02:45.373
is comfortable with me.

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:46.624
I had no issues at all with
this catching on anything.

00:02:46.624 --> 00:02:48.126
I was able to move around it.

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:50.628
The point easily pierced
through this and lacerates

00:02:50.628 --> 00:02:51.921
on the way out.

00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:53.381
The balance of the
weight of the blade

00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:55.091
is forward enough to
where I cut through right

00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:58.678
into the clavicle, into
the ribs, into the lungs.

00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:02.015
Jon, this weapon will kill.

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:03.224
Thank you, sir.

00:03:03.224 --> 00:03:04.601
Mike, you're ready.
You up for this?

00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:06.561
Let's do it.

00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:08.938
[music playing]

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.085
All right, Mike.

00:03:31.085 --> 00:03:32.587
Let's talk about your
cutlass right here.

00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:34.923
First up, it's a lot
heavier than the other sword

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:36.507
but it's all centered down here.

00:03:36.507 --> 00:03:38.676
That curved edge
really lends itself

00:03:38.676 --> 00:03:41.304
to a nice lacerating weapon.

00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:43.014
The only one thing I
have to say about this

00:03:43.014 --> 00:03:45.975
is it's a very big handle.

00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:47.977
There's a lot of
space right here.

00:03:47.977 --> 00:03:50.563
So I have to choke up to get
the right feel for the blade.

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:54.067
But overall, sir, it will kill.
Good job.

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:55.526
Thank you.

00:03:55.526 --> 00:03:58.529
Jon, Mike, we here
at "Forged in Fire"

00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:00.073
want to thank you
for your service.

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:02.158
I'm a former service
member, so is Doug.

00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:04.535
We understand that sacrifice.

00:04:04.535 --> 00:04:06.412
In this arena of competition,
there can only be

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:08.331
one "Forged in Fire" champion.

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:12.043
Both of your blades performed
exactly as we expect them to.

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:14.671
They're strong, they're
sharp, they're deadly,

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:18.049
so this is a decision that came
down to the finest details.

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.346
Our new "Forged in
Fire" champion is Jon.

00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:25.014
Congratulations.

00:04:25.014 --> 00:04:29.852
Mike, unfortunately your
blade did not make the cut.

00:04:29.852 --> 00:04:31.896
This is why we have
these kinds of competitions

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:33.731
when it comes to be that close.

00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:36.442
So we have to look
at the finest detail.

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:38.861
What we looked at now was
the handle construction

00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:40.196
of your blade.

00:04:40.196 --> 00:04:41.906
There are some hot
spots and some gapping,

00:04:41.906 --> 00:04:44.325
and that's the reason
why you didn't win.

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:46.160
OK.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.955
I have a hard time
saying this Devil Dog,

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:51.457
but it's time to
give up that weapon.

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:53.876
I think I really
represented myself.

00:04:53.876 --> 00:04:55.044
I did a really good job.

00:04:55.044 --> 00:04:57.505
Jon just beat me
in a fine detail.

00:04:57.505 --> 00:04:59.298
That's it.
- Congratulations.

00:04:59.298 --> 00:05:00.299
Semper fi, buddy.
