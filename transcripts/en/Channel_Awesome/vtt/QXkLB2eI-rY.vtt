00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.180
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.200
I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.660
Well, with the month of Halloween right around the corner,

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.700
I found it only fitting to talk about something truly scary.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.980
That's right.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.500
The fear...

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.840
of the subconscious.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.680
(Crowd boos)

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.380
With orgies.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.440
(Crowd cheers)

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.580
In summer of 1999,

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.960
Legendary filmmaker Stanley Kubrick's final film premiered,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.460
just after he died:

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.940
"Eyes Wide Shut."

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.520
Incredibly hyped with its steaming marketing,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.720
audience reaction seemed to be mainly this...

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.220
Krusty: What the hell was that?!

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.280
While a hit with critics,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.000
Eyes Wide Shut mostly alienated audiences

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.040
who saw it as nothing but slow, artsy porn.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.720
And hell, even the porn part at the time seemed to be edited out.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.600
So you couldn't even get that going for you.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.180
Years later, after all the hype has died down,

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.360
can it be true?

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.220
Is Stanley Kubrick's final masterpiece just glorified T&amp;A?

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.680
...as opposed to his other glorified T&amp;A, that at least had a point?

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.860
(in Southern accent) Well, I may be an old-fashioned critic,

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.700
who reads too deeply into...disturbed, perverted minds,

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.740
(Southern accent ends) but I too have an interpretation.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.720
To figure out what the movie's about, let's look at the basic story.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.480
Will and Alice - played by Tom Cruise
and Nicole Kidman -

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.420
seem like a normal, well-off couple.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.240
But one night, things go south when under obviously some very bad pot,

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.640
Alice admits that she would have given up everything just for a night of lust with a sailor she saw years ago.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.960
She also has a dream that night that she was having sex with that sailor,

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.840
and that she was doing it mainly to hurt her husband.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.280
She's never talked like this before, or given any hints in the past,

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.780
but this seems to obviously piss off Will.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.080
Obsessed over this, he goes on a journey to try and either one up her, by sleeping with someone else,

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.740
or at the very least achieving a similar mental lust with another woman.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.660
He sneaks into a sexual den of holy fuckery,

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.000
where powerful people wear masks, and sleep with whoever they want.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.660
But when he's discovered, his life is threatened,

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.300
but saved by a young woman, who sacrifices herself because he saved her life earlier that week.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.820
As he tries to look for answers, his simple world begins to crumble,

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.740
as he's followed, threatened, and apparently endangered, or corrupted many of the people around him

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.220
He's finally given an out when one of the people at the mask ball of holy fuckness

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.980
says that everything was just a ploy to scare him into not revealing the truth about their sexcapades.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.740
Suspicious, but still possible, Will decides to accept the excuse, and eventually comes clean to his wife about everything.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.400
They decide to put behind the ugly experience, and forget it ever happened,

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.820
trying to live the happy life they know they want for themselves, and each other.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.800
After doing one very important thing, of course.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.940
Alice: Fuck.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.720
Critic: Heh?

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.400
What the hell did I just watch?

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.520
When I first saw this movie, I didn't know what to think of it.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.660
I loved the style and the imagery, but I had no idea what it was trying to get across.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.400
Everything started to come together though, when I asked myself one simple question:

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.620
Do Alice and Will love each other?

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.620
I've asked this question to a few people who have seen the movie, and you'd be surprised how many different answers there are.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.180
Some say...yes.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.820
They never technically slept with anyone else, and every couple is gonna have their moments of doubt.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.520
This was just a really ugly, albeit bizarre experience that their love pulled them through.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.740
But others would say, no.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.760
There's too many issues being ignored, and too much pain, and vengeance the two have for one another.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.800
Even the line about living together forever seems to frighten Alice.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.940
Alice: We're awake now. For a long time to come.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:39.760
Will: Forever.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.380
Alice: Mmm...let's not use that word.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:44.820
It, uh...

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.540
it frightens me.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.500
Critic: But others say that's a normal, scary idea for lots of people.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.840
And the anger that comes out is normal when you're invested and care so much for one another.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.520
I started to work backwards on this question of whether or not they loved each other,

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.780
because clearly, our main couple wasn't going to take the time to find the real answer.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:10.140
Kind of like how...Will isn't taking the time to find the real answer to a possible crime scene--

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.380
Wait a minute...

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.800
The same way he has an out from all this misery, even though a lot of bad stuff could have gone down,

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:24.260
is pretty similar to how they're taking an out for their relationship, that may also have some alarming things to address.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.200
It's even done in this very romantic, fantasy-like setting,

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.480
like happily ever after. This is what it's supposed to be.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.160
Surrounded by toys, and fairy tales, and smiling faces.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.300
It's like they're suggesting their happy ending is right around the corner. Just go ahead and forget all the misery.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.420
It's kind of like how Will tells Alice that the dream she had is nothing more than a dream.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.620
Nothing to worry about.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.380
Alice: It's too awful.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.340
Will: It's only a dream.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.900
Critic: But she is worried,

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.080
she hates that these thoughts are in her head.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.080
Isn't love supposed to be emotional comfort and support?

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.920
Why would she have such terrible, vengeful thoughts about her soulmate?

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.680
The one she chose to live the rest of her life with?

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.380
Is that something to be concerned about? Or is the mind just really complex and would go to these dark places anyway?

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.520
Does love go as deep as your subconscious?

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.720
Again, some would say, "obviously, yes." While others would say, "obviously, no."

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.960
Love is a compromise, with hurdles and complex feelings.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.640
But at what point do you say love has nothing to do with certain parts of the brain?

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:29.520
The brain can be a dark place, and obviously it's going to go to some creepy areas. That doesn't mean it's bad.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.160
Right?

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.500
At what point does the subconscious become conscious, when love is involved?

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.440
Kind of a blurry line in between the dream world and reality, isn't it?

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.440
Actually...

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.200
The whole film kind of is.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:47.120
Everything is very dreamlike. The blurry colors, the hazy lights, the dark shadows.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.420
Hell, the masked ball scene is something right out of a nightmare.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.280
With scary faces in the dark, exposing you at your very core.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.860
He's even asked to take off his clothes, so they can do God knows what to him.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.960
Man: Remove your clothes.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.580
Will: Gentlemen, please.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:09.600
Remove your clothes, or would you like us to do it for you?

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.100
Critic: How many dreams have you had where you were naked and exposed to everyone?

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.480
Well...that were actually dreams?

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.800
It's kind of like that night he chose to enter the world of his sexual subconscious,

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.040
trying to figure out what he really wants.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.440
But then the next day, when he's more awake, reality sets in.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.380
The harsh consequences of his actions now suddenly seem to take hold.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:35.100
It's contrasting reality with dreams, and where the line should be drawn between the instinct of sex,

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.440
and the instinct of love.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.580
Which seems to be more and more blurred the harder you look at it.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.780
Even the title "Eyes Wide Shut."

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:47.100
At first, I thought it was just kind of a cool, artsy name, but when you really think about it,

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.180
what's it a play on?

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.440
Eyes Wide Open.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.180
Meaning you focus intensely on what's in front of you.

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.180
Well, then...what would you focus intensely on when your eyes are closed?

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.360
What can you focus on when your eyes are closed?

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.420
Oh yeah, your dreams.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:05.100
Even Will seems to backtrack in the end, emphasizing that their simple understanding of love,

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.920
and giving of one's self goes deeper than what's on the surface.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.640
That...

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.760
Like he says,

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:12.940
Will: And no dream is never....

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.160
just a dream.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.100
Critic: The way this all started seemed to stem from a different mindset as well.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:24.980
With both of them getting high, and not thinking about what's socially acceptable to themselves or others.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:28.260
Their minds are just free to do and say whatever they want.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.740
The whole movie seems to focus on that.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:36.680
Unraveling the layers and journeying through the shadows to find the truth of what it means to give yourself wholly.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.680
Both mind and body to another person.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:45.720
The more I looked at this film, the more I realized it was bringing up questions that every couple should discuss.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.300
How deep does love go?

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.800
How deep *should* it go?

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.480
What's the cut-off point?

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:56.920
Rather than searching for answers, though, our leads - like many couples - choose to ignore it and move on with their lives.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.960
Is this making things better, or worse?

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:06.500
It seems like they're ignoring a lot of important issues, but at the same time, forgive and forget.
Nobody's going to be perfect, right?

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.620
Like many great films, it doesn't answer it for you.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.240
It just gives you the questions worth thinking about.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:19.860
It asks, what connection love has to everything? Sex? Emotions? Even your deepest thoughts that you keep hidden.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:24.520
Eyes Wide Shut exposes that secret place, and asks you to draw conclusions from it.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:29.740
It's a film that dives into what it means to go from being me into being we.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:33.460
And what you have to be ready to explore, if you're willing to make the full commitment.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:40.820
So, yes, someone could look at this and just see a pretentious porno, which maybe was all part of Stanley's evil plans,

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.720
spend lots of money just to confuse, and piss people off.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.940
That would be financially brilliant, right? MAWAHAHA!

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:51.800
But for me, I can't help, but think these artistic choices are more than just coincidence.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:57.960
That there is something deeper than the surface of the story, just like there's something deeper than the surface of a relationship.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:02.420
If you're going for some high-end T&amp;A, you're probably going to be disappointed.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:05.940
But if you're willing to look deeper inside the film, who knows?

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:09.640
You might just find something a little deeper in your own relationship.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:23.460
Or, maybe the lesson of the whole thing is masked orgies are a great place to meet chicks.

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.920
Either way, I know what I'm doing tonight.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.320
I'm the Nostalgia Critic.
I remember it so you don't have to.
