00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.420
 this afternoon I'll talk about computers 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.189
 that in what you can do with it and 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.980
 I will speak beginning and at the end of the presentation 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.460
 also what is cloud computing? 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.340
 how google cloud platform enters 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.770
 to answer you hopefully to yours 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.250
 needs to your problems 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.820
 then the cloud platform offers so many 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.579
 services 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.100
 the most famous that we offer since 6 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.530
 7 years if I'm not mistaken, it's google app 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.420
 engine is a system that basically 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.100
 see a front end that scales 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.200
 automatically an application for you 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.070
 you write the code this code goes 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.960
 on a car 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.840
 if you have so many many requests 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.010
 maybe new instances are created 123 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:02.700
 another ten or a hundred instances that you 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.140
 will allow to honor the requests 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.909
 of your customers without having a day time 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.560
 out after ten seconds because maybe 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.829
 they are all on your site 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.570
 you do not know a newspaper online the first 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:15.030
 ten people succeed in your heaven 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.220
 newspaper after one thousand two thousand 10 thousand e 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.899
 100 thousand there is always a number above 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.939
 above which your server will 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:22.619
 sits and fails to serve a 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.819
 honoring requests and your customers 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.979
 they no longer go to your site and you 

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:29.159
 lose customers you lose money app engine 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.959
 answers this question computer g that 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.600
 it's fairly recent we launched a 

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:36.689
 year ago a year and a half ago and is now 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.100
 now available to all of you instead 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.679
 answer another question the possibility 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.590
 to create virtual machines online 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:45.420
 machines for now only linux but a 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.159
 short we will have other machines than others 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.179
 guy 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.639
 in which you can install the software 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:52.590
 what you want suppose nothing changed 

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:54.779
 I don't know a Java library 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.300
 especially a track that runs on 

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:57.770
 a car 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.800
 unique are windows machines but not 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.420
 works in hosting systems 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.770
 traditional then competent in 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.070
 could be the answer he does for 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.250
 you 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.600
 and as I said this morning competent not 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.910
 only offers virtual machines 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.250
 offers an entire ecosystem in which these 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.020
 machines live so you can create 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.300
 network you can create loads 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.920
 balancer of the firewall rules yes 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.750
 apply only to certain networks you want to have 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.210
 the network of mz the deformed network we will see 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.210
 later cultured create discs attack them 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.500
 detach them create snap shot create one 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.230
 machine you like the fact one 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.240
 slapshot you instantiate one disk in another 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.470
 area type in america and allocated the 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.520
 machine starting from this disk 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.590
 maybe spaced 10 then struggled for 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.510
 some reason grows the pull down 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.950
 from the same the snap shot you pull up of 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.230
 new the eighth that the call with a 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.880
 another name is somehow using 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.460
 of the mechanisms I can show you 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.310
 the system takes this into account and uses it 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.330
 for example the load balancer can 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.070
 help them achieve the purpose of 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.500
 reach a certain number of machines 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.850
 a bunch of machines without a bunch 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.320
 worry about their names 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.030
 ip address have because there is a 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.920
 level of in the direction that comes 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.220
 managed directly from our front 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.070
 end 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.020
 ok then we have cloud storage that a 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.690
 system that allows you an object store 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.730
 allows you to store data 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.660
 imagine very large static files for 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.650
 example images music video or data of 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.760
 a telescope for example 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.440
 then we have in our offer of 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.860
 cloud sequel which has very interesting is 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.380
 a never-ending sequel is therefore a database 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:33.020
 traditional then relational opposite 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.610
 to the data store that those of you familiar with app 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.290
 engine knows well, raise your hand 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.820
 who of you has used app engine and the 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.410
 own life ok not bad 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:46.010
 who of you has used any other 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:48.040
 what is the fault based on cloud storage or 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.170
 to computer gen 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.670
 ok you're lying because so many of you are 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.030
 a morning pasta but let's pretend to 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.050
 anything 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.050
 ok thanks other offers other parties 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.710
 offer 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:04.190
 cloud platform are translate Ã¨ pia e 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:07.470
 prediction api ai that allow you to 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.630
 insert from the source data if di 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.010
 make predictions to understand and for the 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.450
 mind a classifier allows you to 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.270
 understand if something left right 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.930
 or if something is good or bad by giving it 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.950
 mixture of initial data in which you 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.630
 taught how to behave as a system 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.890
 obviously we will not talk about this 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.720
 afternoon we will talk only about 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:28.890
 computer g ok however just to give you a 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:32.220
 framework a cloud computing framework 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:34.830
 I think the most important word of 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.540
 this slide sias that or the cloud 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.550
 computing allows you to do something that 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.240
 in the traditional way you can't 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.180
 just do 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.830
 you can create any one 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.380
 idea whatever project you have 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.750
 you can no longer make it just with one 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.370
 car but with the machines and the thing 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.560
 nice if you go to think about the fact that 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.810
 you pay every minute the car in 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.700
 su is that you can multiply the number of 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.170
 cars and basically if you have 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.600
 written the program with a certain 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.070
 criterion you can manage to get the 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.110
 your result in a tenth of the time 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.669
 so in the end yes the price yes 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.560
 balance is not that you have to think about create 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.480
 10 thousand machines split as I spend 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.890
 because maybe these machines find again 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.720
 the result in a ten-thousandth of the 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.919
 time of a car obviously is not 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.070
 just a tenth of a thousandth but 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:22.020
 however, the order of magnitude remains if I am 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:24.510
 follow then ok let's see what it is 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.630
 inserts the world of computer and gene 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:30.480
 then if you go to the cloud google 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.710
 dot.com slash console what I invite you 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.940
 to do if you have a browser 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:37.680
 you have a browser that exposes all the 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.300
 projects that you are likely to be 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.919
 no one if the first time there 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.990
 log in if you have already done app engine or 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:44.250
 other things because in projects for whom 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.430
 does not know what a project is 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:50.430
 base container inside which 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:51.900
 you can create instances of several instances of 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.419
 computer gini app engine instances 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.040
 you can create cloud databases 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:57.000
 sequels you can create budgets for 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.060
 objects and all these objects 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.300
 within a project I am able 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.750
 to talk to each other, that is, they inherit 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:08.580
 a purpose within which 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.960
 application a can talk to the back end 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.180
 b for me that nintendo can be 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.740
 database data store a machine of 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:18.419
 computer gene and so on for who it was 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:20.190
 this morning at the alcohol lab is practically 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:23.460
 the part where we create a car 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:25.680
 with the scoop with service accounts that 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:28.500
 allow the machine to write or 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:31.860
 read from cloud storage are technologies 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.870
 several united by ep to the municipalities and the 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.700
 possibility also to make these speak 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.440
 technologies that then perhaps the biggest 

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.030
 advantage of using the platform 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:43.080
 google is the fact that you have so many 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:44.610
 different technologies and you can orchestrate them 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.210
 as you please 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:50.970
 the second of yours and not necessity 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:52.680
 so a project is basically a 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:54.870
 container to which it is associated with billing 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.640
 who is paying a credit card with 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:59.760
 all odds could be one 

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:02.520
 fly billing if you have turned a little 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.450
 the bigger you want to be want to pay to 

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.860
 end of month 

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:07.229
 you have a team of people to whom 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.430
 associate this project they have that 

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:10.289
 inherit rights that you have 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.400
 grant with a grant you can say 

00:07:10.289 --> 00:07:13.410
 this person can create machines 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:17.010
 this person cannot create anything but 

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:19.140
 can read from the database for example later 

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:20.640
 we have virtual machines that like you 

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:24.050
 I said they are linux machines 

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:26.760
 we currently provide debian 67 and centos 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:29.250
 you have the well documented possibility in the 

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:31.979
 site to create machines of other types 

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:34.169
 you can create a ubuntu a whammy was 

00:07:31.979 --> 00:07:36.510
 a gentoo whatever you like 

00:07:34.169 --> 00:07:38.590
 once you create the image 

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:41.730
 following the parameters of the 

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:43.990
 of documentation just google with 

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:48.010
 image for computer ingenuity and you should 

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:48.730
 then find it deeply 

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:50.620
 machines you want 

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:53.200
 we are working on windows machines 

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:54.760
 so if you need s 

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.470
 I can't guarantee the timing but 

00:07:54.760 --> 00:08:00.040
 we will also have this windows machines 

00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:02.230
 it's a promised thing 

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:07.060
 the processors are 2.7 gHz memory 

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:09.580
 it's about 3.7 gigabytes and that's the 

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.600
 main brick because I don't know if 

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:13.540
 remember who of you was this morning 

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:16.210
 you could create the machines n1 n2 n 4 e 

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:19.570
 n 8 that is the multiplier how many 

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:21.220
 how many cores do you have in proportion to 

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:23.170
 basic brick so you can have it 

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:25.090
 cars with more US more machines with more 

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.780
 ram depending on the type of calculation that 

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:30.310
 you have to do 

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:33.790
 ok then let's talk about network 

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:36.010
 the enel have so much there are 

00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:37.840
 many entities connected to the network 

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:41.040
 the first network you have yourself 

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:44.230
 default network called default is the 

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:46.180
 10000 slash 24 and basic of all 

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:49.480
 machines you can create a dmz in 

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:51.250
 another network you can create in theory 

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:54.820
 you can also have different projects in 

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:56.380
 different networks project 1 project 2 

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.730
 these would be useless if it were not 

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.740
 for the fact that you have the possibility of 

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:02.320
 create firewall rules and rules of 

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:04.390
 routing you can say whenever 

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.640
 a request arrives this mandala 

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:08.110
 instead to this to this other network but 

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.510
 go to this gateway who knows about how 

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:12.040
 sort it if you are good at making 

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:14.980
 routine with linux could be that 

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:16.690
 you want to do a nice fi 

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:18.640
 Latvian with ip tables you put us all 

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:21.160
 the rules you want your nat 

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:23.320
 use this this bridgehead 

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.890
 to do the routing to the machines 

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.450
 affect 

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:27.460
 you can let us do this work 

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:31.540
 that we have a load balancer that makes for 

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:33.040
 you and think about on other levels of 

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.150
 conquer but if you have to do something 

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.220
 more complex than what we are there 

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:37.090
 we obviously offer the tools 

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.540
 to do it 

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:40.850
 ok 

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:42.110
 so you have networks inside one 

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:43.930
 network you can create rules of 

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:48.140
 firewall you can say opens port 80 

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:50.480
 on the network of mz opened the door 33 06 

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:54.470
 on the database network and so on 

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:56.270
 ok with regards to internet 

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:58.820
 default machines are born with a 

00:09:56.270 --> 00:10:02.210
 public ip address that for aeffem 

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:03.590
 eric efe merit means that it changes 

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.850
 every time you pull on the machine 

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:07.280
 different ie you have no guarantors e 

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:10.400
 quality guarantee you know if you want mipi 

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:12.050
 static you can buy it 

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:14.210
 funny is that static lippi is 

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:16.250
 absolutely free and it's done 

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:17.600
 pay only when and is touch from one 

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:19.160
 machine there is the world in which it attacked 

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.140
 the car is free 

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.670
 the moment we do not use 

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:25.580
 no cars with public ones 

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:27.650
 so the public ones are external like you 

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:29.150
 says in Italian is there to do nothing with 

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:32.150
 fact that we have to pay the rep 

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:33.500
 to have a rotation of ep we see 

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:34.630
 this responsibility to be sure 

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.920
 that the ip actually used 

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:39.080
 but if you use them for any 

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.760
 kind of work questp don't cost you 

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:42.800
 absolutely nothing so you can 

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:45.790
 give your customer a regard 

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:47.390
 my state dns p 1 point 2.3.4 

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:48.620
 forget it because those more and 

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:49.490
 yours forever 

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:51.800
 you can also attack horse racing 

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:55.250
 you own for other reasons from tea 

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:57.080
 you can make gissi useful for hunting p 

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:59.420
 and you have an ip that your company for 

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:01.040
 some reason to that in anyway ripe 

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:05.380
 already towards your company 

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:08.080
 in short, you have lots of possibilities ok 

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:10.880
 let's talk about a couple of records then 

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:14.210
 when created a virtual machine 

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:16.040
 you can have persistent or 

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:17.450
 skins that mou scratch days that I am 

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:20.060
 disposable discs 

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:22.130
 the second is a record that is born and dies 

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:23.570
 with the with the car means of 

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:25.100
 disinterested in what's up 

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:26.840
 this record because maybe it's a 

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:29.060
 trivial boot disk but the data that you 

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:31.550
 they are interested in another record that 

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:32.810
 you can attack 

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:34.790
 then there are the persistent risks that 

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:36.829
 vice versa they are guaranteed discs 

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:40.130
 to be 

00:11:36.829 --> 00:11:43.230
 persistent excuse the duplication 

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:46.589
 these discs will always remain where 

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:48.990
 they are guaranteed to be up extra 

00:11:46.589 --> 00:11:52.019
 positions of the same area then 

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:53.700
 however the province is highly 

00:11:52.019 --> 00:11:55.529
 unlikely to result in corruption 

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:58.980
 of data or that you lose the disk that is 

00:11:55.529 --> 00:12:01.260
 I say with your heart in your hand is you 

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:03.810
 rest assured when you have a data on 

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:06.480
 persistent ska and then suppose to 

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:08.459
 have a super car stand disk 

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.529
 where you do so many jobs every 

00:12:08.459 --> 00:12:12.120
 add week add load 

00:12:10.529 --> 00:12:14.160
 you can take snap shots which is a 

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.300
 concept here you are definitely used to 

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:18.120
 maybe with vmware or others it is 

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:20.640
 virtualized virtualization and therefore 

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:22.050
 you can also juggle the 

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.579
 concept of snap shot to the concept of 

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:25.620
 visco ie you can transform a disc 

00:12:23.579 --> 00:12:27.660
 snapshots but also to allocate a disc 

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:29.640
 from a snap shot the difference that a 

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:31.620
 disk is attached to an area and is 

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:34.860
 snapshot somewhere in the cloud no 

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:35.220
 I tell you where somewhere else anyway 

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.440
 part 

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:39.120
 you can switch between them and 

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.860
 you can obviously instantiate images a 

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:43.649
 starting from a disk so you can create 

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:46.300
 a vanilla installation for example 

00:12:43.649 --> 00:12:50.440
 October 2010 01 

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:52.180
 2013 10 01 that is your panel e 

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.710
 create ten machines starting from 

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:55.390
 flavors come an idea wait when I have 

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:57.880
 forgotten to install to installed peaces 

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:59.920
 a paci you have the November 01 version 

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:02.560
 you have another snap shot this time 

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:05.740
 you can instantiate the vanilla image 2 

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:08.110
 ok it's instant maybe 10 100 1000 a 

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:11.050
 depending on what you have to do is 

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:15.750
 all very simple i assure you ok the 

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:19.630
 disk is encrypted so there is data is 

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:21.400
 absolutely safe and not even if the 

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:22.300
 your project is separate from the project 

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.310
 of other customers 

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:27.400
 when there was any kind 

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:28.840
 unauthorized access 

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:31.330
 anyone who does not have that key does not have 

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:32.350
 any access to those disks is therefore a 

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.630
 security point of view 

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:36.310
 we have been careful we also have gods 

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:37.690
 problems with a customer are asked to 

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:39.700
 find data for them because it is 

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:43.090
 really problematic 

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:44.710
 then another another doubtful disco 

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:46.660
 another another storage system a 

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:48.760
 which you can access is cloud storage 

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:51.180
 I've already talked about it this morning is a yes it is 

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.960
 an object store as I mentioned 

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:54.640
 you can use it from the command line 

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:57.059
 you can use it from the web 

00:13:54.640 --> 00:14:00.329
 we have a 

00:13:57.059 --> 00:14:02.519
 google.com slash cloud web page 

00:14:00.329 --> 00:14:03.839
 console allows you to access all the 

00:14:02.519 --> 00:14:06.179
 your projects so you can see i 

00:14:03.839 --> 00:14:10.189
 your files browse these directories 

00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:12.479
 virtual repeats are not drinking directories 

00:14:10.189 --> 00:14:14.699
 you can do interesting things like 

00:14:12.479 --> 00:14:17.549
 these you can use a line of 

00:14:14.699 --> 00:14:21.089
 sorry command if it is a bit grainy gst 

00:14:17.549 --> 00:14:23.279
 free I read gs tmb as make bucket gs 

00:14:21.089 --> 00:14:23.729
 two points bar slash and then the name of the 

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:26.159
 budget 

00:14:23.729 --> 00:14:27.539
 I created the computer budget g if there 

00:14:26.159 --> 00:14:31.589
 try it should fail because already 

00:14:27.539 --> 00:14:34.199
 exist of sutil is always copied more to 

00:14:31.589 --> 00:14:36.599
 in here and automatically will create 

00:14:34.199 --> 00:14:38.189
 will copy a file you have locally and there 

00:14:36.599 --> 00:14:40.619
 will put in the object or from this moment 

00:14:38.189 --> 00:14:42.509
 this object is persisted is guaranteed 

00:14:40.619 --> 00:14:44.849
 exist forever 

00:14:42.509 --> 00:14:48.089
 as long as you have your designed it goes 

00:14:44.849 --> 00:14:50.039
 obviously jesus tls you can make it lsu 

00:14:48.089 --> 00:14:51.929
 in them less r is practically one 

00:14:50.039 --> 00:14:53.489
 very similar command line compatible 

00:14:51.929 --> 00:14:55.799
 with all the controls you are used to 

00:14:53.489 --> 00:14:56.939
 from the command line and being able to do things 

00:14:55.799 --> 00:14:59.129
 very interesting thing more 

00:14:56.939 --> 00:15:02.459
 interesting of the object store is that 

00:14:59.129 --> 00:15:05.039
 you can redirect a dns to your site 

00:15:02.459 --> 00:15:06.989
 web so you can for example if you have 

00:15:05.039 --> 00:15:08.579
 of any film images of any 

00:15:06.989 --> 00:15:10.319
 what you have on your site you can 

00:15:08.579 --> 00:15:11.399
 make them direct all the static part 

00:15:10.319 --> 00:15:13.349
 of your site 

00:15:11.399 --> 00:15:15.179
 to this object store that may be 

00:15:13.349 --> 00:15:17.519
 replicated in more areas so maybe in 

00:15:15.179 --> 00:15:19.229
 America in Europe and Asia and therefore 

00:15:17.519 --> 00:15:21.119
 have very low latencies and 

00:15:19.229 --> 00:15:23.399
 even low costs with regards to 

00:15:21.119 --> 00:15:26.699
 little eyes think of the reader I don't know 

00:15:23.399 --> 00:15:28.259
 an online newspaper the html part 

00:15:26.699 --> 00:15:30.100
 very small compared to the part of 

00:15:28.259 --> 00:15:32.319
 images 

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:33.940
 and documents in general therefore may have 

00:15:32.319 --> 00:15:35.920
 meaning to put the static files that are 

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:37.540
 bigger in another part because 

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:43.560
 this is faster and less access 

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:46.209
 expensive ok how to access computer gene 

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:47.769
 all 

00:15:46.209 --> 00:15:51.339
 all this world is exposed to the outside 

00:15:47.769 --> 00:15:53.529
 through bees to quests have one 

00:15:51.339 --> 00:15:56.740
 version now we are at 1 beta 16 

00:15:53.529 --> 00:15:58.240
 probably slides will offer at 15 

00:15:56.740 --> 00:16:00.220
 because we have a little star on xvi 

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.860
 there are three ways basically for 

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:04.990
 access the lady at the command line 

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:06.370
 that at the profit you will find that you will see more 

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:09.550
 forward and that you used this morning 

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:12.910
 cheerfully the oye which is the cloud 

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:15.040
 google.com slash console that as I said 

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:17.740
 it really is I talked to 

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:19.300
 developers and we have a team in 

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:21.730
 america that is working hard on us 

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:23.560
 and every week we have new features 

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:26.709
 the nice thing if you want to insert one 

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:28.480
 create a new web instance that does 

00:16:26.709 --> 00:16:30.490
 of people automatically all 

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:33.009
 possible instances the images possible 

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:35.139
 the possible areas so it is much more 

00:16:33.009 --> 00:16:36.699
 easy but from licari command though if 

00:16:35.139 --> 00:16:38.709
 you want to start one hundred machines not 

00:16:36.699 --> 00:16:40.810
 you want to fill out a form a hundred times 

00:16:38.709 --> 00:16:43.000
 cli car 100 times right is like 

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:45.490
 I don't know a plane book 

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.199
 air tickets all identical 

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:49.360
 it makes no sense to click a hundred times then 

00:16:47.199 --> 00:16:50.769
 in that case you will have to get your hands dirty 

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.839
 with the command line but then later 

00:16:50.769 --> 00:16:55.209
 you can launch a hundred machines in a turn 

00:16:52.839 --> 00:16:56.470
 a few seconds and I assure you one of mine 

00:16:55.209 --> 00:16:59.800
 colleague did party thousand 

00:16:56.470 --> 00:17:02.160
 machines in 5 minutes and just have the 

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:04.270
 there is no quota there is no problem 

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:06.640
 you have an initial quota which is a bit 

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:09.069
 little girl and to prevent people from doing it 

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:10.630
 put to start 100 thousand machines and 

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:13.419
 make our data centers head office though 

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:17.409
 obviously with time if we are well 

00:17:13.419 --> 00:17:19.470
 pleased with altavilla empty third code 

00:17:17.409 --> 00:17:22.179
 but not least last but not least 

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:24.839
 we have hypia inscriptions for java 

00:17:22.179 --> 00:17:27.640
 python ego which are the three languages 

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:30.910
 more supported 

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:33.820
 from google then we are working on ruby 

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:35.350
 we are working on php now that it is 

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:37.360
 been combined with app engine and I think that 

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:38.890
 we are also working on that though 

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:45.010
 I can only guarantee for now 

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:46.420
 python java ego this morning with who it was 

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:49.630
 the club and we wrote a little program 

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:51.820
 in python to see a list of 

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:54.100
 instances that are available in your 

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:55.420
 project doing so you can make create 

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:58.000
 a logic of yours yours 

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:59.290
 liking you can sell computer g in 

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.480
 your customers by offering to our customers 

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:03.640
 customers by offering an intermediate layer 

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:07.600
 which adds value as it is doing 

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:09.660
 and we have two clients who are 

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:12.450
 basically selling computer gene 

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:14.530
 to the whole world 

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:16.330
 offering something more above 

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:17.820
 obviously they write the code of the 

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:20.530
 morning to evening offer perhaps 

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:23.230
 monitoring were resilience offer 

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:25.450
 of things on top of the service that 

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:26.830
 we offer we see what is 

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:28.390
 he calls ben metal which is not really for 

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:29.740
 goal because they are virtual machines though 

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:32.230
 what we do are machines 

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:34.810
 who can be born can die 

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:38.050
 you must create a system that is in 

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:39.580
 able to withstand the breaks it is 

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:42.730
 one thing you always have in the cloud 

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:45.040
 take into consideration ok 

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:47.170
 this is a screenshot I made 

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:49.840
 a few weeks ago, unfortunately, it was not 

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:51.700
 he sees very well however as you see here 

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:55.000
 you have an overview of this project 

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:56.830
 here you have yours 

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.380
 your technologies and then appengine 

00:18:56.830 --> 00:19:01.600
 computer jing cloud storage is 

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:04.690
 illegible, I apologize but I wanted to 

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:09.430
 let us stay all here is the name of the 

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:13.360
 machine we can put a 

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:15.040
 little more focus you fail 

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.780
 I ask, however, the thing 

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:19.930
 interesting that here this area and us 

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:22.270
 central 1 and I think and click here to give you 

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:23.680
 a list of all the zones and so far e 

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:25.240
 also uninteresting though 

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:26.410
 interesting here when yours are there 

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:28.360
 snap shot this is populated 

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:30.610
 then automatically via the jacks 

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:33.040
 when you have a car you have 

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:34.660
 created a minute ago a snap shot created 

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:37.270
 minute ago an image created a minute 

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:38.860
 ago can you tell him look make me this 

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:41.200
 machine that is called this of this 

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:43.870
 type taking it from the cosmos image 

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:45.010
 surprises from the vanilla image made 

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:49.000
 yesterday and things like that 

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:51.610
 here is the networking that kind of la 

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.160
 default network dpf merico ep public 

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:55.150
 etc. etc. access to the process at 

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.560
 project 

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:58.150
 this is the thing that showed me 

00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:00.280
 this morning for those in the queue from 

00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:03.040
 this is the part where you allow 

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:05.230
 a virtual machine to access her 

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:08.050
 automatically like that if you 

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:10.690
 click on this checkbox that now 

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:13.030
 do not see an invitation to do so if you have 

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:14.560
 access computer gene can create one 

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:17.130
 car that already has the right to 

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:18.870
 access to certain 

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:20.850
 certain services and stamps you even if in 

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:22.470
 car in writing or no type 

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:24.210
 you want a car to do from 

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:27.150
 orchestrator to create other machines 

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:28.470
 something that you have a cloud 

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:29.910
 elastic you want a car that is 

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:31.590
 notices if there is too much traffic creates 

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:33.930
 new machines you want them to have 

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:35.670
 read write access to the computer 

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:36.840
 and you don't want anything else 

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:38.940
 you have another car that does the 

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:41.160
 cloud storage logging you want that 

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:42.990
 have the white on.le but no not the rid 

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:44.430
 maybe for security reasons 

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:46.590
 maybe ten different customers who 

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:48.420
 they write in the same buckets you want 

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:49.590
 they change the law in writing but not 

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:51.030
 in reading 

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:55.440
 strange case but can absolutely 

00:20:51.030 --> 00:21:06.690
 happen ok but we have already arrived 

00:20:55.440 --> 00:21:06.960
 towards the end load balancer I mine 

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:09.390
 purpose 

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:11.220
 my purpose for this talker to talk 

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:12.810
 of the load balancer to show you a pair 

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:13.170
 of scripts I had made etc. 

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:15.330
 etc 

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:18.090
 I just want to maybe intrigue a 

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:20.010
 I guess what the load balancer does 

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:21.150
 I think I talked about it with Alessandro with 

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:23.010
 atoms sc to work with us 

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:24.780
 I think that balances is practically the 

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:27.600
 second application that each person makes 

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:30.690
 when when it starts to do 

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:32.820
 computer the first is apache server see 

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:34.590
 that works to see that your rights 

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:37.140
 pia on the page written hello mom is 

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:38.310
 everything appears and you are happy because 

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:40.530
 you have grated the car you pulled 

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:41.730
 on a service you had to configure 

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:44.580
 the firewall to open port 80 

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:46.410
 because otherwise you don't access it and this is it 

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:47.880
 the first satisfaction then say the 

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:48.630
 widow and eating you this is fin 

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:51.000
 too easy 

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:53.010
 the second exercise that one tends to 

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.340
 do wait let's try having ten 

00:21:53.010 --> 00:22:00.180
 machines 10 web servers and each of 

00:21:56.340 --> 00:22:04.170
 they mice I call myself web 1 web2 web 10 

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:06.960
 now the problem of load balancing is a 

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:10.350
 problem that many companies are faced with 

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:12.540
 for over a decade and can have it 

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:14.190
 brilliantly solved creator three 

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:16.679
 firewall shifts 

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:19.740
 companies like google like as amazon or 

00:22:16.679 --> 00:22:22.259
 like many other companies it is not a 

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:25.590
 problem easy to solve 

00:22:22.259 --> 00:22:30.779
 the idea is this I have a backhand with 100 

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:31.860
 machines n machines excuse me and I want 

00:22:30.779 --> 00:22:34.710
 make sure that when a person 

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:37.019
 type www.google.com go to one 

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:38.909
 random machine that is capable of 

00:22:37.019 --> 00:22:40.409
 offer that service but I don't want to 

00:22:38.909 --> 00:22:43.200
 know that car and I want a level 

00:22:40.409 --> 00:22:45.980
 I don't want to know about holding fiction 

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:48.330
 machine both but I want when 

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:49.740
 www.google.com arrives in the car 

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:52.320
 possibly the closest to me 

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:54.179
 possibly not charging possibly 

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:57.269
 so many beautiful things we begin with in the meantime 

00:22:54.179 --> 00:22:58.220
 get a car home that already does not 

00:22:57.269 --> 00:23:00.809
 is a problem recently 

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:01.649
 you already realize that there are some things 

00:23:00.809 --> 00:23:03.659
 they are factors 

00:23:01.649 --> 00:23:06.750
 I can do say the machines 

00:23:03.659 --> 00:23:08.580
 are from 1 to 10 make the bow the bow 

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:10.440
 ding of the ip the problem that if the 

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:14.309
 machines number 8 falls me down in a 

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:16.769
 sure moment how do I know 

00:23:14.309 --> 00:23:18.509
 that the car has fallen and to tell the 

00:23:16.769 --> 00:23:21.750
 controller looks at what the car is 

00:23:18.509 --> 00:23:23.250
 fall off the balancing pool 

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:24.710
 now if the thing you want to implement 

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:28.289
 you and I have tried 

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:31.740
 and is very liable to bankruptcy 

00:23:28.289 --> 00:23:33.809
 main reason is here custodian custodes 

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:34.769
 if you have heard this if it does many 

00:23:33.809 --> 00:23:38.129
 networking 

00:23:34.769 --> 00:23:40.049
 the problem is how do you ensure that 

00:23:38.129 --> 00:23:42.960
 even the controller does not fall here you have to 

00:23:40.049 --> 00:23:44.279
 make a multi-level two-tier system 

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.360
 controller because a controller from 

00:23:44.279 --> 00:23:47.669
 it can only be your neck 

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:49.590
 bottle happened he falls all right 

00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:51.570
 you can do it very robust but the 

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:54.769
 therefore controller does not work 

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:59.040
 the load balancer is google has taken off one 

00:23:54.769 --> 00:24:01.050
 has practically used the 

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:03.810
 a technology he has used for many years 

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:08.640
 that is the one with which our front end 

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:10.380
 with which we give do not know if google doc com e 

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.940
 all our other technologies 

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:14.370
 we have an existing technology 

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:16.260
 we have applied computer and ge now 

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:18.570
 we launched it for a month and a half from 

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:20.820
 mid-October if I'm not mistaken first of 

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:23.190
 October is usable is 

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:25.320
 basically it works like this 

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:27.480
 sorry it's a level 3 dogma wars 

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:30.300
 work at regional level and therefore of 

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:34.050
 the hollow balance in europe and one in us 

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:36.540
 central a region is an array of more 

00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:40.560
 zone there is always at least two types 

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:43.770
 europe west one is a region of europe 

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:45.660
 west one and yen b are two areas the part 

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:47.310
 so interesting is that you can do the 

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:49.650
 load balancing only between machines that 

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:50.670
 they are in neighboring areas but can 

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:52.410
 be different areas 

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:55.560
 this is the merit that is an area 

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:57.390
 it falls because we put it in 

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:59.100
 maintenance for a week you can 

00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:00.720
 have cars in the other area and you have 

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:03.420
 have the guarantee that the load balancer 

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:05.430
 draws on a pool of machines of which 

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:06.540
 at least half of them are always right away 

00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:09.390
 what you want then 

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:11.550
 the purpose of load balancing is yours 

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:13.080
 customer does not have to notice that you 

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:15.690
 go down for 5 minutes 

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:20.190
 this is the idea the beautiful part of the 

00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:21.810
 balance is that to a thing called sexual 

00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:24.390
 they are finished and a little more complicated there 

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:26.790
 I talk later to something called with 

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:28.920
 target on where you say 

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:29.799
 all the machines you call all the 

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:32.830
 cars 

00:25:29.799 --> 00:25:35.320
 web a web 2 up to the web 10 belong 

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:38.320
 to this pool associated with this rule 

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:39.129
 an ip address is really simple ve 

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.980
 assure you 

00:25:39.129 --> 00:25:43.629
 henceforth lippi 1 point 2.3.4 e 

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:46.149
 the public address you give to 

00:25:43.629 --> 00:25:49.840
 your client or your DNS server 

00:25:46.149 --> 00:25:51.279
 configured www.la mia punto com page 

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:54.909
 at this point whenever one types 

00:25:51.279 --> 00:25:58.710
 that one page the dns responds to 

00:25:54.909 --> 00:25:58.710
 with an ip once you have those p 

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:04.059
 the request goes to google decides 

00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:06.730
 on the load balancer rule of this 

00:26:04.059 --> 00:26:08.409
 forwarding room decides which machine 

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:10.600
 send the algorithm more if instead one 

00:26:08.409 --> 00:26:12.009
 round robin then the first but on the a1 

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:14.350
 the second goes on the 2nd tenth 

00:26:12.009 --> 00:26:16.239
 on the a10 the eleventh returns from 1 

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:17.559
 this is the main rule is the 

00:26:16.239 --> 00:26:18.639
 more basic rule 

00:26:17.559 --> 00:26:20.980
 then we have a concept called sa 

00:26:18.639 --> 00:26:24.759
 finished scene I give you an example 

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:26.590
 suppose you want yours 

00:26:24.759 --> 00:26:29.289
 customer number one go to the car 

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:31.119
 number one but every subsequent request 

00:26:29.289 --> 00:26:32.799
 stay on the same machine you want that 

00:26:31.119 --> 00:26:34.389
 there is a concept of session that 

00:26:32.799 --> 00:26:35.950
 stay glued on the same machine 

00:26:34.389 --> 00:26:39.070
 how do you guarantee a thing of the 

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:40.600
 kind then google sail by as it is 

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:42.850
 possibility you can rub I want 

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:45.429
 the murderess finished at the level of ip and di 

00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:47.409
 door and in doing so the system remembers 

00:26:45.429 --> 00:26:51.700
 as if it were a born table remember 

00:26:47.409 --> 00:26:53.470
 the address is more source and recalls the 

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:54.820
 pool machine to which it was 

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:57.279
 associated and will continue to apply 

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:57.970
 league because you may want to do one 

00:26:57.279 --> 00:27:00.549
 something like that 

00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:02.409
 imagine the stupidest example e 

00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:03.820
 authentication one logs in on 

00:27:02.409 --> 00:27:05.529
 machine number one but I am also number 

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:06.940
 2 did not do it however this is a 

00:27:05.529 --> 00:27:08.769
 bad example because nobody 

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:10.600
 would ever design a system where a 

00:27:08.769 --> 00:27:12.070
 depending on the car you are going to of 

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:14.739
 make a new login and every time it would be 

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:16.690
 it would be really beautiful design 

00:27:14.739 --> 00:27:19.720
 an example could be a car 

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:20.739
 which caches information e 

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:22.179
 if he doesn't have them 

00:27:20.739 --> 00:27:24.279
 the discharge maybe puts us some 

00:27:22.179 --> 00:27:26.169
 second, if you already have them at the level of 

00:27:24.279 --> 00:27:27.879
 sail milliseconds immediately serves well 

00:27:26.169 --> 00:27:29.320
 this case then you have machines 

00:27:27.879 --> 00:27:30.820
 which are all the same, they are all born 

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:33.639
 the same and this is an example in my opinion 

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:35.030
 more fitting then this machine 

00:27:33.639 --> 00:27:37.730
 which has in 

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:40.070
 it is convenient that the customer the user 

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:42.410
 hicks go on the same car because 

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:43.640
 probably the cache will have in cash and 

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:44.810
 of the information that this customer has 

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:48.590
 already asked for purely reasons 

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:50.510
 statistics and statistics monetize 

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:53.810
 very well in the sense if you make houses 

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:55.580
 well done you can save a 

00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:58.280
 order of magnitude and sometimes 2 and not 

00:27:55.580 --> 00:28:01.280
 I'm kidding it's really 120 

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:03.200
 saved for policies and techniques 

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:05.420
 caching done well so this is one 

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.800
 which can work a thing I have 

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:09.620
 neglected to tell you is that the load 

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:12.440
 balancer keeps these words pinging you 

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:15.560
 machines and if so 

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:17.870
 and if for 15 seconds a car is not 

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:20.240
 responses are automatically removed from 

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:22.760
 pool is marked as bad comes 

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:24.680
 marked as anna hofer and then 

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:27.640
 fifteen should be fifteen 

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:30.110
 seconds when a car does not go and 

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:32.330
 you will have this problem of course but it is 

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:34.430
 but always a trade off no after 15 

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:36.830
 seconds this machine is taken out of the pool 

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:39.260
 and therefore you have the guarantee that with good 

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:41.810
 approximation your customer will come 

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:44.150
 always hitting a car from there 

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:46.520
 the best part is the checks you can 

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:56.540
 do something amazing like this 

00:28:46.520 --> 00:29:03.140
 being able to say verification I don't put anything 

00:28:56.540 --> 00:29:06.050
 By the way you can say check out the 

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:07.240
 page at port 80 with slash address 

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:10.340
 check 

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:11.780
 by doing so you can hope that you 

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:15.560
 be the systems analyst and you have 

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:17.090
 php java developers wanted and these 

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:19.010
 people have written one 

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:21.200
 an application that you don't know how 

00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:25.070
 functions but nothing looks at me 

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:27.110
 premise does in ciak of the system that is 

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:30.590
 fast costs little because it is anyway 

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:33.050
 we do every 15 seconds and me if i 

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:35.510
 I do the unauthenticated slash curl 

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:37.280
 look for port 80 of your car 

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:41.120
 you have to come back to me 200 if everything goes 

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:45.140
 good or 404 500 if things do not go 

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:46.790
 doing so you can give this dough 

00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:49.550
 to the load balancer that automatically 

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:50.990
 will do this cech for you and will remove the 

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:55.010
 machines that do not respond to this 

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:56.480
 check independently of the class e 

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:58.580
 so however the semantics of the 

00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:01.760
 your application and enter this 

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:04.280
 Of course I don't know what is in default 

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:05.690
 a diet of port 80 and you can 

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:08.930
 really try it with machines 

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:11.480
 virtual you can say apt get install a 

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:13.460
 paci on ten machines you can make a 

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:14.870
 service stop on a couple of machines 

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:17.270
 you will see that these are removed 

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:20.990
 from the Alban surgery 30 seconds which is one 

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:22.670
 quite a valuable thing now this is 

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:28.880
 a rough diagram of how long 

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:30.110
 still fantastic then this 

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:33.410
 the rough diagram to make you understand 

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:35.780
 the question I have the most and that they make me 

00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:37.820
 more often on accomplished in gene and how it is 

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:39.559
 inserts with more ten gene in 

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:40.850
 a cloud architecture 

00:30:39.559 --> 00:30:43.100
 ok i promised you i would talk 

00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:44.030
 we're doing a bit of cloud 

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:51.080
 at the beginning we also talk about it now 

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:53.300
 this is an architecture made by ok 

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:56.030
 so a team in us did 

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:57.740
 this this beautiful this 

00:30:56.030 --> 00:31:02.929
 beautiful diagram that makes you understand 

00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:05.660
 that your customer here in the mobile with 

00:31:02.929 --> 00:31:09.559
 a web browser with anything 

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:11.330
 usually the first the first point of 

00:31:09.559 --> 00:31:13.429
 access to any one 

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:16.010
 mobile application is always a page 

00:31:13.429 --> 00:31:17.630
 web that the customer sees it or not another 

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:20.800
 what when you play a game online with 

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:23.510
 I don't know which one of our clients is satin or 

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:26.000
 in any online game you play 

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:27.710
 on the iphone or on facebook anything 

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.350
 usually goes to access pages 

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:32.030
 web with ip ai that are served 

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:34.760
 from a web front so to speak 

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:35.320
 a peace or an engine x or anything 

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:38.179
 it is 

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:40.760
 then in the google scenario 

00:31:38.179 --> 00:31:42.500
 certainly the first front and is a penn 

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:45.260
 jing app engine is very great 

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:47.330
 property and I think and I can 

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:50.000
 boast say is the only one in the world to do 

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:52.790
 this that at least you could use 

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.590
 wrong this is the capacity of 

00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:58.730
 scale automatically in a way 

00:31:54.590 --> 00:32:00.679
 horizontal means that if you just want it 

00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:02.660
 set it up and he will automatically be 

00:32:00.679 --> 00:32:03.140
 able to accept connections over more 

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:04.910
 cars 

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:09.650
 if a car is not enough it will create it 

00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:10.820
 others and cars but scalability is 

00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:13.760
 elastic so that 

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:15.530
 regardless of how many people from 

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:17.120
 how many get are going to affect 

00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:19.670
 on the father on door 80 of this 

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:21.320
 car he will create more cars for 

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:22.970
 support traffic or when the 

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:25.760
 graphic I don't know we are there at night 

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:28.190
 less people to save back to 

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:30.350
 less cars and therefore is a one 

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:31.880
 accordion of cars that go up and 

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:34.130
 down in time and you only pay for 

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:36.910
 what you use which is really the 

00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:39.170
 cloud based concept pay what you use 

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:41.690
 so if this is the front end that 

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:44.750
 what is computer g but surely it is a 

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:47.540
 good on is a good example of back end 

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:50.240
 rather in plain words we can say 

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:51.440
 you need a backhand sequel use 

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:53.270
 the cloud sequel 

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:55.460
 you need in backhand of items 

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:59.510
 then static objects photo images 

00:32:55.460 --> 00:33:03.080
 film geographical data I don't know gis stuff of 

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:05.450
 genre use the cloud storage you have a 

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:07.040
 system does not sequel the data store 

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:08.600
 we are quite famous for the data stop 

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:11.000
 because they like it very much 

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:13.100
 that is a system basically of you 

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.740
 you can can put some objects that 

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:17.630
 they are gods and you have your name and surname 

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:18.800
 address phone number then vi 

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:21.860
 wake up the 

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:23.240
 also forgotten age and from this 

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:24.620
 moment, your data store 

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:26.540
 will count objects that also have the field 

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:28.640
 age but it's not like you have to change 

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:30.800
 the database is a lot and already the how 

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:33.080
 methodology allows you to adapt the 

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:35.270
 system over time and add fields in the 

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:37.700
 time then you may have to have some 

00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:39.230
 algorithms to correct the data 

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:41.510
 maybe more obsolete than missing one 

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:42.460
 campus at the level of program logic 

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:46.450
 you have to assign 

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:48.490
 but more or less so we said to myself 

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:50.350
 if this is for you we are right if 

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:51.880
 this is not for you 

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:54.130
 you probably have a pocket enough 

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:56.470
 complex that deserves the creation of a 

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:58.060
 virtual machine a beautiful way to 

00:33:56.470 --> 00:34:00.370
 app engine to communicate with computers 

00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:02.860
 jing are the letras skew age closed and 

00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:07.240
 we have launched a few months is everything 

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:09.400
 in fieri in the cloud platform and the thing 

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:11.230
 very nice is that the task you is a queue 

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:18.340
 think of a mailbox basically 

00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:19.900
 a fifo queue in which appengine deposits 

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:23.140
 of the rates that must be 

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:25.660
 processed and maybe computer stays in 

00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:27.040
 I listen to this queue and process these 

00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:29.530
 images you have think quite a success 

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:31.120
 with sex with something we yours 

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:32.980
 customer when erika a page a 

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:35.200
 two second you have a second of time 

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:38.860
 to answer if something requires a 

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:39.670
 now it's up to you to return right away 

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:41.020
 page of history 

00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:43.630
 attention we are processing yours 

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:46.330
 request we will send you the answer via 

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:48.480
 email or come back to us tomorrow with the 

00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:51.010
 answer to the page of such 

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:53.290
 and why you are processing in the back end 

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:56.800
 something that will take an hour a day 

00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:59.100
 what is ok so this is a good one 

00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:02.440
 diagram to understand how we can 

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:06.490
 design our system 

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:09.010
 we have customers who write code 

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:12.530
 on top of our dishes for example 

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:15.700
 rightscale as I told you sell cars 

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:19.790
 virtual on top of our offer 

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:24.320
 puppet and chef then papeete ops cod 

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:26.150
 create a ruby-based system in which 

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:27.440
 you can instantiate alloy machines from 

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:29.930
 command you can use a back and also 

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:31.520
 you want you can use google like a 

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:33.650
 another competitor quietly enough 

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:35.570
 that you put the data in a key and then 

00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:38.330
 then in a completely transparent manner 

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:41.420
 there is a system of verbs and entities 

00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:44.030
 then create instance or delete instance or 

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:47.870
 create yourself that is transparent with respect to 

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:49.820
 back end you want to use a thing 

00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:51.230
 very interesting is that you have the 

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:52.580
 possibility to access a starter pack 

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:55.670
 I think you were also told 

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:56.240
 this morning if you enter this code all 

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:59.540
 in 

00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:02.210
 you have 2,000 dollars or 2,000 euros I don't have 

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:05.410
 never understood about a dollar euro dollar 

00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:07.240
 you have 2 thousand dollars d 

00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:09.430
 to start using app engine e 

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:11.740
 incompetent I remember app engine is 

00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:15.400
 completely free if you use a 

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:17.200
 instance you have type 24 hours distances to the 

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:19.750
 day so math enough 

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:21.820
 simple to create four instances for six 

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:23.710
 hours then pull it down if I'm not mistaken though 

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:25.480
 the idea is that if you use an instance only 

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:27.430
 a single virtual machine is free 

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:30.460
 from the second onwards they started paying 

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:31.570
 ok computer gili but unfortunately you have to 

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:33.310
 pay every single machine that 

00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:35.310
 used and in fact I told you 

00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:37.630
 tend to be used for 

00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:39.580
 back end operations operations that a 

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:42.160
 front end like benji is not able to 

00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:43.570
 support yourself so you need a little 

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:48.400
 smash your head and figure out what it is 

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:50.440
 best thing to do for you one 

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:51.820
 very interesting thing who did who 

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.410
 of you knows a pa you don't know what 

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:54.730
 they do 

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:56.410
 then raise your hand who knows what he wants 

00:36:54.730 --> 00:37:01.780
 say but produced at least to an idea of ââwhat 

00:36:56.410 --> 00:37:04.990
 what they are in my time is not taught 

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:06.820
 the school then I tried to 

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:09.130
 beat the pet world record a 

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:11.230
 sort if i'm not mistaken night was it 

00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:13.930
 sorry we are not yet the partner theme 

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:17.680
 and the arrangement of 10 to 12 

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:19.780
 whole thing which is a typical problem of 

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:22.960
 mapreduce but for news it means the map il 

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:25.960
 problem in sub problems applies 

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:27.430
 problem in a computing unit that 

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:30.100
 can be neither virtual machines or ai 

00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:33.100
 in processors will depend on the context and 

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:35.980
 then re-assemble the answer in a 

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:37.900
 controller and so indeed they did 

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:41.380
 the current world record was made by 

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:44.830
 thousand servers 11,000 corn of which 1,400 

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:46.810
 server and was one minute and 0 2 with gm 

00:37:44.830 --> 00:37:48.340
 para you can do it with 1300 servers 

00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:51.400
 think of a thousand units of computation e 

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:54.850
 three controllers 4 thousand mile three disks 

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:57.070
 bodies of a core each 

00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:58.690
 broke the 6 second non record 

00:37:57.070 --> 00:38:00.040
 I believe the interesting part is a 

00:37:58.690 --> 00:38:03.220
 beat the 6-second record 

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:03.910
 at least this is my opinion 

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:06.070
 staff 

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:08.040
 the most interesting part which is the 

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:12.330
 world record was obtained 

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:14.610
 arming and configuring 1460 servers 

00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:16.540
 physical 

00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:19.440
 this means that it takes time 

00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:21.970
 it takes at least a few months ok all 

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:23.830
 you need to configure the servers to find 

00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:25.870
 of the hardware that does for you that you 

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:27.160
 which then maybe because of its advantages 

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:27.490
 you always have the hardware dedicated to all 

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:30.310
 the things 

00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:32.290
 perfect for your application though 

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:34.360
 it takes time and above all what you have 

00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:35.800
 made this world record what you do 

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:36.940
 go for this hardware not 

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:39.370
 recycled in some other way 

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:40.810
 obviously you can do it however not always 

00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:44.830
 what you want 

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:47.650
 now nepal via google computer gene is 

00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:49.720
 succeeded with the education of useful gissi 

00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:50.890
 that the boys of this morning have 

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:53.290
 touched with hand 

00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:55.510
 do a nice cycle for start a thousand 

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:57.760
 machines from less scardini stylization 

00:38:55.510 --> 00:39:01.750
 beige with writing configures this do 

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:03.190
 to leave this and so on 

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:09.190
 a few minutes they pulled up a thousand 

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:10.840
 instances and have paid something like 500 

00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:14.380
 dollars something you can do with 

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:17.050
 your starter pack starter then the 

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:20.020
 part in my opinion is interesting is that 

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:22.630
 in the cloud if you get an idea on a Saturday 

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:26.050
 afternoon and you want to try and see if 

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:27.460
 it works to write the application e 

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:29.530
 if it doesn't work you had fun 

00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:32.830
 you have lost an afternoon if it works e 

00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:34.570
 see some business 

00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:36.580
 the only promise I can make is that 

00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:40.060
 the cloud is the only thing that allows you 

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:43.060
 to indefinitely increase the 

00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:43.870
 number of customer instances the size 

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:45.880
 of your system 

00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:48.460
 within minutes instead of months 

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:50.020
 that is the speed of the system in the 

00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:52.240
 grow if things go well or 

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:53.920
 decrease when things go wrong 

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:55.970
 where to turn off stop paying 

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:58.190
 when things are not going well unfortunately 

00:39:55.970 --> 00:40:01.390
 the downside the cloud vi 

00:39:58.190 --> 00:40:04.340
 lets do this very well ok 

00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:06.290
 let's see if I'm done with a lot 

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:08.450
 interesting is that recently 

00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:09.830
 we can do the billing per minute 

00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:12.050
 we started from then we can arrived 

00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:13.400
 ten minutes now my name is minute 

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:16.630
 it means that yes you give on the machine for 

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:19.220
 5 minutes paid and a twelfth
