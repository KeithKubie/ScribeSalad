JOANNA SMITH: Good afternoon,
everybody, and welcome to this

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.880
week's episode of Google+
Developers Live, where I'm

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.300
going to take some
time to discuss

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.040
our developer policies.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.080
And the reason that I wanted to
do this episode is because

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.790
I wanted to be able to make it
comprehensible, to define the

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.310
key points and break it down
in a way that's easy to

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.700
understand.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.800
I also want to emphasize that
these policies are designed to

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.150
ensure that there's a consistent
user experience.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.700
We want our users to know that
when they click on something

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.580
that has the Google name or the
Google+ name on it, they

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.250
understand what's going
to happen next.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.240
And the other thing that is an
advantage of this episode is

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.560
that the approach here is that
these are the things that we

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.880
look at when you apply
for additional quota.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.380
So if you want a higher rate
limit on some of the calls you

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.260
make, you need to make sure
you're already compliant with

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.990
some of these tips and tricks.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.990
And that'll make sure that
you go a lot faster.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.360
Not being up to date with this
is going to slow down your

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.379
process and make your request
take longer to get through.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.790
So keep that in mind as you go
through and listen to the rest

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.450
of this episode.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.430
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to start with our

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.610
developer policy.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:13.897
And this you can find
at developers.googl

00:01:13.897 --> 00:01:18.050
e.com/plus/policies.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.100
And I'm going to just pull
out a few things here.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.700
There's really a lot
to look at here.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.000
But I recommend you go ahead
and take the time to read

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.420
through it.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.600
It should only take 10 to
15 minutes to skim.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.970
And it will help you keep in
mind the most important things

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.470
that you need to know when
you're designing an app that

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.800
uses Google+ in any way.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.150
But first, let's take a look at
Section c.2.a, because this

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.210
is one of the most important
things to keep in mind, when

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.910
you need to follow the
basic guideline.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.310
The basic tip to our
policies is never

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.180
let the user be surprised.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.910
And so the thing that hits this
point the best is 2.a.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.510
And it says, don't mislead your
users about what your

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.550
application does or trick
them into using it.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.210
And this sounds really harsh.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.800
But it's actually not as
harsh as it may seem.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.720
Because what it really does,
what it really emphasizes, is

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.880
that your user needs to know
what's going to happen when

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.490
they click on something with
the Google name on it.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.690
So for example, if I click on
the Google+ Sign In button,

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.250
and I don't get signed in,
I'm suddenly confused.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.650
The best use case that I can
think of is if I click on the

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.050
Google+ Sign In button, and I
suddenly have a handful of

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.230
celery and vegetables.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.530
Lots of vegetables.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.030
I don't want to click on the
Sign In button and get

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.970
attacked by vegetables.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.130
I want to click on the Sign In
button and know that I'm a

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.540
part of your app, and know
that there's my name, my

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.130
information, that's going to
make a better user experience

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.750
for myself.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.000
So keep that in mind.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.070
The other thing that I want to
point on that hits on this

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.770
"don't surprise your users"
is Section b.1.c.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.680
And what this means is
don't use stale data.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.740
You don't want your user to
have data that's not been

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:52.830
updated in a while.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.540
You want to make sure that if
they delete something on

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.660
Google+, it's not still on
your site a week later.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.910
FEMALE SPEAKER: Where's
my celery!

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.090
JOANNA SMITH: So the best way
you can do this is update your

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.270
cache regularly.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.880
Make sure that you don't keep
any data forever, because that

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.670
wouldn't be a very good
user experience.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.390
But also make sure that
everything in there gets

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.980
refreshed on a regular basis.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.350
So like I said, there's
a lot here.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.800
But it's definitely worth
going through.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.310
But the easiest way to make
sure you're abiding by

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.190
developer policies is that
simple rule of never let the

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.720
user be surprised.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.520
Because if you're meeting that
in every possible way, you're

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.950
probably meeting the rest
of our policies.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.410
So the other major thing that
I wanted to hit on today are

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.990
our branding guidelines.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.420
And these can be found
at developers.googl

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.350
e.com/plus/branding-guidelines.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.640
And there's kind
of a lot here.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.030
We have some helpful
links at the top.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.350
But then what we have are our
buttons, our standard options,

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.190
the things that just
come for free.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.515
And you can actually download.

00:03:56.515 --> 00:03:58.710
And a lot of people haven't
noticed this, but we have a

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.810
download link over here
to the right.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.200
And this has all of our
attributes, all of our buttons

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.970
that you might need for your
app to sign in, to share.

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.780
They're easy to find, and
they're right here.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.200
There are several options,
of course.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.220
We've talked about
those before.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.940
But let's move on to the
other important things.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.459
This next section is what
we refer to as the equal

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.209
prominence specification.

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.600
And what this means is that we
want all of your sign in

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.240
options to be clear and equal.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.210
If you are offering Google+ Sign
In, it should be as up

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.250
front and as discoverable as
any other authentication

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.670
service that you have.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.400
And they should all be
there for the user

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.730
to have a real choice.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.940
And that's really
important to us.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.250
The other thing that's really
cool about this section is

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.380
that it points out an exception
that you might want

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.710
to be aware of.

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.080
If you're designing a custom
button, we have a lot of

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.480
specifications and parameters
for you.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.480
But if you're doing something
in your design that doesn't

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.645
quite fit one of those, and yet
you're doing it across all

00:04:55.645 --> 00:04:59.440
of the authentication services
that you provide, we'll abide

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.750
by the exception as well.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.090
Because it's consistent in the
look and feel of your design.

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.050
It's part of your site, and
we understand that.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.020
So this is really
cool for you.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.170
Now, let's take a look at some
of the custom button design

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.890
specifications.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.990
There's kind of a lot here,
and I understand that.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.570
So I was going to just pull out
the key points for you,

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.810
and you can take a look later
if you want to get to know

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.320
more about it.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.060
So the first, with regard to
size, is that we just want you

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.370
to preserve the original
aspect ratio.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.770
Don't really care how large or
how small the button is, so

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.330
long as it's the same ratio.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.440
With text, this is where it
kind of gets important.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.210
You want to choose the wording
very carefully.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.480
Do something like "Sign in with
Google." It needs to be

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.200
very clear to the user that
they're not signing in to

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.710
Google with your site, but
rather they're using their

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.720
Google identity to authenticate
your app, to gain

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.390
access to other features.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:51.390
That's the distinction.

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.100
And your button text
needs to show that.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.630
In any case, though, never say
Google+ on the button.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.210
It needs to be apparent to the
user that signing in with

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.996
Google grants access to more
than just their Google+ data.

00:06:03.996 --> 00:06:07.300
A developer can add a scope, for
example, to gain access to

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.420
other services, like
Google Drive.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.750
And that's beyond the
scope of Google+.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.810
And the user should not be
confused or surprised to see

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.130
if they're giving access
to Google Drive, using

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:18.180
Google+ Sign In.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.350
So only ever use the word Google
on your button, just to

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.510
keep it clear.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.370
Also, for color, we have some
specific shades of red and

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:27.480
white listed.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.460
And we'd like you to use
these if you're going

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.170
to use red and white.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.390
We don't want some off-shade
or slightly

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:33.880
wrong look and feel.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.600
This ratio is kind of
important to us.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.720
The font that we chose
is Roboto Bold.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.760
This is a True Type font,
and we have to download

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.440
instructions for you.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.680
And then finally, padding.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.610
This is one of those
bits that's of

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:48.460
hard to decide sometimes.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.750
So what we would look like is
we'd like the right and left

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.420
sides of the text to
be the same width

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.130
as the Google+ icon.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:55.840
It's that simple.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.410
So you can just use the same
width over and over.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:02.140
We have a section dedicated to
the Google+ icon by itself.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:07.730
And then we have some "where you
shouldn't go" directions.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.830
And the most important thing
here is that you don't use

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.810
anything that's old
or outdated.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.200
You may have designed your app
over a year and a half ago,

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.085
but Google+ has evolved a lot
since then, and we would like

00:07:18.085 --> 00:07:21.860
it if you would update your
branding to meet our

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:22.860
guidelines.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.270
And like I said, this is one of
those things that I'm going

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:28.820
to check for, for any quota
request that comes by my desk.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:32.830
And if you haven't met that,
if you are using an old

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.500
button, that's an immediate
hesitation.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.440
You have to fix that before we
can approve your request.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.140
So the more up-to-date you are,
the sooner you can get

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:44.170
through our process for
additional rate limits.

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:47.030
So, the last thing I want
to talk about, as far as

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:49.590
branding, is I have an
example for you.

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:52.820
And this is one of my favorite
partners that we have.

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:53.990
This is Fancy.

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:59.220
And they are a pretty cool site
for how to buy things or

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.320
really interesting products
they have a lot of.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.440
But what they did
here is awesome.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.510
They built a custom button, but
it fits seamlessly into

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:08.910
their design, which
is why it's such

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:10.010
a good custom button.

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:13.630
They've preserved our original
red and white contrast.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:14.520
We really like that.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.600
They've got the Google there.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.090
But what they did that's
so cool is they

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:20.070
redesigned our button.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.440
Our button was rounded, a
little bit more shaded.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.440
They wanted a flatter look,
because you'll notice that

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:28.190
their entire site has
a pretty flat look.

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:30.480
It's consistent.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.840
So they have equal prominence.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.059
They have the right colors.

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:34.400
They have the right text.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.669
And they made it fit seamlessly
into the entire

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:37.929
design of their side.

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:40.090
This is an example
of a well done

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:42.179
customized sign in button.

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:45.310
And you can actually turn to
Fancy for a lot of other

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:47.350
ideas, because their
implementation is pretty cool

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:48.220
all around.

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.270
So I encourage you to check
out their site if you're

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:52.880
looking for inspiration.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.830
So that's everything that I
have for you regarding our

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:56.770
policies and our branding
guidelines.

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:59.330
But before we go, I wanted to
take a moment, because I've

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.310
noticed a lot of questions
lately in the Google+

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:06.200
Developers community regarding
some of these developer notice

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.820
emails that have gone out.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:11.170
And these are a sort of
implementation check up.

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:14.240
And they're actually intended
to help developers find and

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.190
fix their implementation.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.910
So, the most obvious causes of
these emails are some of the

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:20.850
things that I talked
about today.

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.200
And for that reason, I really
hope that this can help you

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.740
find where you might have gone
wrong, if you're one of those

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.360
developers that's wondering
what triggered this email.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.510
These are some of the things
that you want to look at.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:32.040
So I hope that's helped
you all today.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.920
And if you have any questions,
feel free to ask them in the

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.000
comments of this event or raise
them in the community.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.730
And I'll take a look
this week.

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:41.110
Thanks everybody, and have
a good afternoon.
