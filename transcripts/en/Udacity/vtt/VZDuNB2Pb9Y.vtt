00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.280
In this lesson we will talk about

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.630
distributed hash tables, which enable a form of

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.440
content overlay called a structured overlay. We'll

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.130
talk about a particular distributed hash table called

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.200
Chord and an underlying mechanism that enables

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.820
it, called consistent hashing. Chord is a scalable,

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.120
distributed lookup service. A lookup service is

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.220
simply any service that maps keys to values.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.960
Examples of lookup services on the internet include

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.770
DNS and directory services. Chord has some desirable

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.370
properties, including scalability, provable correctness, and reasonably good

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.310
performance that's also fairly easy to reason about.
