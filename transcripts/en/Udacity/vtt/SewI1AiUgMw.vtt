00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
You finished Unit #2, and you now know a lot about scatter plots.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
They tend to be 2-dimensional, and real-world scatter plots look often just like this

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
where a simple eyeballing tells us something about the relationship

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
of one variable to another.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Now, scatter plots aren't great when there is what is called "noise."

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
That is, the data deviates from the exportation in some random, noisy way.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
In the next unit, we talk about a simple plot called "bar chart"

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
that addresses the issue of noise in data by pooling data points into a single cumulative bar.

00:00:42.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So stay tuned.
