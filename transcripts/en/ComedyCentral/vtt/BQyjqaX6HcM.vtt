- You know as anyone
will tell ya',

00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:05.538 line:0%
I'm a lover of the
finer things in life,

00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:09.109 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
incredible outfits,
exotic bilingual women

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:12.445 align:start position:0%
and Guy Fieri's American
Kitchen and Bar in New York City

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:15.482 align:start size:81% position:19%
recipient of three
Michelin Tires.

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:16.850
As a possessor

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.185 align:start position:0%
of one of the most sophisticated
palettes of all-time,

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:20.553
I'm gonna offer my critique

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:24.591 align:start size:84% position:16%
of some of Guy's most
legendary dishes.

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:25.525
(water spitting)

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:27.227
(annoyed grunt) Horse piss.

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:31.331 line:0%
Ah, Dragon's Breath
Chili, let's see.

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:37.637
(intrigued grunt)

00:00:37.637 --> 00:00:39.639
This has some interesting notes,

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:43.376
kind of like licking the floor

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:45.979
of your drunk uncle's rec room.

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:52.452
A hint of an ashtray

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:55.789
at a dog track.

00:00:57.157 --> 00:00:59.259
There's definitely
a taint element,

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:03.096 align:start size:94% position:6%
but I can't put my finger
on who's taint it is.

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:08.101 align:start size:88% position:13%
George Stephanopoulos's
pinky ring

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:12.505
and bull semen, I knew it.

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:15.308 line:0%
You know, they say each
rack of Motley Que Ribs

00:01:15.308 --> 00:01:19.712
is painstakingly marinated
in a stripper's bathtub.

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:22.182
(intrigued grunt)

00:01:22.182 --> 00:01:24.250
Got a nice tang to it.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.986 align:start size:81% position:19%
You can really
taste the Sudafed.

00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:32.592
Horse.

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:34.294
(excited grunt) Lucky me.

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:37.297
I think I found a piece
of Guy's soul patch.

00:01:37.297 --> 00:01:40.400
He really is a hands-on chef.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.835
(wind blowing)

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:44.704
You know it's better this way.

00:01:44.704 --> 00:01:46.339 line:0%
Now one of Shakespeare's fools

00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:48.808
was this tastefully
realizes this one

00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:51.010 align:start size:84% position:16%
of the salted whiskey
caramel variety

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.780 align:start size:84% position:16%
and yes, I'm including
Bottom the weaver.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.482
(laughing)

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:58.151
(coughing)

00:01:58.151 --> 00:02:02.255
This would pair well with
subtle spirit as digestif.

00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:07.494
(relaxed grunt)

00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:09.729 line:0%
That's the stuff.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.198 line:0%
The Guy-talian Nachos
are a wonderful blend

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:16.703
of sausage, beef and ricotta
on fucking tortilla chips.

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:18.304
Reminds me of that
one time in Italy

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:22.842 align:start size:84% position:16%
when a lusty divorcee
of advanced age took
me as her lover,

00:02:22.842 --> 00:02:24.677
looked a lot like this.

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:27.280
Also, she too gave me diarrhea.

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:30.216 line:0%
A variety of condiments

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:32.952
have been provided for
the Volcano Chicken.

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:35.188
Flavor, according to taste.

00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:46.466
Need a little bit more.

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:49.869
(whiskey splashing)

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:52.138
(spitting)

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:54.974 align:start size:81% position:19%
I don't think I
should be driving.

00:02:54.974 --> 00:02:56.576
(keys jingling)

00:02:56.576 --> 00:02:57.710
(grunting)

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:58.978 line:0%
Looks like my fried ice cream

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:01.447 line:0%
has been aged by
the hot autumn sun.

00:03:01.447 --> 00:03:03.283
It don't make no matter.

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:05.385
(intrigued grunt)

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:08.054
(straw sucking)

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:13.693 align:start size:97% position:3%
Here's a fun fact, they
say it's the only ice cream

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:16.429
that's been fried with
a Firestone car battery.

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:18.031
Not your best work Mr. Fieri.

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:19.799
I mean, sure ya'
fried ice cream,

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.468
but why not add a pocket
of blue cheese dressing

00:03:22.468 --> 00:03:25.371
or maybe a drizzle
of nacho cheese sauce

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:28.975 align:start size:88% position:13%
or maybe a pair of
gin-soaked board shorts.

00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:31.177
I believed in you God damn it.

00:03:31.177 --> 00:03:33.046
(spitting)

This is Dave Hill At Midnight's
food critic signing off.

00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:37.650
Now if you'll excuse me,

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.520 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm gonna go hit the
can for 12 hours.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.688
Oh God.
