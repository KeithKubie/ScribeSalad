00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.004
( intro music )

00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:11.410 line:0%
We're about 5,000 species
into a 12,000 species quest.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.879
<i>Let's just get people to look
 these animals in the eye</i>

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:15.514
<i>on black and white backgrounds,</i>

00:00:15.514 --> 00:00:16.549
<i> We're not trying to
 get everything</i>

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:17.984
<i>on the face of the Earth,
 there's millions.</i>

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:20.719
<i> We're trying to get
 everything in captivity.</i>

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:22.389
<i> Instead of this</i>

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:23.656
<i> let's do this.</i>

00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:26.359
<i>Instead of this animal just
going to become stew that night</i>

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.661
<i> in a bush meat market
 in Equatorial Guinea,</i>

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:30.363
<i>lets take black velvet and
 make him immortal.</i>

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:32.532
<i> So we have. He's run all
 over the world now.</i>

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:35.868
<i>Sydney Opera House, Empire
State Building, you name it.</i>

00:00:35.868 --> 00:00:38.738
<i>Up to half of all species
of amphibian could be lost</i>

00:00:38.738 --> 00:00:40.473
<i>in the next 20 years, say.</i>

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:43.209
<i>I went to a lab in Ecuador,
the guy, he's got this frog</i>

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:45.178
<i>he puts it down in front of
me at this breeding center.</i>

00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:47.146
<i> Take a picture of this,
 nine left.</i>

00:00:47.146 --> 00:00:49.148
<i> Take a picture of this,
 five left.</i>

00:00:49.148 --> 00:00:51.551
<i> Take a picture of this,
 four left.</i>

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:54.153
<i>And in the ten years that
I've been doing this project</i>

00:00:54.153 --> 00:00:56.588
<i> this has gone extinct,
 this has gone extinct</i>

00:00:56.588 --> 00:00:59.091
<i>and this, and this, and this.</i>

00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:01.394
Or the Northern White Rhino
named Nabiré

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:05.164
at the Dvur Králové Zoo, this
summer in the Czech Republic.

00:01:05.164 --> 00:01:08.134
<i> She was really old.
 And she had cysts.</i>

00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:09.669
<i>And they knew those cysts
we're going to be a problem</i>

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:11.871
<i> but she was too old
 to anaesthetize</i>

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:13.472
<i>and put under to work on.</i>

00:01:13.472 --> 00:01:16.976
<i>So, we got there this summer,
rolled out the black velvet</i>

00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:19.578
<i> photographed her,
 sweetest rhino ever.</i>

00:01:19.578 --> 00:01:21.280
<i>And at the end of the shoot,
 she was tired</i>

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.148
<i> and she laid down
 and went to sleep.</i>

00:01:23.148 --> 00:01:26.152
And she died seven days later.

00:01:26.152 --> 00:01:28.187
And now the world has four.

00:01:28.187 --> 00:01:30.656
And they're all too old
to breed. And that's it.

00:01:30.923 --> 00:01:32.025
<i> Why the black and
 white backgrounds?</i>

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:33.492
<i> Well, they're the
 great equalizer.</i>

00:01:33.492 --> 00:01:36.429
<i>This tiger is no more important
 that the Tiger Beetle.</i>

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:38.831
<i> Probably a little less
 complicated actually.</i>

00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:40.632
<i> And this bison is no
 more important than</i>

00:01:40.632 --> 00:01:43.235
<i>a Bog Turtle or a Bat-eared Fox.</i>

00:01:43.235 --> 00:01:45.070
<i> We have to cover,
 snakes we have to--</i>

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.539
<i> cover things that
 crawl on the ground.</i>

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.208
<i>It ain't all grizzly bears,
 it ain't all koalas</i>

00:01:49.208 --> 00:01:51.511
<i>as much as we'd like it to be.
 We run these pictures</i>

00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:55.114
up the Geographic NG Instagram
flagpole routinely.

00:01:55.114 --> 00:01:58.251
There's about 33-34 million
people see these pictures.

00:01:58.251 --> 00:01:59.918
<i> You know what people
 respond to the most?</i>

00:01:59.918 --> 00:02:02.521
<i> Mammals and animals
 that look like us.</i>

00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:05.057
<i> The more they stand up,
the more people like them.</i>

00:02:05.057 --> 00:02:08.094
<i> Insects, snakes,
 turtles not so much.</i>

00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:09.928
<i>Zoos actually are the ark.</i>

00:02:09.928 --> 00:02:11.964
<i> Zoos are the ones
 that really take care</i>

00:02:11.964 --> 00:02:14.400
<i>to make sure we have assurance
 colonies of animals</i>

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.502
until we get smart
enough as a species

00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:19.172
to set land aside that
these animals need.

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:20.572
And we need it too,
believe me.

00:02:20.572 --> 00:02:22.608
<i> We work with these
 zoos months in advance</i>

00:02:22.608 --> 00:02:25.077
<i> to make sure that we're
working with animals that</i>

00:02:25.077 --> 00:02:26.745
<i>will tolerate the process fine.</i>

00:02:26.745 --> 00:02:28.748
<i> We haven't heard
 anything yet in</i>

00:02:28.748 --> 00:02:30.950
<i>many, many, many species.</i>

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.520
<i> and it may be that the
 true value of Photo Ark</i>

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.489
doesn't happen for
another hundred years

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.992
when people go back and
they see what we have.

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:41.060
Maybe they'll save
what they have left.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.062
<i> Here in North America,
 the Whooping Crane</i>

00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:45.865
<i> the California Condor,
 the Mexican Gray Wolf</i>

00:02:45.865 --> 00:02:48.867
<i>Black-footed Ferret, even the
 Vancouver Island Marmot.</i>

00:02:48.867 --> 00:02:51.703
<i>All these animals got down
 to fewer than two dozen.</i>

00:02:51.703 --> 00:02:53.172
And they are not out of
the woods completely

00:02:53.172 --> 00:02:54.874
but they are in
the hundreds now.

00:02:54.874 --> 00:02:57.076
They are stable.
How 'bout that?

00:02:57.076 --> 00:03:00.412
Because people cared.
People cared. That's it.

00:03:00.412 --> 00:03:02.282
All you have to do
is pay attention.
