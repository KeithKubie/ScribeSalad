RETO MEIER: Hello, my
name is Reto Meier.

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:04.220
IAN NI-LEWIS: And I'm
Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.920
RETO MEIER: We're kicking off
2013 by launching our pure

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.680
Android collection here on a
very special episode of--

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.930
IAN NI-LEWIS: The App Clinic.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.370
RETO MEIER: It's been awhile
since our last App Clinic but

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.590
we've been hard at work during
the interval testing your apps

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.310
in some pretty remote and
extreme conditions.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.795
IAN NI-LEWIS: That was a tough
one for you, I remember.

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:26.020
RETO MEIER: Yeah, I struggled.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.680
But the things I do for this
team and for this job.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.270
IAN NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.299
I simply stayed here and poured
beer on my phone.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:33.190
We have to do stress-testing.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.160
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.180
We all do what we can.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.590
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well anyway, we're
back now and we're ready

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.420
to get back to work.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.130
RETO MEIER: We thought the best
way to get back into the

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.440
swing of things was to remind
everyone what the App Clinic

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.200
is all about.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.240
IAN NI-LEWIS: And what better
way to do that than by showing

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.270
off some of our graduates.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.150
And officially launching--

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.115
RETO MEIER: Pure Android.

00:00:50.115 --> 00:00:52.390
IAN NI-LEWIS: Pure Android is a
Google Play collection that

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.290
we, along with Roman, Nick, and
Adam from Android Design

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.500
in Action will be curating.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.170
You can find it at bitly dot--
er, bit.ly is that--?

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.150
Do we just say bitly?

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.700
RETO MEIER: Yeah, I'll
just go with bitly.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.890
I think we just say bitly.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.450
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.
bit.ly/PureAndroid.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:06.100
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.520
It's a way for us to shine some
light on the Android apps

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.260
that we've examined
during be App

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.700
Clinic, often quite candidly.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.090
But they've really built
something beautiful and

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.570
intuitive, and taken some
feedback that we've given to

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.300
create something which
we really like.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.860
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.870
It's also a small way of saying
thank you all the

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.070
developers who submit their
apps to our constructive

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.580
criticism, and who then turn
around and make their apps

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.530
even better.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.780
RETO MEIER: And so we're
going to be adding

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.930
to this list slowly.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.010
So there's only a couple
of apps that

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.960
we'll be adding today.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.260
And we're going to hope to try
and find a couple of really

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.640
good examples, maybe every week,
maybe every other week.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.410
So it's a list that
we hope to grow.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.165
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh yeah,
I've got a list.

00:01:40.165 --> 00:01:43.140
RETO MEIER: There's lots of
great apps out there, but we

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.720
want to make sure we give each
app the opportunity to really

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.740
shine by itself first.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.460
So that's why we're going
to go slowly.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.670
And every time we do induct
someone in our hall of fame,

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.970
we're going to do it live on the
App Clinic, so stay tuned

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.350
for the end of the show when
we're going to give you a

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.180
little more details on what it
takes for you to create an app

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.090
worthy of the Pure
Android title.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.940
IAN NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.080
So today we're inducting two
apps into Pure Android, both

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.780
of which we looked at in the
very early days of Android

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.075
Developers Live.

00:02:09.075 --> 00:02:12.730
RETO MEIER: And that's Pattrn
by Lucas Rocha and Tasks by

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.070
Team Tasks.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.570
And it's not just because
they're both using Apps Clinic

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:17.610
as their color palette.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.565
IAN NI-LEWIS: Although, that
does tend to make, you know--

00:02:20.565 --> 00:02:21.060
yeah.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.600
RETO MEIER: It's not
going against them,

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.260
I'll say that much.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.220
IAN NI-LEWIS: No, no.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.000
Let's start by taking
a look at Pattrn.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.630
RETO MEIER: All right.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.250
So right off the bat, you can
see that they've done a great

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.490
job on a Google Play
feature page.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.250
The branding is really
striking.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.840
And it's still entirely
consistent between their logo

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.270
and their feature graphic.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.120
And you can see how this
banner is really

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.140
going to stand out.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.900
No matter what size it is, if it
does get featured in Google

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.440
Play, you're going to
notice this banner.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.825
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:02:45.825 --> 00:02:48.580
And you can tell it's not just
that they've made something

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.070
big and bold.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.110
They've also taken a lot
of care with the pixels

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.740
themselves.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.770
They do have a little bit of
drop shadow, but it's not

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.930
obvious, just to
separate them--

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.260
the pattern from
the background.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.995
They've done some design.

00:02:59.995 --> 00:03:00.810
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.400
And that's really important
for the sort of

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.270
app that this is.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.170
Something which is visual, which
people who care about

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.470
designing would be
interested in.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.550
It really pays to take
that extra step and

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:11.620
make that extra effort.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.560
IAN NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.440
It also gives you a grade
A idea of what the

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.765
apps going to do.

00:03:15.765 --> 00:03:17.150
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.760
So throughout the
app, the design

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.020
language is really clean.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.850
It's really uncluttered.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.650
It's intuitive and it's entirely
consistent with the

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:24.985
Android Design Guide.

00:03:24.985 --> 00:03:27.153
And you can see that as you move
through the app you're

00:03:27.153 --> 00:03:29.530
never left wondering where you
are, what you should be doing.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.570
The navigation is obvious.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:32.880
The screen design
is really clear.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.980
There's not extra stuff
going on there.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.380
They've tried to keep it as
visual as possible and as

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.930
non-intrusive as they can.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.140
And if you look at their tablet
layouts-- which is sort

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.920
of key as well to being
pure Android.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.000
You can see that they've
implemented a fantastic

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.720
responsive design that
works well both in

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.110
portrait and in landscape.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.710
And that's really important and
really exciting for me to

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.640
see a great tablet experience
that works in both

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.120
orientations.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.900
So we spoke to the developer
of Pattrn, Lucas, earlier.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.710
And we asked him to tell us a
little bit more about his

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.606
experience building a
Pure Android app.

00:04:05.606 --> 00:04:07.060
LUCAS ROCHA: Hello.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.800
I'm Lucas Rocha.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.846
I'm the creator of Pattrn.

00:04:10.846 --> 00:04:14.510
It's a unique app, like a
wallpaper app, for Android

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:15.890
phones and tablets.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:21.010
What's unique about it is that
instead of the usual

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.340
photo-based wallpapers that you
get from other apps, it

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.050
gives you access to more than
200,000 patterns created by

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.720
the COLOURlovers community.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.780
And the cool thing about working
with patterns in the

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.960
context of wallpapers is that
because they are tiled they

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.830
will always look great on any
form factor, because they

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.180
don't stretch or crop
or anything.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.860
So it always works great.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.730
That's the cool thing, and I
think that's one of the things

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.750
that is attracting a lot of
attention to the app now.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.550
If I'm not mistaken, Pattrn was
one of the first apps to

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.300
implement proper design
for Nexus 7.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.390
And I think maybe that was one
of the things that caught the

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.690
attention of the Google folks.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.190
So that was an interesting
thing.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.050
And actually, I started working
on the Tablet UI

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.970
because of the Nexus 7.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:12.750
It's a great device.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:13.240
I love it.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.640
I have one.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.870
And as part of the process, I
also implemented the 10 inch

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:19.700
UI, of course.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.000
So it just made sense.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.160
So responsive design is probably
one of the most

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.710
challenging things I had
to do on Pattrn.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.480
Although Pattrn is in kind of a
privileged position in terms

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.680
of scalability just because the
content is so flexible in

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.650
terms of stretching, like
filling areas, because we are

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.970
tiling all the time.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:51.430
So you don't have a lot of the
constraints in terms of the

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.450
content you're presenting.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.000
So that helped a lot.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.220
I had a lot of freedom to size
things properly without caring

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.730
about looking bad in some form
factors for example.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:06.520
So there was one suggestion by
Roman Nurik which was to use

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.940
grid on landscape on phones.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.620
And that's something I didn't
do just because I

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.530
didn't have time to.

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.410
But I definitely
want to do it.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:19.400
It's just one of those details
that make a lot of difference

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.410
and I just didn't have
time to do it yet.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:26.680
But I do get a lot of
inspirations from other apps.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.880
This is one of the reasons
I watch the show.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.350
Not live, most of the time.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:35.620
But I always try to watch them
just because especially the

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:40.570
design in action stuff.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.950
Especially that series
of proposed

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:44.700
designs from the community.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:45.910
That was really inspiring.

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:51.820
And I think the big message,
from that amount of designs--

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:58.530
great designs that we got was
that there is clearly a design

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.720
language arising in the Android
platform, and that

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:08.290
helps, especially for developers
getting started in

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:09.100
the platform.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.200
They have a reference, a visual
design to get started

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:13.970
and that helps a lot.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.760
Especially if you don't have a
designer working with you.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:18.540
So that helps a lot.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.470
I'm not a designer.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:23.150
I tend to see myself as
a developer with a

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:26.220
design eye to things.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.650
So having this design language
helps a lot.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:32.120
The think is, with any platform,
definitely just

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.430
going through API Docs
doesn't help at all.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:39.740
So having some discussion, and
some reference designs, or

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.630
even reference implementations
of certain aspects of the

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:43.990
platform help a lot.

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:48.990
So this is where I think the
design action shows help a

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:54.010
lot, in terms of discussing one
topic and maybe talking

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.510
about existing reference
implementations.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:59.020
And that helps a lot.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.870
Implementation wise, to be
honest, it wasn't that

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:02.690
challenging.

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:08.880
I think the big thing with
Pattrn was finding the right

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.130
design for it.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:16.040
And I usually spend much more
time thinking about how things

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.380
should look than implementing.

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:22.100
One thing I did for Pattrn that
helped a lot was I did

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:26.970
fragment-based implementation
from day one.

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.630
So I didn't have to
reimplement the

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:31.520
app to support tablets.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:36.970
So I started with a phony UI,
pretty much with one fragment

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:37.939
inside one activity.

00:08:37.939 --> 00:08:42.270
So a one-to-one relationship
for every bit of the UI.

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:47.110
So when I came to start working
on the tablet UI, it

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:51.860
was a natural thing to just put
two pieces together in a

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:52.480
different layout.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.420
So that helped a lot.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:56.230
I sketch a lot.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:59.480
I have a very thick notebook,
and I have several

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.200
versions of the UI.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.880
And I only start implementing
when I feel good about it.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.160
It doesn't need to be perfect.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.960
But I need to feel good about
the direction of things.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:15.300
And that helps in terms of
avoiding reimplementing stuff,

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.350
just because you change your
mind while doing something.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:21.660
And of course, as any software
development, you'll

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:22.600
learn as you do.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.670
There's nothing in software
development that is

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.830
deterministic, like you know
what you're doing and you go

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:29.430
until you end with
the same idea.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.280
So as you do it, you change

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.160
direction, you tweak something.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.490
So actually there's something
interesting about

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:37.650
the design of Pattrn.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:40.840
I started Pattrn, I wanted to
do something like a flick

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.870
board thing of wallpapers.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:46.910
So it would look like
a magazine thing.

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:51.600
And in the end, I just couldn't
find a way to make it

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.780
look not right and nice.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:59.660
So that was about the time
the whole Holo thing

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.700
started to pop up.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:08.610
So once I got the design
language of Holo, the ICS

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:12.560
stuff, it just felt natural to
implement something that was

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.990
more in line of Androids.

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:15.890
Because flipboard is very--

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:18.330
I mean, it's a nice design,
but it's alien.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.730
It's not really Android
in many ways.

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:24.500
It has some bits of Android
there, but not really.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.960
So right now I'm working
on two things.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:32.000
One is editing features.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.550
So allowing you to change colors
of existing patterns,

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:39.770
adding brightness
and saturation,

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:41.160
this kind of thing.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.410
A lot of people ask that.

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:45.170
They like the pattern, but they
don't like the colors,

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:46.250
this kind of thing.

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:49.310
And the other thing is syncing
across devices.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.800
So you have favorites, your
wallpaper history.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.200
You want that across all your
different Android devices.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.500
And that's something
I'm working on now.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:02.860
IAN NI-LEWIS: --to you today
is Tasks, by Team Tasks.

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:05.220
RETO MEIER: The Tasks Team have
also created a strong and

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.480
consistent brand style.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.890
And I'm particularly impressed
by their icon, which is both a

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:11.930
distinctive silhouette and also
offers a really excellent

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:14.932
indication of what
the app offers.

00:11:14.932 --> 00:11:17.560
IAN NI-LEWIS: Like Pattrn, the
learning curve to get started

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.800
with Task is virtually
nonexistent.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.470
They've used a standard action
bar with icons and make it

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:25.840
immediately obvious how to add
new items to your list.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.190
The view page is a simple
and obvious way to

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:29.330
switch between lists.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:30.250
We love it.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:32.650
And we also love small touches
that help make this app

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:35.340
particularly intuitive, like the
ability to drag and drop

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.550
items in the list
to reorder them.

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:41.460
They've also included some
excellent interactive widgets

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:42.910
which use the same
design language.

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:45.960
And we love us some widgets.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.300
The tablet layout is exactly
what you'd expect.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:52.890
Similarly intuitive, standard
multi-pane approach with a

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:55.120
fragment on the left and a
fragment on the right which

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.750
basically just removes a level
of navigation by letting you

00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:01.060
modify your tasks while the
list is still visible.

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:04.040
Notice also, on this version,
they've implemented a

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:08.480
contextual action bar which
is very tablet-y.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.410
So really well done there.

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:14.260
Now we also spoke to Jorim from
Task Team to find out a

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.140
little more about how he created
this Pure Android

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:17.490
experience.

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:21.100
RETO MEIER: Let's
listen to him.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:22.840
JORIM JAGGI: Hi, my
name is Jorim.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.440
I'm one of the developers
of the app

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.280
Tasks, from Team Tasks.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:31.860
The app is basically designed
to sync with Google Tasks.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.880
It's a relatively simple app,
where you can add your

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:39.410
personal tasks and show them in
Gmail and check them off.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.890
The app is now like nine
months on Google Play.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.470
It was released in April.

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:51.510
We had huge success with
engagement and ratings and,

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:53.730
yeah, it's a pretty cool app.

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:59.190
Based on the feedback of Google
Developer Advocates, we

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:01.970
implemented that you can set
customer reminder times for

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:04.580
every task.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:06.520
But this is not synced
with Google Tasks

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.870
because it's not possible.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:15.800
And also we did some minor clean
up, like, the Up button

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.770
on the Home screen was
pressable, but it didn't have

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:19.330
any action.

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.560
So we cleaned some stuff
like that up.

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.790
Like the change we did for the
reminder times helped ratings

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:27.020
and comments a lot.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.900
It was like the number one
complaint about the app, that

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.770
people can't set custom reminder
times, and I can

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:33.900
understand why.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.970
Although, it's kind of hard
for us because we really

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:40.100
designed the app to be
like the Google Tasks

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:41.460
client you can use.

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.470
And as soon as we implement
functionality, which we can't

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:45.900
sync, we have kind
of a problem.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:50.170
So this is kind of a trade off
between a useful feature and

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:53.130
not being able to sync that.

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:57.020
But it helped a lot for our
ratings and comments.

00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:01.675
So the most challenging parts
really the sync part.

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:09.240
It sounds pretty simple to sync
all your tasks with the

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.600
Google back end.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.320
Sounds really simple, but it
gets really complicated

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.250
because it can have nests
of self tasks.

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:19.150
And then, what happens if you
delete the parent what happens

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.330
if the child, and
all this stuff.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:25.040
And what we did there is kind
of we unit tested the whole

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:28.740
thing so that we were
sure that the

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.620
sync is working properly.

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.640
Because the sync code is kind
of the heart of the

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:34.750
application.

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:36.850
It's kind of the most important
stuff that the sync

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:38.750
always works.

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:41.780
And, yeah, that was kind of
really challenging, but it

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:42.310
worked out.

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:44.530
And we had almost no bugs.

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:48.290
We had some, a few bugs there,
but we figured it out.

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:51.630
Our app adapts itself to
the different device

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:52.290
configurations.

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:56.360
We basically design the app to
be compatible with four--

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.420
no, the three main buckets.

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.190
The size of a Nexus 4, the size
of a Nexus 7, and the

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:04.280
size of Nexus 10.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.350
On a Nexus 4, you just
see the task list.

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:10.610
And then if you press your
task, you can edit it.

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:13.450
And on a Nexus 7, it's
kind of the same.

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:17.360
But if you rotated into
landscape, you see your tasks

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.770
on the left and the task
detail on the right.

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:24.600
So you can edit the task while
doing other tasks.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:29.120
And on the Nexus 10 it's still
the same, but with more

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.770
spacing and bigger font sizes
and all this stuff.

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:37.050
But really designed to work
from the ground up.

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:40.030
We were clear this app has to
work with all kind of devices.

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:42.700
And Android makes it really
easy, I have to say.

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:45.550
They have a really powerful
resource system.

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:51.230
Select the correct resources
helped design apps that better

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:53.930
work with all screen sizes.

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:56.790
So our design process like

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.440
[INAUDIBLE], we do some sketches.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.570
But then start implementing them
right away, because we

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:04.450
are more developers.

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:11.620
And it's really easy with the
tool in Eclipse now to do the

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:14.960
[INAUDIBLE] like writing code
and reuse it when you are

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.330
really want to implement
it to the whole design.

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:21.740
And we go normally from sketches
to implementation

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:22.880
right away.

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.180
And then iterate, of course,
with designers.

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:29.480
So my favorite part about
developing on the Android is

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:37.610
that you can design one app
and it runs on like 1,000

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:38.660
different devices.

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:39.820
That's really great.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:44.100
And also Android provides a lot
of useful tools to achieve

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.610
that, to have a response
to design on

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:48.780
every of these devices.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:54.340
So for example, the density
independent stuff.

00:16:54.340 --> 00:17:01.500
It just runs everywhere and
also the whole thing with

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:05.680
fragments and the resource
system that you can have

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:09.260
fragments for this device, but
not on this screen size.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:16.640
And that's really, really
pleasing that now I developed,

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:21.190
basically, for testing we used
these three devices.

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:25.670
A four inch phone, seven inch
tablet and a ten inch tablet,

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:30.230
then also a legacy device with
Android 2.2 for backwards

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:31.370
compatibility.

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:35.202
But then after that we didn't
have a single issue that it

00:17:35.202 --> 00:17:36.090
didn't run on a device.

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:37.630
That was really great.

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:40.990
That you have like four devices
to test and it runs

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:42.620
everywhere.

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:47.190
So our next steps for the app
is kind of to integrate the

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:49.150
emails into the tasks.

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:54.590
There is a feature in Gmail
where you can add an email to

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:56.020
your task list.

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:59.220
And we just don't show
it on the device.

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:03.270
So we really would like to sync
all these email stuff

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:07.560
into the device and as soon as
you click on the link, you can

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:11.650
see the email in the mobile
web browser and stuff.

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:15.720
Besides that, we are also
looking with integrating our

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:25.080
data with third party widgets
like simple widgets, whatever.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:28.220
There are lots of them and
they're all asking for a

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:31.800
content provider that
we provide.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:36.100
So the users can show their
tasks on the custom.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.730
They're really customized
widgets.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:39.120
Yeah.

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:44.305
That's kind of what you're
looking for to build.

00:18:44.305 --> 00:18:46.680
IAN NI-LEWIS: So congratulations
to Pattrn and

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.570
Tasks for making it
into Pure Android.

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:50.770
RETO MEIER: For the rest of you,
here's your opportunity

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:54.310
to find out how you, too, can
join these illustrious ranks.

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:56.130
IAN NI-LEWIS: Let's start
with the basics.

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:58.020
RETO MEIER: So yes.

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.240
There's sort of four key
things that you need to

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.230
consider to even be
in the running for

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:03.750
us to consider you.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:07.650
And those are great assets,
having a great quality app,

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:09.980
having a great quality tablet
app, and following the Android

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:10.840
design guidelines.

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.555
Let's look at each of these in
a little bit more detail.

00:19:13.555 --> 00:19:15.180
IAN NI-LEWIS: These really
are pretty basic.

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:19.260
I mean, for the assets, we're
looking for something that's

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.590
going to help us help you
sell your application.

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:25.790
The people that work for Google
Play really want to

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:26.880
help you sell your app.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:30.620
But they can't do that if your
assets look like garbage.

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.590
RETO MEIER: Or if they're
not even there.

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:32.880
All right?

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.800
So we can't-- we will probably
not even look at your app on

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.600
the clinic if you don't at
least have your feature

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.710
graphic, basically all of the
assets which you need to

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:43.130
specify in Google Play done.

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:45.070
IAN NI-LEWIS: So, I think back
here we've actually got your

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:45.720
app, right, Reto?

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:46.220
RETO MEIER: We do.

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:46.350
This is my app.

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:46.930
IAN NI-LEWIS: Your
illustrious app.

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:49.850
RETO MEIER: I would like to
take some credit for the

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:50.480
assets here.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.580
I can't take any.

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:52.060
Actually--

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:53.730
IAN NI-LEWIS: Was it
your doctor friend?

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:56.240
RETO MEIER: It was actually
not my doctor friend.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:58.490
In this instance it was Roman
who actually put together

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:01.800
these quite impressive looking
graphics for me.

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.340
IAN NI-LEWIS: So what's the
one in the middle on the

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:05.190
bottom right here?

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:07.310
RETO MEIER: That is, that's
an earthquake.

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:09.695
IAN NI-LEWIS: But is that
the feature graphic?

00:20:09.695 --> 00:20:10.410
RETO MEIER: That's the feature
graphic, yeah.

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:10.860
IAN NI-LEWIS: OK.

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:12.330
Because the contrast's
a little weird.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:13.845
RETO MEIER: The contrast
is a little off, yeah.

00:20:13.845 --> 00:20:15.494
IAN NI-LEWIS: We should probably
fix that if we're

00:20:15.494 --> 00:20:15.825
going to feature you.

00:20:15.825 --> 00:20:16.200
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.800
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's a really
good point though.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.870
You need to have a feature
graphic in order for us to

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:21.880
feature you.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:25.120
Because that's the graphic that
actually gets put on the

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:29.200
market, or on the Google Play
store, or in the collection.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.590
And we can't automatically use
any of these other graphics.

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:34.040
That graphic has to be there.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.620
RETO MEIER: And also take note
of things like, you'll note

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:40.430
that all of the apps that we
featured today all had both

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:43.060
phone screenshots and
tablet screenshots.

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:44.800
And another thing that you
should also consider is

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.050
including a promotional video.

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:48.840
And you can see that there is
a link for one here online.

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.200
Basically you want to do
everything you can to help the

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.880
Google Play team merchandise
your app.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:53.690
IAN NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:55.740
The promo video a lot of people
forget, but it's an

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:56.940
absolute no-brainer.

00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:00.970
It's absolutely the most
effective way that we've found

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:03.242
to sell people on your app.

00:21:03.242 --> 00:21:05.530
RETO MEIER: Once you've moved
beyond that, what we really

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:08.230
want you to look at is the
app quality guidelines.

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:09.985
Now this is something that you
can find on developer.android.

00:21:09.985 --> 00:21:13.610
com on the Distribute
tab under Google

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:15.220
Play Quality Core.

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:17.380
And these are really sort of
the fundamental things.

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.350
So again, when we have people
internally looking at what

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:22.640
apps can we feature, what things
can we put into pure

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.480
Android, this is basically a
checklist of things which

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.710
we're going to look at as sort
of your bare minimum entry

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:30.350
requirements for what
we consider that to

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:31.640
be a quality app.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:33.220
IAN NI-LEWIS: Now a lot of
people don't know the story

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:36.920
behind these, but Reto and I
actually spent months working

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:43.820
on these pages on convincing
the team to post those

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:44.610
guidelines.

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:48.400
Because originally, we just
had a set of internal QA

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.670
guidelines that we would run
any candidate for featuring

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:54.460
past, and if they failed those
guidelines they'd have to

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:56.130
either fix it or not
get featured.

00:21:56.130 --> 00:22:00.590
And it took a long time to get
everyone involved to agree to

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:02.600
post these guidelines online,
but they finally

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:03.450
are there for you.

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:07.380
They really are the guidelines
that our QA team uses to

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.740
figure out whether an app
is featureable or not.

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:12.450
So if you're not meeting these
guidelines, you are not

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:13.940
meeting the lowest bar.

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:14.400
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:15.970
So this is something you should
spend a lot of time

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:17.630
looking over and basically
as part of

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:19.920
own release QA checklist.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.390
This is what we recommend you
do, is go through this, make

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:23.950
sure that you're meeting all
of these requirements.

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:26.990
And then you'll know that you
have an app that is quality,

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:29.140
it meets those quality
guidelines.

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:30.530
IAN NI-LEWIS: Of course,
just having an

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:31.780
app isn't good enough.

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:34.910
We also want that app to look
great on different devices.

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:37.260
And this year, we are
all about tablets.

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:39.050
So it's got to look
great on tablets.

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:39.500
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:43.480
And you can find the tablet app
quality checklist also on

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.730
Google Play.

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:46.420
It's quality/tablet.

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:49.450
And so you'll find here a bunch
of best practices which

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:52.320
we look at to say, well, is this
a tablet app, is this not

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.200
a tablet app.

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.190
This is basically what we're
going to look at and what we

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:58.220
recommend you look at to say,
well, this meets that bar.

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:00.440
This is something which we think
tablet users are going

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:04.350
to be able to use and enjoy
on their devices.

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:06.840
IAN NI-LEWIS: And finally, we've
got the Android design

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:07.115
guidelines.

00:23:07.115 --> 00:23:08.340
RETO MEIER: Ah, an
oldy but a goody.

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:10.410
So this is something which we
also launched last year.

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:13.670
Really exciting at
developer.android.com/design.

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:16.900
This tells you how to make an
app which looks like an

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:17.470
Android app.

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:20.150
Now there is a huge amount
of variation.

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:22.960
We don't want every app to look
the same, some sort of

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.070
cookie-cutter mold.

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:25.290
That's kind of boring.

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:27.620
But there are certain principles
which you can

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:30.330
conform to which are going to
make sure that every Android

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:32.680
user feels comfortable once
they get into the app.

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:34.970
And this is something which the
Android Design in Action

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:36.900
guys spend a lot of time
talking about on

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:38.246
their Tuesday show.

00:23:38.246 --> 00:23:38.860
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:42.810
This is when the way we got
these is by hiring an

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:46.360
excellent design team and
letting them run loose for a

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:49.340
while until they figured out
exactly what the design

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:51.600
language of Ice Cream Sandwich
was going to be.

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:55.020
And even though we expect that
to evolve, we don't expect

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:58.730
that to ever completely change
the way it did in Ice Cream

00:23:58.730 --> 00:23:59.510
Sandwich again.

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:03.240
This is, for the foreseeable
future, what Android apps

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:06.760
should look like unless you have
a really good reason to

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:08.130
not make them look that way.

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:10.300
RETO MEIER: So once you've
sort of gone through and

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:14.480
created all of these basic
requirements for building an

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.430
app, which we're going to be
really excited about and are

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:18.740
going to be willing to feature
on our own collection--

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:21.450
in a collection we're going
to put our names against.

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:22.445
There's a few--

00:24:22.445 --> 00:24:23.810
IAN NI-LEWIS: Actually, I think
just your name's on it.

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:25.000
RETO MEIER: Right now
it's just my name.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.010
I don't think you're quite
that comfortable yet.

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:28.250
But nonetheless.

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:31.460
The next thing we're looking for
is something which makes

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:35.600
an even Pure-r-er Android than
just those basic criteria.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.730
And these are things which
are kind of ephemeral.

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:40.860
This isn't stuff that you can
easily define in a checklist.

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:43.330
We want something that's really
efficient, that's

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:45.850
buttery smooth, it gives you
this sort of magical

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:47.870
experience when you're
using the app.

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:50.210
You kind of launch and you're
like, oh this is kind of cool.

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:51.450
IAN NI-LEWIS: It just
totally works.

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:52.860
Yeah, it feels right.

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:53.360
Exactly.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.830
And efficient, I think we're
talking about, how easy is it

00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:59.480
to get tasks done in the app?

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:02.160
Buttery, on the other hand, I
think we're really referring

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.940
to the efficiency
of your code.

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:08.340
And that one actually,
personally, I can measure.

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:12.120
If your code is running
consistently at 30 to 60 FPS

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.750
on a newer device, then
it's not buttery.

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:15.590
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:17.560
And we're also looking at
efficiency and butteriness in

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.910
terms of things like
your battery life.

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:22.070
You don't want to have the user
being conscious of the

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:24.480
fact that your app is doing
anything other than running

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:26.770
without draining your
battery at all.

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:30.720
I think a good example of that
delightful aspect is something

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:34.150
like Pattrn, which creates
attractive wallpapers or

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:35.790
allows you to browse attractive
wallpapers.

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:39.330
Now, I don't really change the
wallpapers on my app, but I

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:41.330
found myself when looking at
this app, just sort of

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:44.310
flicking through and just having
fun with something

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:47.100
which isn't necessarily
something I normally would.

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:49.790
IAN NI-LEWIS: Whereas Tasks
delighted me, even though it

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:53.880
is the simplest app possible,
they just didn't

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.490
get anything wrong.

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:57.280
All I wanted was a task list.

00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:00.130
I didn't need a skeuomorphic
design, I didn't need bells

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:02.950
and whistles, I just needed
the task list that worked

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:05.360
exactly the way I expected
it to work.

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.810
And everything that they added,
whether it's the list

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:11.480
drag and drop or whatever, was
something that added to my

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:14.660
sense of the app responding
the way I expected it to.

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:16.290
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:19.770
So I think that pretty much
wraps it up for us today.

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:22.380
So tune in to Roman, Nick, and
Adam for Android Design in

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:23.470
Action on Tuesday.

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:24.840
They're going to be
doing a design

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.800
exploration on a soccer--

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.530
or football, depending on what
country you're in-- app.

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:31.420
And they're going to be
doing a deep dive on

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:32.690
launcher icons as well.

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:34.330
IAN NI-LEWIS: And we're going
to follow their lead.

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:36.120
So next Friday we'll
be looking at

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.730
sport stream tracking.

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:41.420
And if you've got a device
profile app you'd like to take

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:44.600
a look at be sure
to let us know.

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.210
RETO MEIER: Put everything
you want them

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:46.950
into the Trello page.

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:49.300
This is where we're going to be
collecting nominations for

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:51.770
the apps that we're going to
look at and sort of listing

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:54.340
the categories which are
under consideration.

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:57.650
So this is where you self
nominate to possibly be part

00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:00.330
of the Pure Android
collection.

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:02.280
So we're going to start digging
through the archives

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:05.000
of the App Clinic app reviews
over the last year or so to

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.990
try and find more Pure
Android candidates.

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:09.270
We already have a short list
of apps which we're pretty

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:11.580
excited about, which we're going
to start rolling out.

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:13.580
But if you've made some changes
to your app recently

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:15.650
or since we reviewed it, and
you'd like us to take another

00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:18.455
look and put it into
consideration, do let us know

00:27:18.455 --> 00:27:21.320
on Google+ and we will
add it to our queue.

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:24.300
And hopefully it'll
make the cut.

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:26.190
So until then, I'm Reto Meier.

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:27.380
IAN NI-LEWIS: And I'm
Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:28.630
RETO MEIER: And this has
been the App Clinic.
