00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.968
Well, here's how I did it. This is the condition for y's in the top fifth. This

00:00:04.968 --> 00:00:09.768
is the condition for y's in the bottom fifth. If it's in the top or the bottom,

00:00:09.768 --> 00:00:15.135
that's where the or comes in, then the pixel is blue. If it's in the middle

00:00:15.135 --> 00:00:19.230
here, well, that's the case if it's at least at this point, and at most at this

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.515
point. Notice the and, then it's red, and otherwise it's just white. So now

00:00:25.515 --> 00:00:32.580
you've gotten good practice with using ands and ors to form complex conditions.
