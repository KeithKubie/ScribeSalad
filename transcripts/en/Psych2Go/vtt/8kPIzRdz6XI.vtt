4 Types of Narcissism

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.720
Narcissism and vanity are often considered mirror images of each other.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:13.100
We think of both as being enamored with our own beauty image and self-centered attitudes. This, however, is a shallow

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.680
representation of what Narcissism really is.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:22.020
Narcissism is a spectrum. On one side, you have self assurance and confidence, which make for a happy and healthy

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.930
Personality. On the other side, you have Narcissistic

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.539
Personality Disorder which is self-centered, non empathetic, and emotionally draining to be around.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.930
Narcissism and vanity are somewhere in the middle.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:34.770
They're not healthy

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.579
But they're not as damaging as NPD. NPD can only be diagnosed by a professional, and isn't something you can develop or catch.

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.479
The seed of Narcissism is usually planted in childhood.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.239
Differences in upbringing make for differences in Narcissism, and change which narcissistic traits people develop.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.939
What types of Narcissism are there? How does narcissism present itself? We're so glad you asked!

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.969
Narcissistic people can be either body oriented-- called the somatic narcissist-- or

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.839
Personality oriented --called the cerebral narcissist. Somatic narcissists focus on looking better than everyone else.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.439
They're the ones with the fancy clothes, perfect hair, and gym bodies.

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.719
Cerebral narcissists focus on things like being smarter or funnier than everyone else.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.400
They'll start debates in order to win them, and live off the praise fed to them from other people.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.000
On top of this body/mind division,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.909
There are also four main ways narcissism can present itself. 1: Overt Narcissism.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:40.589
Loud, outspoken, and always right. These narcissists tend to be bullies, and use their words to tear down the people around them.

00:01:40.589 --> 00:01:43.720
This is the most common presentation of narcissism.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.220
2: Covert Narcissism.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.629
Sneaky, like snakes in the grass. You might not even recognize this person as a narcissist.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:58.110
They pretend to be kind and gentle when in reality, they're manipulative and cold, feeding off the people closest to them

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.479
They use people as a means to an end: to gain money, power, fame, whatever they want.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.380
3: Seductive Narcissism

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:13.640
We don't mean seductive like high heels and fishnets. These narcissists tend to praise and idolize people close

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.140
To them in order to get the same response back. They suck people in with admiration and compliments

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.779
Then drop you with no warning. By playing hot and cold, they keep you on the hook and get their ego constantly fed.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.400
4: Vindictive Narcissism.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.620
These people aim, shoot and destroy.

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:38.249
They're the most dangerous of all the narcissists, and might be confused with the overt narcissists because of how outspoken they are.

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.959
Be warned. These people will do and say anything to destroy their victims and

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.150
Often will trash talk and incite anger and other third parties to turn more people against their victim.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.640
Worrying you might be a narcissist? Don't. While you might present traits of narcissism,

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.059
You're likely somewhere in the middle, non-dangerous portion of the spectrum.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.739
And if you're really worried, talk to your mental health professional about a possible diagnosis.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.859
