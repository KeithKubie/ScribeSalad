Hey it's me Destin. This week I've been in the lab or, my garage working on my

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.010
thesis. So I'm trying to finish it so I can't give you an awesome video this week. To hold you over

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.020
I'll give you some video of when me and my daughter went to the fair and we checked out

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.030
some pretty cool things about animals. Anyway, check it out. I've gotta get back to my thesis.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.550
[gunshot]

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.070
[fairground sounds]

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.110
This duck has three feet. The weird thing is the extra foot is

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.130
growing out of it's head. This is a condition known as polymelia

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.150
where you have extra appendages.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:58.240
   

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.250
(son) Look at that bunny rabbit.
(Destin) What's he doing?

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.270
Oh, he's a tricky one. He snuck through.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.320
One of my favourite animals growing up was a quagga, even though it was extinct.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.370
And so we've found something pretty similar, here. What is this called?

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.400
A zedonk. Father is

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.420
a zebra, and the mother is a donkey.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.440
(Destin) So the father's a zebra and the mother's a donkey. Heeere zedonk zedonk.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.490
If you put your hand flat like this he won't bite your fingers.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:40.050
 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.570
Zorse.
(Destin) Zorse, now what's a zorse?

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.600
Daddy is a zebra,

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.610
mother is a horse.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.230
oohoo! [laugh]

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.650
(son) Daddy are you OK?
(Destin) I'm OK.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.660
Next week we're gonna learn what it's like when a bullet hits an eyeball.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.680
For real, we're gonna do it. A zorse and a zedonk?

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.700
I hope you learned something. Alright, let's be honest. This week's video wasn't that awesome

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.720
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and put a video right.. right there.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.740
You can go ahead and click on that. Joe and Buzz, they're my friends

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.760
