Hey,

I don't know what's going on,
dude.
There's something going.
Wow.

5
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.160
I heard about a dude.

6
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.210
You'd hear that about that guy in swamp Scott already fucking dude.

7
00:00:26.211 --> 00:00:30.990
The fucking guy died.
He had two fucking sniffles.
You went up to duty,

8
00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:35.160
went upstairs to bed and it came up in the fucking guy was dead.

9
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.790
There's always those stories around Europe.
Uh,
Ron Europe,

10
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.470
about a brown winter this time of year,

11
00:00:43.471 --> 00:00:46.070
right?
Europe.
I'm thinking about my euro dates.
I might as well tell you,

12
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.891
listen to this shit.

13
00:00:46.891 --> 00:00:50.820
The following cities in Europe from my European tour and have sold out Munich

14
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.500
often buck ragga,
Arica,
Vienna,
Liverpool,
London,

15
00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:57.090
Copenhagen in Helsinki,

16
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.190
a second show will be added at the Royal Albert Hall in London.
More shows in,

17
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.660
um,
other cities of second shows.
If we feel that we can sell them a,
they will be,

18
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.250
um,
they will be added.
All right.
There you go.
Okay.

19
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.750
And the Patrice O'neil comedy benefit.
February 19th,

20
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.140
2019 Jim Gaffigan,
uh,
fucking rich Vos,

21
00:01:20.141 --> 00:01:22.630
myself and a bunch of other people.
I don't have the shit in front of me.

22
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.350
A big Jay Oakerson and little bill burn.
We're all going to be down there.

23
00:01:28.351 --> 00:01:32.020
It's gonna be tremendous.
Um,
alright.
Plowing ahead here.

24
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:34.630
Um,
yeah,
I dunno everybody,

25
00:01:34.631 --> 00:01:39.250
my fucking house is sick right now and I got to go to New York because I'm doing

26
00:01:39.251 --> 00:01:42.190
a benefit on December 1st in the city.

27
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.660
I tweeted about it and I forget what the fuck is going to be at,
but um,

28
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.511
she'll be a good time,

29
00:01:46.511 --> 00:01:51.511
music and comedy extravaganza to help people with,

30
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.660
I don't know what I have.
I never fucking know.
They just ask and I say,
all right,

31
00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.910
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
Then you make the bad mistake as a comedian,

32
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.510
as you don't find out what the benefits for before you go on stage,

33
00:02:01.511 --> 00:02:05.420
and then you end up doing a fucking joke about it.
What does it say?

34
00:02:05.421 --> 00:02:09.990
Is this a benefit but cancer?
Yes,
it is.
Oh,
sorry.
Sorry.

35
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.760
I should have looked in.
I should have looked in before I fucking,
you know,

36
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.250
before I started doing my shit.
I apologize.
I apologize.
Um,

37
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.700
so,
you know,
it's funny,
my,
uh,

38
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.400
one of one of my relatives ask me what's on your Christmas list.

39
00:02:27.401 --> 00:02:28.700
I should have talked to him about this speaker.

40
00:02:28.701 --> 00:02:31.480
I think I should have asked de Rosa was just here.
We were taping an uninformed,

41
00:02:31.481 --> 00:02:36.160
I should've asked him what exactly it is that I need,
like where the problem is.

42
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.570
Cause right now I just hold it,
you know,

43
00:02:37.571 --> 00:02:40.780
like a fucking suicide bomber if we've got to take your thumb off the thing and

44
00:02:40.781 --> 00:02:44.500
then you blow up.
That's the way I got ahold of to be able to hear shit.
And uh,

45
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.360
I think it's going to affect my performance.
Um,
so anyways,

46
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.280
I was sleeping
so soundly.

47
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.890
All right.
I went to bed early,
I ate,

48
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.560
I had no booze,
none of that bullshit.

49
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.590
I fucking just went to sleep and I was sleeping so soundly and I am awoken to

50
00:03:07.981 --> 00:03:12.090
this noise that sounds like literally like God's alarm clock.

51
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.870
It was just going,

52
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.870
<v 0>Eh,</v>

53
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.870
Eh,

54
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.750
<v 1>right.
So I'm like,
the fuck is that right?</v>

55
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.670
<v 0>Yay.</v>

56
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.350
<v 1>And I opened the window,
you know,
I go over and I'm going to open up the window.</v>

57
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.240
<v 0>Hm.</v>

58
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.660
<v 1>I'm like,
it's fucking outside.</v>

59
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.280
So I go outside.

60
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.570
<v 0>Yay.</v>

61
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.720
<v 1>Fucking,
I don't know what the power box,</v>

62
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.710
the power box,
whatever the side of my house where it says,
you know,

63
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.380
high voltage and all of that shit.
I just walk up to it and it's just like,
man,

64
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.980
I don't know what the fuck happened.
And then right as I walked up to it,

65
00:04:10.981 --> 00:04:12.090
it just stopped,

66
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:14.463
<v 0>eh.</v>

67
00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.340
<v 1>And I went inside and you know,
nothing has happened since.</v>

68
00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.490
So I'm going to go out on a limb and I'm going to say that somebody should take

69
00:04:25.491 --> 00:04:28.250
a look at that thing.
It was raining on.
I don't know what happened.

70
00:04:28.251 --> 00:04:32.480
I heard sirens down the street.
Somebody probably slammed into a fucking pole

71
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.490
or something.
I don't,
I don't know.
I don't know.

72
00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.380
Because last night we know before I went to bed,
you know,

73
00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.080
I was driving home from the comedy store and a,

74
00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:46.730
I sound like fucking three fire trucks down the street.
And,
uh,

75
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.570
I made a left before I got to him and shit.
And I dunno,
you know,

76
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.670
it rains a little bit out here and people just fucking slamming the trees

77
00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.040
because it never rains out here.

78
00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.320
So all the oil and antifreeze and fucking just shit is just on the road and all

79
00:05:00.321 --> 00:05:04.830
it takes is a little bit of water and it gets slick as hell.
And um,

80
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.740
plus people aren't used to driving in it,
I guess.

81
00:05:06.741 --> 00:05:09.710
And they just fucking crash their cars.
So anyways,

82
00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:11.210
<v 0>yeah,</v>

83
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.460
<v 1>evidently I stared down this electricity and it got self conscious and it</v>

84
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.160
stopped making the fucking noise and then I get in my house and then,
you know,

85
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:21.810
it's the first rain of the year,

86
00:05:21.811 --> 00:05:24.870
so I got to go up on my roof and make sure there's no fucking problems.

87
00:05:24.871 --> 00:05:28.770
And you know,
and one of the gutters was clogged up just because,
you know,

88
00:05:28.771 --> 00:05:32.010
we've got trees out here and shit falls in there and when it rains it pours out

89
00:05:32.011 --> 00:05:36.840
here just like the song.
So I'm fucking cleaning out the Goddamn gutters and uh,

90
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.080
I almost fucking fell off the roof.

91
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.250
Is it in that split second?
You know,

92
00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.910
cause I didn't want to get wet so I was crouched down.
I wasn't leaning back,

93
00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.750
I was just sort of crouch down and I was reaching forward.
It was just like,

94
00:05:50.751 --> 00:05:54.620
what the fuck am I doing?
And I had to do that quick math like bill,

95
00:05:54.621 --> 00:05:55.610
what would you rather do?

96
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.680
Would you rather get your wet and have to throw them in the hamper or would you

97
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:05.660
like to die or be paralyzed?
So I laid down on the roof,
you know,

98
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.990
and I fucking cleaned all this shit out.
Cause that's what I do.

99
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.750
That's the thankless fucking work you do as a dad and nobody appreciates it.

100
00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:17.660
You know,
you make sure the water gets away from the foundation,
you know,

101
00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.900
you do those types of things for,
you know,

102
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.280
I don't know the roof over the your fucking head.
No,

103
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.070
maybe I'm just spoiled.
You know,
cause I tell a joke and everybody laughs,

104
00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:32.300
you know,
you guys give me an attaboy every fucking 10 to 12 seconds or whatever,

105
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.780
eight to 10 and from killing.
Um,

106
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.750
maybe that's what the fuck it is.
But now,

107
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.660
now I have to get some goddamn electrician come over and figuring out what the

108
00:06:41.661 --> 00:06:45.290
fuck that thing is about.
My front door lock is fucked up.
It's just like,

109
00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:48.720
it's just never ending.
You know?

110
00:06:48.721 --> 00:06:51.450
I don't know who the fuck the American dream was.
You wanted to own a house,

111
00:06:51.451 --> 00:06:55.620
but I swear to God,
it's just,
it's never fucking ending plus,

112
00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.900
but there's another way to do it.
There's other people,

113
00:06:57.901 --> 00:07:01.200
they just live in a house and when something breaks,
they just deal with it.

114
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.400
You know,
those kinds of people,
they buy a car and they don't get it fixed ever.

115
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.470
They don't get the fucking,
you know,

116
00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.750
remember back in the day they'd have those sports cars with the lights flipped

117
00:07:11.751 --> 00:07:14.640
down and flipped up and one would just be up and they would just drive around

118
00:07:14.641 --> 00:07:19.500
and be okay with it.
You know?
I always thought that that was like a,
like a,

119
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:24.150
a ridiculous like sign of a loser.

120
00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:30.240
Like this guy's a fucking loser.
I know he's got a corvette,
but like he's,
he's,

121
00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.990
he's living beyond his fucking means.
You know,
how,
how,

122
00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.210
unless it just happened.

123
00:07:36.211 --> 00:07:38.150
How long are you going to ride around with that fucking thing?

124
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.270
Looking up like that,

125
00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:42.510
the beautiful lines of that car and you're fucking it up with that.
And just,

126
00:07:42.511 --> 00:07:44.340
I would watch people drive me nuts.

127
00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.610
Your parents were always like that.
If something broke in the car,

128
00:07:48.611 --> 00:07:53.120
they just fucking,
they never got it fixed.
I don't get that bill.

129
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.950
You really mad about this?
I don't think so.
I don't think so.

130
00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.720
It's just I was sleeping soundly and then,
yeah,

131
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.570
my daughter was still asleep at fucking woke her up and it's just like,

132
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:13.080
you know,
I don't know.
Can it,
can I just have one fucking day where I get,
I mean,

133
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:16.260
I feel like I get eight hours though.
Always.
I sleeping well.

134
00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:22.230
I was sleeping so good.
Oh God.
It was so fucking great.
And then I just woke up.

135
00:08:22.231 --> 00:08:25.620
I was like,
what the fuck is said?
What the fuck is why?

136
00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.510
What is that?
Is that what the alarm in the house sounds like?

137
00:08:30.511 --> 00:08:32.130
Is there a serial killer in the house?

138
00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.550
Can you give me another five minutes to sleep and all that shit and we just

139
00:08:35.551 --> 00:08:39.000
fucking laying there in bed.
You just don't give a shit.

140
00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:43.283
Um,

141
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:49.240
I vaguely remember my Nia coming into waking me up last night as your wife does.

142
00:08:50.001 --> 00:08:53.120
You know he's sleeping soundly.
Why when they wake up,
she goes,
was that the car?

143
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:57.500
Was that the house alarm?
Did you hear that?
And I went,
no.

144
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.390
And I did hear it.
It's just like,

145
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:05.160
I'm not fucking going downstairs for the 9000000th time with that softball bat

146
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.190
going down the fucking stairs just to find out that the,

147
00:09:08.191 --> 00:09:11.620
that a fucking window in our old ass house,
you know,

148
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.020
blew open a little bit.
Um,

149
00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.350
then I woke up feeling guilty like I should have done,
but I was just sleep.

150
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:23.220
I was sleeping so fucking,
well.
Anyways,

151
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:28.430
let's plow ahead here.
So freckles,
um,
I mentioned
I my,

152
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.490
uh,
on the Monday morning podcast I was going to be on the Joe Rogan experience.

153
00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.020
Uh,
they ended up being a little confusion on the booking.

154
00:09:34.021 --> 00:09:38.540
So instead it's going to be December 20th.
And,
uh,

155
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:42.510
which will be cool because I'm going to hang with Joe a couple times before that

156
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:44.320
and give us some time,
some shit to talk about.

157
00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.610
Cause I hadn't seen him in a while just cause I've been doing the road and he's

158
00:09:46.611 --> 00:09:48.830
been doing his stuff.
So,
uh,

159
00:09:48.831 --> 00:09:52.780
that got rescheduled and uh,
um,

160
00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.030
I also said I was doing dice Clay's podcast.
I wasn't,

161
00:09:56.031 --> 00:09:58.340
it was somebody else's pocket.
I fucked the whole thing up.

162
00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:03.500
But I did call in spit and chiclets on Barstool so I did,
I did do that.
Right.

163
00:10:03.501 --> 00:10:06.980
And I also said thatF is for family was coming out today and it is,

164
00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:11.720
and it's coming out tomorrow,
the 30th.
So I basically,
I fucked everything up.

165
00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:16.040
Um,
I apologize.
So,
um,
anyways,

166
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:22.660
hang on a second.
What the fuck is that now?
Anyways,

167
00:10:22.661 --> 00:10:25.310
next week I am going to be on a,

168
00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:30.940
I'm going to be on Seth Meyers show on Tuesday of next week promotingF is for

169
00:10:30.941 --> 00:10:33.670
family.
And then I will also be,
uh,

170
00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:39.330
at the Gotham comedy club doing a show with Paul Versey and Sam j.

171
00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:41.770
It's going to be awesome.
Christmas in New York would be Suc Elsa,

172
00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:46.210
cause I'm with my family and shit,
but a bing bang,

173
00:10:46.211 --> 00:10:49.800
boom real quick out and then right back and uh,

174
00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.590
I'm back on the Diet.
I'm not boozing,
they've been dry for five days,

175
00:10:53.591 --> 00:10:54.640
bored out of my mind,

176
00:10:54.641 --> 00:10:58.750
but obviously sleeping well until my fucking side of my house starts buzzing.

177
00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:03.280
But I've decided that I'm going to get in great shape again.

178
00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:07.240
Like I did the end of August and then Labor Day came and I made a couple of

179
00:11:07.241 --> 00:11:09.310
Burgers,
had a couple of beers and I just,

180
00:11:09.311 --> 00:11:11.740
then I had six weeks on the road and I just,
I fucking put it,

181
00:11:11.741 --> 00:11:16.090
almost all of it back on.
But now I've turned the ship around and all fractals,

182
00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:21.160
his head back,
last time I was able to get for abs,
four out of Eight,

183
00:11:21.161 --> 00:11:25.480
I got halfway there.
You know,
you don't really feel like you ever watched the,
uh,

184
00:11:25.481 --> 00:11:29.520
American Ninja Warrior and is that fucking guy every year they,

185
00:11:29.521 --> 00:11:33.980
last year he couldn't get past the fucking trap piece and then he gets past the

186
00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.340
trap.
He's,
he's all excited.

187
00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:37.300
And then he does a face plant on the next [inaudible].
It's fucking,

188
00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:42.140
whatever you call it,
object,
obstacle,
whatever the fuck you call it.
That.

189
00:11:42.141 --> 00:11:45.520
That's basically what I'm doing is far as trying to get in shape.

190
00:11:45.521 --> 00:11:48.910
But at least this time,
cause I went to a nutritionist,
a nutritionist,

191
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:50.830
I know how to a,
I know how to eat.

192
00:11:50.831 --> 00:11:53.980
So I just been doing that and it got to at once you lay off the booze,

193
00:11:53.981 --> 00:11:57.520
it's fucking,
it's all good.
It's all good.

194
00:11:57.521 --> 00:11:59.710
So I go home and my new show on me TV,

195
00:11:59.711 --> 00:12:03.990
I watched the untouchables and was an episode of a,

196
00:12:03.991 --> 00:12:05.510
I watched the other day,

197
00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:10.130
had a young Carroll O'connor who played Archie bunker on it.
It's just the,

198
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:14.590
uh,
it really is the shit.
And um,
you know,

199
00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.980
I got my Christmas tree.
I already fucking amazing already got my Christmas tree.

200
00:12:18.981 --> 00:12:22.130
I was sitting there going,
you know what,
I want to get a good one this year.

201
00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.460
I'm going to knock that out before I go to New York.
I'll just make sure,

202
00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:29.780
you know,
my wife waters the fucking thing.
And,
uh,

203
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.190
so I go down there and it's just classic La.

204
00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.140
Why I love La and why it can be annoying.

205
00:12:35.141 --> 00:12:39.410
Sometimes I show up to buy a Christmas tree and this sunlight,

206
00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:42.600
you know,
fucking hot chick,
right?

207
00:12:42.601 --> 00:12:46.290
This Asian chick just dress ridiculously nice.

208
00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:51.560
Like she was going to go walk a red carpet,
you know,

209
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:54.410
high heels make up the whole fucking thing.

210
00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.960
Getting out of this shiny SUV.
I'm like,

211
00:12:56.961 --> 00:12:58.730
what the F are you buying a Christmas tree like that?

212
00:12:58.731 --> 00:13:02.150
Then of course I look over the left and there's a guy with the fucking camera

213
00:13:02.151 --> 00:13:06.980
filming or there's some fucking reality show.
I mean like full makeup,

214
00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:07.641
the whole,

215
00:13:07.641 --> 00:13:10.850
you think reality shows look fucking stupid when you watch them at home.

216
00:13:10.851 --> 00:13:14.360
If you see one that's really being shot,
it's just like,
what the fuck?

217
00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:18.290
Who the fuck looks like that going to get a God damn Christmas tree?

218
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:20.623
<v 3>MMM.</v>

219
00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:25.300
<v 1>Yeah.
I'm standing there and I'm trying to find what I'm facetiming with my wife.</v>

220
00:13:25.301 --> 00:13:28.570
What about this?
Why Layla?
You have full enough,
you know,

221
00:13:28.571 --> 00:13:32.020
go through all that bullshit.
Then all of a sudden this other guy shows up.

222
00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.200
He's dressed like little Bo peep,
swear to God,

223
00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:39.010
but with like a beard and everything that's got miniskirt tattoos on his legs

224
00:13:39.011 --> 00:13:42.700
and holding a selfie stick,
filming himself with full fucking makeup on.

225
00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:45.500
And I was just like,
all right,
you know this

226
00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:46.770
<v 3>a,</v>

227
00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.270
<v 1>this is fucking la man.</v>

228
00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:58.630
Will this cough ever go away?
I think I might take some medicine.

229
00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:03.070
My wife had me go out and get some Robitussin.
I've always been a Nyquil guy,

230
00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:04.633
<v 3>you know?</v>

231
00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:05.790
<v 1>Well,</v>

232
00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:08.860
I gotta tell you I cannot taste the fucking difference between the two of them.

233
00:14:08.861 --> 00:14:10.090
They get that read shit.

234
00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.870
It's almost like you'd rather die in pneumonia than fucking drink that stuff.

235
00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:17.730
And now when you go there to buy it,
they actually asked for your fucking idea d,

236
00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:23.040
which is really annoying.
It's like,
look at me lady.
Do you think I'm fucking,

237
00:14:23.041 --> 00:14:28.041
do you really think I'm 20 look at me hand the gang and thick Dag Dag again.

238
00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:29.913
You know?

239
00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:31.760
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

240
00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.510
<v 1>He imagined like that's like a how rock bottom you.</v>

241
00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:38.680
How much fucking we'll look that up.
I don't know how to spell Robitussin,
but I,

242
00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:40.100
I'm a drink.
Look up Nyquil.

243
00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:43.610
This shit that I ended up looking up on my fucking laptop because of this God

244
00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:47.000
damn podcast.
I can't imagine what's watch ledge list.
I'm on here.

245
00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:52.700
How much is that Nyquil?
The window?

246
00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:54.620
Nyquil?

247
00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:56.080
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

248
00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.990
<v 1>to get drunk.</v>

249
00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:01.403
<v 2>Okay.</v>

250
00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:05.490
<v 1>Right now they're all thinking this is a functioning alcoholic cause he's</v>

251
00:15:05.491 --> 00:15:07.020
drinking Nyquil to get shit faced.

252
00:15:07.021 --> 00:15:11.190
Yet he's still somehow has access to a laptop and the Internet.
All right.

253
00:15:11.191 --> 00:15:13.620
Drinking copious amounts of Nyquil pros,

254
00:15:13.621 --> 00:15:16.800
a bottle comes with its own personal shot glass.
All right.

255
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:21.480
I already love this right here.
I already loved this.
Sorry.
What do we got here?

256
00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:24.663
<v 2>All right.</v>

257
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:29.070
<v 1>Flat cut tampons.
What the fuck?
What part of the Internet am I on?</v>

258
00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:38.020
Vapor.
Teeny vodka.
Eyeballing and snorting.

259
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:44.330
Do these people are fucking crazy.
People don't do any of this,
but let's,

260
00:15:44.331 --> 00:15:45.770
let's listen to it for the comedy.

261
00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:50.930
Taking shots of mouthwash wine.
Ice Cream.
All right,

262
00:15:50.931 --> 00:15:55.310
I can do that.
Oh,
a copious amounts of NYQUIL.
All right,

263
00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:59.930
pro.
Okay.
Nyquil,
this nighttime sniffling,
sneezing,
coughing.

264
00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:05.000
How the fuck did I end up on the kitchen floor?
Medicine.
Okay.
This is on a spoon,

265
00:16:05.001 --> 00:16:09.170
university.com by the way,
a bottle comes with its own personal shot glass.

266
00:16:09.171 --> 00:16:12.710
This is the pros.
Take a few shots,
fight the sleepy feeling,

267
00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:16.730
and then you're in for a hazy,
loopy drunk slash high combination.

268
00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:21.280
It's kind of where that you gotta like fucking fight off,
going to sleep.

269
00:16:21.281 --> 00:16:25.910
All right.
Cons,
you have to be 18 to buy it in most drug stores,

270
00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:29.660
which is a big deterrent for the underage population of binge drinkers.

271
00:16:29.661 --> 00:16:31.400
Not a reliable way to get drunk.

272
00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.850
You might just send up passed out or worse sober.
Yeah.

273
00:16:34.851 --> 00:16:37.660
People don't do any of this,
especially if you're fucking underage,
but I,

274
00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.290
for the comedy,
I have to read this here.

275
00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:41.470
<v 2>All right.</v>

276
00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:43.570
<v 1>Tired of the wretched taste of booze.</v>

277
00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:48.190
This is the Sally set this up like no booze tastes worse.

278
00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:50.200
Busch light doesn't taste worse than Nyquil.

279
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:55.500
Simply drinking alcohol to get drunk these days is just so mainstream in the

280
00:16:55.541 --> 00:17:00.070
mood to potentially,
they're probably just making fun of
they're making,
okay,

281
00:17:00.071 --> 00:17:02.770
I get it.
They're being sarcastic here so it's not wretched.
Taste the booze.

282
00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:05.530
Then making fun of how wretched all this other shit is.
Okay?

283
00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:11.250
I'm in the mood to potentially take a trip to the er or meet hot doctors.

284
00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:16.660
Check out these alternative methods of imbuing for hardcore alcoholics only.

285
00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:20.110
Not for the faint of heart.
Disclaimer,
in case you didn't get it,

286
00:17:20.111 --> 00:17:23.530
do not try any of these messages.
Methods seriously,
don't yet don't.

287
00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.980
This is what lunatics do.
Vodka tampons.

288
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.570
All right?

289
00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:34.340
A good friend shows you how to soak your Tampon in vodka for a quicker buzz.

290
00:17:34.341 --> 00:17:37.100
These are like little advertisements like this is smart things to do,

291
00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:38.031
which it isn't.

292
00:17:38.031 --> 00:17:41.420
I have to keep putting that disclaimer out there before when you dopes does this

293
00:17:41.421 --> 00:17:42.560
do not do this pros,

294
00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:46.520
these suckers were designed for more than just that time of the month and

295
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:51.510
nosebleeds.
Soak one up with your choice.
Liquor.
Um,

296
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:53.400
who am I kidding?
If you're trying this method,

297
00:17:53.401 --> 00:17:55.650
you're most definitely a vodka gal.

298
00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.740
They supposed to hold a sh about a shot's worth.

299
00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:04.020
Shove it up there to bypass your digestive track and get drunk way faster.

300
00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:08.430
It doesn't sting.
Cons.

301
00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:14.160
A yard golf,
you only got one.
You only get one vagina.

302
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:17.590
Flooding the sensitive area with 40 proof liquor is bound to leave a wake of

303
00:18:17.591 --> 00:18:21.550
destruction.
Your baby coming out drunk would be the least of your problems.

304
00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:26.110
Ladies,
stick to fake tampon flasks.
They sell it.
I don't know what the fuck.
Okay.

305
00:18:26.111 --> 00:18:29.680
That was too many jokes here.
Or what's a vapor?
Teeny.

306
00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:33.080
No calories,
no carbs,
no hangover.

307
00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:36.530
Smooth taste and feel the effects of liquor much quicker.

308
00:18:36.531 --> 00:18:38.720
Since the alcohol bypasses your stomach,

309
00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:44.260
you could also bypass your liver so that those with liver damage from too much

310
00:18:44.361 --> 00:18:48.530
drinking can once again partake.
This doesn't make sense.
Also,

311
00:18:48.531 --> 00:18:53.531
you look like a boss smoking alcohol out of an orb with a metal straw.

312
00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:00.480
Oh,
that's like that chemistry shit.
Vodka.
Eyeball snorting.
Eyeballing is snorty.

313
00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:07.380
All right.
This is just dumb shit.
All right,
I'm done with it.
Okay,
I'm done.

314
00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:09.030
<v 2>Okay.</v>

315
00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:11.640
<v 1>I'm done.
I can't believe anybody would ever fucking do that</v>

316
00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.690
for alcohol into your fucking eye.
That can't be right.

317
00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.690
Can I just do the reeds here?
People just,

424
00:26:03.791 --> 00:26:06.210
I'll give a fuck what them,
the hair restoring that did it.

425
00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:11.460
Entire hair plants,
surgeries here.
Transplant surgery.

426
00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:16.080
Can a bald person receive a hair transplant?
This is Bosley,

427
00:26:16.081 --> 00:26:19.510
obviously they're going to say yes.
They want your fucking money.
Oh,

428
00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:21.900
why don't you just go to images?
Images?

429
00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:24.030
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

430
00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:25.860
<v 1>Okay.
I was not completely bald.
Okay.</v>

431
00:26:25.861 --> 00:26:30.750
This guy was really bald and now he's got the Conor Mcgregor.

432
00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:38.280
These guys,
they just always look,
ah,
that guy looks good.

433
00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.740
It always looks just a little weird.

434
00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:42.970
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

435
00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:44.000
<v 1>What do you guys have?
Good heads.</v>

436
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.290
<v 6>I don't know why he just wouldn't fucking
shave the goddamn thing.
Fuck it.</v>

437
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:51.023
Right?

438
00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.930
<v 1>Oh,
that's that tattoo that people get on the top of you head to keep your hair</v>

439
00:26:56.340 --> 00:27:00.920
buzzed down.
No,

440
00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:02.600
they still don't have it down.

441
00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:08.700
They still just don't have it.
Wow.
They a lot of famous people.
Oh my God.

442
00:27:08.701 --> 00:27:12.420
What the fuck happened?
And that guy hair transplant gone wrong.

443
00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:16.410
Jesus Christ look the same,
but two ago took a fucking hatchet to his head.
Nah,

444
00:27:16.411 --> 00:27:19.290
that's bullshit.
That can't be real.

445
00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:22.020
You know people.
Why do,

446
00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:24.640
why do people feel the need to lie so much on the Internet?

447
00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:28.900
If you ever wondered that,
that's something here.
Transplants gone wrong.

448
00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:32.820
I have discussed hair transplant.
I'm not reading
fuck year.

449
00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:35.380
Is this hair trans?

450
00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:36.620
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

451
00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:40.980
<v 1>Plant law suits.
There we go.
Boom.</v>

452
00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:45.790
Images.

453
00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:51.870
Let's see what we got here.
Hatchet head.

454
00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:55.190
Hatchet had keeps coming up.
Yeah,

455
00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:58.140
there's a lot of people let us celebrities were starting to go.

456
00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:02.180
He saw Brian Urlacher did it.
Brian,
our lack of look great bald.

457
00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:09.230
Oh Jesus.
Look at that
bad hair plugs.

458
00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:15.350
Yeah,
dude,
this is the kind of tie some,
every time I think about doing this shit,

459
00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:17.750
I look at these pictures and like I'm not fucking doing that.

460
00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:25.010
Oh my God.
Look at these fucking Jack Lalanne and looking sons of bitches.

461
00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:29.320
Well there is a good one.
That guy.
Yeah,
this guy got a good one.

462
00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:34.140
I got it though.
I guess really listening to me googling this shit.

463
00:28:34.141 --> 00:28:36.900
What the fuck am I doing?
Can we get back to the Goddamn show?
Um,

464
00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:43.530
anyways.
Um,
you don't need as people.

465
00:28:43.531 --> 00:28:47.370
I did fucking back to back episodes of uninformed with Joe to Rosa and I am

466
00:28:47.371 --> 00:28:51.810
fucking for the one of the few times in my life,
I'm a little talked out.

467
00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:55.680
I am.
I'm just a little fucking talked out and I'm fucking stab and,

468
00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:56.910
and I want to go get something to eat,

469
00:28:57.090 --> 00:29:00.990
but my wife is fucking pissed at me right now cause I flipped out about

470
00:29:00.991 --> 00:29:04.110
something really important,
you know,
like,
uh,

471
00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.790
I don't know what the fuck I fly.
I didn't know what the fuck.
I just want to see,

472
00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:08.611
this is why I was right.

473
00:29:08.611 --> 00:29:11.880
And then I flipped out and then I became wrong as always,
you know,

474
00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.690
then I tried to walk away and then she wants to fucking,

475
00:29:15.691 --> 00:29:19.650
let's just sit down and discuss it.
Like fucking a regular person.
I'm just like,

476
00:29:19.651 --> 00:29:22.750
I'm not a regular person and I'm already heated.
So you,
you,

477
00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:26.790
you gotta let me walk away.
You know,
she won't let me walk away.
You know,

478
00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:31.320
it's got to get out of work.
What highlight.

479
00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:36.230
Huh?
Tommy Lasorda,
New York Yankees.
Reggie Jackson,

480
00:29:36.231 --> 00:29:40.100
leaning into that ball accidentally according to him.
Um,

481
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:46.390
anyways,
I,
uh,
oh Jesus.
I'm always in the fucking dog house.

482
00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:49.320
Anyways,
I want to thank everybody for listening today.
Uh,

483
00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:53.020
thank you to everybody who's been buying the Patrice O'Neal tickets.
Um,

484
00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:56.920
they're going even faster than usual every year.
They go by fast for the benefit.

485
00:29:56.921 --> 00:30:01.140
Thank you for that.
And thank you to every,
that's a joining my patrion page.
Uh,

486
00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:05.170
we have all the backstage footage of,
um,

487
00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:07.820
my arena shows at the forum,
the,
uh,

488
00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:12.370
Boston Garden and Madison Square Garden w me walking off Madison Square Garden

489
00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:16.660
is,
uh,
arguably the coolest moment of my life.

490
00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:20.260
Not the most important.
I had a kid get married and shit,

491
00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:24.280
but like the coolest moment in my fucking life cause the show could not have

492
00:30:24.281 --> 00:30:27.640
gone better.
And I talked to the audio guy today and we got the audio.

493
00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.530
There's no problem.
And,
uh,

494
00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:33.040
I'm hoping to be releasing that on vinyl after my next special cause there'll be

495
00:30:33.041 --> 00:30:37.640
too much overlap in the material,
but,
um,
uh,
I'm,

496
00:30:37.641 --> 00:30:40.270
I'm very anxious to hear the audio because it's like,
dude,

497
00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:43.540
I want people when they listen to it to feel like they're at the fucking show

498
00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:48.850
and I'm not going to lie to you.
It was a good one.
So,
um,
that is it.

499
00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:52.640
<v 7>Um,
enjoy the music here and uh,</v>

500
00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:55.970
we'll have another half hour of bonus material from a Thursday afternoon just

501
00:30:55.971 --> 00:30:57.090

502
00:30:57.090 --> 00:31:01.520

503
00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:04.180
,

I don't know how it works.
All right,
I'll see ya.

504
00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:09.013
[inaudible]

505
00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:14.520
<v 6>how many guys have you come to you with?</v>

506
00:31:14.521 --> 00:31:19.190
The line wasn't true and you pay them

507
00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.600
[inaudible] their lines.

508
00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:30.890
[inaudible] let me try.

509
00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:34.813
No.

510
00:31:58.580 --> 00:31:58.670
[inaudible] [inaudible]

511
00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:00.770
<v 7>so anyways,
uh,
yeah,
we got to go again.
The</v>

512
00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:02.850
<v 8>Christmas tree.
So for the last two years,</v>

513
00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:05.550
I have to admit something to you people.
All right.

514
00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:10.260
I have been going down to get these fucking Christmas trees and I have been

515
00:32:10.261 --> 00:32:14.160
getting the traditional Christmas tree and we all know what it looks like.

516
00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:18.630
All right.
It looks like someone on the biggest loser about four weeks in.

517
00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:22.290
That's what a Christmas tree supposed to pop that full,
you know?

518
00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:29.220
But does his other Christmas trees that I noticed,
not the scrawny ones,

519
00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:35.150
but they are minimalist Christmas trees where you can see the entire trunk and

520
00:32:38.161 --> 00:32:42.440
it's like they still have the branches,

521
00:32:42.441 --> 00:32:46.400
but there it's very like symmetrical.
It looks fucking cool as hell.

522
00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:50.270
Clean look and Christmas tree,
right?

523
00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:55.010
It looks like one of those trees and like the Dr Seuss books,
you know?

524
00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:59.210
So I go,
you know what?
Fuck this.
I'm going to get something different.

525
00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:03.080
I liked this tree.
It looks fucking cool.

526
00:33:03.081 --> 00:33:06.570
I think the ornaments are going to hang off it much better as if you know,

527
00:33:06.571 --> 00:33:10.640
when you get one of those full trees,
you know this?
Yeah.
It's just,

528
00:33:10.641 --> 00:33:13.790
it's a fucking pain in the ass.
And then the end of the end of the Goddamn,

529
00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:16.250
you know,
Christmas season,

530
00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:19.640
if you're not a dick and you just don't throw it out the side of your car,

531
00:33:19.641 --> 00:33:22.310
like a fucking some,
you know,

532
00:33:22.311 --> 00:33:25.570
some piece of degenerate gambler that owed him money.
I said,

533
00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:29.540
have it by Tuesday and then you just throw it out the fucking car,
right.

534
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:32.900
If you actually do it the right way and you just saw it up,

535
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:38.060
it's a pain in the ass and makes an unbelievable mess.
This thing,
you know,

536
00:33:38.061 --> 00:33:41.570
it's like,
it's like you ever walk into like,
uh,
like when I'm out with,
with the,

537
00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:46.550
with Nia and we go out to one of her,
uh,
her clothing stores and um,

538
00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:51.830
if it's like a corporate place,
the place is just jam packed was shit.

539
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:54.740
But if it's like a privately owned,

540
00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:59.030
they go out and they buy these individual pieces still by a couple of sizes of

541
00:33:59.031 --> 00:34:00.680
each things that they like.
And you go in there,

542
00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:02.870
he pray to God that they have your size and it's,

543
00:34:02.871 --> 00:34:05.180
and you go in and it's very minimalist.

544
00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:08.780
That's the sort of Christmas tree that I bought and uh,
you know,

545
00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:11.150
knee as a fashion Easter.
So I thought she would like it.

546
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:15.680
So I bring this Christmas tree in and the second she looks at it,

547
00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:17.990
cause I think she's going to be like,
you know,

548
00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:22.250
like I literally just have like techno music on like I'm so far into the fucking

549
00:34:22.251 --> 00:34:23.084
future here.

550
00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:28.180
The second she looks at it all my confidence just drains out the bottom of my

551
00:34:28.311 --> 00:34:33.090
shoes.
And I go,
yeah,
this is the Christmas tree.
And she goes,
oh yeah,

552
00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:37.660
because where's the rest of it?
And I'm like,
no,
no.

553
00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:41.870
That's the style.
That's the style it's supposed to look like that.
I go,

554
00:34:41.890 --> 00:34:45.980
doesn't it cool?
I mean it looks like one of those trees and Dr Seuss.
She goes,

555
00:34:45.981 --> 00:34:47.960
yeah.
She goes,
I think it looks more like that.

556
00:34:47.961 --> 00:34:50.120
That Christmas tree in that Charlie Brown cartoon

557
00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.350
[inaudible] I feel like an asshole.

558
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:59.870
So because I love the verbal abuse that you guys give me every fucking week.

559
00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:04.580
I'm actually going to be dumb enough to send a picture of my Christmas free.

560
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:09.680
Now granted it's naked.
It's not all dressed up.
It's not all dolled up.
All right.

561
00:35:09.681 --> 00:35:14.480
It's like Charlie's Theron and that stupid movie monster that rather than

562
00:35:14.481 --> 00:35:16.820
chastising her for being a murderous comment,

563
00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:20.450
they actually made a movie that said maybe guys Outta to look at themselves and

564
00:35:20.451 --> 00:35:23.840
treat bitches a little bit better before they go and start killing you after a

565
00:35:23.841 --> 00:35:24.674
blow job.

566
00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:29.120
It wasn't that the message in the move SMS a gy got so anyways,

567
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:30.530
it doesn't have any makeup on,

568
00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:34.010
which I think should automatically give it a golden globe for being that

569
00:35:34.011 --> 00:35:37.710
courageous.
It was so brave.
It was such a brave performance.

570
00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:42.690
Um,
just take a look at the Christmas tree.
Tell me what you think.

571
00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:46.500
I think it looks fucking bad ass.
I love it.

572
00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:51.120
I fucking love it.
And uh,
I stand by it.
You know,

573
00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:52.500
I'm breaking a little tradition here.

574
00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:05.830
<v 6>[inaudible] will
you my terms?</v>

575
00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:09.800
I'm sure we'll see you.

576
00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:30.900
[inaudible]

577
00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:32.850
<v 8>hello.
Hey,
what's going on?</v>

578
00:36:32.851 --> 00:36:36.540
It's bill birds to Monday morning podcast for Monday,

579
00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:40.830
November 29th,
2010.
How the hell are you?

580
00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:44.460
Did you have a nice thanksgiving?
Did you,

581
00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:49.290
did you hang out with all your family and all your friends?

582
00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:52.620
Will you sitting at the table with someone that you know,

583
00:36:52.621 --> 00:36:56.370
this time next year you're not going to be together,
you know,

584
00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:59.730
and you're just trying to just sit there and plow through the fucking meal.

585
00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:05.230
Go ahead.
God dammit.
Why didn't I break up with this bitch before I came home?

586
00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:07.950
My fucking parents.
Why are you asking her questions?

587
00:37:07.951 --> 00:37:12.210
She's not going to be here next year.
People,
this is all a rose.
Okay?

588
00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:17.370
She was fond of bag.
We were having a good time and a,
I don't know what happened.

589
00:37:17.371 --> 00:37:19.830
It got out of control and next thing you know,

590
00:37:19.831 --> 00:37:23.940
she wanted to come to this thing and I didn't have the balls to say no.

591
00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:29.060
Alright,
I fucked up.
Well,
I can tell you what,

592
00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:33.010
I'm not going to get sucked into buying her a fucking Christmas gift.
Okay,

593
00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:38.040
so you do the math.
You know when the fuck Christmas is.

594
00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:42.030
We all know when it is.
It's on the fucking 25th.

595
00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:48.060
It's the 29th or November and she's out this bitches out before Christmas cause

596
00:37:50.421 --> 00:37:54.340
I'm not feeling it past the fucking porch.
Thank you.
Um,

597
00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:59.370
Jesus Christ.
Nia,
I'm trying to do the podcast.
Can you not distract me?

598
00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:01.280
Good Lord.
You know,

599
00:38:01.281 --> 00:38:04.520
something you ever have a girlfriend or just does not appreciate your creative

600
00:38:04.521 --> 00:38:07.250
space.
It's like you're sitting in here,

601
00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:11.870
you're trying to give people something that they can enjoy for the week.

602
00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:16.160
And what do you do?
Nia?
You just come walking in here like this,

603
00:38:16.161 --> 00:38:21.080
this amazing thing that's happening isn't happening.
Okay?
Nothing.

604
00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:23.900
I don't get anything from you.
You're just gonna.

605
00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:27.000
You're just gonna collect your little belongings.
Okay?

606
00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:30.450
And then walk out of my life for a couple hours.
Where are you going?
In and out.

607
00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:37.120
Burger Nino.
All right.
She's gone.
No words of wisdom from her this week.
She's,

608
00:38:37.121 --> 00:38:41.560
she's annoyed.
She's annoyed with me.
I've been traveling a lot lately.
Everybody,

609
00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:46.570
it's because,
uh,
the tax man woe,
the tax bay,

610
00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:50.140
the tax man's coming my way.
All right.
And as usual,

611
00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:53.470
he's got his fucking handout with a scowl on his face.
So,
uh,

612
00:38:53.471 --> 00:38:55.330
this is what always happens to me at the end of the year,

613
00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:57.370
right before I take my month off.

614
00:38:58.310 --> 00:39:00.730
You know the stare at my balls.

615
00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:06.363
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

616
00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:08.840
<v 8>Ah,
that's what I do know.
My Christmas break could take a month off.</v>

617
00:39:08.841 --> 00:39:12.420
I just stare at my balls,
you know,
find my censure.

618
00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:16.940
Um,
Jesus,
I'm gonna fucking Goofy,
Goddamn move.
You know,

619
00:39:16.941 --> 00:39:21.320
somebody hit my fucking car.
Can you believe that shit?

620
00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:26.060
Why?
Yes,
Bill.
We can believe it.
Thousands of accidents happen every day.

621
00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:30.980
All right.
So basically I was sitting at a red light,
uh,
me and my,
uh,

622
00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:35.150
lovely compadre we was sitting there shooting the Shit,
you know,

623
00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:40.280
and all of a sudden we just got hit from behind.
And uh,

624
00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:43.230
I see this woman,
she's doing the gestures like,

625
00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:47.600
<v 6>and I got old Xsi.
I thought,
yeah,</v>

626
00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:51.270
<v 8>I am like Sal die.
She's making those faces,
right?</v>

627
00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:53.310
At least that's how I'm reading it.
Okay.

628
00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:57.420
So then I go to pull over and then she starts pointing to different places where

629
00:39:57.421 --> 00:40:00.390
I should be pulling over,
which is really fucking annoying me.
It's like,
listen,

630
00:40:00.391 --> 00:40:05.340
bitch,
you hit my car.
How about I get to make a decision here?
You know,
like,

631
00:40:05.341 --> 00:40:08.730
maybe we'll pull over here.
So we pull into this fucking Jiffy Lube.
She gets out.

632
00:40:08.731 --> 00:40:11.430
Turns out she's a fucking sweetheart.

633
00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:16.620
She's a sweetheart,
right?
She's not a bad person.
She's like,
you know,

634
00:40:16.621 --> 00:40:19.680
my dog was jumping around and went to go pick her up and I fucking rammed into

635
00:40:19.681 --> 00:40:24.480
you.
So,
uh,
I look at my back bumper and it's got a nice little crease in it.

636
00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:27.600
You know what I mean?
Like right down the side of Keith Richards face.

637
00:40:27.601 --> 00:40:31.290
That's what I got like on,
uh,
not,
not on the,
the uh,

638
00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:34.590
the side that you would see if you were standing behind it,
if you will.

639
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:36.790
Creeping up right behind my car.

640
00:40:36.791 --> 00:40:39.850
Like you were going to fuck it for some reason and you look down at it.

641
00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:42.650
That part of the bumper,
the top part of the bumper,

642
00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:46.100
that's what I'm trying to say.
I looked as crease a little bit,
whatever.

643
00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:51.180
Do you know the fuck I'm going to get a new bumper,
you know?

644
00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:55.780
Yeah.
Then what some other person's going to hit me.
It's La p.
It's a bumper.

645
00:40:55.781 --> 00:40:59.260
Cars out here.
Impossible.
I've done that a couple of times.

646
00:40:59.261 --> 00:41:02.080
I've gone out and I've got my bumper replaced and literally a fucking week
later,

647
00:41:02.081 --> 00:41:05.980
some asshole bumps into me.
So I'm just like,
fuck it.
Uh,

648
00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:09.580
but what have we exchanged information?
And I,
and I go to leave.
And today,

649
00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:11.680
Lo and behold,
I go for the first time,

650
00:41:11.681 --> 00:41:16.360
I guess in a week to open and close the hatch back and it's not closing,
right?

651
00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:20.750
So evidently she hit it hard enough that it did a little more damaged.

652
00:41:20.751 --> 00:41:24.800
So I took it over to the place to get an estimate.
And of course the guy's like,

653
00:41:24.801 --> 00:41:28.010
yeah,
you go fucking with plays days,
you go fuck gonna place data.
You know,

654
00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:32.540
the gas day killing it looks intact.
Butter,
it's probably a,
you know,

655
00:41:32.541 --> 00:41:35.810
suffered sort of trauma.
So emotional trauma.

656
00:41:35.811 --> 00:41:38.270
So he tells me it's going to be,
uh,

657
00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.900
around two grand if not three grant

658
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:46.640
for this bullshit.
So I just had to call her back and just say,
listen,

659
00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:51.140
I don't know if you got that kind of cash.
I ain't got that kind of fucking cash.

660
00:41:51.141 --> 00:41:54.040
So why don't you report it to your fucking insurance company?
Because,
uh,

661
00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:57.530
basically both thought it was going to be a new bumper,
which is like,
you know,

662
00:41:57.531 --> 00:41:57.831
five,

663
00:41:57.831 --> 00:42:01.370
600 bucks depending on whether or not the fucking mechanic wants to have a keg

664
00:42:01.371 --> 00:42:05.150
party that weekend.
You know,
and I don't know how to fix the shit.

665
00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:08.480
So all you guys are going to send emails do,
there's no fucking way.
I know.

666
00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:10.520
There's no fucking way.
All right.

667
00:42:10.521 --> 00:42:14.700
But I don't have time to find the fucking guy that's going to give me the,

668
00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:17.450
I think actually whatever.
I have no fucking idea.

669
00:42:17.451 --> 00:42:20.450
I have no idea what it's supposed to cost.
I drive a hybrid.

670
00:42:20.451 --> 00:42:21.980
It's half a fucking spaceship.

671
00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:26.330
God knows what the health behind those plastic bumpers.

672
00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:31.490
But um,
so that's my day.
I just got off the beaten track.
What the fuck is today?

673
00:42:31.491 --> 00:42:33.380
Today's the 29th of November.

674
00:42:33.381 --> 00:42:37.610
This is the Monday morning podcast and I hope all you guys had a happy

675
00:42:37.611 --> 00:42:40.400
thanksgiving.
I apologize the last week for the volume.

676
00:42:40.401 --> 00:42:43.340
I don't know what happened.
I don't know if I hit it or what,
but uh,

677
00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:48.200
I'm surprised I didn't get more than the 30 complaints I got for how quiet it
is.

678
00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:53.060
So this week it's going to be nice and loud.
Okay.
So called white man.

679
00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:58.370
Um,
so anyways,
let's get through the podcast here.
I would,

680
00:42:58.371 --> 00:43:03.140
I do this weekend I have after thanksgiving.
Um,
you know that this podcast has,

681
00:43:03.141 --> 00:43:07.070
this podcast has a lot of momentum,
but not a lot of funny.

682
00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:08.960
I'm just fucking,
you know,

683
00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:12.170
you ever switched your drunk when you go down a flight of stairs and you start

684
00:43:12.171 --> 00:43:15.350
the fall and you just like,
well fuck it.
I'm going in this direction anyways,

685
00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:17.120
so you don't even try to break your fall.

686
00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:20.240
That's basically how I've been doing this podcast.

687
00:43:20.241 --> 00:43:22.820
So I'm going to take a breath in,

688
00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:26.240
let it out and I'm just going to fucking relax here.

689
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:30.110
I'm going to tell you about my weekend.
I had a phenomenal weekend.

690
00:43:30.111 --> 00:43:31.850
Everybody just sit back,

691
00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:37.880
take your fucking scrunchy out,
let your hair fall down around your shoulders.

692
00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:42.800
Um,
no,
I went to a,
a,
I did the more theater,
the more,

693
00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:47.870
the more theater up in,
uh,
Seattle,
Washington.

694
00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:52.820
And I'm,
I'm gonna tell you a fucking underrated right now.
Seattle,

695
00:43:52.821 --> 00:43:57.800
Washington.
That place is a places to shit.

696
00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:01.460
And if you ever decided,
you know,
he didn't want to fucking go overseas,

697
00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:06.890
I'll go to some stupid fucking place just because it had palm trees.
Uh,

698
00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:11.720
Seattle is a,
is a,
it's just a fucking awesome city.
Although I got to tell you,

699
00:44:11.721 --> 00:44:15.950
the weather is just as brutal as they say.
You know,
I have this new fancy phone.

700
00:44:15.951 --> 00:44:19.260
I went out and got the droid incredible.
And um,

701
00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:25.340
it always has the forecast.
If it's sunny out,
there's a sun.
If it's cloudy,

702
00:44:25.341 --> 00:44:28.700
they just have a little,
they have a cloud.
The whole fucking weekend I was,

703
00:44:28.701 --> 00:44:33.701
there was just this gray cloud on my phone and I gotta admit after three days it

704
00:44:33.721 --> 00:44:38.550
was really starting to fuck with me.
Um,
and even when they actually,

705
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:43.290
when you would look at the forecast and they would try to predict the next

706
00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:45.900
couple of days,
they didn't have the balls to just say it was sunny.

707
00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:49.560
They'd always throw a couple of clouds in front of the sun just to hedge their

708
00:44:49.561 --> 00:44:53.610
bets.
Um,
but anyways,
I did the,
uh,

709
00:44:53.611 --> 00:44:57.570
the Moore theater up there with Paul Versey.
Uh,

710
00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:01.290
my gambling associates slash comedian buddy.
Um,

711
00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:05.220
and man,
I had a fucking great time.
If you have,
you listen every week,

712
00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:07.560
you're already know this shit.
If you're just tuning in for the first time,

713
00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:08.790
you haven't listened in a couple of weeks.

714
00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:14.310
The Moore Theater is a legendary music venue up there in Seattle.

715
00:45:14.311 --> 00:45:18.060
All those grunge bands played at Alison.
Change Soundgarden,
Nirvana,

716
00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:21.660
pearl jam shot that video there for a even flow.

717
00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:26.430
Remember that when Eddie vetter walked out and kind of fell off the balcony or

718
00:45:26.431 --> 00:45:30.940
whatever the hell he did a,
as they would go,
Bam,
pick a tech,
a dick head,
Bam,

719
00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:33.030
pick a ticket to Dan or whatever the fuck they were playing.

720
00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:37.050
I never got into them until later on.
I never liked that first album

721
00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:41.850
[inaudible] I never got into that shit.
But anyways,

722
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:44.930
so I went there and um,

723
00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:50.790
I found out the theaters like over a hundred years old and it had three tiers to

724
00:45:50.791 --> 00:45:55.791
it and the upper most tier back in the day during a segregation when they had

725
00:45:57.541 --> 00:46:00.540
the white section in the black section all the way up top,

726
00:46:00.541 --> 00:46:05.541
there was the black section and they hadn't really done any different,

727
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:09.330
uh,
anything different to the theater I guess.

728
00:46:09.331 --> 00:46:11.690
So they still had the set,

729
00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:16.140
there's still a separate staircase to go all the way the fuck up there.

730
00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:19.950
And I got to tell you,
cause I'm a history buff in that type of shit.
I'm like,

731
00:46:19.951 --> 00:46:24.510
I got to see this,
I got to check this shit out.
So the guy takes us up there,
man.

732
00:46:24.511 --> 00:46:27.510
It was fucking ridiculous.
You had to walk up like

733
00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:33.630
two flights of like,
you know,
10 12 stairs and then it was just,

734
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:38.070
it's like you're going out the beginning part of the statue of Liberty before it

735
00:46:38.071 --> 00:46:43.071
becomes that spiral staircase and it was like a fucking nine floor walk up and

736
00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:47.550
you got like fucking six levels up in literally your thighs are burning,

737
00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:50.100
you know,
and we started joking,

738
00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:54.750
this right here is why you don't see any white running backs at the pro level

739
00:46:54.751 --> 00:46:58.980
anymore.
We used to just waltz right in to the fucking theater,

740
00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:03.990
but they're fucking doughy white legs and we'd sit down at the lower level.

741
00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:05.281
Meanwhile,

742
00:47:05.281 --> 00:47:10.281
the black dudes had a fucking walk up like 200 fucking stairs and they had the

743
00:47:10.641 --> 00:47:12.210
lean forward,
you know,

744
00:47:12.211 --> 00:47:15.060
to try to watch the show that strengthens the back muscles.

745
00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:19.850
It's a fucking workout just to watch some jackass go up there and go,
Mami,

746
00:47:20.290 --> 00:47:22.950
how I love you,
how I love you,
Mami.
You know,

747
00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:28.110
that's my fucking theory.
Either that or we just suck.
You know?
It's funny,

748
00:47:28.111 --> 00:47:32.200
we actually went to a gave Friday night.
Me and [inaudible] we had do we bet?

749
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:34.540
We bet the fucking,
uh,

750
00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:38.770
New Orleans who vet New Orleans was Sean Paul and was sitting there watching it.

751
00:47:38.771 --> 00:47:42.670
Right.
And,
uh,
the fucking,

752
00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:47.110
the game keep every time we,
we're going to be winning,
I bet Portland comes back,

753
00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:51.280
right.
And then all of a sudden a New Orleans,
I'm sorry,

754
00:47:51.281 --> 00:47:53.950
I'm fucking this story up because I keep thinking it's the Charlotte Hornets,

755
00:47:53.951 --> 00:47:54.910
the New Orleans Hornets,

756
00:47:54.911 --> 00:47:59.290
New Orleans comes flying down the court on this fast break and they dump it off

757
00:47:59.291 --> 00:48:03.610
to this white dude.
And of course he misses the fucking layup.
And I swear to God,

758
00:48:03.611 --> 00:48:07.900
me and Versie both looked at each other and in unison went fucking white guy,

759
00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:10.900
you know,
and then we just started laughing.
But it's true.

760
00:48:10.901 --> 00:48:15.670
It's like get them off the court,
you know,
give them a ref shirt.

761
00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:19.180
Other than that,
get them the fuck out of there.
I got money on this fucking game

762
00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:26.260
to knowing,
man.
It's fucking embarrassing.
I Dunno.
I Dunno what happened to us.
Um,

763
00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:27.220
but I think some of the,

764
00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:30.190
some of it has to do with that flight of stairs that I saw up there at the Moore

765
00:48:30.191 --> 00:48:31.024
theater.

766
00:48:34.810 --> 00:48:39.400
That's offensive.
I'll go fuck yourself.
They have a merry Christmas.
Anyways,

767
00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:43.870
I um,
I got to tell you that showed that I did at the,
uh,

768
00:48:43.871 --> 00:48:48.871
the Moore theater there in a Seattle was a probably the best crowd that was like

769
00:48:50.411 --> 00:48:54.070
the best crowd I've had since my standup special.
And I've had some great ones,

770
00:48:54.071 --> 00:48:58.990
but I'm telling you,
man,
that it was,
I just want,

771
00:48:58.991 --> 00:49:01.900
it was one of those shows where I just walked out and the first word,

772
00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:05.620
I felt like it.
Uh,
it clicked Nia,
you look gorgeous.

773
00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:11.800
You look gorgeous.
All right.
Go get them.
Knock 'em dead.
Break a leg,

774
00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:16.630
kick their ass.
Look them right in the eye.
Tell him to go fuck themselves,

775
00:49:16.631 --> 00:49:19.870
but with your eyes,
you know,
read those sides.

776
00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:25.630
You get my right and you'd get my left.
I'm going to keep talking to you too.

777
00:49:25.631 --> 00:49:27.670
You leave.
I'm in the middle of telling a story here.

778
00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:31.780
Let me pick out the right earrings.
They're earrings that go with this outfit.

779
00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:36.640
There's the jewelry box.
Where's the bracelet?
Oh my God.

780
00:49:36.730 --> 00:49:40.300
Does anything take longer than your fucking girl to pick out a shit and get out

781
00:49:40.301 --> 00:49:43.840
of the Goddamn Room?
That's all.

782
00:49:44.050 --> 00:49:46.660
I'm trying to get you to yell at me.
Nia,
to add to the comedy.

783
00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:56.890
Yeah,
I know.
But you know how I am.
You know I'm going to add you to it.

784
00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:00.610
What am I supposed to act like?
You're not in the room.
That's fucking weird.

785
00:50:00.611 --> 00:50:04.330
Like you're a guest.
Like I'm actually doing this in a radio show.

786
00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:12.400
Yeah,
she's going all right.
Anyways.
Um,
the fuck was I talking about?

787
00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:12.701
Yeah,

788
00:50:12.701 --> 00:50:16.690
it was one of these shows like I went out there and I was ridiculously excited.

789
00:50:16.691 --> 00:50:18.190
You know,
cause I'm a music geek.

790
00:50:18.910 --> 00:50:22.090
You combine the fact that I'm a music Geek and then I'm a history buff.

791
00:50:22.091 --> 00:50:25.660
He combined the whole thing.
It's a 100 year old theater downstairs.

792
00:50:25.661 --> 00:50:29.300
It's all fucking cramped.
They these little doorways,
you know,

793
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:33.710
cause back in the day we weren't all hopped up on these fucking whatever the

794
00:50:33.711 --> 00:50:37.430
fucking horse tranquilizers they put into the chicken nowadays.

795
00:50:37.431 --> 00:50:42.080
So now we're all like at least five,
11 for some fucking reason.
You know,

796
00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:47.300
they're those little douche bags with the powdered wigs hundred years ago.
Right.

797
00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:52.460
And actually is people stop wearing posted wigs.
Go Fuck Yourself.
I know.

798
00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:55.370
I'm just saying you ever seen those old pictures,

799
00:50:55.371 --> 00:50:57.760
those little runts sitting there making the fucking,
uh,

800
00:50:58.670 --> 00:51:03.670
the railroads are standing there with their evil fucking white guy.

801
00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:08.090
Racist Mustache is the,
uh,
the Chinese guys built it,
right.

802
00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:11.630
At least they built it from San Francisco.
All right.
People,
I'm a history buff.

803
00:51:11.631 --> 00:51:12.980
I didn't say I know the history.

804
00:51:13.850 --> 00:51:16.190
I just thought I just sort of walked by it every once in awhile.

805
00:51:16.550 --> 00:51:19.040
I read a couple of plaques in the museum.
I'm that guy.

806
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:24.140
Then I deliberately try to shoehorn the information.
I just read it and at a,

807
00:51:24.141 --> 00:51:29.120
at a museum into whatever conversation is going on at a party,
you know,

808
00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:34.640
that was kitten who I'm a fucking moron anyway,
so let's plow ahead here.
So,
um,

809
00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:37.940
I was really excited to do the show and I walked out there and it was just just

810
00:51:37.941 --> 00:51:39.890
from,
I don't know,

811
00:51:39.891 --> 00:51:44.891
some shows you just go out there and from the first word you just lock in with

812
00:51:44.931 --> 00:51:48.860
the crowd.
And uh,
that's what happened.
And they were,
yeah,
they were just,

813
00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:52.250
they were just a great crowd.
Totally went along for the ride.

814
00:51:52.251 --> 00:51:56.210
For some reason they didn't turn the fucking heat on in the building.

815
00:51:58.190 --> 00:51:59.900
Um,
and I think that's what happened.

816
00:51:59.901 --> 00:52:02.060
I just started making fun of how fucking cold it was.

817
00:52:02.061 --> 00:52:05.880
And then at that just sort of opened my brain up and a,

818
00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:09.350
and I went off and I had a great time and I want to thank everybody up in

819
00:52:09.351 --> 00:52:13.520
Seattle who came out to,
uh,
came out to the show.

820
00:52:13.850 --> 00:52:16.010
So that was my weekend.
Oh,
wait a minute.

821
00:52:16.011 --> 00:52:19.510
Then I went to the Seahawks game on Sunday and,
uh,

822
00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:23.720
the fuck did I go to and I'm fucking wiped out.
I came out.

823
00:52:23.810 --> 00:52:26.450
What the Hell I did when did the Seahawks game with [inaudible].
That's right.

824
00:52:26.550 --> 00:52:27.740
We will walk into the stadium going,

825
00:52:27.741 --> 00:52:31.850
should we bet the fucking Seahawks or we see should we bet the chiefs in both

826
00:52:31.851 --> 00:52:36.110
those teams have fucked me over the whole God damn year and a,

827
00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:38.360
we bet the fucking Seahawks.
You know,

828
00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:42.680
I was just sick of going to games and rooting against the home team,

829
00:52:42.681 --> 00:52:45.350
so I actually bet with my heart,
like a fucking asshole.

830
00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:50.570
And the second I showed up and I saw Pete Carroll and his entire coaching staff

831
00:52:50.571 --> 00:52:53.690
in those fucking khaki dockers,

832
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:57.230
I don't know why they're wearing those things.
You know,

833
00:52:57.231 --> 00:53:00.410
like they're going to go play the fucking Ryder Cup.
This is football.

834
00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:05.540
And it was a,
the game started off awesome.
First of all,

835
00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:10.130
it's the loudest fucking Stadium Professional Football Stadium I've ever been
to.

836
00:53:10.131 --> 00:53:14.180
And I think it's louder than even when I went to a Michigan,
the big house,

837
00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:18.140
as far as I can remember,
I'd have to go to a Michigan game again.

838
00:53:19.310 --> 00:53:20.870
It was louder than Ohio state.

839
00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:24.680
I think it was the loudest fucking football game I'd ever been to.
It was,

840
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:27.150
it was unbelievable.
I know you guys think I'm exaggerating,

841
00:53:27.151 --> 00:53:28.830
but I'm not bullshitting.
First of all,

842
00:53:28.831 --> 00:53:33.120
they started off and every fucking week they have some guy come out there and

843
00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:35.970
they got this big thing out there.
The 12th man,
which is the crowd,

844
00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:39.450
a phone for non sports fans is 11 guys.

845
00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:43.090
In any given time when you play in the game live guys on defense level,

846
00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:46.920
guys on offense,
that type of shit.
So the 12th guy's the fucking fan.

847
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:50.610
Little bit of pandering,
but you know these fans earn it.

848
00:53:50.611 --> 00:53:53.820
So to start the game they have some fucking,

849
00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:58.850
they just find some dude that's gonna fucking ramp the crowd up to come out and

850
00:53:59.821 --> 00:54:03.030
raise the 12 12th man flag.

851
00:54:04.110 --> 00:54:07.110
Like we're going to Goddamn or like he already conquered some shit.

852
00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:12.570
All right?
Never Denley earlier this year on some sort of veteran's day,

853
00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:16.710
they brought out some old guy who stormed the beaches of Normandy,

854
00:54:16.711 --> 00:54:20.210
came out yet is purple hearts and all that and the poor bastard.

855
00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:23.730
It took him like 20 minutes to raise the flag because he was so old.
But it just,

856
00:54:23.731 --> 00:54:27.240
the fact that the fucking guy storm normally the place and a place almost

857
00:54:27.241 --> 00:54:31.770
collapsed.
People were flipping out.
So the week we went,

858
00:54:32.370 --> 00:54:34.830
they brought the guy,
I can't remember his name,

859
00:54:34.831 --> 00:54:39.630
that actor who was in top gun viper,

860
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:43.950
I believe his name was to do two flew with Maverick's dad deck guy came out

861
00:54:43.951 --> 00:54:46.290
there.
So they're playing the top gun music and all that.

862
00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:49.260
And it should have been cheesy,
but it was,
it was kind of cheesy.

863
00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:52.920
It was fucking hilarious and a,
that's a guilty pleasure.

864
00:54:52.921 --> 00:54:56.010
Everybody loves that movie.
So the place is just going fucking nuts.

865
00:54:56.670 --> 00:55:00.930
And I'm feeling like,
uh,
I'm feeling like we're going to win our bet.

866
00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:06.330
And then Kansas City gets the ball and immediately first play from scrimmage,

867
00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:11.520
castle rolls out and just fucking throws one 12 yards first down.
Right.

868
00:55:11.970 --> 00:55:15.990
And all of a sudden I hear this voice behind me and I,
it,
I just say,
this guy,

869
00:55:15.991 --> 00:55:20.340
just go on the fucking sea hawks quarterback suck.

870
00:55:21.090 --> 00:55:25.950
Right?
And I turn around and it's this big fat Kansas City chiefs fan.

871
00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:28.050
And he was so fat.

872
00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:31.980
You could just tell he knew about football and this son of a bitch was right

873
00:55:31.981 --> 00:55:34.090
because they got burned the entire fucking gay.

874
00:55:34.091 --> 00:55:35.580
I don't want to talk about the rest of it.

875
00:55:35.730 --> 00:55:38.610
So we ended up losing the money we want on the fucking Portland game.

876
00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:43.110
We ended up giving it back,
but,
uh,
I don't know,

877
00:55:43.111 --> 00:55:44.250
it was still an awesome time.

878
00:55:44.251 --> 00:55:47.490
We ended up meeting some people from the show and they had these seats right

879
00:55:47.491 --> 00:55:51.330
down on the end zone.
So we fucking went all the way down for the second half.

880
00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:55.830
You're actually basically sitting on the field and uh,

881
00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:59.760
you know what sucked was Seattle actually scored a touchdown.

882
00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:02.580
They threw a bomb is 50 yard bomb for a touchdown.

883
00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:06.720
And I was in this suite taking a piss.
And when I come walking out,

884
00:56:06.721 --> 00:56:10.380
as I'm walking out trying to see past all these people stuffing their faces with

885
00:56:10.381 --> 00:56:11.214
Nachos,

886
00:56:11.310 --> 00:56:15.060
I just see these male cheerleaders running around with those Seahawk flags,

887
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:20.670
you know,
out on the field and the crowd's going nuts.
And I was like,

888
00:56:20.671 --> 00:56:25.270
you gotta be shitting me.
So,
other than that,
it was a great fucking time.

889
00:56:25.271 --> 00:56:30.010
So we had an awesome time up there in Seattle and went down to the,
uh,

890
00:56:30.011 --> 00:56:34.420
the fish market,
their guts,
some,
it was just,
it was awesome.
It was,
it was just,

891
00:56:34.450 --> 00:56:37.750
it was fucking phenomenal.
50.
If it just could have been a little sunny,

892
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:42.130
it would have been the best weekend I had all goddamn year other than other than

893
00:56:42.131 --> 00:56:47.110
the,
the depressing gray skies and yours.
Funny.

894
00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:50.410
He's everything.
I was joking on stage.
Everything in Seattle is made,

895
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:53.170
I swear to God from the same bag of concrete,

896
00:56:53.830 --> 00:56:57.490
see exact same consistency.
It's the exact same fucking color.

897
00:56:58.690 --> 00:57:00.820
And on those overcast days,
it just,

898
00:57:00.821 --> 00:57:04.640
the horizon just blends in with that concrete and it's,

899
00:57:04.750 --> 00:57:08.920
I can really see why people fucking blow their brains out up there.
You know,

900
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:11.650
if you're not careful,
if you're not fucking careful,

901
00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:16.600
you can end up like that fellow there,
that fellow from that,
from that,

902
00:57:16.601 --> 00:57:20.530
that place who did that stuff.
Remember that guy?
Um,

903
00:57:21.490 --> 00:57:24.130
you know what I notice about poverty the last week I was giving him shit and I

904
00:57:24.131 --> 00:57:26.020
can't give him shit this week cause I went one and three.

905
00:57:26.021 --> 00:57:29.380
I officially do not know shit about football when it comes to fucking gambling.

906
00:57:29.381 --> 00:57:31.610
And evidently,
uh,

907
00:57:32.170 --> 00:57:35.800
I don't know shit about football without gambling because I said the Steelers,

908
00:57:35.890 --> 00:57:39.070
we're going to be the team to beat fucking assholes.

909
00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:42.910
You can't cover against the God damn bills.

910
00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:46.720
What the fuck is wrong with that team?
They got the defense.

911
00:57:46.721 --> 00:57:51.400
They got Ben Roethlisberger is back.
Is it because he can't rape anybody anymore?

912
00:57:51.401 --> 00:57:54.430
It's fucking thrown off his game.
I don't know what's going on,
but they got all,

913
00:57:54.670 --> 00:57:55.750
maybe they've got some injuries.

914
00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:58.330
That's another thing why I suck at gambling is cause I don't,

915
00:57:58.331 --> 00:58:03.331
I can't watch ESPN because they just hype shit through the fucking roof.

916
00:58:05.890 --> 00:58:08.200
Like that Monday night football game,
Michael Vick,

917
00:58:08.201 --> 00:58:11.190
remember that thought there was over,
just give them the Superbowl.
True.

918
00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:13.810
Michael Vick,
Michael Vick,
Michael Vick.

919
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:17.800
What we're seeing tonight with Michael Vick.
There was fucking over,

920
00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:22.120
they weren't even addressing the fact that he was doing it against the hapless

921
00:58:22.570 --> 00:58:27.460
Washington.
Fucking Redskins
didn't even mention that.

922
00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:30.550
And then what happens the next week they played the giants.
Giants beat him,

923
00:58:30.551 --> 00:58:34.990
I believe contained Vic this week.
I still got their fucking voices in my head.

924
00:58:35.610 --> 00:58:38.320
Michael Vick,
he fucking Michael Vick,
right?
So what do I do?

925
00:58:38.590 --> 00:58:41.410
I fucking put money on the Goddamn Eagles in the fucking bears.

926
00:58:41.411 --> 00:58:44.620
Kicked the shit out of them.
So once again,

927
00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:49.450
and I even said on this pod podcast when somebody tried to say that Michael Vick

928
00:58:49.451 --> 00:58:52.540
was the best quarterback in the fucking league because he kicked the shit out of

929
00:58:52.541 --> 00:58:54.010
the Redskins one fucking week.

930
00:58:54.310 --> 00:58:59.310
And it's the exactly the reason why I keep trying to tell people that Peyton

931
00:58:59.411 --> 00:59:03.130
manning isn't as great as people are saying,
ah,

932
00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:07.210
I give up,
but you know something.
I've actually,
I,
I give up with that argument.

933
00:59:07.211 --> 00:59:11.350
I officially fucking give up because this guy after my show in Seattle,

934
00:59:11.351 --> 00:59:16.180
just started the argument with me and then followed up and sent me an email.

935
00:59:16.181 --> 00:59:20.860
And one of the points he wanted to make as to the reason why Tom Brady was an

936
00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:23.810
quarterback was because of his knee injury.

937
00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:29.450
He said something that if Tom Brady knew how to scramble and didn't suck so bad,

938
00:59:29.451 --> 00:59:32.780
he wouldn't have injured his fucking knee.
Now that's a funny fucking line,

939
00:59:32.781 --> 00:59:36.560
but this guy was actually serious.
So at this point it's just like whatever,

940
00:59:36.561 --> 00:59:41.060
people like who they like.
So go ahead like who you like,

941
00:59:41.061 --> 00:59:44.210
I don't give a fuck.
Anyways.
Um,

942
00:59:44.211 --> 00:59:47.240
I finally got bored with that whole fucking thing and also I got,
um,
I just,

943
00:59:47.241 --> 00:59:50.030
I just don't believe in the Patriots.

944
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:53.120
I just can't get behind that fucking defense.

945
00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:56.750
Belichick's a fucking genius can make the,
make the adjustments,

946
00:59:56.751 --> 01:00:01.751
but we're not going to go anywhere with that given up 24 to 30 points every

947
01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:06.890
fucking week.
Did you see Fatboy slim there?
Uh,
uh,

948
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:11.400
what's his face?
Rex Ryan
trying the,

949
01:00:11.401 --> 01:00:16.340
the age old world against us fucking speech.
You know,

950
01:00:16.341 --> 01:00:18.470
trying to paint his team as the underdog.

951
01:00:18.471 --> 01:00:21.380
Do you think his team's dumb enough to fucking believe it?
I do.

952
01:00:22.430 --> 01:00:24.600
It'll allow people out that their dad,

953
01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:29.840
Belichick and the Patriots and best team and the leg well lab,

954
01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:33.740
that one of those guy and he gives his stupid fat John Wayne Smile.

955
01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:35.180
Ah,

956
01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:40.180
Jesus fucking Christ cookie dough wheat and fucking patent looking jackass.

957
01:00:40.191 --> 01:00:41.510
I'm so fucking sick of them.

958
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:48.740
It's how to fuck you guys kicked the shit out of us.
Wow.

959
01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:52.130
Well where the fuck you getting off of this fucking underdog talk your fucking

960
01:00:52.131 --> 01:00:54.620
Pansy.
What are you already hedging your bet?

961
01:00:55.010 --> 01:00:58.730
You afraid you're going to fucking lose you faggot.
Oh,

962
01:00:58.790 --> 01:01:03.560
there's no game in the world that I want to win more than this Monday night

963
01:01:03.561 --> 01:01:07.170
coming up next week.
The patriots verse the jets.
I want,
I,
I,

964
01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:11.000
I can't remember the last time.
This is worse than Celtics Lakers.

965
01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:14.510
And you know what the sad thing is is we're not going to fucking win cause at

966
01:01:14.511 --> 01:01:18.080
defense sucks fucking assholes.

967
01:01:19.070 --> 01:01:23.090
24 to 30 points a game.
There's no fucking way you can.
You can give that up.

968
01:01:23.091 --> 01:01:27.500
The jets have to good at defense those mother fuckers and now the Steelers

969
01:01:27.501 --> 01:01:30.050
aren't stepping on maybe the ravens.
Maybe the ravens will save,

970
01:01:30.170 --> 01:01:33.410
but that's all I need.
That's all I need.
I don't give a fuck.

971
01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:37.210
As long as somebody beats the jets in the playoffs,

972
01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:42.220
I am going to be excited if that fucking half ass bullshit fucking team wins the

973
01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:45.380
super bowl,

974
01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:49.570
that fucking team that wins by the skin of that goddamn teeth hasn't fucking

975
01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:53.030
dominate in anybody but my shit ass fucking defensive team,

976
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:58.330
it's going to kill me.
It's absolutely going to fucking kill me.
I'm gonna.

977
01:01:58.350 --> 01:02:00.200
I don't know what I'm going to do.
I'm going to have,

978
01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:03.110
I would say I cancel the podcast for two weeks,

979
01:02:03.111 --> 01:02:06.150
but that would be the bitch move after I talked to all this shit's so I'm going

980
01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:08.630
to have to come in and take my shit if it happens,

981
01:02:08.631 --> 01:02:10.610
but luckily I don't think it's going to happen,

982
01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:15.440
but I gotta admit I got no fucking faith.
I've got no faith.

983
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:18.560
The fuck you let the Lions score 24 points on you

984
01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:24.870
got trampled by the browns were fucking horrific on defense.

985
01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:29.070
What good for the first two doubts.
What grade of what great with that.

986
01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:30.053
Then third down,

987
01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:33.210
I think that our defense is just having so much fun being out there that they're

988
01:02:33.211 --> 01:02:36.870
like,
Eh,
let's just let up 12 yards on a run.
Let's do it on a run.

989
01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:41.880
They'll eat up some of the clock.
That'll be fucking awesome.
Um,
who else?
Fuck me.

990
01:02:41.881 --> 01:02:46.110
Last week I Aaliyah icon blaming everybody but myself for my,
uh,

991
01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:51.060
for my awful Pyxis week.
Actually bet on Peyton manning.
You know,

992
01:02:51.061 --> 01:02:54.150
all you douchebags telling me such a great fucking quarterback with his three

993
01:02:54.690 --> 01:02:57.390
picks.
You know what,
why?

994
01:02:57.391 --> 01:03:01.690
Why wouldn't I realize at this point after the chargers have essentially what

995
01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:05.490
are they beaten the colts at home?
Like what nine times in a fucking row?

996
01:03:06.070 --> 01:03:07.620
Couple of times in the playoffs.

997
01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:14.650
Look at Peyton manning now.
Now that he has no fucking tools.
Now look at him.

998
01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:18.510
Look how average he looks and just fucking pissing people off our name.

999
01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:21.900
Let's get off this fucking subject.
So that's my prediction.
Next.
I actually,

1000
01:03:22.050 --> 01:03:25.410
I think next week I think it's all going to be a tight fucking game,

1001
01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:29.280
but I just can't see us.
Uh,

1002
01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:34.440
it wouldn't surprise me because I can't believe we beat the Steelers,
but I just,

1003
01:03:34.441 --> 01:03:37.320
I can't get behind a fucking team that lets up all those goddamn points.

1004
01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:42.090
That fucking old lady we did.
Our defense should be dressed like matadors

1005
01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:48.630
with big red capes.
Just letting receivers and running backs go down the field.

1006
01:03:48.631 --> 01:03:52.020
All Aa.
Um,
all right.

1007
01:03:53.310 --> 01:03:55.350
I think that's about enough to see.
That wasn't that bad.

1008
01:03:55.351 --> 01:03:57.900
I'm trying to tone down the fucking NFL Shit I get.
I'm getting really,

1009
01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:02.340
I'm never doing this again because I realized there's no fucking way I can talk

1010
01:04:02.341 --> 01:04:05.040
for 17 weeks about anything.

1011
01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:10.400
I am absolutely bored shitless with the sports talk with that specific shit.

1012
01:04:12.691 --> 01:04:14.010
I can't fucking do it anymore.

1013
01:04:14.011 --> 01:04:17.280
But now I have to hang in there cause I've talked so much goddamn shit.

1014
01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:18.700
So maybe that'll be the inch.

1015
01:04:18.701 --> 01:04:20.970
Maybe that'll be the entertaining part of this podcast.

1016
01:04:20.971 --> 01:04:24.630
Listening to me talk about something I don't give 'em slowly not giving a fuck

1017
01:04:24.631 --> 01:04:27.840
about anymore.
Um,
all right.

1018
01:04:30.090 --> 01:04:32.130
Oh,
I know what I want to tell.
I wanted to make fun of Paul Versey.

1019
01:04:32.131 --> 01:04:35.730
Do you guys remember that?
Fucking,
uh,
you remember good fellas.

1020
01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:37.420
Me that little movie,
Goodfellas,

1021
01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:40.560
it was as a little art house movie that kind of came and went the theaters

1022
01:04:40.561 --> 01:04:44.010
really quickly.
What was the name of that character in the beginning?
One of the,

1023
01:04:44.550 --> 01:04:47.290
uh,
Jimmy two times or whatever.
Get the papers,
get the papers.

1024
01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:51.960
Remember that Paul Versey is fucking,
uh,
poly three times.

1025
01:04:53.370 --> 01:04:57.940
It's not that he says shit twice or three times.
It's like I don't,

1026
01:04:57.941 --> 01:05:02.910
I don't know if he thinks that you can't hear him or f if he starts to make a

1027
01:05:02.911 --> 01:05:07.380
point and he realizes that the wall that he wanted to jump over with his point

1028
01:05:07.381 --> 01:05:09.630
is like six feet higher than he thought.

1029
01:05:09.631 --> 01:05:11.820
So he's got to run back another 10 paces.

1030
01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:17.060
I'd never met a guy who starts and then stops and restarts his fucking more

1031
01:05:17.861 --> 01:05:21.430
times than this guy fucking at the game the other day.
Right?

1032
01:05:21.431 --> 01:05:25.150
I can't remember what we were just talking about something and this,
this is him

1033
01:05:26.650 --> 01:05:29.560
trying to make this point.
He goes,
goes,

1034
01:05:29.561 --> 01:05:34.180
you know people talk shit now.
He goes,
no.
He goes,
you know,
he goes,
people talk,

1035
01:05:35.470 --> 01:05:37.780
people talk shit,
dude.

1036
01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:41.980
People Talk Shit when they think they know what's going on

1037
01:05:44.610 --> 01:05:48.760
the all fucking weekend.
It driving me now it's like watching,

1038
01:05:48.761 --> 01:05:52.930
it was like the verbal equivalent.
You know when you watch those reality shows,

1039
01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:53.800
you know,

1040
01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:57.430
and they're about ready to waste some fat fucking than they do the scale and

1041
01:05:57.431 --> 01:05:59.080
you're like,
oh fuck,
what's going to happen?

1042
01:05:59.081 --> 01:06:02.260
And then they go to commercial and then when they come back from commercial,

1043
01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:05.530
they go right back to the fat fuck getting on the scale.
It's just like,

1044
01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:10.180
just wait a fucker.
Just weigh them.
That's what verse he does.

1045
01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:14.320
Robinson Cano,

1046
01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:18.730
Dude Robinson Cano was four for four last night.

1047
01:06:20.290 --> 01:06:24.490
He does,
he,
he fucking,
he,
he,
he bangs against the door once just to see if,

1048
01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:28.870
if it's solid or it's particle board and then he figures out how far back he has

1049
01:06:28.871 --> 01:06:29.704
to run.

1050
01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:37.360
Don't you heard it here first?
All right.
The New York giants,

1051
01:06:37.630 --> 01:06:38.050
dude,

1052
01:06:38.050 --> 01:06:43.050
the New York giants are going to fucking run the table hurting here first.

1053
01:06:43.631 --> 01:06:48.300
Paul,
I heard it the first nine times you said it.
I swear to God it's,
it's,

1054
01:06:48.301 --> 01:06:52.480
it's like he's got some sort of like a,
it's not a a speech impediment.

1055
01:06:52.481 --> 01:06:57.250
It's like a brain impediment.
He said he starts to make a point and uh,

1056
01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:00.400
then there's like a heckler in his head.
Just go,
no Paul Unit.

1057
01:07:00.401 --> 01:07:03.730
You're not saying it with enough confidence.
Like there's a director going cut.

1058
01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:06.970
Cut.
Cut.
All right,
Paul.
No,
no,
no.
We love what you're doing here.

1059
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:07.960
We love what you're doing here.

1060
01:07:07.961 --> 01:07:10.300
But if you could just come with a little more emotion this time,

1061
01:07:10.410 --> 01:07:13.960
a little more fucking emotion.
Um,
all right.

1062
01:07:15.550 --> 01:07:19.450
[inaudible] there'll be about enough of that shit.
I'm really,
this is,

1063
01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:22.030
this is what travel does to me.
This time of fucking year.

1064
01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:26.260
I fly through a fucking point and then I slam into a brick wall and then I'm

1065
01:07:26.261 --> 01:07:29.890
done with it.
All right.
I'm done with fucking sports,
you know?

1066
01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:32.380
And then some of you on this podcast,
I'm fucking done with you.

1067
01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:35.530
You know who you are.
Um,
let's get to youtube videos for the week,

1068
01:07:36.130 --> 01:07:39.610
ladies and gentlemen.
Um,
and they,
they,

1069
01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:42.190
they've actually at this point,
uh,

1070
01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:47.220
kind of broken off into two because we have the clips from the bad movies,

1071
01:07:47.561 --> 01:07:49.030
the great bad movies.

1072
01:07:49.031 --> 01:07:53.710
And I'm telling you some of the shit you guys are sending me is unbelievable.
Um,

1073
01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:57.010
and all these videos will be up on the [inaudible] podcast.com.

1074
01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:00.790
She's so check this one out.
You got to see this one.
Um,

1075
01:08:01.330 --> 01:08:03.850
this is actually something that I brought up.
This is not a bad movie.

1076
01:08:03.851 --> 01:08:07.870
This is actually an incredible movie.
It's the original Manchurian candidate.

1077
01:08:08.290 --> 01:08:11.980
But I had mentioned a long time ago that there's a fight scene in there,

1078
01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:14.860
Frank Sinatra versus Asian dude.

1079
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:17.720
And um,

1080
01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:22.940
according to Frank Sinatra,
it's the first karate film,

1081
01:08:22.941 --> 01:08:27.440
the first Kung Fu film ever done in American cinema.

1082
01:08:27.441 --> 01:08:30.830
And you have to see how fuck image,
especially now,
I mean,

1083
01:08:30.831 --> 01:08:31.880
I don't know how to fucking fight,

1084
01:08:31.881 --> 01:08:34.700
but I've watched enough UFC and you look at the stance,

1085
01:08:34.730 --> 01:08:37.640
the stance is that some of the stances they get in about three quarters into the

1086
01:08:37.641 --> 01:08:41.990
fight are just as ridiculous as that karate kid.
Um,

1087
01:08:42.230 --> 01:08:46.310
fear the sparrow or whatever the fuck that,
the name of that stance,

1088
01:08:46.311 --> 01:08:50.150
that bird [inaudible] that he would do.
Um,

1089
01:08:51.770 --> 01:08:56.030
anyways,
I got it's Manchurian candidate 1962 fight.

1090
01:08:56.031 --> 01:08:57.500
You can look it up if you want to,

1091
01:08:57.501 --> 01:09:01.580
but we have all these videos listed nice and neatly along with some pictures

1092
01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:05.480
from my trip to Seattle if you'd like to see where we sat at the game.

1093
01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:09.710
Me and Mr Versie took a picture of the nice fluffy fish and chips.

1094
01:09:09.711 --> 01:09:13.710
I got fucking unbelievable seafood.
That's a great place to take your,
your,

1095
01:09:13.730 --> 01:09:17.420
your girlfriend or your wife.
I fucked up.
I should have brought my girl,
you know,

1096
01:09:18.170 --> 01:09:18.471
but you know,

1097
01:09:18.471 --> 01:09:22.460
I was going to a couple of sporting events and she doesn't like sports,
you know,

1098
01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:23.481
you know,

1099
01:09:23.481 --> 01:09:26.330
when you date a girl doesn't like sports should taken to a sporting event and

1100
01:09:26.331 --> 01:09:29.210
all they talk about has how pretty the grass looks.

1101
01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:33.680
And then by like the second inning,
they're just bored shitless.
Uh,

1102
01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:38.570
that's my experience when I take Nia places.
So,
uh,
you know,

1103
01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:42.310
I don't know.
I don't fucking know who's kidding,
who I fucked up.
Anyways,

1104
01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:47.120
let's plow,
hit um,
the second,
um,
great bad movie.
Here we go.

1105
01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:50.840
Uh,
I drink your blood.
1970 trailer.

1106
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:54.890
This is the fact that they made this fucking movies.
It's just,

1107
01:09:56.370 --> 01:09:57.710
it's unbelievable.

1108
01:09:58.790 --> 01:10:03.320
But when you think back to it how there was no internet and uh,

1109
01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:07.820
just how early on they were into like those slash or kind of movies when you

1110
01:10:07.821 --> 01:10:10.070
actually watch this trailer,
like this is the kind of,

1111
01:10:10.071 --> 01:10:14.180
it's like very like you're really going after this serial killer sort of

1112
01:10:14.181 --> 01:10:17.960
demographic lay a bet like Ted Bundy in those fucking maniacs went to go see

1113
01:10:17.961 --> 01:10:22.790
this stuff back when it was shocking.
Now it's hilarious,
but it's really,
uh,

1114
01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:28.340
it's just really bizarre,
really fucking bizarre.
Um,
all right,
and here's the,

1115
01:10:28.341 --> 01:10:30.510
a regular youtube videos for the week.
Um,

1116
01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:34.910
this one was actually already shown on a Taj point.
Oh,
but this one is so funny.

1117
01:10:34.911 --> 01:10:37.400
I don't like to show videos that have already been shown on that show,

1118
01:10:37.401 --> 01:10:39.980
but just in case you missed the episode,
this is fucking hilarious.

1119
01:10:40.390 --> 01:10:43.880
I remember that I talked about last week,
man versus booze.
If you did that,

1120
01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:48.740
this dude tries to chug a bottle of patron,
which um,

1121
01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:52.250
by the way,
guys is really fucking dangerous.
All right?

1122
01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:55.370
If you actually did it successfully,
you would die.

1123
01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:59.900
Which is why this guy projectile vomits.
That's your body basically saying,

1124
01:10:59.930 --> 01:11:02.750
let's get this shit the fuck outta here so we don't die.
Um,

1125
01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:04.580
the name of the video,
do you want to search?
Uh,

1126
01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:08.390
Joe Breezy patroned challenge and uh,

1127
01:11:08.391 --> 01:11:10.160
this guy's fucking hilarious.

1128
01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:15.950
The shit talk and he does front of it is,
is almost as funny as when he pukes is,

1129
01:11:16.170 --> 01:11:20.820
you know,
this guy's a fucking riot.
He's like mocking the shit talk.

1130
01:11:20.821 --> 01:11:24.930
I think that you see on a lot of these uh,
videos or that you see on reality TV.

1131
01:11:24.931 --> 01:11:28.680
It's hilarious.
Um,
another one you guys see a lot of Christmas lights on.

1132
01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:31.830
You're on the houses as you're driving around a check out.

1133
01:11:31.831 --> 01:11:35.850
This one heavy metal Christmas light show.
That one was actually on live,

1134
01:11:36.810 --> 01:11:41.460
leak.com heavy metal Christmas light show and a.
Then there's another video here.

1135
01:11:41.461 --> 01:11:43.260
This one is awesome as far as like,

1136
01:11:43.261 --> 01:11:48.261
it's really interesting if anybody's into animals and you can explain this one.

1137
01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:52.770
It's crows verse,
Cat [inaudible] Cat Street fight.

1138
01:11:53.730 --> 01:11:57.840
And this person put this unbill almost like they custom made this music for this

1139
01:11:57.841 --> 01:12:01.620
fight.
It's fucking incredible.
These two cats.
I'm not,

1140
01:12:01.621 --> 01:12:03.360
I'm not going to ruin it for you.
You just,
you just got to see it.

1141
01:12:03.390 --> 01:12:07.980
It's fucking incredible.
Um,
another video,
I love this one.

1142
01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:11.730
It's called a censored 8,000,
800 pennies.

1143
01:12:13.710 --> 01:12:17.430
Um,
and it basically,
this dude,
it looks like a college aged kid.

1144
01:12:17.431 --> 01:12:21.780
He got his car towed and he had to walk 15,
20 miles to get home.

1145
01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:23.400
The next day called up,

1146
01:12:23.401 --> 01:12:28.020
he found out where his car was and they wanted $88 to get it out.
So he said,

1147
01:12:28.021 --> 01:12:32.790
fuck it.
I got $88,
and he showed up with 8,000,
800 pennies.
Uh,

1148
01:12:32.850 --> 01:12:37.740
most of them unrolled and he brought it in and he's like,

1149
01:12:37.741 --> 01:12:40.200
it's legal tender.
You have to take it.
And ladies like,

1150
01:12:40.201 --> 01:12:42.660
I'm not going to take this,
I'm not taking this.
And he's like,

1151
01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:46.530
you got to take it's legal tender.
She's like,
I'm not taking it.
And he goes,
fine.

1152
01:12:46.531 --> 01:12:51.210
I'm calling the cops,
which he did and you got to see it.
It's fucking awesome.

1153
01:12:51.690 --> 01:12:54.690
I don't want to ruin it,
but it's awesome.
Uh,
is another good one.

1154
01:12:54.690 --> 01:12:57.690
A speeding ticket fail.
Just a quick one for you.

1155
01:12:57.691 --> 01:13:01.050
People who don't like to watch 10 minute videos and uh,

1156
01:13:01.051 --> 01:13:02.930
this is another great one too.

1157
01:13:03.130 --> 01:13:06.780
There's some really funny fucking filmmakers and actors and shit just fucking

1158
01:13:06.781 --> 01:13:10.050
around.
Just regular people are on Youtube,
man.
These dudes are really funny,

1159
01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:14.940
especially the guy who fucking punches the pig.
And this one,
uh,

1160
01:13:14.970 --> 01:13:19.880
this is called Turbo Bacon epic Thanksgiving epic meal time.

1161
01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:21.640
Uh,
you know,
I think I'd like to,

1162
01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:24.750
every year they come up with a new fattening way to cook a Turkey.

1163
01:13:24.751 --> 01:13:26.940
These guys just take it to the fucking nth degree.

1164
01:13:26.941 --> 01:13:30.630
They make like a 7,900 calorie,
uh,

1165
01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:34.260
Turkey man.
It's fucking insane.
And uh,

1166
01:13:34.290 --> 01:13:36.630
just watch the part where he's tenderizing the pig.

1167
01:13:36.930 --> 01:13:40.980
That's my favorite fucking part really made me laugh out loud.
Um,

1168
01:13:42.330 --> 01:13:44.550
and let's get to the overrated,
underrated for this week.

1169
01:13:44.551 --> 01:13:47.760
Did I not get an advice one?
Why didn't I s God dammit,

1170
01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:52.410
that's usually a nice fucking time filler.
Somebody asked me some fucking advice.

1171
01:13:53.610 --> 01:13:57.690
Um,
oh,
by the way,
speaking of advice,
uh,
did not booze,

1172
01:13:58.830 --> 01:14:00.300
still have not boost.

1173
01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:06.080
I am 44 days in 44 is a very famous number in professional sports.

1174
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:12.820
Right.
You all know who I'm talking about.
Who's the famous number?
44

1175
01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:18.970
and all of a professional sports.
Think about it.
That's right.

1176
01:14:19.190 --> 01:14:23.770
You got it.
Robert Newhouse,
the old fullback used to block for Tony Doors set.

1177
01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:28.690
You're absolutely right though.
It's fucking Reggie Jackson was,

1178
01:14:28.691 --> 01:14:32.740
was was Hank Aaron 44 I don't fucking know.

1179
01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:36.370
You know what people really dropped the ball on was the obscure sports facts.

1180
01:14:36.371 --> 01:14:39.040
I thought that people are going to work really good to keep that one going.

1181
01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:44.110
I thought it had a new segment and it,
it just died a quick death.
You know,

1182
01:14:44.111 --> 01:14:46.780
like one of those critically acclaimed shows.
Critics love it.

1183
01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:50.440
Eight other people are watching it and then it just fucking gets canceled

1184
01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:54.250
because no one else gives a shit.
And then what happens,
right.

1185
01:14:54.970 --> 01:14:58.540
Comes out on DVD and then everybody loves it.
Why they ever cancel this?

1186
01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:02.890
All right.
Overrated.
Underrated for the week.
No,
I'm not done talking about booze.

1187
01:15:02.891 --> 01:15:07.600
I'm 44 fucking days in.
All right.
Uh,

1188
01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:12.370
all I got as I got San Francisco this week,
just as far as tentation goes.

1189
01:15:13.450 --> 01:15:18.190
I got San Francisco this week.
I'm playing COBB's comedy club for the first time.

1190
01:15:18.191 --> 01:15:19.720
I've always been a punchline guy.

1191
01:15:20.710 --> 01:15:25.030
Now I'm going across town playing cobb's comedy club this Thursday,

1192
01:15:25.031 --> 01:15:28.930
Friday,
Saturday,
and Sunday.
Um,

1193
01:15:28.931 --> 01:15:32.600
and I'm also doing a book signing in a,

1194
01:15:33.290 --> 01:15:35.770
I've got to get the interview.
I've got to get you guys not a book signing.

1195
01:15:35.771 --> 01:15:40.570
I don't have a book.
I'm doing a DVD signing.
It's for,
uh,

1196
01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:44.410
to support,
uh,
research for AIDS and Amanda.

1197
01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:48.550
Oh,
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck are,
you know,
they'll tell you how dumb I am.

1198
01:15:48.551 --> 01:15:49.720
I didn't know the name of the bookstore.

1199
01:15:50.050 --> 01:15:53.230
I keep thinking Brookstone begins with a B.

1200
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:58.030
What's that bookstore everybody goes to see.
Only one left,
isn't it?

1201
01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:03.220
Wow.
I just went fucking blank.
Um,
yeah,

1202
01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:08.020
I'm going to be at one of those borders,
borders,
bookstore.
I want to be up there.

1203
01:16:08.590 --> 01:16:09.850
Uh,
doing a book's a book,

1204
01:16:09.851 --> 01:16:13.240
signing a DVD signing on Wednesday night before I do my gig.

1205
01:16:13.241 --> 01:16:16.140
And I absolutely love San Francisco.
And,
uh,

1206
01:16:16.170 --> 01:16:18.820
if you guys know any cool places to eat,
cause I'm not drinking,

1207
01:16:18.821 --> 01:16:20.380
I'm really enjoying this.
I went to a,

1208
01:16:20.381 --> 01:16:23.830
I think it was called the steel diner in um,

1209
01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:29.050
in Seattle,
me and version,
we got like the best fucking fish,

1210
01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:33.130
most of the freshest seafood.
You've,
you've ever fucking had those,

1211
01:16:33.131 --> 01:16:35.230
those goddamn deadliest catch guys show up.

1212
01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:39.280
You can buy shit right off the goddamn boats if you want to.
It's unbelievable.

1213
01:16:39.670 --> 01:16:44.170
Uh,
best fish and chips I've had,
uh,
I'm eating them like Jesus,

1214
01:16:44.171 --> 01:16:47.440
this is like light as air then,
you know,
cause it's deep fried and shit.

1215
01:16:47.441 --> 01:16:51.160
Afterwards I felt like had a boot in my stomach,
but it was absolutely delicious.

1216
01:16:51.161 --> 01:16:55.300
So anyways,
I'm not boozing if you guys know of any,
uh,
any,

1217
01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:56.560
any cool restaurants,

1218
01:16:56.561 --> 01:16:59.770
if that man versus food guy went there and I don't want to eat the fucking

1219
01:16:59.771 --> 01:17:02.440
challenge thing,
but if he went there,
like that Burger,

1220
01:17:02.441 --> 01:17:06.250
I was trying to remember the name of Juicy Lucy,
the one in Minneapolis.

1221
01:17:06.251 --> 01:17:08.980
I missed out on that.
So if this,
if there's something,

1222
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:13.730
whatever people in San Francisco,
late night,
you're drunk or are you going just,

1223
01:17:13.731 --> 01:17:17.630
or you just went there as a kid and you had to get this sandwich or this pizza,

1224
01:17:17.631 --> 01:17:21.710
whatever,
please let me know where it is because,
uh,
I need some,

1225
01:17:21.711 --> 01:17:25.310
a productive shit to be doing rather than sitting around thinking about booze

1226
01:17:25.311 --> 01:17:29.450
and cause I gotta admit that weather up there in Seattle,

1227
01:17:30.050 --> 01:17:30.620
you know,

1228
01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:35.210
it makes you want to eat comfort food and then just go out and drink whatever

1229
01:17:35.211 --> 01:17:38.690
local beer that they have a fuck.

1230
01:17:38.690 --> 01:17:41.450
That's what I really miss about booze and you know,

1231
01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:47.360
I'll tell you a great time to go to Cleveland,
Ohio,
Cleveland,
Ohio,

1232
01:17:47.361 --> 01:17:49.940
this time of year,
right when you get into December,

1233
01:17:50.570 --> 01:17:52.010
go out there and go to a browns game.

1234
01:17:52.130 --> 01:17:55.280
They got a great team and they got this fucking Christmas all out there.

1235
01:17:55.490 --> 01:17:59.440
That is the shit.
And it's an extra couple of,
uh,

1236
01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:03.300
I think they could have one in,
in Pittsburgh to this.

1237
01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:04.700
A really knocked me back on the wagon.

1238
01:18:04.701 --> 01:18:07.640
Why don't you guys send me lists if you guys in those colder cities,

1239
01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:11.990
just because that seems to be where they only put those,
those beers out,

1240
01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:17.200
those seasonal beers that come out,
man,
a fucking unbelievable.
Um,

1241
01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.630
Jesus Christ.
Am I going to be able to make it to the Rose Bowl?

1242
01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:24.580
I'm actually contemplating not drinking at the Rose Bowl and this year rather

1243
01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:26.960
than,
than going with up with one other drunk buddy.

1244
01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:29.510
I'm going with two other three other,

1245
01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:34.220
I got a crew of four and uh,
I don't know.

1246
01:18:34.221 --> 01:18:37.400
For some reason I want to see if I can go 100 days.
I know I can,

1247
01:18:38.540 --> 01:18:42.230
but I got to admit,
man,
I was in Seattle was fucking really difficult,

1248
01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:46.100
really difficult.
But every day,
every day you wake up when you didn't drink,

1249
01:18:46.101 --> 01:18:50.520
the night before you wake up,
you feel good.
You know,
you work out,

1250
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:52.940
you go down,
you get yourself a juice.

1251
01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:56.780
You sit there stone sober.

1252
01:18:57.170 --> 01:19:00.920
Don't have any good stories to tell because you didn't fucking do anything the

1253
01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:03.440
night before.
And you sit there bored shitless with the,

1254
01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:06.560
but you have the exact same brain cells you had the night before.
People,

1255
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:13.390
I think the level of brain cells you have left is it is exactly equal to the

1256
01:19:14.181 --> 01:19:18.020
amount of fun that you had in life.
It's a theory I just came up with.
You know,

1257
01:19:19.370 --> 01:19:22.910
if you have half your brain cells left,
you enjoyed half of your life.

1258
01:19:25.490 --> 01:19:28.970
A fucking makes no sense.
But you know what I mean.
All right,

1259
01:19:28.971 --> 01:19:30.890
let's stop talking about booze.
Cause I swear to God,

1260
01:19:30.891 --> 01:19:33.350
I still have one of those Murphy's stout in the fucking roof.

1261
01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:34.850
I keep leaving in there.

1262
01:19:34.851 --> 01:19:37.580
I can't get myself to dump it down the sink because it's such a good beer,

1263
01:19:37.581 --> 01:19:38.414
you know?

1264
01:19:38.470 --> 01:19:41.480
And I keep thinking that some friend out here that I don't really have is going

1265
01:19:41.481 --> 01:19:45.650
to come swinging by.
Would you like a bear?
I'm going to pour it to him.
Hands.

1266
01:19:45.651 --> 01:19:50.510
Fucking trembling.
Like a Goddamn crack addict.
Um,
anyways,
overrated.

1267
01:19:50.511 --> 01:19:54.170
Underrated for the week here.
Um,
all right.

1268
01:19:54.171 --> 01:19:58.400
Overrated laptops.
Uh,
the batteries fucked after a month.

1269
01:19:58.401 --> 01:20:01.700
So when you move to scratch your ass,
you'd delete half of your work.

1270
01:20:01.730 --> 01:20:04.850
Isn't that the fucking truth?
Um,
underrated.

1271
01:20:04.851 --> 01:20:08.130
Throwing snowballs on cars are at cars.

1272
01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:12.510
No easier way to get your ass kicked.
Wow.

1273
01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:15.600
Now there's something to do if you're not drinking and you still want an

1274
01:20:15.601 --> 01:20:17.920
adrenaline,
adrenaline rush,
you know,

1275
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.330
you remember that as a kid when he threw a snowball at a car and you got him

1276
01:20:21.331 --> 01:20:26.331
real good and the guy slammed on his brakes and fucking pulled over that fucking

1277
01:20:26.641 --> 01:20:31.620
adrenaline rush as you turned around and your snow suit and your big stupid

1278
01:20:31.621 --> 01:20:36.390
boots trying to run in like a foot of snow that actually comes up to mid thigh

1279
01:20:36.391 --> 01:20:40.470
because you're so small.
Oh Man,
that was fun.

1280
01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:42.990
That was a good fucking time back in the day.

1281
01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:46.620
That's another reason why people always think it snowed more when you were a kid

1282
01:20:46.621 --> 01:20:50.130
is because you were a fucking midget walking around in the snow though.

1283
01:20:50.131 --> 01:20:53.670
When I was a kid,
we used to have snow storms,
eh,
would come up to your waist,

1284
01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:55.680
you know?
Yeah.
Dude,

1285
01:20:55.710 --> 01:20:59.670
you are for you five fucking years old.

1286
01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:03.210
Remember that Shit,
you're knocked out your front teeth on your dad's shoes.

1287
01:21:03.270 --> 01:21:07.110
You will little you dumb.
Fuck.
Um,
all right.

1288
01:21:08.430 --> 01:21:12.450
Overrated coffee houses.
This guy says,
I can't stand these places.

1289
01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:16.390
People show up in their scarves and laptops,
ex,
uh,

1290
01:21:16.490 --> 01:21:18.150
that are exclusively apple.

1291
01:21:18.151 --> 01:21:21.750
May I add and park themselves in a booth for three hours.

1292
01:21:22.170 --> 01:21:24.000
You go in and get a coffee.
You have to stumble,

1293
01:21:24.030 --> 01:21:28.410
stumble through some college kids project than stand in the longest line known

1294
01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:30.150
demand.
All the while listening,

1295
01:21:30.151 --> 01:21:33.690
some mellow hippie with a beard playing his acoustic guitar.

1296
01:21:33.930 --> 01:21:36.360
Is it just me or do these places stink?

1297
01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:42.990
Um,
I think they do stink.
You know,
I just heard some laughter downstairs.

1298
01:21:42.991 --> 01:21:45.720
I wonder if they're actually listening to the podcast or they're laughing at how

1299
01:21:45.721 --> 01:21:50.100
unfunny the shit is.
Um,
and then I have one here,
underrated Seahawks fans.

1300
01:21:50.130 --> 01:21:54.330
I got a whole new fucking respect for those people to share on that God awful

1301
01:21:54.331 --> 01:21:55.470
fucking performance.

1302
01:21:55.740 --> 01:22:00.270
They hung in there right to the fucking end and a lot of them were pissed at the

1303
01:22:00.271 --> 01:22:04.530
end of the game when with like a minute left,
they just took a knee,
you know,

1304
01:22:04.531 --> 01:22:07.650
for the last two or three fucking plays.
Even though you're down by 20 points,

1305
01:22:07.651 --> 01:22:08.730
can you go down swinging?

1306
01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:13.890
I'll tell you that's that Pete Carroll ball standing up there in his fucking

1307
01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:19.050
Docker's.
Huh?
That fucking that.
You know what he's like?

1308
01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:21.750
He's like in the coach's witness protection program.

1309
01:22:21.910 --> 01:22:26.490
It's kind of like what he did.
It's like the shit hit the fan.
He's Henry Hill,

1310
01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:30.330
he's the Henry Hill.
I'm like Paul Versey.
He's Henry Hill.
He's dude,

1311
01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:34.410
he's the Henry Hale a fucking coaches look at is contagious now.

1312
01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:36.990
He really is though.

1313
01:22:38.250 --> 01:22:42.720
He got all the glory at USC and then the second the show,
he told Sanchez,

1314
01:22:42.721 --> 01:22:46.200
he left too early and made all this big fucking speech and then the second the

1315
01:22:46.201 --> 01:22:49.500
shit went down and people start talking about Reggie Bush and all this other

1316
01:22:49.501 --> 01:22:51.900
bullshit.
He just fucking skips town.

1317
01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:57.720
Has he even commented on it or did he pull that bullshit where they just look,

1318
01:22:57.930 --> 01:22:59.610
I'm here to coach the Seattle Seahawks.

1319
01:22:59.850 --> 01:23:03.300
If you have some Seattle Seahawks questions,
I'll be happy to answer those.

1320
01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:08.150
Anything else?
I'm not answering
that is all in the past.

1321
01:23:08.510 --> 01:23:12.890
But glob of Boba Ball.
Did he do that bull shit,
son of a bitch.

1322
01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:17.030
Oh Big [inaudible] fucking flames out and this has nothing to do with Seahawks

1323
01:23:17.031 --> 01:23:17.330
fans.

1324
01:23:17.330 --> 01:23:22.140
I hope he flames out in Seattle and then he goes back with his tail between his

1325
01:23:22.141 --> 01:23:26.220
legs.
Right.
It goes back to the college coaching level.

1326
01:23:26.340 --> 01:23:29.820
He'll probably get a coaching job in the SCC.
Right?

1327
01:23:30.230 --> 01:23:33.810
And we all know that the SEC has the best fucking teams.

1328
01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:37.530
It's got the bets coaching and it's got the best players and I don't think that

1329
01:23:37.531 --> 01:23:40.200
he can fucking stand up to the fucking sec conference.

1330
01:23:40.201 --> 01:23:44.820
He was out there in the PAC 10 a bunch of Goddamn pansies out there other than

1331
01:23:45.430 --> 01:23:48.300
Jim Harbaugh bar over the fuck you say his name.
Captain come back there.

1332
01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:53.710
That fucking guy can coach.
There is a guy who should go to the pros.

1333
01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:56.770
Pete Carroll,
when you make a good play,
he goes,

1334
01:23:58.160 --> 01:23:58.420
<v 9>Woo.</v>

1335
01:23:58.420 --> 01:24:02.560
<v 8>Do you ever seen that?
Like fucking ric flair.
But it's not funny.
I remember that.</v>

1336
01:24:02.561 --> 01:24:03.790
I haven't,
does he still do that shit?

1337
01:24:03.791 --> 01:24:05.680
I remember that back when he used to coach the Patriots,

1338
01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:08.910
they'd score a touchdown.
They cut to him on the sideline,
you know,

1339
01:24:08.911 --> 01:24:11.440
all the fat fuck defensive coordinators are like,
ah,

1340
01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:14.040
like they just murdered somebody got that look,

1341
01:24:14.041 --> 01:24:17.280
a rage on their face at the play work and Pete would be in the middle with his

1342
01:24:17.530 --> 01:24:18.720
hand straight up in the air and just go on.
Yeah.

1343
01:24:20.050 --> 01:24:20.883
<v 9>Woo.</v>

1344
01:24:20.890 --> 01:24:24.890
<v 8>And I was just like,
this guy's up pussy.
Yeah.
Then he went to the,</v>

1345
01:24:24.891 --> 01:24:28.220
you went to the fucking,
uh,
Trojans and I was like,
all right,
maybe I was wrong.

1346
01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:31.730
Maybe I was wrong about this guy.
Turns out I was right.

1347
01:24:33.710 --> 01:24:36.410
Go back down to the college level with your fucking dockers.

1348
01:24:38.010 --> 01:24:42.900
You fucking Richie Cunningham
coming out there,
you know,

1349
01:24:44.620 --> 01:24:48.490
dress like you're going to host an am radio show.
That's it.

1350
01:24:48.491 --> 01:24:52.050
That's how you fucking leave.
Yeah.
Team to battle.

1351
01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:55.950
I can understand if you're a fat fuck like Rex Ryan,

1352
01:24:55.951 --> 01:24:59.010
he had to wear those soccer moms stretchy pants.
I don't understand that shit.

1353
01:24:59.130 --> 01:25:02.870
I don't understand that shit.
In a second.
Sheeran's shape.
Pete Carroll.

1354
01:25:03.780 --> 01:25:06.600
What the fuck are you know something?
I,
you know what kind of pants coaches were,

1355
01:25:06.660 --> 01:25:10.620
but I know they're not those.
What are you going to a fucking sock hop?

1356
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:15.260
Oh my God.
You know,
to have money on that fucking guy.

1357
01:25:15.261 --> 01:25:18.980
If they show me the pants that they're coaching staff was going to fucking where

1358
01:25:18.981 --> 01:25:23.720
I would have put money on the chiefs who fucked me when they played the bills.

1359
01:25:24.170 --> 01:25:25.850
I was kidding.
Who?
I don't know how to gamble.

1360
01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:29.630
Thank God Paul Versey doesn't either.
I'm actually still two games ahead of him.

1361
01:25:31.130 --> 01:25:33.800
I'm only saying that because I know he's listening to this shit at this point.

1362
01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:36.530
Um,
all right,
Paul Versey by the way.

1363
01:25:36.531 --> 01:25:41.420
Absolutely fucking destroyed growing by leaps and bounds.
You know,

1364
01:25:41.610 --> 01:25:44.630
he's jumped out of the little stand up nest.
He's flapping his wings.

1365
01:25:44.631 --> 01:25:48.050
He didn't hit the ground.
I think this one's going to make it,
you know,

1366
01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:51.560
you know comedians are,
when we start off,
you ever see those things when like a,

1367
01:25:51.561 --> 01:25:52.970
the little turtles hatch,

1368
01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:56.040
you ever see them on the discovery channel and then you,

1369
01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:59.450
they start fucking going down the beach,
those cute little turtles,

1370
01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:04.610
those fucking birds come in and swoop up like 90% of them and only 2% make it

1371
01:26:04.611 --> 01:26:09.090
out to the water.
Right.
Okay.
That's where [inaudible] is right now.

1372
01:26:09.091 --> 01:26:12.150
He's not in the water.
He's not on the beach.
It's getting a little wet

1373
01:26:14.690 --> 01:26:15.840
and you want the birds are,

1374
01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:18.210
those are the broads in your life that don't support yet.

1375
01:26:18.670 --> 01:26:19.503
<v 10>Yeah.</v>

1376
01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:24.940
<v 8>Just fucking scoop you up in your fucking dreams and they fly away with you.</v>

1377
01:26:25.390 --> 01:26:28.260
Hate your fucking soul.
Bill,

1378
01:26:28.261 --> 01:26:33.150
do you have anything positive to say about women?
Um,

1379
01:26:33.180 --> 01:26:36.540
yes.
Yes I do.
Yes I do.

1380
01:26:36.750 --> 01:26:40.680
I sat next to a pretty lady on the plane yesterday,

1381
01:26:41.490 --> 01:26:46.250
know just a beautiful girl.
Cleavage half a titty.

1382
01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:51.730
Okay.
But a nice steady,
you know what I mean?
Not Obnoxious,
Nice Healthy B Cup.

1383
01:26:52.660 --> 01:26:54.130
Just sitting there.
I just made you,
you know,

1384
01:26:56.130 --> 01:26:58.440
just something nice to look at during the turbulence.
Like,
you know,

1385
01:26:58.441 --> 01:26:59.950
it's not all bad.
Yeah.

1386
01:27:00.330 --> 01:27:03.850
Fact that this plane's probably going to crash it because it's a jet.

1387
01:27:03.851 --> 01:27:04.840
When the engine's cut out,

1388
01:27:04.841 --> 01:27:08.930
you can't even glide is tendencies actually to just turn over.
And I'm like,

1389
01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:12.570
should we be hanging from my fucking seatbelt?
You know,

1390
01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:17.580
with some fucking free peanuts stuck to my face.
If we're pulling four g's,

1391
01:27:17.581 --> 01:27:21.280
going back to mother earth,
you know,
if I have the neck muscles,

1392
01:27:21.281 --> 01:27:26.110
maybe I can glance over at that cleavage right before we fucking enter the

1393
01:27:26.111 --> 01:27:29.860
fucking ground.
Jesus Christ bill.
Um,
you know what I'm doing on my end?

1394
01:27:29.870 --> 01:27:33.840
I'm not even listening to what the fuck I'm saying.
Oh,
you know,
it was great.

1395
01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:37.170
Was uh,
we actually got hooked up with tickets.

1396
01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:41.690
What we were supposed to be hooked up with tickets to the Seattle game.
You know,

1397
01:27:42.130 --> 01:27:44.860
it's just one of those things.
You have to have a friend who just says,
Oh yeah,

1398
01:27:44.861 --> 01:27:48.510
dude,
I can fucking hook you up.
I got,
I got the tickets.

1399
01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:50.460
Don't you worry about it.
Right.

1400
01:27:50.461 --> 01:27:54.840
And then you show up and then not there and you just realized that the guys all

1401
01:27:54.841 --> 01:27:59.100

I'm just fucking,

1402
01:27:59.101 --> 01:28:01.290

We had a good time,

1403
01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:05.190

They're in Seattle.
You know what it was.

1405
01:28:10.461 --> 01:28:13.670
They were too busy laughing at Carroll.
Carolyn,

1406
01:28:13.671 --> 01:28:17.560
As they walked down the [inaudible] down the fucking hall that they actually
got,

1407
01:28:17.561 --> 01:28:20.890
they got us two tickets for next week.

01:28:22.620 --> 01:28:26.720
I Dunno if I should do this,

Eat Up some time.

1422
01:29:16.141 --> 01:29:21.141
My girlfriend's a coochie kind of smells like a the inside of my gym sneaker and

01:29:22.381 --> 01:29:27.300
I was wondering how I,

1429
01:29:48.391 --> 01:29:51.030

1432
01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:06.690
Airbag prank,

1434
01:30:10.350 --> 01:30:13.230
Let's look at the Seattle DVD order cause I thought I asked for three.

1435
01:30:14.850 --> 01:30:18.900
I have confirmed the tracking KT date,

That's the podcast for this week.
God bless all of you.
Thanks for listening.

1438
01:30:27.190 --> 01:30:30.840
I thought it had an advice one here.
Uh,
thank you for your contributions.

1439
01:30:30.841 --> 01:30:34.440
I hope you guys all had a really nice Thanksgiving and merry thanksgiving.

1440
01:30:34.650 --> 01:30:37.350
I hope you have a merry Christmas.
You're going to start your shopping.

1441
01:30:38.010 --> 01:30:40.350
That's something I could talk about.
I haven't started my shopping yet.

1442
01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:44.970
I met that weird age where,
uh,
you know,

1443
01:30:44.971 --> 01:30:47.760
I don't have any fucking kids so I don't have to do that.

1444
01:30:48.690 --> 01:30:52.200
All my friends are too fucking old.
What am I going to buy them?
You know,

1445
01:30:52.830 --> 01:30:57.360
we're at the Cologne in new shirt age.
Uh,

1446
01:30:58.140 --> 01:31:01.140
you know,
everyone in my family has their own fucking lives.

1447
01:31:01.141 --> 01:31:03.510
They have their own soul.
My overhead is really not that high.

1448
01:31:04.980 --> 01:31:09.300
All I gotta do is just buy something for my girl and I'm done and I'm done.

1449
01:31:10.090 --> 01:31:14.460
You know,
you don't actually,
I'm thinking of getting her is uh,

1450
01:31:15.030 --> 01:31:20.030
I was driving by Arby's the other night and I saw on underneath the sign that

1451
01:31:20.431 --> 01:31:24.660
they have these Christmas gift packs and a,
it's this booklet.

1452
01:31:25.230 --> 01:31:27.560
It's really cool because they have like everything,

1453
01:31:27.570 --> 01:31:31.680
like coupons for everything on their menu at a discount because a,

1454
01:31:31.681 --> 01:31:35.160
you know what,
if she doesn't want one of those awful roast beef sandwiches,

1455
01:31:35.161 --> 01:31:38.520
maybe she just wanted to go,
go in there and get the fucking,
the uh,

1456
01:31:38.521 --> 01:31:40.020
the onion rings,
you know?

1457
01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:44.820
Wouldn't that be awesome to do that just as a fuck you

1458
01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:48.850
to the,
to the pressure of,
of,

1459
01:31:48.860 --> 01:31:51.330
of getting something nice for the woman in your life.
It just,

1460
01:31:51.331 --> 01:31:55.680
one year you just went out and just bought her a gift like that.

1461
01:31:57.870 --> 01:32:00.940
How do you think your girl would read out why you can't go that you can't go

1462
01:32:00.941 --> 01:32:04.420
that low?
Because that's like insulting.
You can't get her a fucking coupon,

1463
01:32:04.690 --> 01:32:06.100
but you know,
it gets to the point like,

1464
01:32:06.101 --> 01:32:08.220
how much fucking money do I got to spend on you?

1465
01:32:09.660 --> 01:32:12.830
You know what if you bought it like a really nice bathrobe,

1466
01:32:14.130 --> 01:32:17.160
you know that's something she can wear every day when she gets out of the shower

1467
01:32:17.161 --> 01:32:20.760
really nice and comfy and you give it to her and she thinks like,
Ooh,

1468
01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:25.290
this is just one of the buildup gifts.
And it's like no,
that,
that is the gift.

1469
01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:28.690
That is the one,
there it is.

1470
01:32:29.930 --> 01:32:31.400
Merry Christmas.

1471
01:32:32.730 --> 01:32:37.410
You know that it will be a great thing just to,
you know best I know something.

1472
01:32:37.411 --> 01:32:39.660
That's a great idea.
If you actually got her something really nice,

1473
01:32:39.661 --> 01:32:42.120
do something like that.
Just act like this.

1474
01:32:42.121 --> 01:32:45.000
No other gifts and then just watch her stewing and,

1475
01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:49.820
and figuring out how to play it.
You know,
because she's mad at you.

1476
01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:54.840
All right cause you didn't get her something good enough but she has to play it

1477
01:32:54.841 --> 01:32:58.920
right because if she flips out too much she's going to look selfish,
you know,

1478
01:32:59.100 --> 01:33:01.560
because she,
cause she has to be honestly sitting there thinking like,

1479
01:33:01.561 --> 01:33:05.190
well wait a minute.
What if he really thought that this is enough?
You know,

1480
01:33:05.260 --> 01:33:09.530
how rude of it would it be for me to be giving you shit?

1481
01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:14.310
Oh,
wait a minute.
Wow.
I just had a flashback.

1482
01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:22.120
I just had a flash drive one time.
Oh my God.
One time.

1483
01:33:22.810 --> 01:33:27.190
One of my first girlfriends.
Right.
I grew up with all brothers.
Right.

1484
01:33:27.550 --> 01:33:31.240
I don't mean black people.
I mean that uh,
siblings and uh,

1485
01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:35.830
and I had a,
so I didn't know shit about women,
you know,

1486
01:33:36.340 --> 01:33:39.400
and a lot of you who are listening,
it's probably still think I don't.
So anyways,

1487
01:33:39.401 --> 01:33:43.300
my first girlfriend,
I went to buy her something for her birthday.

1488
01:33:43.301 --> 01:33:47.650
What the fuck did I get here?
I was on the road and it was no,

1489
01:33:47.651 --> 01:33:50.110
so I was on the road is already a comedian.
This wasn't my first Mike,

1490
01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:56.060
this is my second serious girlfriend.
I was like 25 years old,

1491
01:33:56.061 --> 01:34:01.061
24 25 and that was in the mall and I bought her this shirt.

1492
01:34:02.230 --> 01:34:05.560
Was there a birthday and I swear to God,
I think it was one of those,
you know,

1493
01:34:05.561 --> 01:34:09.490
those polo style shirts,
I bought her one of those and it was like striped.

1494
01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:14.640
I got a two of them and I wrapped him up and she was all excited.

1495
01:34:14.930 --> 01:34:19.220
She was just complete fucking psycho that I was dating.
As I told you before,

1496
01:34:19.370 --> 01:34:22.610
you know what the deal is when somebody is dating his psycho and you're sitting

1497
01:34:22.611 --> 01:34:24.710
there going,
why are they dating this fucking person?

1498
01:34:24.711 --> 01:34:28.890
You know why all psychos are good in bed.

1499
01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:33.090
At least everyone that I ever met,
not only they had good and bad,

1500
01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:36.190
they're fucking unbelievable in bed.
All right?

1501
01:34:37.290 --> 01:34:40.330
So I'm sitting there like I,
you know,

1502
01:34:40.590 --> 01:34:44.070
I dunno why I didn't I just ask a woman,
just get help me out here.

1503
01:34:44.260 --> 01:34:47.830
But I basically bought or what I would have bought my older brother.

1504
01:34:50.290 --> 01:34:54.610
So,
and this is the thing,
I hadn't had a girlfriend a couple of fucking years,

1505
01:34:55.780 --> 01:34:56.600
uh,
you know,

1506
01:34:56.600 --> 01:35:00.140
just one of periods while I was just focusing on becoming a comedian.

1507
01:35:01.370 --> 01:35:02.750
And I don't even think I was really even,
whoa.

1508
01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:07.780
I went to a fucking dry spell an 18th month fucking not hooking up nothing.

1509
01:35:09.140 --> 01:35:11.420
So this girl says,
psycho comes into my life.

1510
01:35:11.421 --> 01:35:16.370
So I buy are these two fucking izod looking shirts that you know,

1511
01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:22.580
a married father with three with three fucking kids would be pissed if he got

1512
01:35:22.670 --> 01:35:24.830
there and I gave it to this disco was fucking hot too,
right.

1513
01:35:24.831 --> 01:35:28.390
And I gave it to her and she's all excited and it professionally wrapped.

1514
01:35:28.391 --> 01:35:31.610
That's the one thing I did.
So she's thinking it's going to be something nice.

1515
01:35:31.611 --> 01:35:35.930
And she goes and she fucking unwraps this damn thing.
And uh,

1516
01:35:38.210 --> 01:35:40.280
she opened it up and she just like,

1517
01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:45.590
and I was standing up and I was so fucking nervous and she just goes like,
what?

1518
01:35:46.430 --> 01:35:51.110
She's like,
what?
What,
what is this,
what you'd be bought me this,
this.

1519
01:35:51.111 --> 01:35:53.660
And she starts holding department.
She's like,
this is stupid.

1520
01:35:54.050 --> 01:35:57.020
She kind of like threw it down.
I came out with the fuck,
she said,

1521
01:35:57.170 --> 01:36:02.170
all I remember was by the end of it I was sitting and she was standing and she

1522
01:36:02.541 --> 01:36:05.120
was fucking like,
I was getting scolded like a child.

1523
01:36:05.380 --> 01:36:07.640
You're like your first girlfriend when your first relationship or whatever.

1524
01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:10.610
You just think of the dumb shit that you did.
It's like my second one,

1525
01:36:10.611 --> 01:36:12.830
but I'm such a moron.
I had to learn this shit over again.

1526
01:36:13.010 --> 01:36:18.010
I was just sitting there getting fucking scolded for like 10 minutes about this

1527
01:36:18.951 --> 01:36:22.790
awful fucking,
admittedly it was awful,
but what the fuck?

1528
01:36:23.630 --> 01:36:27.680
You know what kind of a fucking cunt would do that?

1529
01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:30.800
I don't have any data like fucking two months,
but she,

1530
01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:35.920
I sat there like this sad kid getting scolded and it was one of those things

1531
01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:41.740
where our w the only reason why I sat there was cause I was so embarrassed and I

1532
01:36:42.021 --> 01:36:45.080
didn't have a lot of experience with women and all I want to do,

1533
01:36:45.081 --> 01:36:46.340
I wanted to crawl out of there.

1534
01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:49.640
It felt like the way it felt the first time I bombed doing jokes,

1535
01:36:49.641 --> 01:36:50.630
that's how bad it felt.

1536
01:36:51.110 --> 01:36:56.110
And then as she got to the end of her 10 minute fucking tirade about how bad

1537
01:36:57.471 --> 01:36:58.640
this fucking gift was,

1538
01:36:58.850 --> 01:37:02.960
that's when I started getting my feet underneath me,

1539
01:37:04.070 --> 01:37:09.070
where finally the shame and the embarrassment had gone away because she just

1540
01:37:09.831 --> 01:37:13.490
gave me shit for so long that I was actually able to regroup.
And I was like,

1541
01:37:13.491 --> 01:37:17.330
wait a minute.
I don't even think I yelled at her.

1542
01:37:17.570 --> 01:37:20.150
I just remembered that switch in my head.
Just went,
you know what?

1543
01:37:20.151 --> 01:37:24.310
Fuck this person next.
And uh,

1544
01:37:24.350 --> 01:37:27.890
later on that night she actually called me up and apologize was just like,
yeah,

1545
01:37:27.891 --> 01:37:31.580
listen.
Um,
I,

1546
01:37:32.350 --> 01:37:35.510
I probably shouldn't have said that and an hour and I was totally passive

1547
01:37:35.511 --> 01:37:38.000
aggressive.
No,
no,
it's fine.
No,
it's cool.
You know,
you know,

1548
01:37:38.001 --> 01:37:40.100
back then when you don't know how to get out of a relationship,
I don't know.

1549
01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:44.000
It's too,
that's cool.
So you want to come see me tonight?
Ah,

1550
01:37:44.001 --> 01:37:48.440
actually I got to a,
I got to fix the toilet,
uh,

1551
01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:49.810
fucking clean off the stove.

1552
01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:54.770
My brother's coming to town and gave her like every fucking excuse and I uh,

1553
01:37:55.970 --> 01:37:59.410
yeah,
I basically in a coward way,
just sort of back my way out of this.

1554
01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:01.080
Is that all that happened?
Oh No,
wait.

1555
01:38:01.081 --> 01:38:02.790
I remember how I remember how I got out of it,

1556
01:38:02.791 --> 01:38:05.500
but I can't tell you cause it's fucking horrific and uh,

1557
01:38:05.540 --> 01:38:08.790
some stuff is just too personal and I'm gonna leave you at that and we leave you

1558
01:38:08.791 --> 01:38:13.520
fucking hanging.
Fuck you.
It's an hour and one minutes into this podcast,
right?

1559
01:38:13.580 --> 01:38:15.330
It was this one loud enough for you.
I hope it was.

1560
01:38:15.331 --> 01:38:16.890
Now people are gonna say it was too fucking loud.

1561
01:38:17.100 --> 01:38:20.520
So that's the podcast for this week.

1564

That's the podcast for this week.
In two weeks.

1583
01:39:40.371 --> 01:39:43.430
I'm going to be at the Improv in Bray,
California.

1584
01:39:44.370 --> 01:39:48.420
So for all you people out here asking me when the fuck I'm going to be in Bray

1585
01:39:48.421 --> 01:39:51.410
California,
there you go.

1587
01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:58.010
Then I'm all my Christmas break where I stare at my bulls.
Um,

1588
01:39:59.340 --> 01:40:00.430
and then,
um,

1589
01:40:01.590 --> 01:40:06.060
I'm doing the Borgata in Atlantic City and uh,
we,

1590
01:40:06.061 --> 01:40:09.580
we sold out that show in 30 hours.
Hopefully they're going to add a second show.

1591
01:40:09.700 --> 01:40:12.580
It'd be great if you guys called up and asked them to add a second show and then

1592
01:40:12.581 --> 01:40:15.270
they could,
but that show is a,

1593
01:40:15.271 --> 01:40:20.010
that's the Miami heat comedy show is home branding it.
It's Jim Norton,

1594
01:40:21.060 --> 01:40:25.380
Jim Breuer,
David,
tell and myself,
how the fuck do you not add a second show?

1595
01:40:25.770 --> 01:40:29.940
How do you as a comedy fan not call up the Borgata right now and be like,
dude,

1596
01:40:29.941 --> 01:40:30.840

1597
01:40:31.740 --> 01:40:35.850
Add a second show or I'm coming down there and I'm taking my dick out and I'm

1598
01:40:35.851 --> 01:40:39.240
running through your fucking casino.
Uh,
all right,
that's it.

1599
01:40:39.241 --> 01:40:41.700
I've really overstayed my welcome.
That's the podcast for this week.
