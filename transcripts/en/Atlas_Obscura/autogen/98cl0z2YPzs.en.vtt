00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.920
- What I see when I look
at the rectal tool kit

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.560
is a great example of problem solving

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.770
in the intelligence world.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.060
Technology is designed
to fix hard problems.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.090
My name is Dr. Vince Houghton.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.380
I'm the historian and curator here

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.280
at the International Spy Museum.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.840
The International Spy Museum
has the largest public display

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.590
of espionage artifacts
anywhere in the world.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.200
From time to time, I'll
see visitors looking

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.910
at our escape and evasion case,

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.380
which is all the tools to help you get out

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.650
of a bad situation.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.100
And you can just watch their eyes

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.930
as they go from artifact to artifact,

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.820
until they lock on to the rectal tool kit.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.140
It's almost like you can
see their brain working,

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.830
and then the light bulb pops:

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.123
"Are you kidding me?"

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.290
What I have in my hand is a
CIA-issued rectal tool kit,

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.333
given to CIA officers during
the height of the cold war.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.270
The materials that rectal
tool kits are made of

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.680
vary to a degree.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.220
But you want to make sure
that you have a material

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.030
that does not have the
chance of having sharp edges

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.850
or any kind of splintering effect,

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.630
because of the sensitive
places that we're putting this.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.810
It also has to be finely machined.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.830
The seals have to be very tight,

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.000
not only to prevent things from seeping

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.810
into the actual tool kit itself,

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.105
but also so that you don't
have any kind of sharp edges

00:01:23.105 --> 00:01:25.540
or ridges that could possibly injure you

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.690
when you're using this
particular artifact.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.530
What the tool kit allows them to do

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.080
is have on hand ways to get them

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.170
out of a bad situation:

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.380
to pick a lock, to drill
your way through a door,

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.830
to kind of carve your way
to make a small tunnel.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.730
Think of all the different ways

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.080
that you could maybe
break out of a jail cell,

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.010
like the things that people
might bake into a cake.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.857
Well, these are all encompassed
inside this tool kit

00:01:49.857 --> 00:01:52.300
because guards are
gonna put you in a place

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.437
and say, "Oh, the door's locked,

00:01:53.437 --> 00:01:54.417
we don't have to really pay a lot

00:01:54.417 --> 00:01:55.430
of attention to this guy,"

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.680
because they don't think that
you have these tools with you.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.130
And if you do, you have a huge advantage.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.100
These people who work
in intelligence agencies

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.460
building these gadgets

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.540
are given some impossible tasks.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.773
And they're trying to figure out ways

00:02:06.773 --> 00:02:09.960
to solve the impossible problem.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.080
So this is a great
indication of that, right?

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.030
You present a problem,

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.060
say, if our guy's captured
and he's searched,

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.610
let's say he's strip-searched,

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.180
how do we provide him with the tools

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.010
to help him escape from
this terrible situation?

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.500
Well, there's your rectal tool kit.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.667
And sometimes, this is a
matter of life and death.
