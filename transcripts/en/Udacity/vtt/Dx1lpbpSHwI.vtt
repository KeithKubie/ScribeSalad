00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
All right. Let's look at the answer.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Here's a particular graph where all the nodes are of even degree.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Let's see what happens when we try to follow an Eulerian path.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Let's just pick any node to start--say E--and go to C.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
There are some choices here. Let's follow an edge back to B.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Then maybe to D to C to A to B and to E.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So it looks like we were able to hit all of the edges exactly once.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This graph does have an Eulerian path.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
But there's something very special about that path,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and that it is started at E and it ended with E.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Because the path actually started and ended at the same node,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
that node should have even degree,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
because each time we go into we come out,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
except for the first time where we go out but then the last time we come back in.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Everything matches up and you end up with even degree.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
This is a special kind of Eulerian path called an "Eulerian Tour."

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
"To tour" in the sense that we start off in our home city,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and we go around, we visit lots of things, and we come back to our home city.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We kind of did a tour of the graph, and it was very scenic.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
That's an Eulerian Tour.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
This first answer is definitely not correct.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Such a graph can have an Eulerian path.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
No, it doesn't depend on the graph.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It turns out that this is going to be fine no matter what,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
because we're going to end up starting and ending at the same node.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We could have actually started and ended on any of the nodes

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and it would've worked out the same way. All such graphs do.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
All graphs that have only even degree nodes do have Eulerian paths,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
specifically Eulerian Tours, but it's not the case that all such graphs do.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Let's make a quick example graph just so that you can see it.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
For this to work we need to have a graph where more than two of the nodes has odd degree.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Let's make one where four of the nodes has odd degree.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
We have these four nodes--F, G, H, and I.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Let's make it so that each of them has odd degree.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Now they all have even degree. Now two of them have odd degree.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
If we connect these two guys, then they have odd degree as well.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
All the nodes have odd degree. It's not just 0 or 2.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
All of them have degree of 3.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Let's see what happens when we try to make an Eulerian path.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
We'll pick some node like I.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
We'll go I to G, G to F, F to I, I to H, H to F, and now we hit a dead end.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Maybe we didn't want to do that. Let's instead go H to G where we also hit a dead end.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
In fact, you can do this all day long, and what you're going to discover

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
is there's always going to be at least one edge that you just can't visit,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
because again, each node in this case has an odd degree.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Every part of the path has to come into the node and out of it,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
so it has to have even degree except for the endpoint.

00:02:21.000 --> 09:59:59.000
No matter what we're going to be stuck.
