00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:06.450
- All right, good
evening, everyone.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.850
My name's Anthony Brooks.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.170
I do political
reporting with WBUR.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.050
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:12.950
Thank you.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.210
Thank you for that.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.434
Thank you for
coming out tonight.

00:00:16.434 --> 00:00:18.350
I know this is going to
be a great discussion.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.410
My job is to
introduce the panel,

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.810
but first I want to
acknowledge Radcliffe

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.220
for hosting this event and say
a couple of things about that.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.970
So we're meeting in a
really fitting location.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.240
This is, as many of you probably
know, the former Radcliffe

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.690
College gymnasium, where
generations of female athletes

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.780
played basketball, hung from
ropes from those rafters,

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.610
ran around that track.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.630
And today, the building
is the Knafel Center,

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.050
which is the central meeting
place of the Radcliffe

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.970
Institute for Advanced Study.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.610
And the Radcliffe Institute
is Harvard's Institute

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.630
for Advanced Study dedicated
to sharing transformative ideas

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.850
across all disciplines.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.480
Tonight's event is part
of a two year initiative

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.110
that the Institute is
pursuing about citizenship

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.860
in anticipation of the 100th
anniversary of the ratification

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.350
of the 19th Amendment.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.540
That's the one that gave
women the right to vote,

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.125
so it's an important one.

00:01:20.125 --> 00:01:25.830
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.450
One little housekeeping note.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.540
This program is being broadcast
live on Facebook tonight

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.650
by WBUR, and it will be
available in a few weeks

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.610
at Radcliffe.Harvard.edu.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.420
Good.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.730
So, before I
introduce the panel,

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.659
I want to just say a couple of
words sort of how I ended up

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.950
here, because it's sort of
related to what you guys are

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.033
going to be talking about.

00:01:48.033 --> 00:01:51.540
So your moderator this evening,
who I'll introduce in a moment,

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.630
is my colleague Shira
Springer, WBUR sports

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.980
and society reporter.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.270
She asked me if I would
introduce this program,

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.455
and I said, well, OK.

00:01:59.455 --> 00:02:00.330
And she said, no, no.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.038
You'd be perfect.

00:02:01.038 --> 00:02:03.030
You're a reporter.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.520
You're a journalist,
and you're a fan.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.160
And I thought, does she
mean I'm a Red Sox fan?

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.830
Because I'm kind of a
Red Sox fan, but I think

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.870
I'm more of a Red Sox hostage.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.020
That's sort of the way
I think about that,

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.090
and I want to explain that.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.340
And my story is
certainly not unique,

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.920
but I had a grandfather who
was born sort of late 1800s.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.440
He was passionate
about the Red Sox.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.120
He saw them win the
1918 World Series.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.000
That's the last one he saw.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.700
And one of my
earliest memories is

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.240
my grandfather, who was
sort of a repressed Yankee

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.820
who didn't say a lot,
would come to the table,

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.370
and just shake his
head, and say they

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.180
break your heart every day.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.130
This is one of my
earliest memories--

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.090
that my dad, who
was born in 1918,

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.150
the last time at that point that
they had won a World Series,

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.520
spent his entire 82 years
waiting for a World Series

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.570
victory.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.750
Never saw one.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.180
Again, a lot of
us in this region

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.190
have these stories to tell.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.940
We suffered.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.480
It was painful.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.772
And then came Pedro
Martinez and his fellow--

00:03:22.772 --> 00:03:27.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.130
--and his fellow
idiots in 2004 when

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.260
our entire world and really our
entire regional sports identity

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.130
just changed.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.710
It was just
overnight it changed.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.510
I was telling Pedro
just before we

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.120
came up here I have a
21 year old daughter,

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.547
and she's blase
about the Red Sox.

00:03:47.547 --> 00:03:48.880
It's like, dad, they always win.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.940
What's the big deal?

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.188
It's like, how did this happen?

00:03:53.188 --> 00:03:56.260
Anyway, but here's the
point about tonight.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.050
So being a fan, or a hostage,
whatever you want to call it

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.390
for all those years is
significant because it's not

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.030
just about rooting
for your home team,

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.770
because sometimes I didn't.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.050
Sometimes I got really
angry, and I just

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.220
wanted them to lose quickly
so I could stop the pain,

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.089
but this sort of unrequested
involvement with the Red Sox

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.321
brought with it an
opportunity to think

00:04:18.321 --> 00:04:19.779
about a whole bunch
of other things

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:21.347
that had nothing to
do with baseball.

00:04:21.347 --> 00:04:22.930
I mean, something
to do with baseball,

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:23.920
but not only baseball.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:29.030
Winning and losing, obviously,
but other more complicated

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.530
things.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.080
The way our country
has changed--

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.610
in the Red Sox case, our
difficult relationship

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.270
with race.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.270
I mean just think about this
week and this whole debate

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.270
about getting rid of
the name of Yawkey Way.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.350
So I'm grateful to have
this team in our midst

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.350
for a lot of reasons,
including the richness

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.850
and complexity of issues that
sports can bring to the fore.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.340
And I'm just going to
tell very quickly one more

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.500
story about the 2004 American
League Championship Series game

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.520
four at Fenway Park, which I
had the total honor of covering

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.140
for NPR.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.290
Now, you all know what
happened, but just in case

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.850
you don't, here's the
quick, quick synopsis.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.820
So the Red Sox were down
three games to nothing

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.230
against the Yankees.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.620
Mariano Rivera is on
the mound, so it's over.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.560
The Red Sox are losing the
game, facing elimination,

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.150
another disappointing season.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.810
Kevin Millar gets the base hit.

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.390
Dave Roberts steals the base.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.040
Bill Miller gets the base hit.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.600
They tie it up.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.080
Extra innings.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.950
Bottom of the 12th, David
Ortiz, winning home.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.900
They win game four.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.490
And you know what
happens after that.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.080
They win seven more games and
finally take the monkey off

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.590
of our backs.

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.910
My job was to cover that game,
and as a good NPR reporter,

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.540
I wanted to get the sound
of the end of the game

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.380
just in case it was
a Boston victory.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.204
I wanted the sound
of Fenway erupting.

00:05:55.204 --> 00:05:57.370
So bottom of the ninth
inning I go out in the stands

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.650
with my microphone,
stand there, and wait.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:00.400
Nothing happens.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.710
Bottom of the 10th, stand
there, nothing happens.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.660
Bottom of the 11th,
nothing happens.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.000
Bottom of the 12th, I'm
there with my microphone

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.830
and up comes David Ortiz.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.100
Boom-- hits the home,
walk off home run.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.750
Fenway comes to its feet.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:14.920
Huge cheer.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.300
My microphone is going.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.060
Yes, I've got the sound.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.110
It's fantastic.

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.200
So I go back to WBUR
to write my story,

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.960
and I start listening
to the tape,

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.760
and I get to that
great moment where

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.970
I'm going to hear 37,000 people
cheering for the Red Sox.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:39.046
The only thing on that
tape is me screaming yeah!

00:06:39.046 --> 00:06:40.990
It's all that I could hear.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.962
So--

00:06:41.962 --> 00:06:46.822
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:46.822 --> 00:06:50.810
So that's the end of the story.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:51.850
So Shira's right.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:52.540
I'm a fan.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.373
I was trying to be a
professional journalist

00:06:54.373 --> 00:06:56.620
that night, but I was a fan.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.490
So now it's my pleasure to
introduce this terrific panel.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.160
So ladies, gentlemen,
will you come up,

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.082
and I'll introduce you all.

00:07:06.082 --> 00:07:10.456
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.690
To my immediate left, Shira
Springer, your moderator

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:23.790
tonight, who invited me here.

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:26.700
So she's WBUR's sports and
society reporter covering

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.630
stories at the intersection
of sports and society,

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.630
and before that, she wrote for
the Boston Globe as the Celtics

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.840
beat writer, then as an
investigative reporter

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.280
and Olympic columnist.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.190
She grew up in Connecticut
cheering for the Hartford

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:44.250
Whalers and the New York Mets?

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.353
Come on, Shira.

00:07:46.353 --> 00:07:48.630
But-- hold on now--

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:51.030
in high school, she saw
the error of her ways.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.520
She took down the pictures of
Keith Hernandez, and Darryl

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.732
Strawberry, and Dwight Gooden,
and she became a Red Sox fan.

00:07:57.732 --> 00:08:02.016
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:02.016 --> 00:08:04.230
To my far left at
the end, Sam Kennedy

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:06.120
has been with the
Red Sox for 17 years.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.880
This is his second year
as president and CEO

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.110
of the Red Sox.

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:11.280
He's a native of Brookline.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.190
He grew up within walking
distance of Fenway Park.

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:17.790
And get this, he was captain
of the Brookline High School

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:21.180
baseball team with his friend
and classmate Theo Epstein.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.816
Is this true?

00:08:22.816 --> 00:08:24.132
- He was our third base coach.

00:08:24.132 --> 00:08:24.840
- That's amazing.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:31.220
To Sam's right, Rebekah
Splaine Salwasser

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.841
is executive director of
the Red Sox foundation,

00:08:33.841 --> 00:08:35.549
which is dedicated to
making a difference

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:37.710
in the lives of children,
families, veterans,

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:38.580
and communities.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.860
She joined the Red
Sox this past January.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.158
Thank you for being here.

00:08:43.158 --> 00:08:47.649
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:48.647 --> 00:08:52.120
And finally, last, but
certainly not least,

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.420
he's a special assistant
to the president

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.990
of baseball operations with
the Red Sox, but most of us

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:02.160
know him simply as one of
baseball's greatest pitchers.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.100
He's a veteran of 18 major
league seasons, seven of them

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:09.000
with the Red Sox,
including that 2004 season.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.130
Thank you for that.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:12.990
He's a three time Cy
Young award winner,

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.510
eight time all-star
hall of famer inducted

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:17.310
into the Hall of
Fame, by the way,

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:20.043
in his first year
of eligibility.

00:09:20.043 --> 00:09:23.424
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:33.084 --> 00:09:36.180
- Thank you, Anthony, for
that very kind introduction,

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.500
and thank you WBUR and
the Radcliffe Institute

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.750
for Advanced Study at Harvard
for hosting this event.

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.470
And of course, I want to thank
the panelists, Pedro, Bekah,

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:46.760
and Sam.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.430
Before we begin, just a
few words about the game

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:50.750
plan for the panel.

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:53.360
This panel will run
for about 50 minutes--

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.400
this discussion-- then
we're going to open it up

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.380
to audience questions.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.020
We will take audience
questions for about 25 minutes.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.840
There will be a microphone
placed in the center aisle,

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.620
and I'll let you know when
it's time to line up for that.

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:08.690
I'm sure there will be lots
of people with questions

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:10.340
for everyone up here.

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.540
And now we're just going to--

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.936
I have some framing
remarks for this panel,

00:10:14.936 --> 00:10:16.310
sort of what went
through my mind

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:19.670
as I thought about what we
wanted to discuss tonight.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:22.730
And I think what's interesting
is baseball looks at itself not

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:27.110
only as America's pastime,
but as a social institution.

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:30.710
And in Boston, probably
more than anywhere else,

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:34.100
it's easy to see baseball
as a social institution,

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:39.930
because, as everyone knows, the
Red Sox are more than a team.

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:44.390
The organization is woven into
the cultural and social fabric

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:47.540
of the city, of New England in
a way that creates, I think,

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:51.080
a sense of belonging and a
sense of community both inside

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.150
and outside of Fenway Park.

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.910
And yes, as Anthony said,
sometimes you can feel like

00:10:55.910 --> 00:11:00.260
a hostage of Red Sox nation, but
I also think that the Red Sox

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.995
ability to create a sense of
belonging with the team with

00:11:03.995 --> 00:11:06.410
the most prominent-- or one
of the most prominent social

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:09.230
institutions in the city--

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:10.160
it begs the question.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.500
You want to know,
how do the Red Sox--

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.890
the executives, their players,
current and past players--

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:18.470
see their roles and
responsibilities

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:19.890
to the community?

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:22.520
And so that's the guiding
question for this discussion,

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.410
one that I hope we'll answer
as we talk about Yawkey Way,

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:30.140
inner baseball initiatives,
building homes in the Dominican

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:35.310
Republic, and ticket prices,
among many other topics.

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:39.950
So I think we have to start
with the most recent news.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:42.080
Yesterday, as many
of you may be aware,

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.780
the Boston Public
Improvement Commission--

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:46.460
a commission I'd
never heard of--

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.196
unanimously voted to
rename Yawkey Way.

00:11:49.196 --> 00:11:51.320
That, as you know, is the
front street-- the street

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.030
in front of Fenway Park.

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:56.930
The Red Sox requested that
the road be changed back

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:58.940
to its original
name, Jersey Street,

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:03.020
because of what many see
as former Red Sox owner

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.386
Tom Yawkey's legacy of racism.

00:12:05.386 --> 00:12:07.010
So I guess I want to
first to you, Sam,

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:08.510
because I know
you've been outspoken

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:10.190
about this in the past.

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:12.170
Why was it important
for the organization

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:14.330
to push for the name
change, and perhaps more

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:17.450
importantly now that
the name change is here,

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:19.340
what message do
you hope that sends

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.710
to fans, to players,
to staff members,

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:24.530
to people who partner
with the Red Sox?

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:27.100
- Well, thanks for the question.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:31.040
I knew we'd dive right
into the topic du jour,

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.080
but let me just first
say it's an honor

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.080
to be here on behalf of the
men and women of the Red Sox

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.360
organization joined
by a few colleagues.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.610
Guys, thanks for
being here, and it's

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:44.450
an honor to share the
stage with Bekah and Pedro.

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:47.299
We have a great
time at Fenway Park,

00:12:47.299 --> 00:12:49.340
and we're lucky to be a
part of the organization.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:52.880
This is my 17th year, and
I'm as energized as ever

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.690
about the present Red
Sox team and our future.

00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:59.360
And I mention future,
because that's

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:04.520
what this whole process and
initiative has been about.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:08.480
It's less about sort
of dwelling on the past

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.870
than some of the negative,
unfortunate, regretful,

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:15.230
reprehensible history
of the Red Sox.

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:17.600
When we arrived in
2002, we were very

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.360
quick to point out the
shameful past with respect

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.310
to race relations.

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:25.220
Simply put, we were the
last team to integrate.

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:29.660
We had a poor record of
hiring not just on the field,

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:31.100
but off the field.

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:34.592
Diversity was a
huge issue for us.

00:13:34.592 --> 00:13:36.050
There were lots of
things that went

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:40.610
on that the organization wasn't
and shouldn't be proud of.

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:45.230
That said, the move to change
or restore Jersey Street

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:48.790
and remove the name Yawkey
Way is really about people

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:50.780
and people's feelings.

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:54.420
When we went around and
talked to our constituents,

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:58.460
whether it was community
leaders, employees frankly,

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:02.240
players, a consistent
refrain that we

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:07.780
heard in the community was,
look, we never knew Tom Yawkey

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:12.830
and never met him in
person, but that symbol

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:15.650
had been a reminder
for many people

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:20.570
that Fenway was not always
the most inclusive welcoming

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:22.220
environment.

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:27.830
And unfortunately,
in 2017, last year,

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:31.650
we were told that we're still
not where we need to be.

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:34.780
And it's just one step.

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:35.800
It is a symbol.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.090
It's a street name.

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:38.777
We don't fool
ourselves and think

00:14:38.777 --> 00:14:40.360
it's going to change
things overnight.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.880
We still need to walk the
walk and do the right thing

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:47.620
with respect to making
Fenway welcoming to everyone,

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:51.010
but for those of us who grew
up in Boston and New England,

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:55.900
like I did, and like
Bekah did, Fenway Park

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:57.850
should be for everyone.

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:00.440
It should be everyone's
team-- the Red Sox--

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.410
not just a certain
group of people.

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:06.580
So this was a step
towards that goal,

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.400
and it's a journey
that that never ends.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.250
You need to keep doing the
right things each and every day,

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:15.790
and we have an ownership group
led by John Henry and Tom

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.950
Werner that are really
committed to making

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:20.152
Fenway welcoming for everybody.

00:15:20.152 --> 00:15:21.610
So that's what this
has been about.

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:24.040
- I'm curious, Pedro, as a
former player and somebody

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.412
who's now still associated
with the organization--

00:15:26.412 --> 00:15:28.120
sort of ambassador
for the organization--

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.490
what did the name
change mean to you?

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:33.447
I mean, how do you view it?

00:15:33.447 --> 00:15:35.030
- Well, thank you
for the opportunity.

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:37.550
Thank you, everybody,
for coming over,

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:42.190
like always, being
loyal and supportive.

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:44.910
I think that's what
he is trying to say

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:47.880
when it comes to the people.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:54.560
But in my own perspective,
it's totally different.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:59.590
I came from a country
where diversity is--

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:01.570
it's all over.

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:08.170
Simple-- I just never realized
what being a minority.

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:09.280
We were all minorities.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.270
We were all the same.

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:11.425
We were all the same color.

00:16:11.425 --> 00:16:13.370
It didn't matter.

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:20.470
But for me, coming to Boston,
when I heard earlier--

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:24.210
and you were referring
about my partner--

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:28.140
is he's a true Bostonian.

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:29.470
Isn't he?

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:33.930
He's a legit Bostonian.

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:36.240
And we were talking about
Theo and those things,

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.660
and I'm thinking this
kid is a Bostonian.

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:40.140
That's what he is.

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:41.400
He has an ID.

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.980
He's a Bostonian.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.920
Ever since I got to Boston,
I feel the same way,

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.280
because for me, it
was totally different.

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:53.250
I did not realize
it, maybe because

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:56.580
of lack of knowledge and
stuff like that, or maybe

00:16:56.580 --> 00:17:01.464
I didn't know that the
history of Boston, but for me,

00:17:01.464 --> 00:17:03.630
it's just like the little
girl that you were talking

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:05.130
that said, oh, they always win.

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:06.670
The Red Sox always win.

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:09.390
Well, it depends on the
generation that you came in.

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:12.491
For me, it has always
been like a parade.

00:17:12.491 --> 00:17:16.179
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:23.339
Ever since I got to
Boston, it's been all hugs.

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:27.460
Me and David have a
little competition

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:31.540
between the two of us, because
I said to David, as much

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:34.780
as you love to hug, I'm
going to lead you every year.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:39.670
So here in Boston for me
has been a great experience.

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:44.630
Being from the Dominican
Republic born and raised,

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:47.860
I know that a lot of that has
to see with the kind of success

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:48.950
I had here in Boston.

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:52.870
I think this is the place where
it's almost impossible to think

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:55.240
about a defeat for me.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.520
For me, it was impossible.

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.230
I did have some
success, and I know

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:02.860
that leads to a lot
of happy moments

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:06.670
for the people in Boston, but
it's not just in the field

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:09.070
that I have felt
the love that Boston

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:13.720
has for me, and the respect,
and the good feeling,

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:17.620
the mutual feeling between
me and the city of Boston.

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:23.170
So for me, it's really difficult
to go deep into those details,

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:27.190
because I've always
been treated right.

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:29.770
I've always been
treated with class.

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:33.910
So I don't know if my
story is really relevant

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:37.780
when it comes to that,
because I'm a different breed.

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:38.620
I'm just--

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:39.455
- I'll say.

00:18:39.455 --> 00:18:41.685
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:47.170
- My ID is hanging in
the right field wall--

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:48.130
number 45.

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:50.480
And my name is
Pedro the Bostonian.

00:18:53.296 --> 00:18:54.530
II never felt anything.

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:58.880
I've never been a victim
of anything in Boston,

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:04.320
so I'm not the proper person
to probably go into details.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:08.370
For me, it's a loving
hug and respect.

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:09.600
That's my own opinion.

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.910
- I think it's worth
pointing out that we waited.

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:16.520
For those of us who were
born a little bit after 1918,

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:19.380
but before 2004, we
waited a long time.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:23.460
And it's worth pointing out
that it wasn't until the Red Sox

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:28.320
were a fully integrated
organization on the field

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:31.590
and off the field that
this team and this region

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:34.470
were able to come together
and climb the mountain top.

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:37.620
And you had Pedro
Martinez, and David Ortiz,

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.920
and Kevin Millar, and Dave
Roberts, and Bill Miller,

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.200
and this group of
guys who came together

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.690
from all over the
world, all walks of life

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:47.310
to win a World
Series championship.

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:49.660
And that had never
happened in our lifetime.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:53.670
And I think what Pedro is
saying is exactly right.

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:57.990
He and his teammates changed
the course of history,

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:01.020
and he changed the
course of the trajectory

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:05.290
of the mindset in New England
for kids that we can win.

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:08.700
We can do this, because I
grew up here with Theo Epstein

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:12.270
at Brookline High thinking, how
are we going to lose this game?

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:15.570
How are the Red Sox going
to lose to the Mets in 1986,

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:18.780
or whether it was '75, or '78?

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.330
The mindset in
New England is now

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:24.326
about winning, which is
really special to watch.

00:20:24.326 --> 00:20:25.950
- You mentioned the
kids, which I think

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:29.430
is an interesting
area to go into.

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:32.100
It's one thing to believe
the Red Sox can win,

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.200
but it's another thing
for the kids in the area

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.380
to feel that they are
part of Red Sox nation,

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:40.422
and I know that the Red
Sox foundation, Bekah,

00:20:40.422 --> 00:20:42.630
which you head-- you're
executive director of the Red

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:46.080
Sox Foundation-- is
working hard to have

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:50.130
some initiatives and some
programs that promote diversity

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:51.420
and inclusion.

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:52.680
One of those is RBI.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:56.010
That's Reviving Baseball
in the Inner Cities, which,

00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:59.220
if you're not familiar with
the program, part of it

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.230
is to get young kids
in the inner city

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:04.140
to play baseball and
softball, but it's also

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.940
about instilling
leadership and life skills.

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:08.700
You also have the
Red Sox Scholars,

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:12.900
which is where you select
kids in seventh grade,

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:15.480
and you take them through
the college process.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:18.510
You work on their
academics, and you really

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:21.172
mentor them through
their college years

00:21:21.172 --> 00:21:23.130
from seventh grade through
their college years.

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:26.700
So I guess when you
have programs like RBI

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:28.140
and like the Red
Sox Scholars that

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:32.130
are designed for kids in that
inclusive, diverse vision, what

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:35.296
do you hope are the goals
short term and long term?

00:21:35.296 --> 00:21:36.930
- So I'm going to
back up and start

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:38.850
with why I think
this job has been

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:40.440
the most amazing
opportunity for me,

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.659
and I will get to
your answer, but I

00:21:42.659 --> 00:21:43.950
think there is relevance there.

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:46.370
So I'm born and
raised in Cambridge.

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:47.140
I grew up in--

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:47.680
yes, I know.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.699
- Another Bostonian.

00:21:49.699 --> 00:21:50.490
- Real [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:51.540
- Shes' the only one who
didn't get lost here tonight.

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:52.450
- Right here.

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:52.570
- Anyway.

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:53.945
- Right, so I was
born and raised

00:21:53.945 --> 00:21:56.490
in Cambridge to a
biracial family,

00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:59.050
and I started playing soccer
for Cambridge U soccer

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:00.510
when I was four years old.

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:03.000
And I say that to say
that sport has always

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.715
been an instrument
that I've used

00:22:04.715 --> 00:22:06.270
in my life to be successful.

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:08.570
I went to BB &amp; N, and
I graduated there.

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:09.920
I played soccer at Brown.

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.670
I went on to play
professional soccer here

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:14.100
in Boston for the
Boston Breakers,

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:16.860
and I worked for the Boston
Celtics for five years.

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.560
And now here at the Red
Sox it's just been a dream,

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.260
and in between there, I ran a
couple other small non-profits.

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:26.550
But I say that to say I
know the power of sport.

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:28.380
I believe in the
power of sport, and so

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.510
heading a foundation like
the Red Sox Foundation

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:33.450
that has quite arguably the
best resources, the best

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:36.390
brand in the entire world,
in my opinion, when it comes

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:39.300
to leveraging a pro sports
team against its charitable

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.380
endeavors, has just
been a dream come true.

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:45.030
And to run programs like
Red Sox Scholars and RBI--

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:50.580
to really and directly direct
some of those resources

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.410
from the Red Sox
into the community

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:53.680
has just been amazing.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.580
I was a Jackie Robinson scholar.

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.580
My parents worked for Boston
public schools for 34 years,

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:02.610
and being one of five,
it was not in our reality

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:03.787
to go to college--

00:23:03.787 --> 00:23:05.370
or have my parents
pay for it, rather.

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:09.420
So I know the power of
being able to provide funds

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:12.070
to young people to
pursue higher education.

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:16.170
And so for us, we have
now 275 young people that

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:19.800
have been through the
program, and making sure

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.740
that we can always, always be
there for them, whether it's

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:24.540
connecting them to
local resources,

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.490
connecting them to
national resources--

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:29.490
we actually just employed
one of our graduates.

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:31.440
And so really just seeing
it come full circle

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.042
for me has just been amazing.

00:23:34.042 --> 00:23:35.625
- I'm going to turn--

00:23:35.625 --> 00:23:38.000
Pedro is another person who
has sort of devoted your life

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.510
to doing things for kids
and giving kids opportunity

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:45.650
both here in Boston and here in
your native Dominican Republic.

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:48.530
I hope I can do the
Spanish well enough.

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:49.650
Lindos Suenos?

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:50.150
Am I--

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:51.290
- Lindos Suenos, yes.

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:53.960
- So this means beautiful
dreams in Spanish.

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:56.401
It's a program that you
are part of-- that you

00:23:56.401 --> 00:23:57.650
take part of in the Dominican.

00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:59.090
You are building homes.

00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:01.820
You are making sure people
have in the Dominican what

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:02.610
they need.

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:04.640
I've heard you also
have taken up a hammer

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.260
and nails on occasion to--

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:07.040
- Oh, believe me.

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.331
And that wasn't the first time.

00:24:08.331 --> 00:24:08.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:11.210
- I've heard that you do that.

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:14.390
You were also here last
August playing in the old time

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:16.310
baseball game to help
raise money for ALS.

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:17.070
- In your city--

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:17.570
Cambridge.

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:18.240
- That's right.

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:18.740
- Cambridge.

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:20.910
- Right down the road,
as a matter of fact.

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:23.490
You have been, as I said,
building schools, homes,

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:26.689
everything, here, the
Dominican, all over the place.

00:24:26.689 --> 00:24:28.980
It's so hard to keep track
almost of everything you do,

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.220
and I'm wondering
how do you choose.

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.200
How do you figure
out what it is--

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.800
where you want to put your
energies, what you want to do,

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:39.270
and what do you hope is your
personal legacy with all

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:41.160
of this philanthropy?

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:45.630
- Well, I grew up
extremely poor.

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:51.776
So as you grow up,
you become an expert

00:24:51.776 --> 00:24:58.220
at identifying opportunities,
identifying the weak points,

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:04.340
identifying what it takes
for you to come out.

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:06.120
You identify so many things.

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:11.170
You become a veteran at
a very, very early age.

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:13.720
And for me, it was no exception.

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.550
I became a survivor.

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:20.200
I became someone that
needed to find sources

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:24.170
to continue to go to school.

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:28.450
My mom and dad could
barely supply for us

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:34.950
clothing to go to school,
meals on the table,

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:37.440
and I can't go really
deep on the things

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.990
that my mom and dad
were able to supply.

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:45.090
So right away, I was introduced
sometimes, or at an early age,

00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:50.580
very young to what a nail and a
hammer was to different things

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:53.320
that you have to do to
help out in a big family--

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:56.310
six kids and mom and dad.

00:25:56.310 --> 00:26:00.540
And both of them not
the best educated

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:09.520
people when it comes to school,
but at home the best teachers

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.190
that you could ever have.

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:12.860
And that's all we needed.

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:21.590
And the reason I have that drive
is because thanks to baseball

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:23.730
and the support of
many people like you

00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:25.740
that support
baseball and support

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:30.900
different ideas I was able
to become a baseball player.

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:34.320
I was granted an opportunity.

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:38.430
As an immigrant, I
was fortunate enough

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:42.030
to make it through baseball and
become a US citizen, something

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:44.310
that I'm really proud of--

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:47.820
to be able to enjoy the
rights that you guys that are

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:52.950
born and raised here enjoy.

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:56.100
I think for me it
was pretty cool

00:26:56.100 --> 00:27:02.040
that if I was able to do
anything for the future was

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:07.860
help out education, help
out the less fortunate,

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:10.270
because I've been there.

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:12.510
I've been on the
other side, and I

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:15.760
know what it's like to need
something and not have it.

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:19.680
So if I'm in a position to grant
anybody an opportunity to be

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:26.550
better, to get educated, to
become a better man for society

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:30.510
in the future, I think it's--

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:33.950
even though it's not a written
rule like we do in baseball--

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:35.930
we have unwritten rules.

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:40.334
Like if you hit one of
my teammates, nobody--

00:27:40.334 --> 00:27:42.694
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:42.694 --> 00:27:45.526
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:45.526 --> 00:27:49.760
Nobody needs to tell me that--

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.920
nobody needs to give
me a piece of paper.

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:55.270
Pedro, you know that guy
over there that's coming up.

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:59.170
It's the same position as
your player that just got hit.

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:01.330
It's not written
on the paper, but I

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:05.198
know that my first
instinct will be drill him.

00:28:05.198 --> 00:28:07.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.410
It's the same thing.

00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:14.130
I would like my legacy to
be remembered not really

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:17.370
as the guy that posted all
those numbers that you just

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:26.610
mentioned, and the awards, or my
curly hair face in Cooperstown.

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:29.330
I want to be remembered
as a sign of hope,

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:34.080
as a sign of opportunity,
as a sign for others

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:42.470
to follow and try to emulate,
because just the fact

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:45.810
that I was traveling
to the states

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:52.850
my first year as a 17-year-old
was a huge, humongous step

00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:54.890
towards the future.

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:56.870
Just getting the
opportunity to come out

00:28:56.870 --> 00:29:02.690
of the Dominican with a visa
to look for new opportunities

00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:06.940
was a huge step, and
I was so grateful.

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:09.090
And I will always be.

00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:10.480
So I want to do the same thing.

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:14.860
I want people to look at
me, see the opportunity,

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:19.530
take advantage of it, take
advantage of the things that

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:24.930
are granted for them, and
see hope everywhere I go,

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:27.370
because if I did
it, even though I

00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:30.400
got into many fights
in baseball, well,

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.650
they can also do it.

00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:36.570
I also fight with life,
and adversities, and stuff

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:39.720
like that, but like
I told you earlier,

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:45.940
coming from where I come from,
adversity is an everyday deal.

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:49.930
So I wasn't
intimidated, and today I

00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:55.500
can serve as a testimony of
faith, hard work, dedication,

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:58.830
integrity, and I represent
my family really well.

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:02.250
I told George
Steinbrenner one time,

00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:04.500
you know, you might
call the league

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:07.380
and have them suspend me
or do whatever they want,

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:09.390
but you just don't
have enough money

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:12.166
to buy fear and
put it in my heart.

00:30:12.166 --> 00:30:15.512
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:21.820
It is the same thing
with life-- adversity.

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:25.470
And for people that want
to look up to the future,

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:28.120
don't let adversity
intimidate you.

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:29.950
Just go forward.

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:30.800
Same thing.

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:34.130
George is big, but if you have
to drill him, you drill him.

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:35.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:37.180
Right?

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:39.630
So that's my perspective,
and that's why I do it.

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:43.211
That's why I want to help some
more people do the same thing.

00:30:43.211 --> 00:30:45.210
- Isn't it interesting
how the game has changed?

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:47.540
Joe Kelly-- it just
got away from him.

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:51.540
[INAUDIBLE],, and with
Pedro, no, I drilled him.

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:52.462
I drilled him.

00:30:52.462 --> 00:30:53.490
You drilled him.

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:54.240
- Different times.

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.030
- Different times.

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:56.980
- We have been talking
about different times

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:58.120
ever since we started.

00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:58.695
- Yes.

00:30:58.695 --> 00:31:01.600
- His dad never
saw a World Series.

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.160
He got to see one.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:05.230
Now he's daughter
is like, yeah, dad,

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:07.040
I know the Red Sox
are going to win.

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:09.400
She's accustomed
to winning, right?

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.770
Well, those are different times.

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:11.270
- Exactly.

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:14.965
- When I pitched, drilling
a guy was a thing of nature.

00:31:14.965 --> 00:31:17.125
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:17.125 --> 00:31:18.250
- I think it's interesting.

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:19.750
We're talking about
different times.

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:22.240
I think another thing that's
happened sort of off the field

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:26.410
that you might not have seen
15, 20 years ago is the Take

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:28.919
the Lead initiative that
the Red Sox started.

00:31:28.919 --> 00:31:30.460
And if you're not
familiar, this came

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:33.850
in the wake of the racist
incidents that took place

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:36.000
last summer at Fenway.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.420
And it's sort of a combined
effort of the Red Sox, Celtics,

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:42.820
Patriots, Bruins,
and Revolution.

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:44.560
They got together
and basically said,

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:46.150
we're going to
stand up to racism,

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:49.450
stand up to hate speech, and
you talk about players being

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:50.830
a sign of hope and role models.

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:52.663
And we're going to put
our players out there

00:31:52.663 --> 00:31:55.280
in public service announcements.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.150
And so I guess the question is--

00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:57.970
and not only that.

00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:00.840
I think you, Sam, have said we
want our players to speak out.

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:02.215
We want our players
to speak out.

00:32:02.215 --> 00:32:04.060
- Well, I'm representing
the players.

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:07.386
I'm old, but I'm
representing the players.

00:32:07.386 --> 00:32:09.412
Hey, I still throw a little bit.

00:32:09.412 --> 00:32:11.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:17.470
- Well, if you go back, it's
just about a year ago when I

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:20.350
was home after-- it
was May 1, I think--

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:21.250
May 2, maybe.

00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:24.507
I got home after a night game,
and maybe like many of you

00:32:24.507 --> 00:32:25.090
in this room--

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:29.010
I know my colleagues probably
share the same addiction,

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:31.600
this device right
here in my pocket.

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:35.620
And got home, and I'm just
checking text and email

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:36.780
before going to bed.

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:41.260
And on Twitter pops
up Bob Nightingale.

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:46.930
Adam Jones was called the
n-word at Fenway Park tonight.

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:51.160
And it just hit me
like a ton of bricks.

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:58.680
I'm this 45-year-old Caucasian
white guy from Brookline,

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:02.340
and you just don't think
about those things.

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:06.660
You just don't when you're
in my shoes, but you read it,

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:09.440
and it hits you like
a ton of bricks.

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:14.190
God, how could this be in 2017?

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:17.080
You realize how sort
of ignorant you are,

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:22.020
and it really just was so--
it just angered me so much,

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:26.520
and we knew that it was going
to be really important to handle

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:30.270
this the right way not
from a PR perspective,

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:32.810
but from a human perspective.

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:38.350
And so the next morning John
Henry called me and said,

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:39.100
what do you think?

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:40.224
And I said, well come over.

00:33:40.224 --> 00:33:42.520
Let's sit with
our players first.

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:46.110
And so we went to talk to
Mookie, and Jackie, and Xander,

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:49.890
and John Farrell, and Dustin
Pedroia, and Rick Porcello.

00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:53.070
And we said, we're going
to go talk to Adam Jones

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:56.940
and apologize for what
happened, and the players

00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:58.510
thought that was a good idea.

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:06.720
And it was Jackie who said,
you know, this isn't new.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.340
This isn't something
that doesn't

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:11.630
happen all over the place.

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:14.580
And I said, yeah, but it's
Boston and Fenway Park.

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:18.090
We have this reputation
as this racist city.

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:19.705
It's just so frustrating.

00:34:19.705 --> 00:34:23.580
He said, Sam, you know,
it's not Fenway Park.

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:25.340
It's not Boston.

00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:26.560
This is everywhere.

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:27.270
It's malls.

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:29.610
It's airports, public
gathering places.

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:31.020
This stuff happens.

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:34.570
So we left the clubhouse,
and we went over,

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:36.533
and we talked to Adam
Jones, and he basically

00:34:36.533 --> 00:34:37.449
had the same attitude.

00:34:37.449 --> 00:34:40.184
Like, hey, what are
you apologizing for?

00:34:40.184 --> 00:34:41.350
You guys didn't do anything.

00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:43.020
It was some idiot
out in the stands,

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:48.280
and so anyway that happened,
and incredibly we put out

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:49.870
this clarion call to our fans.

00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:53.380
We said, look, we don't want
hate speech in our venues.

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:56.570
If you hear something,
please say something.

00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:57.400
Please let us know.

00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:01.210
And later that
night, we had a woman

00:35:01.210 --> 00:35:04.810
from Nigeria singing
the national anthem,

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:10.030
and a white male in the
stands used the n-word

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:13.780
to describe her to another
person in the stands.

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.960
And thankfully, someone
heard it, pointed them out,

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:19.330
identified them, and
our security, and BPD--

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:21.610
we were able to
identify the person

00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:23.080
and eject them
from the ballpark.

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.870
The individual admitted to it.

00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:30.250
And it was just within 24 hours
these two incidents happened

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:34.270
at Fenway Park in
Boston in 2017,

00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:36.730
and for us as an
organization I think

00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:39.770
it was a big wake up call.

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:42.100
And so a lot of us got
together, including

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:46.000
Pam Kenn, my great colleague
who's been with us 20 years,

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.110
a few others.

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:49.470
And we said, look, what
are we going to do?

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:53.710
And we got resources and
people around the table--

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:54.850
elected officials.

00:35:54.850 --> 00:35:58.900
We had started to build a
relationship with the NAACP,

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:02.290
and a brilliant woman,
Tanisha Sullivan,

00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:03.920
said, you know, you
guys have a choice.

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.310
You can lean into this and
take it on as an issue,

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:09.190
or you can just do
what most companies do

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:12.005
and sweep it under the rug
and hope that it goes away.

00:36:12.005 --> 00:36:13.630
And so we sort of
looked at each other,

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:16.360
and said let's take this on, and
let's talk to the other teams.

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:18.190
And I can't tell
you how incredible

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:20.710
the Patriots, the Celtics,
the Bruins, the Revolution

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:21.220
have been.

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:24.700
It started with a campaign
around our venues.

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:27.250
We don't want hate
speech in our venues.

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:29.170
In the case of the
Red Sox, if you

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:33.010
engage in hate speech in our
venue, we will kick you out.

00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:34.690
We will ban you
from coming back.

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:38.050
In some cases, we may ban you
for life from coming back,

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:39.593
and that's what we've done.

00:36:39.593 --> 00:36:44.523
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:51.000
The next step is a
continuation of that.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.570
We need to try and provide
economic opportunity.

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:56.730
We started the Take
the Lead job fair,

00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:58.920
which we just held
at the Boston Garden

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:04.660
about two or three weeks ago,
to really give tangible ideas

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:09.810
and teach young people to how
to get into the sports business,

00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:12.120
because it's a great business.

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:15.810
For someone like
me, sitting on stage

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:19.006
with two professional
athletes, that's pretty cool.

00:37:19.006 --> 00:37:20.880
And the only reason I'm
doing it is because I

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.050
work in the sports business.

00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:23.910
So it's a great career.

00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:26.640
It's a great business whether
you work in a front office,

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.950
for a league, a broadcast
outlet, an agency,

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:30.600
but people need to
know how to do it,

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:32.250
and how do you actually get in?

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:36.480
So we wanted to give tangible
direction to young people

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.410
about how to get into
the sports business.

00:37:38.410 --> 00:37:40.800
So we're going to continue
to work with this umbrella

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.714
program called Take
the Lead, and Bekah,

00:37:42.714 --> 00:37:44.880
I don't know if you want
to add to it because you've

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:47.040
been a big part of
it since coming in.

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:50.100
- Yeah, so as much as it may
seem reactive to the incidents,

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:52.980
I also think it's worth
noting that programs like RBI

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:55.210
and Scholars have been in
existence for a long time.

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:57.001
And I think that was
one of the things that

00:37:57.001 --> 00:37:59.460
was really attractive to
me, and my personal mission

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:02.472
of always giving back
attracted me to the foundation

00:38:02.472 --> 00:38:04.680
to know that they'd been
committed to charitable work

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.480
in the community for so long.

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:08.580
RBI is 25 years old.

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:10.890
Scholars has been in
existence since 2003.

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:13.230
There have been millions
of dollars donated

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:15.720
in the community throughout
New England, particularly

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:17.910
inner city communities,
whether that's

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:20.250
a monetary gift
or auction items,

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:22.530
really making sure there's
an intentional allocation

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:24.630
of resources to ensure
that we're connecting

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:27.970
to our communities of color,
because as a person of color,

00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:30.750
I know firsthand how difficult
it is to break barriers.

00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:36.090
And to break into this industry
is very, very, very difficult.

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:39.960
And so I do want to say, though,
that I believe the Red Sox have

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.400
always been committed.

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:42.474
It's never ending work.

00:38:42.474 --> 00:38:43.890
I think that's one
of the things I

00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:46.500
love about being in philanthropy
and being in nonprofit--

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:48.510
is that there's
always more to do.

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:50.340
And being behind an
organization that

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:53.460
is truly committed to this
cause and has basically

00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:56.490
said to me like any resource you
need, Bekah, we're behind you.

00:38:56.490 --> 00:38:57.435
Go and do it.

00:38:57.435 --> 00:38:59.310
And so one of the things
that we're exploring

00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:01.980
is larger, again, more
intentional allocation

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:04.907
of resources into bigger
communities outside of Boston.

00:39:04.907 --> 00:39:06.990
And one of those communities
that we're looking at

00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:08.940
is Lawrence, making
sure that we can

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:11.610
step into gateway communities,
and be present, and make

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:13.650
sure to recognize some
of the great work--

00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:16.200
academic, economic-- that
are happening in communities

00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:19.200
outside of Boston to ensure
that we can keep that connection

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:22.129
and keep the pipeline open
for young people, adults

00:39:22.129 --> 00:39:23.670
to come into Fenway
Park, and so they

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:28.020
know it's an accessible, open,
welcoming venue and space

00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:28.980
for them to partake in.

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:32.331
So I think it's just
relevant to note that.

00:39:32.331 --> 00:39:34.830
- Yes, and I was going to say
one of the other things that--

00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:37.510
other components of Take the
Lead, as I mentioned earlier,

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:41.320
is the encouragement,
empowerment, for players,

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:44.790
whether past or present,
to speak up and speak out.

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:48.240
Pedro, I know you are someone
who enjoys speaking out

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:51.570
and doesn't shy away from that.

00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:52.780
And I'm just curious--

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:53.280
advice?

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:55.860
Because you have such a
big platform in the city,

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:57.360
and at the same
time there's so much

00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:01.350
scrutiny to what
players do in this city.

00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:05.321
Advice to players who
might want to speak out,

00:40:05.321 --> 00:40:07.320
whether it's against hate
speech or whether they

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:11.570
have some other issue that's
near and dear to their heart?

00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:17.200
- Well, I think
everybody deep inside

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:21.360
has a feel for the things
that are right or wrong.

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:22.915
I know we have a
lot of young players

00:40:22.915 --> 00:40:29.980
that are playing right
now, but a lot of them,

00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:31.090
when you look at them--

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:35.420
and I was talking to you
earlier about those things--

00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:37.810
some of those guys
are now barely

00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:41.530
old enough to go buy a drink.

00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:45.670
And they are already dealing
with the responsibility

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:52.060
to be one Red Sox,
to be one very known

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:58.300
person, social media, the
phones, everything being

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:03.420
documented makes it so
hard on those kids that

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:09.240
are bound to make mistakes
because of lack of experience--

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.220
all those things
that people normally

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:15.570
don't stop to think about
when they're playing the game

00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:18.310
and when they get off the field.

00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:23.700
So my advice for them
would be understand really

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:30.210
what you're doing, who you are,
what you mean to the people,

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:34.970
and understand also that
it's not just baseball.

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:36.560
There's a lot of
responsibilities

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:41.940
that come attached
with it, and I

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:45.060
think they have to understand
that baseball doesn't

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:47.590
stop between the white lines.

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:49.390
And when they walk
in society, when

00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:51.550
they walk in the
neighborhoods, when

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:54.040
they walk in the
residential areas

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:56.530
and they drive their
nice cars, they

00:41:56.530 --> 00:42:00.840
have to realize that
everything they do

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:03.810
has a little bit of
responsibility with it.

00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:06.190
And it's not written
on the papers

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:11.680
that you're supposed
to go to communities,

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:12.880
but they look at you.

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:14.840
Kids look at you
as a role model.

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:17.260
They want to be like you.

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:19.700
I couldn't believe
during the winter caravan

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:27.630
that we have here at Foxwoods
I saw so many young little kids

00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:29.190
growing their hair.

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:30.830
They wanted to be
like Benintendi.

00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:33.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:36.360
And so many jerseys that
said Mookie on the back,

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:37.860
and they wanted to
look like Mookie.

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:38.880
They dressed up.

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:41.160
They had their own
little uniform.

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:43.290
They had the rubber bands.

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:46.680
They have everything,
just like the players do.

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:52.170
And that is part of their
responsibility that they have.

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:54.040
And they're probably
not thinking about it,

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.790
but my advice would be
to really pay attention

00:42:56.790 --> 00:43:00.450
to those little details and
understand that everything they

00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:03.570
do means something to someone.

00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:08.244
And even if it is in
a good way, you've

00:43:08.244 --> 00:43:10.410
got to be responsible and
accountable for the things

00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:11.580
that you do.

00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:17.040
And part of the society,
part of community work

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.170
comes with the package.

00:43:19.170 --> 00:43:21.460
So I will advise
them to really look

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:24.810
into the things that
are behind their back,

00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:26.750
not just in the baseball field.

00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:29.249
- I think it's interesting you
mentioned the things that you

00:43:29.249 --> 00:43:32.490
see and that are so
visible, especially

00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:35.460
in this city with the
spotlight on the players,

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:36.930
but there are two
examples I wanted

00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:40.470
to bring up that
happened recently

00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:41.950
that you may have missed.

00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:43.822
And I want to get the
panel's reaction--

00:43:43.822 --> 00:43:45.030
the panelists reaction to it.

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:49.530
First of all, I think you have
in newly hired-- or recently

00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:53.640
hired Red Sox manager Alex Cora
somebody who leads in the way

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:54.900
that Pedro was talking about.

00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:57.870
You have to really think about
what your responsibility is.

00:43:57.870 --> 00:44:01.680
You all know he is the first
minority manager of the Red Sox

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:03.780
in team history.

00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:05.850
I think you may also
be aware of the fact

00:44:05.850 --> 00:44:11.380
that, in the off season, he
took a trip down to Puerto Rico,

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:13.440
where he grew up,
where his family lives

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:17.460
to provide aid to the
victims of Hurricane Maria.

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:22.740
What you may not know is that
that was part of his contract

00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:26.550
negotiation, and in the final
stages of that negotiation,

00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:27.900
it wasn't about more money.

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:29.320
It wasn't about more years.

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:31.950
It was about getting a
plane that could go down

00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:33.870
to Puerto Rico with that aid.

00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:35.320
That's one example.

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:38.070
Another example is
Christian Vazquez

00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:41.690
with his recent contract
extension, a three year,

00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:44.590
I believe, $13.3 million
contract extension,

00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:47.627
but that's not what's
interesting about that.

00:44:47.627 --> 00:44:49.710
In, I think, a move that's
pretty unprecedented as

00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:53.040
far as I know, he
asked that there

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:56.970
be a provision in his contract
that was a donation to the Red

00:44:56.970 --> 00:44:59.160
Sox Foundation.

00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:03.030
So kind of mind blowing when
you think about a player having

00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:04.260
the presence of mind--

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:05.850
and a manager--
during the contract

00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:09.000
negotiations to think
of the community.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:14.550
Rebecca, because you're the
beneficiary of that contract

00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:18.270
donation, when you heard that
that was coming your way, what

00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:19.500
was your reaction?

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:20.500
What did you make of it?

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.041
And did you think
there was something

00:45:22.041 --> 00:45:24.060
of a change taking place?

00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:26.040
- No, I think my
reaction was, no way.

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:28.680
It was like that when
I got the phone call.

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:30.930
Yeah, I mean, again having
worked for the Celtics

00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:32.850
and worked with those
players for five years,

00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:34.360
I'd never seen
anything like that.

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:36.930
And this was the first time that
I'd heard it at the Red Sox,

00:45:36.930 --> 00:45:37.429
as well.

00:45:37.429 --> 00:45:39.270
So hearing it, to me, was--

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:41.250
I mean, my immediate
thought was, wow, money.

00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:43.840
Less money I had to raise
to meet my bottom line,

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:48.720
but beyond that I just felt that
it was a real indication that

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:51.330
players I feel like are
starting to finally recognize

00:45:51.330 --> 00:45:54.240
the inherent value of being
invested in the community,

00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:57.420
and how giving back can be good
for your own personal brand,

00:45:57.420 --> 00:45:59.760
and how working in the
community and being

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:02.490
present in the community
is really, really

00:46:02.490 --> 00:46:04.890
helpful for themselves both
as individuals, but also

00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:07.110
as members of a
professional sports team.

00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:10.200
And so to have that carve
out was just remarkable--

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:14.650
that there is kind of an
element of philanthropy going on

00:46:14.650 --> 00:46:16.640
in our players'
brains is incredible.

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:19.050
And I think there's only
more opportunity for more.

00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:21.180
I think the other
element of that contract

00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:23.440
was that I get to work
with the player now

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:26.430
to think about where we
can allocate those funds.

00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:31.230
So making sure that it can
be kind of part of the either

00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:33.504
portfolio of the
player or against one

00:46:33.504 --> 00:46:34.920
of his philanthropic
priorities is

00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:37.445
really interesting, because
what I've seen with players

00:46:37.445 --> 00:46:38.820
is the moment that
you can really

00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:41.364
have them bought into where
that investment is going

00:46:41.364 --> 00:46:43.780
is the more they're going to
want to make the appearances,

00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:44.670
the more they're
going to want to say,

00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:46.519
Bekah, I'm available to do this.

00:46:46.519 --> 00:46:48.060
And so making sure
that it can really

00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:50.550
go to something that he's
himself supportive of,

00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:53.630
whether it's a cause
or a nonprofit,

00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:55.320
is really exciting for me.

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:56.310
And so I hope--

00:46:56.310 --> 00:46:58.384
I hope-- that we can
continue to do this,

00:46:58.384 --> 00:47:00.300
and that it catches on,
and that we can really

00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:02.640
have an element in
contract with players

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:05.350
to make it a
philanthropic mandate

00:47:05.350 --> 00:47:07.046
that they're part
of the community.

00:47:07.046 --> 00:47:08.670
- Sam, you look like
you have something

00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:09.810
you want to say about
it, either Cora or--

00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:11.070
- No, I'm remembering back.

00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:16.350
It's hard to believe that is
hasn't even been a full year.

00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:19.230
Going back to the
end of last year,

00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:21.450
we had a really good season.

00:47:21.450 --> 00:47:22.740
We won 93 games.

00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:28.650
We had early exit from the
playoffs, and only in Boston

00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:33.540
would you win a World Series,
win two division championships,

00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:35.830
and then lose your job.

00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:39.270
So I have to give a big shout
out to our friend, Pedro's

00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:43.560
friend, John Farrell, who
did an amazing job for us,

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:45.540
as did Tito.

00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:49.240
But there clearly is a
shelf life in that position,

00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:51.030
especially in Boston.

00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:56.490
So when we made the decision
to move on from John,

00:47:56.490 --> 00:48:01.410
it was unanimous before
the process started

00:48:01.410 --> 00:48:06.060
that we thought Alex Cora
would be the right guy,

00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:10.890
but we went through a process
sort of like the process

00:48:10.890 --> 00:48:13.180
to hire Bekah.

00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:16.140
We were proven right,
that after interviewing

00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:18.930
the other candidates,
Alex stood out

00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:21.390
just the way Bekah did
as the right person

00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:22.940
to join the Red Sox.

00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:24.980
The problem was he
was under contract

00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:27.510
in the postseason with
the Astros on their way

00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:29.430
to a World Series championship.

00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:35.310
So we had to navigate the Major
League Baseball waters of no

00:48:35.310 --> 00:48:37.740
tampering and getting
permission to interview him.

00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:41.710
And he was literally
flying in to interview on

00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:44.310
off days in the American
League Championship Series,

00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:46.920
and then we needed to get
him in front of John Henry

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:51.090
and Tom Werner in New York at a
hotel at midnight after a game,

00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:53.910
so it was a little bit tricky.

00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:56.460
But when we ultimately
got the green light

00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:59.850
to make a deal with
him, Dave Dombrowski

00:48:59.850 --> 00:49:02.160
negotiated directly with him.

00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:06.840
It took, I think, about five
minutes to reach agreement

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:09.620
on a first year managerial
contract for Alex Cora

00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:11.730
to join the Red Sox.

00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:14.310
And everything-- it just seemed
to be too good to be true.

00:49:14.310 --> 00:49:17.730
He was the hottest managerial
candidate on the planet.

00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:19.770
We've had an agreement
with him, and we're

00:49:19.770 --> 00:49:21.270
ready to send him a term sheet.

00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:27.989
Then Dave calls back and says
there's one little problem, one

00:49:27.989 --> 00:49:28.530
little issue.

00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:30.340
And I'm thinking,
oh god, here we go.

00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:34.080
As you said, more
years, more money,

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:38.100
bigger suite on the
road, first class

00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:41.040
travel in the off-- something.

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:42.210
No, no, no, no, no.

00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:43.779
He wants a plane.

00:49:43.779 --> 00:49:45.570
I said, what do you
mean, he wants a plane?

00:49:45.570 --> 00:49:47.360
Planes are expensive.

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:49.170
He said, no, no, no, no.

00:49:49.170 --> 00:49:53.970
He wants a plane to go
from Boston to Puerto Rico

00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:56.730
this off season to
shine a light on what's

00:49:56.730 --> 00:49:59.640
going on in Puerto Rico.

00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:02.310
He's got supplies
all over the country

00:50:02.310 --> 00:50:06.150
that can come to Boston
that we can take down there.

00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:09.720
So anyway, we called up
our friends at JetBlue.

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:13.950
We got a plane, and we went
down to Caguas, Puerto Rico

00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:15.280
to Alex's hometown.

00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:19.470
And I think it really
just says a lot about who

00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:22.500
this guy is as a person.

00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:24.890
Look, he's a rookie manager
in the American League East.

00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:27.540
It's going to be difficult.
It's going to be hard,

00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:30.000
but from his time
with us from 2005

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.330
through 2008, as Pedro
knows a lot better than me,

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:37.770
he was a fantastic
teammate, a go to guy.

00:50:37.770 --> 00:50:40.740
When we needed him to do
things in the community,

00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:42.270
I think he was someone--

00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:45.150
Pam would probably agree-- pick
up the phone, and call him,

00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:46.320
and he was there for you.

00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:50.240
So he's been a great addition,
and he's a very special person.

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:53.430
- And just, Pedro, as you hear
these stories both about Cora

00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:55.110
and Vazquez, what goes--

00:50:55.110 --> 00:50:56.780
I mean, I can also
see you smiling.

00:50:56.780 --> 00:50:58.571
There seems to be a
certain amount of pride

00:50:58.571 --> 00:51:00.780
that this has become
the Red Sox legacy

00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:02.490
and that this is where
it's at with both

00:51:02.490 --> 00:51:04.275
the manager and young players.

00:51:04.275 --> 00:51:06.240
- Well, that's a
clear sign of what

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:08.700
you were saying
about the future,

00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:14.490
about the legacy that some other
players are living out there.

00:51:14.490 --> 00:51:15.280
I'm part of it.

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:17.265
I feel proud of those
guys doing that.

00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:23.492
I've been part of so many
things that the Puerto Rican

00:51:23.492 --> 00:51:25.200
players do in Puerto
Rico, just like they

00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:28.230
have been part of the things
that I do in the Dominican

00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:31.560
Republic, and we
support each other.

00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:35.070
And it's no surprise
to me that Christian

00:51:35.070 --> 00:51:38.580
wants to do that as soon as
he gets a little bit of money.

00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:42.450
He's seen that before, and
that's what it's all about.

00:51:42.450 --> 00:51:44.990
They have seen the examples
of the Carlos Beltran,

00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:48.510
Carlos Delgado, and those
guys-- the Alomar brothers,

00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:53.960
Roberto Clemente living his
life in the middle of the sea

00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:56.930
to go help people in Nicaragua.

00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:58.510
That's the legacy.

00:51:58.510 --> 00:51:59.580
That's what you want.

00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:01.570
That's what you want to see.

00:52:01.570 --> 00:52:04.680
Pretty soon we're going to
have to sign another player,

00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:06.890
and it doesn't have
to be precisely

00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:08.850
from Puerto Rico
or the Dominican,

00:52:08.850 --> 00:52:11.240
but that player is
going to try to be

00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:16.330
another Christian Vazquez, or an
Alex Cora, or a Pedro Martinez.

00:52:16.330 --> 00:52:18.510
It doesn't matter who
they choose to be,

00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:21.720
but they are probably going
to be doing the same thing

00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:24.450
because they saw
it on someone else,

00:52:24.450 --> 00:52:27.390
and that's what makes these
kind of things that we

00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:30.030
do in the community important--

00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:32.760
is that the future
that's coming over

00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:37.290
has something to emulate
when they go forward.

00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:40.170
- I think also it seems like
the community expects it now

00:52:40.170 --> 00:52:42.700
perhaps more than
they have in the past.

00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:45.540
And I don't know if, Bekah,
you see that in your work

00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:47.430
that they expect
this philanthropy.

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:50.260
They expect this connection
among the players.

00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:52.230
- Yeah, I mean what
I've been thinking about

00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:55.230
as I'm listening to Pedro is
that representation matters,

00:52:55.230 --> 00:52:59.250
and I think it's critically
important that, as much

00:52:59.250 --> 00:52:59.966
as we can--

00:52:59.966 --> 00:53:02.340
and I know this is in Pam's
team, the Community Relations

00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:04.980
Department-- we're getting
our players into the community

00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:06.510
so that our young
kids of color can

00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:10.620
see individuals
that are successful

00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:12.090
and know that they can make it.

00:53:12.090 --> 00:53:14.340
And making that
connection, I think,

00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:16.380
is the most important thing.

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:19.740
I know baseball plays
700 games a season--

00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:21.630
very different than basketball.

00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:24.240
So the players are
far less available

00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:27.270
than they are in basketball,
but they do make an effort,

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:28.360
and they do make time.

00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:31.560
One example is that we have
Jackie Bradley Jr. Every home

00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:34.320
game on a Friday he's agreed
to come out and meet with some

00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:36.300
of our Red Sox
Scholars, and so we're

00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:38.250
making a connection,
a personal connection.

00:53:38.250 --> 00:53:41.250
He spends about 30 minutes
with them away from cameras,

00:53:41.250 --> 00:53:43.330
away from people, just talking.

00:53:43.330 --> 00:53:45.330
Taking pictures, of course,
signing autographs--

00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:46.044
that's fine.

00:53:46.044 --> 00:53:48.210
But more than that, it's
really just talking to them

00:53:48.210 --> 00:53:49.980
about what they're
doing and helping

00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:51.890
to create some
sort of inspiration

00:53:51.890 --> 00:53:53.640
of a pathway for them,
and vision for them

00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:55.040
that they can be successful.

00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:58.260
And so really trying to make
those little connections

00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:01.350
as often as we can, either at
the park or in the community

00:54:01.350 --> 00:54:03.480
is, I think, what
it's all about.

00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:06.210
- I think we'd be sort of
remiss in this conversation

00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:09.000
if we didn't mention
some of the criticism

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:13.410
that players get for speaking
out, for being activists.

00:54:13.410 --> 00:54:15.060
I'm referencing
here, of course, the

00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:19.290
take a knee movement
in the NFL that

00:54:19.290 --> 00:54:22.230
has players kneeling
during the national anthem.

00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:23.880
Trump has spoken out about it.

00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:27.390
The NFL owners, and
players, and coaches

00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:29.310
have had a difficult
time figuring out

00:54:29.310 --> 00:54:30.900
how they're going
to handle it, how

00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:33.240
they're going to deal with it.

00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:35.910
And out of that, I think
what's interesting is

00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:37.470
that sort of this--

00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:42.220
has come the players
should not be involved.

00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:45.930
The phrase is the shut
up and dribble part

00:54:45.930 --> 00:54:48.240
of this-- that
there's that fallout.

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:51.870
And I'm curious, Pedro,
when you hear somebody say,

00:54:51.870 --> 00:54:54.870
essentially, you shouldn't
care about your community,

00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:58.750
you should just stick to
sports, what's your reaction?

00:54:58.750 --> 00:55:00.070
- That's a no-no for me.

00:55:00.070 --> 00:55:01.297
I think I care about my--

00:55:01.297 --> 00:55:02.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:04.350
I will always care
about my community.

00:55:04.350 --> 00:55:06.660
My community is my strength.

00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:08.910
My community is my support.

00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:13.680
I can't ignore my community,
but at the same time,

00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:23.190
it's so complicated to try to
explain why we see mistakes

00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:28.680
that probably a Dominican
that's not as well educated

00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:31.370
wouldn't commit--

00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:35.720
why are we seeing some mistakes
so high up on the top where

00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:39.820
the leaders of the world are
thinking like little kids

00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:41.022
sometimes?

00:55:41.022 --> 00:55:44.424
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:46.854 --> 00:55:49.000
And just like good
things could be

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:54.070
copied by serving
as an example, I

00:55:54.070 --> 00:55:56.410
think the same message
needs to go to the people--

00:55:56.410 --> 00:55:59.020
the leaders of the world.

00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:02.680
When it comes to the sports, to
the respect for the fan base,

00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:07.210
for the community, for the
people that pay our salaries,

00:56:07.210 --> 00:56:11.500
I think we should continue
to just respect the sport,

00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:14.500
respect the people
that come to see you.

00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:16.060
You should respect your flag.

00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:20.940
You should respect the
integrity of our job.

00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:26.130
We should always take
that in consideration.

00:56:26.130 --> 00:56:30.270
Never forget that
people help people.

00:56:30.270 --> 00:56:35.282
I remember I was
landing in Tampa in 2001

00:56:35.282 --> 00:56:40.414
as those planes were
hitting the twin towers.

00:56:40.414 --> 00:56:41.580
It was early in the morning.

00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:45.780
We had been stranded in New
York for such a long time.

00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:48.510
We were tired, beat up,
getting our luggages

00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:53.790
to our rooms and stuff like
that when that happened.

00:56:53.790 --> 00:57:01.720
And I remember how the entire
country just came together

00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:04.080
and gave each other a hug.

00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:08.870
I don't know how you
felt, but I felt it.

00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:13.080
I felt that, at
that moment, when

00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:19.620
so many innocent
lives were going away,

00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:21.070
that's when we
really got strong.

00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:23.240
We started holding hands.

00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:27.230
It should be the same
way all around the world.

00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:31.800
If a bunch of aliens
came down to erase us,

00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:34.100
we will all be
fighting together.

00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:35.220
So why not here?

00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:37.875
Why not in these
kind of situations?

00:57:37.875 --> 00:57:38.750
Let's stick together.

00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:41.910
People help people, and
people respect people.

00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:45.870
Let's treat everybody
like a human being,

00:57:45.870 --> 00:57:48.200
not really as an individual.

00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:51.320
Humans are humans, and we
all look out for each other,

00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:53.680
and we respect each other.

00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:57.340
That's my point of view
when it comes to that.

00:57:57.340 --> 00:58:00.990
- This panel is
about citizenship.

00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:02.820
We're talking about citizenship.

00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:09.660
It's so great to listen to Pedro
talk, because you're just--

00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:14.910
if you've ever needed a reminder
about what leadership is all

00:58:14.910 --> 00:58:17.610
about, at the end
of the day, it's

00:58:17.610 --> 00:58:22.920
about bringing people together,
not dividing them and tearing

00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:25.080
them apart.

00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:27.380
So I think as a Red Sox--

00:58:27.380 --> 00:58:28.060
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:29.016
--yeah, I agree.

00:58:32.370 --> 00:58:35.220
I grew up a mile
from Fenway Park,

00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:37.490
and we couldn't-- we
just couldn't win.

00:58:37.490 --> 00:58:41.870
We couldn't quite get there in
the '70s, and '80s, and '90s.

00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:48.990
And it took leaders to come
in and bring people together,

00:58:48.990 --> 00:58:52.980
and David Ortiz talks a lot
about Pedro as his mentor.

00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:55.470
So these guys, they
did it together,

00:58:55.470 --> 00:58:58.580
and they showed us
how to win in 2004.

00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:05.210
And then as special as '04 was
and how much it meant to all

00:59:05.210 --> 00:59:08.120
of us, and our
fathers, our mothers--

00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:11.170
in my case, my grandmother--

00:59:11.170 --> 00:59:13.670
it was amazing.

00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:17.240
But Pedro, you talk
about 9/11, and it got

00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:21.080
me thinking about April, 2013.

00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:24.170
And when those bombs went
off at the finish line,

00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:25.700
I guarantee you
every single person

00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:27.470
in this room has
got their own story,

00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:30.830
and they were affected
in some certain way.

00:59:30.830 --> 00:59:37.310
And the Red Sox-- we felt it was
critically important to just do

00:59:37.310 --> 00:59:40.550
everything we could
that year to be

00:59:40.550 --> 00:59:43.250
sort of a part of
the healing process.

00:59:43.250 --> 00:59:47.180
Pam's team was unbelievable
at bringing in survivors

00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:51.710
and their families,
but it was David Ortiz

00:59:51.710 --> 00:59:55.190
who said what needed
to be said on April 20.

00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:58.150
I mean, it's just unbelievable.

00:59:58.150 --> 01:00:00.142
- Didn't put any
makeup on it either.

01:00:00.142 --> 01:00:00.642
- No.

01:00:00.642 --> 01:00:03.400
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:04.960
And when we went
to the White House,

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:07.960
Obama said, you got a hall pass.

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:09.576
You can say whatever you want.

01:00:09.576 --> 01:00:11.730
And David takes a
selfie with him,

01:00:11.730 --> 01:00:13.280
and that's whole other story.

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:17.890
But it really is important,
I think, for organizations

01:00:17.890 --> 01:00:23.590
to support their players and
lift up their status as role

01:00:23.590 --> 01:00:24.640
models, as leaders.

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:26.200
Now, not every
player wants that.

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:30.420
We certainly understand
that, but as an industry,

01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:34.420
as a sports industry,
Commissioner Manfred

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:35.170
and his group--

01:00:35.170 --> 01:00:37.780
I think they're
really working hard

01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:42.310
to try and celebrate the great
personalities and players.

01:00:42.310 --> 01:00:46.330
And with the Red Sox, ever
since I walked through that door

01:00:46.330 --> 01:00:49.930
my first day in
2002, we've had that.

01:00:49.930 --> 01:00:54.040
And we have the next generation
coming behind Pedro and David

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:56.725
with Mookie, and Jackie,
and Xander, and Benintendi,

01:00:56.725 --> 01:00:57.610
and Devers.

01:00:57.610 --> 01:01:02.080
And we're so fortunate to be
a part of this era in Red Sox

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:04.900
baseball, because it
wasn't always like this.

01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:10.210
- Yes, and with success
comes higher ticket prices.

01:01:10.210 --> 01:01:11.650
- This was going so well.

01:01:11.650 --> 01:01:15.970
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:15.970 --> 01:01:18.370
- You may be aware, if you've
gone to a Red Sox game,

01:01:18.370 --> 01:01:20.065
they have one of
the most expensive--

01:01:20.065 --> 01:01:22.250
they call it game experiences.

01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:27.160
That's the combination
of tickets, parking,

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:29.032
and concessions.

01:01:29.032 --> 01:01:30.490
I think they're
actually now ranked

01:01:30.490 --> 01:01:33.460
third behind the Yankees
and Seattle Mariners--

01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:35.800
latest check.

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:38.950
And let's be honest, that
makes the actual game

01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:42.540
inaccessible to a significant
portion of the fan base.

01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:46.497
So you talk about the
importance of representation.

01:01:46.497 --> 01:01:48.080
You've got to have
the representation,

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:49.790
I would think, not
only in the community,

01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:51.790
but also in the ballpark.

01:01:51.790 --> 01:01:54.620
What are you doing
to address that?

01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:56.185
- Well, I'm glad you asked.

01:01:56.185 --> 01:01:57.880
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:00.386
Do you have any other questions
before we come back to that?

01:02:00.386 --> 01:02:00.886
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:00.886 --> 01:02:02.550
- No, I'm just kidding.

01:02:02.550 --> 01:02:06.550
We have very expensive
ticket prices.

01:02:06.550 --> 01:02:09.850
No, we don't hide behind that.

01:02:09.850 --> 01:02:13.450
We have corporate revenue
that we pursue aggressively,

01:02:13.450 --> 01:02:15.800
broadcast revenue that
we pursue aggressively.

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:19.390
We try to stage non-baseball
events to drive revenues.

01:02:19.390 --> 01:02:20.890
We make no bones about that.

01:02:20.890 --> 01:02:24.340
At the end of the day,
we are a business.

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:27.390
We've got a payroll north
of $200 million this year,

01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:30.020
so we do need to run a business.

01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:35.560
That said, I would challenge
your premise and your assertion

01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:38.830
that it's not accessible,
because we have

01:02:38.830 --> 01:02:41.430
to make Fenway Park accessible.

01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:43.480
Look, we talked a
lot about teachers.

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:44.480
My mom was a teacher.

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:47.260
My dad was a teacher in his own
right-- an Episcopal clergyman.

01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:50.380
I got to go to Fenway Park
on his clergy pass for $2.

01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:52.550
So I know what it's
like to have parents

01:02:52.550 --> 01:02:54.550
who can't afford season
tickets or even tickets,

01:02:54.550 --> 01:02:56.380
but to get into Fenway for $2.

01:02:56.380 --> 01:02:58.400
- And you re-instituted
the clergy pass, right?

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:00.150
- And not everyone
has a father who

01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:04.090
is a clergyman, especially if
you're a Kennedy from Boston.

01:03:04.090 --> 01:03:07.670
That's a whole other story
I'll tell you about later.

01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:11.050
But we decided two
years ago that we

01:03:11.050 --> 01:03:15.280
didn't want to have to answer
that question ever again moving

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:16.420
forward.

01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:19.850
So we started our
Student 9 program.

01:03:19.850 --> 01:03:25.150
So now, for every single game,
every year at Fenway Park

01:03:25.150 --> 01:03:27.460
we have $9 tickets
for students--

01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:31.210
high school, middle school,
college, graduate students--

01:03:31.210 --> 01:03:35.230
$9 tickets, less than the
cost of a movie ticket,

01:03:35.230 --> 01:03:37.540
for every single game.

01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:39.430
We have tickets available.

01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:41.560
If we're going to be
approaching a sell out,

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:43.810
we affirmatively
hold back tickets

01:03:43.810 --> 01:03:48.100
to make $9 tickets available
specifically for young people.

01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:50.440
Now, you may get a
standing room ticket.

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:52.720
You may get a seat
behind a pole.

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:55.270
On a night like tonight, you
may get a field box ticket,

01:03:55.270 --> 01:03:58.180
because we're only at
32,000 paid tonight.

01:03:58.180 --> 01:03:59.752
So one of the
benefits-- we sold out

01:03:59.752 --> 01:04:01.960
Fenway Park for nine years
straight, which was great.

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:03.790
We had a wonderful
sellout streak.

01:04:03.790 --> 01:04:07.390
Everyone wanted to
see Pedro and David,

01:04:07.390 --> 01:04:10.810
but one of the benefits
of having more inventory

01:04:10.810 --> 01:04:12.440
is that it is accessible.

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:14.230
So we have this
student ticket program.

01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:17.980
We have $15 tickets, $20
tickets, $25 tickets.

01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:19.686
We have tier five
games, where tickets

01:04:19.686 --> 01:04:20.810
are priced more affordably.

01:04:20.810 --> 01:04:24.310
Yes, we have luxury boxes,
dugout seats, very, very

01:04:24.310 --> 01:04:27.280
expensive tickets in
the Dell EMC Club,

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.650
the State Street
Pavilion, but we sort of

01:04:29.650 --> 01:04:32.680
look at it as the Robin
Hood theory of pricing.

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:35.200
Let's charge
corporations and people

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:37.540
that can afford higher
end ticket prices,

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:40.895
and keep the low end
low so it's accessible.

01:04:40.895 --> 01:04:42.520
The other thing that
we're trying to do

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:46.060
is open up Fenway Park year
round with new and different

01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:48.640
exciting events, whether
it's soccer, outdoor ice

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:52.870
hockey, college football,
ski jumping and snowboarding.

01:04:52.870 --> 01:04:55.570
We're trying to bring in
a new young demographic

01:04:55.570 --> 01:05:00.190
to Fenway Park, because if
you don't care for your sport,

01:05:00.190 --> 01:05:00.970
things can happen.

01:05:00.970 --> 01:05:04.397
If you look at the
state of boxing or horse

01:05:04.397 --> 01:05:05.980
racing in the United
States right now,

01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:08.474
those sports used to
dominate the landscape.

01:05:08.474 --> 01:05:10.140
And we don't ever
take that for granted,

01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:11.740
so we want to get
people into Fenway,

01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:13.840
and we are making it
affordable and accessible.

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:15.800
- And the foundation has
events like Picnic in the Park.

01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:17.424
- Yeah, so this is
my favorite question

01:05:17.424 --> 01:05:19.930
because I get to give away
free tickets as part of my job.

01:05:19.930 --> 01:05:23.710
So actually just in April
we donated out 1,100 tickets

01:05:23.710 --> 01:05:25.340
to the foundation,
which is incredible.

01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:27.420
So I do get--

01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:30.070
I have the fortunate
job of getting access

01:05:30.070 --> 01:05:32.260
to a lot of donated tickets
back from season ticket

01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:34.480
holders either
the day of a game,

01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:36.610
or pre-game, several days out.

01:05:36.610 --> 01:05:39.220
And so what I do with
my team is allocate them

01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:41.020
to nonprofits in the
community that we know

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:42.350
are making an impact.

01:05:42.350 --> 01:05:46.147
And so again, 1,100 in one
month is a good number.

01:05:46.147 --> 01:05:48.230
We continually get tickets
from the team, as well.

01:05:48.230 --> 01:05:50.560
So we have chunks of 75
throughout the season

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:52.990
that we're able to give
out to large groups.

01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:56.080
We have tickets from the team
that we have every single game

01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:59.410
that we're able to donate out to
nonprofits and to organizations

01:05:59.410 --> 01:06:01.447
that are trying to raise
money through raffles,

01:06:01.447 --> 01:06:02.780
or silent auctions, and whatnot.

01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:06.370
So we do have an intentional
effort against making sure

01:06:06.370 --> 01:06:08.500
that we can donate
out to the community

01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:11.046
to make sure we're getting
people in that might not

01:06:11.046 --> 01:06:12.170
have the means to be there.

01:06:12.170 --> 01:06:14.128
So the other thing that
we're making sure to do

01:06:14.128 --> 01:06:16.820
is have other access
points for Red Sox

01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:19.740
nation and/or their fans
to get into the ballpark.

01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:23.180
And so my foundation team
runs about 12 events a year

01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:26.150
varying from Picnic in the
Park, which is we basically put

01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:28.670
on a concert in the outfield.

01:06:28.670 --> 01:06:32.120
And so paid fans
come in, and you get

01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:33.646
to meet every single player.

01:06:33.646 --> 01:06:34.770
We line them up at a table.

01:06:34.770 --> 01:06:37.606
You get an auction, and
you get a picnic blanket,

01:06:37.606 --> 01:06:39.230
and some food, and
some drinks, and you

01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:42.320
get to sit down and hang
out, and hear a band play

01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:43.730
music for the afternoon.

01:06:43.730 --> 01:06:45.830
So it's events like
that that we want

01:06:45.830 --> 01:06:48.980
to make sure we're getting
people into the stadium--

01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:50.277
or Fenway Park.

01:06:50.277 --> 01:06:51.860
I'm still learning
terms for baseball.

01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:52.359
Sorry.

01:06:54.730 --> 01:06:57.675
- Larry Lucchino would never let
you call it a stadium, right,

01:06:57.675 --> 01:06:58.175
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:06:58.175 --> 01:06:59.370
It's a ballpark.

01:06:59.370 --> 01:07:02.499
- Yeah, no, I call Alex Cora
the head coach all the time.

01:07:02.499 --> 01:07:03.040
- Head coach.

01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:03.540
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:05.080
- All the time, all the time.

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:06.764
And spring break, preseason.

01:07:06.764 --> 01:07:09.180
It's just soccer games are
never going to go away from me.

01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:12.165
- And wait until you have to
learn all of those in Spanish.

01:07:12.165 --> 01:07:13.650
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:13.650 --> 01:07:17.610
[APPLAUSE]

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:21.050
- So it's really fun that
we're able to put on different

01:07:21.050 --> 01:07:23.780
events-- like we have concerts
in the right field roof deck

01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:26.720
at much, much, much lower
prices-- sometimes free.

01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:30.120
We can get individuals from the
community into the ballpark.

01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:32.390
- I'm going to turn shortly
to audience questions.

01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:35.270
I know the microphone is going
to be coming down the center

01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:38.540
aisle, and you can line
up to ask questions,

01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:40.580
but while we wait for
that to happen and wait

01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:43.970
for everyone to line up, I
wanted to ask the panelists--

01:07:43.970 --> 01:07:45.450
you mentioned Red Sox nation.

01:07:45.450 --> 01:07:49.020
It's a unique term for this
unique fandom, and I am sure--

01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:52.850
and it speaks to the
devotion of the fan base

01:07:52.850 --> 01:07:54.700
and the far reach
of the fan base.

01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:57.590
So I would like to
hear from each of you

01:07:57.590 --> 01:08:01.010
if there's an experience
you've had that sort of really

01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:05.270
typifies what it is to be one
of the most visible members now

01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:07.520
of Red Sox nation,
if there's been

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:09.890
a moment, an
interaction, something

01:08:09.890 --> 01:08:12.810
that you've experienced
where you're like, wow,

01:08:12.810 --> 01:08:16.970
this is what Red Sox
nation is all about.

01:08:16.970 --> 01:08:17.700
- I have one.

01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:18.859
It's not going to be
as good as Pedro's.

01:08:18.859 --> 01:08:20.775
Let me go first so I
don't have to follow him.

01:08:20.775 --> 01:08:22.424
- I'll be last.

01:08:22.424 --> 01:08:23.420
I'll be the last.

01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:24.960
- So one of my children--

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:25.880
I have three kids--

01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:28.250
goes to a Boston public
school in Dorchester

01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:29.960
called the Henderson,
and I was there

01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:31.520
the other day picking him up.

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:32.990
And I hear from
across the room--

01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:35.430
I'm walking through a hallway,
and this teacher goes,

01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:37.319
can I have your autograph?

01:08:37.319 --> 01:08:38.180
I was like, who?

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:39.770
Is she talking to me?

01:08:39.770 --> 01:08:41.939
And she runs up to me,
and she's like, oh my god,

01:08:41.939 --> 01:08:44.420
I saw you on NESN, and
I'm the biggest Red Sox

01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:45.439
fan in the world.

01:08:45.439 --> 01:08:51.881
And so that has never happened
to me ever, ever, ever.

01:08:51.881 --> 01:08:53.630
Not even when I was a
professional athlete

01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:56.486
has that ever happened,
unless they are five years old

01:08:56.486 --> 01:08:57.319
and a soccer player.

01:08:57.319 --> 01:09:01.760
So to have people that
actually watch pre-game on NESN

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:04.670
is amazing, and that they now
know my face because I'm on TV

01:09:04.670 --> 01:09:07.069
every home Friday
on NESN is amazing.

01:09:07.069 --> 01:09:08.510
So I gave her the autograph.

01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:09.385
No, I'm just kidding.

01:09:09.385 --> 01:09:11.000
I didn't sign an autograph.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.029
So that for me just, I think,
is telling that she, again,

01:09:14.029 --> 01:09:15.229
watched all of--

01:09:15.229 --> 01:09:17.779
I was going to say pre-season--
all of spring training

01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:20.420
and watches every
pre-game on NESN,

01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:21.670
and every single game, course.

01:09:21.670 --> 01:09:25.090
So it's just one small
testament to Red Sox nation.

01:09:25.090 --> 01:09:26.450
- Sam, you're next.

01:09:26.450 --> 01:09:29.880
- I'll never forget
getting off the plane

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:34.899
after coming back from St. Louis
and Pedro was grabbing laptops.

01:09:34.899 --> 01:09:36.649
Remember we were teasing Theo?

01:09:36.649 --> 01:09:41.779
And we rolled right
into the parade,

01:09:41.779 --> 01:09:46.189
and obviously I'm back office--

01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:48.649
front office, but you're in
the background, where you

01:09:48.649 --> 01:09:51.410
should be behind the scenes.

01:09:51.410 --> 01:09:54.620
But thanks to Mayor
Menino at the time,

01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:58.430
we were all allowed as
front office members

01:09:58.430 --> 01:10:01.850
to go on the floats
in the parade.

01:10:01.850 --> 01:10:05.420
So that was sort
of our 90 minutes

01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:08.150
of feeling like a rock star.

01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:10.910
You would just look at these
people in office buildings,

01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:13.410
and wave to them, and
they would just go crazy,

01:10:13.410 --> 01:10:15.080
and you'd say wow,
this is pretty cool.

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:17.684
And my wife, who was on the
float with me, kept saying,

01:10:17.684 --> 01:10:18.350
stop doing that.

01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:19.270
They're not here for you.

01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:19.770
Shut up.

01:10:19.770 --> 01:10:21.154
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:21.154 --> 01:10:25.030
But I don't know how many
people were actually there,

01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:28.210
but I think it was close
to five million people.

01:10:28.210 --> 01:10:31.212
I mean, it had been 86
years, and the estimates--

01:10:31.212 --> 01:10:32.920
I heard all sorts of
different estimates,

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:36.795
but now I sound like Donald
Trump promoting how many people

01:10:36.795 --> 01:10:37.990
were at the inauguration.

01:10:37.990 --> 01:10:38.489
Sorry.

01:10:38.489 --> 01:10:40.290
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:40.290 --> 01:10:45.370
It was a lot of people,
and it was really loud,

01:10:45.370 --> 01:10:51.060
and it was an unbelievable
feeling that I'll never forget.

01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:58.180
- Well, you were talking about
giving away tickets and stuff,

01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:05.050
and talking about Fenway Park, I
might be the most unique person

01:11:05.050 --> 01:11:08.755
for the most unique place
for the most unique fan

01:11:08.755 --> 01:11:13.540
base and the most loyal fan
base I've ever seen in Boston.

01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:15.340
And let me tell you why.

01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:19.420
I was here for seven years,
and I took the mound--

01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:22.090
every single time
I took the mound,

01:11:22.090 --> 01:11:24.310
it wasn't a baseball game.

01:11:24.310 --> 01:11:28.810
It was an event at Fenway.

01:11:28.810 --> 01:11:33.010
And I never threw
a pitch in Boston

01:11:33.010 --> 01:11:37.850
since I got here that the
stadium wasn't sold out.

01:11:37.850 --> 01:11:40.530
And why am I saying this?

01:11:40.530 --> 01:11:47.190
I've never seen a game
from sitting in the stadium

01:11:47.190 --> 01:11:50.870
that Fenway is the
most unique place--

01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:55.360
and I'm saying this with pride--

01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:59.770
Fenway is the most unique place
that a big leaguer can probably

01:11:59.770 --> 01:12:03.750
think of to pitch a
game or to play a game.

01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:10.040
And at the same time, I'm
saying this because I believe,

01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:15.590
expensive or not expensive,
this is the most loyal fan base

01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:16.760
in all of baseball.

01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:17.600
And I'm sorry.

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:20.590
We're not disrespecting
any other organization.

01:12:20.590 --> 01:12:21.090
- That's OK.

01:12:21.090 --> 01:12:21.881
You can disrespect.

01:12:21.881 --> 01:12:23.170
[LAUGHTER]

01:12:23.170 --> 01:12:26.540
- This is the fan base.

01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:29.543
This is Red Sox nation.

01:12:29.543 --> 01:12:33.391
[APPLAUSE]

01:12:35.315 --> 01:12:38.030
That was the biggest
impression for me.

01:12:38.030 --> 01:12:43.300
It was the fact that I never got
to pitch a game without Fenway

01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:47.380
being sold out, and that
showed me a lot about loyalty,

01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:51.520
because you had your heart
broken many times way before I

01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:54.250
got here and after I got here.

01:12:54.250 --> 01:12:59.226
But thanks to god,
we made it up.

01:12:59.226 --> 01:13:02.579
[APPLAUSE]

01:13:04.495 --> 01:13:06.180
- We'll turn to
audience questions now.

01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:07.770
If you could just identify
yourself before you

01:13:07.770 --> 01:13:08.490
ask your question.

01:13:08.490 --> 01:13:08.990
- Sure.

01:13:08.990 --> 01:13:11.940
My name is Matthew, and
I'm a freshman at Harvard.

01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:14.640
I spent the past two
summers teaching in Samana

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:15.890
in the Dominican Republic.

01:13:15.890 --> 01:13:16.390
- Really?

01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:17.370
Beautiful place, huh?

01:13:17.370 --> 01:13:18.690
- Yeah, I agree.

01:13:18.690 --> 01:13:20.580
So my question is for Pedro.

01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:22.160
So first of all, [SPANISH].

01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:24.520
- [SPANISH].

01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:26.710
- [SPANISH].

01:13:26.710 --> 01:13:27.960
- [SPANISH].

01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:29.430
- [SPANISH].

01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:31.890
So my question is,
what do you think

01:13:31.890 --> 01:13:33.810
needs to happen in
the Dominican Republic

01:13:33.810 --> 01:13:35.970
to reduce poverty
within the country?

01:13:35.970 --> 01:13:40.220
And do you think that
baseball has a role in that?

01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:43.190
- Baseball not
only has a role, I

01:13:43.190 --> 01:13:48.890
think it's a great ambassador
for the young athletes

01:13:48.890 --> 01:13:52.190
that we have, but
always remember

01:13:52.190 --> 01:13:55.170
not everybody is going to get
the opportunity to be a Pedro

01:13:55.170 --> 01:13:57.170
Martinez, a David Ortiz, or--

01:13:57.170 --> 01:14:00.230
as many players as you
hear from Dominican,

01:14:00.230 --> 01:14:03.470
there are far more
that fail on the way

01:14:03.470 --> 01:14:06.800
over to the big leagues.

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:08.000
Put it this way.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:14.820
1 out of 450 will be probably
an accurate average--

01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:17.620
will probably make it
to the 40 man roster,

01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:19.960
have an opportunity to
play in the big leagues.

01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:25.320
That's not counting establishing
himself in the big leagues.

01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:28.920
What makes you a big
leaguer is the consistency,

01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:31.629
and not all the time
you get a player

01:14:31.629 --> 01:14:33.670
that's going to be consistent
in the big leagues.

01:14:33.670 --> 01:14:38.650
And that's what gets you money,
too, is being consistent.

01:14:38.650 --> 01:14:41.080
And for the
Dominican Republic, I

01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:46.400
think the first step
that needs to be taken

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:52.834
is to get rid of corruption in
the system from top to bottom.

01:14:52.834 --> 01:14:54.250
The Dominican
Republic is corrupt.

01:14:56.810 --> 01:15:02.750
I'm not saying it's
everybody, but the politicians

01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:05.300
have a bad rap around them.

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:08.040
And I'm not saying
it's all of them,

01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:10.530
but the system is messed up.

01:15:10.530 --> 01:15:15.210
And that's where new
leaders have to be born,

01:15:15.210 --> 01:15:20.880
and education needs to be
the center of the Dominican

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:22.620
Republic right along with Haiti.

01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:25.470
For people that don't
know, Dominican and Haiti

01:15:25.470 --> 01:15:28.340
share the island
divided by a river.

01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:30.270
It has no walls.

01:15:30.270 --> 01:15:32.020
You see as many
Haitians right now

01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:35.940
and you see Dominicans,
as you see Venezuelans.

01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:37.470
There's no borders there.

01:15:37.470 --> 01:15:39.000
There's not really.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.710
There's no order.

01:15:40.710 --> 01:15:43.300
So that's why we struggle
more, and more, and more.

01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:49.780
And the education system is
one of the worst in the world,

01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:52.300
and that needs to be addressed.

01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:55.450
The corruption needs to go
away so that people don't start

01:15:55.450 --> 01:15:58.590
thinking about filling
their pockets in order

01:15:58.590 --> 01:16:01.770
for the Dominican to
become a little bit better.

01:16:01.770 --> 01:16:03.945
And it's not any time soon.

01:16:03.945 --> 01:16:06.510
It takes a lot of
work, but I think

01:16:06.510 --> 01:16:10.020
getting rid of corrupt
people that are there

01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:11.540
to fill up their pockets--

01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:13.040
right along with Haiti, too.

01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:14.565
It's the same problem.

01:16:14.565 --> 01:16:17.744
It's the same
problem that we have.

01:16:17.744 --> 01:16:19.160
If we don't get
rid of that and we

01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:21.720
center ourself
towards education,

01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:25.350
and putting it in the
hands of people that

01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:29.130
want to be clean and want
to have a better future,

01:16:29.130 --> 01:16:32.344
we're standing in front
of a lot of struggles.

01:16:32.344 --> 01:16:32.844
- Thank you.

01:16:37.190 --> 01:16:40.410
- Hi, my name is Brian.

01:16:40.410 --> 01:16:44.580
One thing that disappoints me--
and maybe you could explain why

01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:45.810
this is--

01:16:45.810 --> 01:16:50.440
so many diehard sports
fans in Boston--

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:51.900
maybe across the country--

01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:58.910
are really misinformed
in American politics.

01:16:58.910 --> 01:17:00.520
So many of them
are right wingers,

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:02.510
and they're diehard Republicans.

01:17:02.510 --> 01:17:06.130
They're so loyal to Republicans
it's like their sports team.

01:17:06.130 --> 01:17:10.970
Why don't more players step
up, use their platform,

01:17:10.970 --> 01:17:17.430
use their position of
loyalty that they have,

01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:24.060
and educate their own fan base,
and endorse specific candidates

01:17:24.060 --> 01:17:26.530
for political office?

01:17:26.530 --> 01:17:28.410
It just seems to be so rare.

01:17:28.410 --> 01:17:32.460
And I'm not talking about
the people in this room,

01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:35.400
but I'm saying from my
experience, and observation,

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:39.370
and listening to talk radio,
and sports talk radio,

01:17:39.370 --> 01:17:40.290
it just seems--

01:17:40.290 --> 01:17:42.330
- I have some advice
for you on that topic--

01:17:42.330 --> 01:17:43.810
don't listen.

01:17:43.810 --> 01:17:45.100
[LAUGHTER]

01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:48.660
Turn it off-- country-western.

01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:52.770
Let me take a shot
of that, Pedro.

01:17:52.770 --> 01:17:57.780
I think the premise
is flawed that,

01:17:57.780 --> 01:18:05.280
just because someone like
Pedro Martinez or David Ortiz

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:08.106
has the ability and
the willingness--

01:18:08.106 --> 01:18:09.480
or let me throw
our another name,

01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:12.270
Curt Schilling-- have the
ability and willingness

01:18:12.270 --> 01:18:15.420
to speak out, and
they have a platform,

01:18:15.420 --> 01:18:19.440
doesn't mean that
all athletes, or even

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:23.820
the majority of athletes,
are comfortable doing that.

01:18:23.820 --> 01:18:28.530
And I can give you
a firm example.

01:18:28.530 --> 01:18:33.180
Last year, in the wake of
the Adam Jones incident,

01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:36.300
we had many one on
one conversations,

01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:39.720
group conversations with
guys in our clubhouse--

01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:41.520
and they'll remain nameless--

01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:44.490
who are young in their
career and just simply said,

01:18:44.490 --> 01:18:48.390
you know, I'm not comfortable
talking about issues of race

01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:50.550
or issues of politics.

01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:53.870
And so it's not
for every player.

01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:57.630
They're asked to
do a lot of things,

01:18:57.630 --> 01:19:01.290
and I'd also say
that, while players--

01:19:01.290 --> 01:19:03.960
it's great to celebrate
players' social views

01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:07.380
or have them speak up on
different things from time

01:19:07.380 --> 01:19:09.070
to time--

01:19:09.070 --> 01:19:15.660
there are a lot of sports fans
that I hear from that say,

01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:16.470
enough.

01:19:16.470 --> 01:19:19.170
I turn on MSNBC
and Fox News, and I

01:19:19.170 --> 01:19:23.235
hear Trump this or Obama
that, or Charlie Baker this,

01:19:23.235 --> 01:19:24.480
and Marty Walsh that.

01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:28.530
I want to watch sports
to get away from it.

01:19:28.530 --> 01:19:30.040
I want to enjoy sports.

01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:35.360
I don't want these issues of
the day brought into sports.

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:37.860
So it's a tricky issue,
I think, for players,

01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:40.470
and you put a lot of
pressure on players

01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:43.890
who might not be comfortable
dealing or speaking out

01:19:43.890 --> 01:19:47.160
on these issues, because
every word you said

01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:49.860
gets dissected over,
and over, and over.

01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:52.420
And unless you're the
great Pedro Martinez,

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:54.340
who can say whatever he wants--

01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:55.410
- Not really.

01:19:55.410 --> 01:19:56.920
[LAUGHTER]

01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:59.030
- It's a lot of pressure
on these players.

01:19:59.030 --> 01:20:01.980
- There's social media
right there looking at us.

01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:03.180
Everything is documented.

01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:05.820
You have to really
be cautious now.

01:20:05.820 --> 01:20:10.390
Plus, let me bring something
from a baseball player's

01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:12.390
probably standpoint.

01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:14.810
The season is so long.

01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:18.730
We're always 24/7,
like you hear in WEEI--

01:20:18.730 --> 01:20:22.360
24/7 talking sports.

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:27.540
We're under the scrutiny
every single moment.

01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:29.880
And I was saying
that earlier, too.

01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:33.140
It's hard to believe that
a 20-year-old is going

01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:37.980
to be held responsible for
probably something so small

01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:43.440
like cursing at someone
over having a bad day.

01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:44.940
And it's documented.

01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:47.670
You throw it out
there in social media,

01:20:47.670 --> 01:20:50.550
and it's right away
blown out of proportion

01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:54.030
that this guy is a bad guy,
or he has a bad attitude just

01:20:54.030 --> 01:20:57.740
because he was young,
snapped one time,

01:20:57.740 --> 01:21:01.180
and he was caught
on a cell phone.

01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:04.650
That's how simple it is for
a player to get in trouble.

01:21:04.650 --> 01:21:10.660
And sometimes they just want
to really concentrate on

01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:12.640
the long season they have.

01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:14.620
They're busy thinking,
how am I going

01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:19.760
to figure out the little slump
that I'm going at 20 years old?

01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:24.700
And all I want to do is really
play baseball and let the older

01:21:24.700 --> 01:21:29.380
guys, or the guys that are
ready to explain those things go

01:21:29.380 --> 01:21:33.100
do it instead of me having to
take that load on my shoulder

01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:36.160
when I don't really understand
what I'm going to say,

01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:38.860
maybe because of lack
of experience, too.

01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:41.980
So they try to simplify
things, and baseball

01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:44.279
is really complicated.

01:21:44.279 --> 01:21:45.820
And for a long
season, where you want

01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:48.580
to be established as
a baseball player,

01:21:48.580 --> 01:21:51.700
you don't want any
distractions, so you try

01:21:51.700 --> 01:21:54.556
to stay away from those things.

01:21:54.556 --> 01:21:55.972
- Thank you.

01:21:55.972 --> 01:21:59.750
[APPLAUSE]

01:21:59.750 --> 01:22:02.070
- Hi, I'm Maggie, and I'm
a sophomore at Harvard.

01:22:02.070 --> 01:22:05.900
So that means that I would have
been in first grade in 2004,

01:22:05.900 --> 01:22:10.172
and one of my favorite memories
is my parents running upstairs

01:22:10.172 --> 01:22:12.380
to wake me up after my
brother and I had already gone

01:22:12.380 --> 01:22:14.870
to bed to come back down
and watch the ninth inning.

01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:16.370
So I was hoping
that you could share

01:22:16.370 --> 01:22:20.060
one of your favorite
baseball memories.

01:22:20.060 --> 01:22:22.710
- My favorite memory--

01:22:22.710 --> 01:22:25.680
and it still rings my head--

01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:27.460
is just coming that morning.

01:22:30.030 --> 01:22:32.660
It was like the last out.

01:22:32.660 --> 01:22:33.750
Took forever.

01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:36.900
For a guy that had been
in the baseball field

01:22:36.900 --> 01:22:41.790
for so long that surely
should understand what

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:45.590
finishing a game is
like, the anxiety

01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:51.650
that I had to see that last
out be recorded for Boston

01:22:51.650 --> 01:22:55.610
seems to me like it
was in slow motion.

01:22:55.610 --> 01:23:00.900
And ever since we
got that last out,

01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:04.090
it was like a dream
come true for me.

01:23:04.090 --> 01:23:07.300
And when I finally got
here in the morning,

01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:11.456
and Sam is talking about so
many things that I probably did.

01:23:11.456 --> 01:23:12.720
[LAUGHTER]

01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:15.130
- It was a fun, fun flight.

01:23:15.130 --> 01:23:18.630
When I was about to
step out of the bus,

01:23:18.630 --> 01:23:22.350
I had the trophy in my hands,
and the oldest players--

01:23:22.350 --> 01:23:27.250
the oldest player that we had
in the team was Ellis Burks.

01:23:27.250 --> 01:23:30.050
He told me, Pedro,
wait a minute.

01:23:30.050 --> 01:23:32.390
I know you're the one
handing it out to Boston,

01:23:32.390 --> 01:23:34.580
but I want to be the
one receiving it,

01:23:34.580 --> 01:23:36.410
because he went
through the struggles.

01:23:36.410 --> 01:23:38.080
I don't know if you
remember, but Ellis

01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:41.180
was part of those teams
that got their heart broken.

01:23:41.180 --> 01:23:46.970
He goes, I want to be part
of what you helped create.

01:23:46.970 --> 01:23:47.970
And I went.

01:23:47.970 --> 01:23:50.960
I took the step on the
last step of the bus,

01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:55.410
and I handed the trophy
to the land in Boston.

01:23:55.410 --> 01:23:59.550
That was, to me,
the biggest memory.

01:23:59.550 --> 01:24:04.950
The last out was great, but the
trophy meant, Boston, here you

01:24:04.950 --> 01:24:06.420
have it.

01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:09.379
Now I'm totally
settled with Boston.

01:24:09.379 --> 01:24:11.874
[LAUGHTER]

01:24:11.874 --> 01:24:14.868
[APPLAUSE]

01:24:14.868 --> 01:24:17.862
- That's so good.

01:24:17.862 --> 01:24:18.860
So good.

01:24:18.860 --> 01:24:21.150
- Hi, I'm Jay.

01:24:21.150 --> 01:24:22.680
Last time I went
to a Red Sox game

01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:24.760
it cost $1 to sit
in the bleachers.

01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:26.640
That was in '75.

01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:29.280
So I think we have to give Mr.
Yawkey a little bit of credit

01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:31.590
of keeping the game accessible
to the working class,

01:24:31.590 --> 01:24:33.060
not just to students.

01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:36.210
And it seems to me that
lately over the years

01:24:36.210 --> 01:24:38.460
the game has become more
of a marketing vehicle

01:24:38.460 --> 01:24:41.970
for advertising than it
has for sports or community

01:24:41.970 --> 01:24:42.570
development.

01:24:42.570 --> 01:24:43.560
You go to the stadium.

01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:45.240
It's saturated with ads.

01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:47.700
The broadcasts are all
saturated with ads.

01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:50.550
This is really a means not of
developing community spirit,

01:24:50.550 --> 01:24:53.500
but of integrating out groups
into a consumerist society,

01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:55.490
isn't it, more than anything?

01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:57.630
- Is that a Boston
Globe reporter, or?

01:24:57.630 --> 01:24:58.920
[LAUGHTER]

01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:00.620
I appreciate you question.

01:25:00.620 --> 01:25:05.580
And it's interesting, if you
look at photos from the 1920s,

01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:12.805
and '30s, and '40s, you'll
see ads on the Green Monster.

01:25:12.805 --> 01:25:17.840
I mean, you're not wrong in that
we have to generate revenues

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:23.580
as a company, as a club,
because we have players to pay.

01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:26.260
We have front
office folks to pay.

01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:28.860
So it is a business,
and we recognize that,

01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:33.000
but we also recognize the
Red Sox here in this market

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:33.900
are so much more.

01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:35.250
It's a public trust.

01:25:35.250 --> 01:25:39.160
And I can tell you, having
worked there, since day one--

01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:43.890
February 27, 2002-- when
John Henry, and Tom Werner,

01:25:43.890 --> 01:25:46.972
and Larry Lucchino arrived
as the new owners, 17 years

01:25:46.972 --> 01:25:48.930
in they're still the new
owners of the Red Sox.

01:25:48.930 --> 01:25:50.430
It's what we do in Boston.

01:25:50.430 --> 01:25:54.540
It takes 30 years to
get native status.

01:25:54.540 --> 01:25:57.510
These guys, they care.

01:25:57.510 --> 01:26:01.200
We've had some high highs,
like '04, and '07, and '13.

01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:03.795
We've had some low
lows, but they care.

01:26:03.795 --> 01:26:05.460
And we are doing
everything we can

01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:07.500
to be active participants
in the community,

01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:09.540
to give back through
the foundation,

01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:11.401
through our community outreach.

01:26:11.401 --> 01:26:12.900
I mentioned how
we're trying to keep

01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:16.110
ticket prices affordable
for tier five games,

01:26:16.110 --> 01:26:19.200
tier four games, having lower
prices to complement the higher

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:20.190
prices.

01:26:20.190 --> 01:26:22.860
But we do recognize
it is expensive,

01:26:22.860 --> 01:26:26.050
and we appreciate the
fan support that we get.

01:26:26.050 --> 01:26:29.190
And at the end of the
day, it is a business,

01:26:29.190 --> 01:26:31.054
so we have to balance
that challenge.

01:26:34.830 --> 01:26:36.480
- Hi, my name is Duncan.

01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:39.550
This is my 40th year as a season
ticket holder for the Sox.

01:26:39.550 --> 01:26:40.050
- Thank you.

01:26:40.050 --> 01:26:43.140
- And through those
years, I've coached my son

01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:45.220
in Little League
and travel teams,

01:26:45.220 --> 01:26:47.850
watched a lot of high
school, college baseball.

01:26:47.850 --> 01:26:49.170
I'm a baseball junkie.

01:26:49.170 --> 01:26:55.200
And I just get very concerned
in the youth of America

01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:57.480
that interest in
baseball is fading.

01:26:57.480 --> 01:26:59.760
And a lot of it to me I
think is because baseball--

01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:01.468
I think hitting a
baseball is the hardest

01:27:01.468 --> 01:27:03.450
thing to do in sports,
and so a lot of people

01:27:03.450 --> 01:27:06.821
give up in instant mediocrity,
and lacrosse, and off you go.

01:27:06.821 --> 01:27:07.320
[LAUGHTER]

01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:11.670
But it's inner city kids,
suburban kids, whatever.

01:27:11.670 --> 01:27:14.910
And what major league baseball
has done in Latin America

01:27:14.910 --> 01:27:17.912
with the camps, and the
academies, raising kids up

01:27:17.912 --> 01:27:20.120
and everything, why can't
we do that in America, too,

01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:22.730
and maybe get the
interest back in?

01:27:22.730 --> 01:27:26.590
- Well, I'll kick it to
Bekah and Pedro for a minute,

01:27:26.590 --> 01:27:30.960
but we do have a bit of
an image or a PR problem.

01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:32.830
I don't think so
much in New England,

01:27:32.830 --> 01:27:37.650
but we have 75
million fans attending

01:27:37.650 --> 01:27:42.030
our games, which is more than
all of the other major sports

01:27:42.030 --> 01:27:43.710
combined.

01:27:43.710 --> 01:27:48.000
We have more consumers
consuming baseball

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.130
as a product on
television, and radio,

01:27:50.130 --> 01:27:52.600
on the internet than
the other sports given

01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:55.550
the amount of games, the
amount of inventory we have.

01:27:55.550 --> 01:27:58.740
And there was a very,
very bright spot

01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:01.560
at the last major league
baseball owners meetings,

01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:04.050
where we learned
for the second time

01:28:04.050 --> 01:28:06.450
in two years over
the last two years

01:28:06.450 --> 01:28:09.240
participation rates
in baseball have

01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:14.970
increased by 2.5 million people
from '16 to '17, which is big.

01:28:14.970 --> 01:28:18.240
So we're just under 25
million boys and girls

01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:21.120
playing baseball and
softball, and that's

01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:22.710
something to be celebrated.

01:28:22.710 --> 01:28:24.210
It's seven or eight
times the amount

01:28:24.210 --> 01:28:26.790
of young people playing
lacrosse, for example,

01:28:26.790 --> 01:28:28.320
the sport that you [INAUDIBLE].

01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:30.750
So I really do
think it's something

01:28:30.750 --> 01:28:34.410
that-- we need to focus on that
product to make sure that kids

01:28:34.410 --> 01:28:37.310
have the excess, and they
fall in love with it,

01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:41.370
but I think baseball, especially
in New England, is healthy.

01:28:41.370 --> 01:28:43.320
I think one major
issue we have--

01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:47.820
you mentioned it-- is
the infection of AAU

01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:50.316
and club sports
coming into baseball.

01:28:50.316 --> 01:28:51.690
And Bekah, maybe
you want to talk

01:28:51.690 --> 01:28:54.930
about that, given your
experience as a youth athlete.

01:28:54.930 --> 01:28:57.240
You really need to have
kids playing and not

01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:00.420
turning to these pay
for play programs

01:29:00.420 --> 01:29:01.410
and playing year round.

01:29:01.410 --> 01:29:03.368
I think you're better
off playing Little League

01:29:03.368 --> 01:29:04.700
and then playing another sport.

01:29:04.700 --> 01:29:07.489
- Yeah, and that's why we invest
so heavily in the RBI program,

01:29:07.489 --> 01:29:09.030
making sure that we
can have close to

01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:11.670
over 700 inner city
Boston young people

01:29:11.670 --> 01:29:14.427
participating in baseball and
softball every single summer,

01:29:14.427 --> 01:29:16.510
and we actually have seen
retention there growing.

01:29:16.510 --> 01:29:18.009
One of the things
we're trying to do

01:29:18.009 --> 01:29:21.139
is build in some social and
emotional development, gender

01:29:21.139 --> 01:29:23.430
specific social and emotional
development, particularly

01:29:23.430 --> 01:29:25.050
for young girls,
to ensure that we

01:29:25.050 --> 01:29:27.600
can have them coming back
and having a fun experience.

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:29.558
I was actually just in
Springfield this morning

01:29:29.558 --> 01:29:33.254
with MLB running a
clinic for 150 fourth

01:29:33.254 --> 01:29:34.920
through sixth graders
out there, and had

01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:37.620
an interesting conversation
with the gentleman that

01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:39.560
runs their community
relations department.

01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:41.460
And hearing them talk
about their investment

01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:43.626
that they're going to be
making across the country--

01:29:43.626 --> 01:29:45.900
he was just telling me
about a 24 hour game

01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:47.490
that they're playing out in--

01:29:47.490 --> 01:29:48.781
I was going to say Springfield.

01:29:48.781 --> 01:29:49.550
Not Springfield.

01:29:49.550 --> 01:29:51.730
Alaska-- not even
close to Springfield.

01:29:51.730 --> 01:29:55.710
So they're going out there to do
a whole 24 hour midnight game.

01:29:55.710 --> 01:29:57.600
And he was talking
about going to Hawaii.

01:29:57.600 --> 01:29:59.308
I'll definitely try
to get into that one.

01:29:59.308 --> 01:29:59.880
[LAUGHTER]

01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:01.440
But they are really
being intentional

01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:03.624
about going into communities
and doing what-- one

01:30:03.624 --> 01:30:05.790
of the programs they have
is called Play Ball, which

01:30:05.790 --> 01:30:07.420
is literally just fun.

01:30:07.420 --> 01:30:12.287
It's bringing out Wiffle balls,
softballs, and soft bats,

01:30:12.287 --> 01:30:13.620
and teaching kids how to ground.

01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:14.640
There's no mitts.

01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:16.557
So everything is
really, really basic,

01:30:16.557 --> 01:30:17.640
but there's music playing.

01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:21.300
It's making sure young people
have a fun initial experience

01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:23.176
with the sport to
hopefully build a retention

01:30:23.176 --> 01:30:25.341
and love for the game so
that they keep coming back,

01:30:25.341 --> 01:30:26.230
because you're right.

01:30:26.230 --> 01:30:28.920
I think we are losing
out to elite athletes

01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:31.770
that want to only be
specific in one sport,

01:30:31.770 --> 01:30:35.160
and that they don't want to be
diversified in their portfolio,

01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:38.160
to be fairly formal.

01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:40.800
But I really believe in having
young people participate in

01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:43.920
as many sports as possible as
young as possible to really

01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:47.610
be exposed to the game, because
it's a beautiful thing, A,

01:30:47.610 --> 01:30:50.362
and, B, obviously we know
that there is a proven--

01:30:50.362 --> 01:30:52.320
I know there is a proven
link between academics

01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:52.930
and athletics.

01:30:52.930 --> 01:30:54.870
And so when you can introduce
sports to young people,

01:30:54.870 --> 01:30:56.703
they're going to be
academically successful.

01:30:56.703 --> 01:30:59.130
So all that to say
I think there is

01:30:59.130 --> 01:31:02.250
an intentional effort with
MLB and us to make sure

01:31:02.250 --> 01:31:03.300
we're investing deeply.

01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:07.210
We fund over 200 Mass Little
League programs right now.

01:31:07.210 --> 01:31:10.140
So enabling 3,000 young
people to play sports

01:31:10.140 --> 01:31:12.180
across Massachusetts
is incredible.

01:31:12.180 --> 01:31:14.748
So we're making the investment,
and we know the importance

01:31:14.748 --> 01:31:15.248
there.

01:31:20.410 --> 01:31:21.820
- My name is Sal Bolanos.

01:31:21.820 --> 01:31:23.920
I live and work in Boston.

01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:27.760
Part time student
here at Harvard.

01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:28.780
Combat veteran.

01:31:28.780 --> 01:31:32.380
I met you at the Army-Navy
game last week, Sam.

01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:34.770
[SPANISH], Pedro?

01:31:34.770 --> 01:31:36.570
- Gracias [SPANISH].

01:31:36.570 --> 01:31:39.730
- Anyway, two part question.

01:31:39.730 --> 01:31:41.830
You have a way
with words, Pedro.

01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:43.505
- [INAUDIBLE].

01:31:43.505 --> 01:31:44.380
- People help people.

01:31:44.380 --> 01:31:45.310
- Way with words.

01:31:45.310 --> 01:31:48.220
- Humans are humans.

01:31:48.220 --> 01:31:51.290
Who, in baseball,
has helped you not

01:31:51.290 --> 01:31:54.590
only adjust to
the baseball life,

01:31:54.590 --> 01:31:57.450
but in life in
the United States?

01:31:57.450 --> 01:32:01.300
And also, who have
you mentored as far

01:32:01.300 --> 01:32:05.680
as adjusting to life
in baseball and being

01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:09.140
an immigrant in this country?

01:32:09.140 --> 01:32:11.210
- Thank you.

01:32:11.210 --> 01:32:14.580
That's great, and
some great questions.

01:32:14.580 --> 01:32:22.530
First of all, I must
say faith in god--

01:32:22.530 --> 01:32:25.800
basic in our house.

01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:29.370
Mom and dad, the influence.

01:32:29.370 --> 01:32:32.500
Most of the things that
you probably don't relate

01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:35.750
to baseball, but they are.

01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:39.510
When they teach
you to be strong,

01:32:39.510 --> 01:32:43.630
to work, to do all
those things, they're

01:32:43.630 --> 01:32:46.710
holding you responsible.

01:32:46.710 --> 01:32:51.010
And they want you to
be the best that you

01:32:51.010 --> 01:32:53.430
can be in everything you do.

01:32:57.150 --> 01:33:02.250
If I start mentioning names of
people that really influenced

01:33:02.250 --> 01:33:07.640
my way of being, my way of
thinking, and my experience,

01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:10.910
I probably wouldn't
finish tonight,

01:33:10.910 --> 01:33:15.410
but I would have to
say that the base--

01:33:15.410 --> 01:33:16.790
and I will say it again.

01:33:16.790 --> 01:33:22.430
It's all about the base,
because we do have here a base

01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:23.600
program that we visit.

01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:27.560
And that was, I guess,
the national anthem

01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:31.280
that they have at the base.

01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:34.360
The base-- it's all
about the base to me.

01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:35.570
It was all about the base.

01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:44.610
How my mom and dad were
able to raise us right

01:33:44.610 --> 01:33:51.310
and make us strong to
actually face adversity,

01:33:51.310 --> 01:33:57.640
and face whatever we
had to face, and also

01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:00.550
be respectful of
what we were doing

01:34:00.550 --> 01:34:03.730
and respect human
beings as human beings.

01:34:03.730 --> 01:34:08.140
Like you said, a human helps a
human, and I said it earlier.

01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:11.650
It's all because of my mom
and dad and the strong faith

01:34:11.650 --> 01:34:15.166
and belief that they
introduced to us.

01:34:15.166 --> 01:34:15.666
- Gracias.

01:34:19.090 --> 01:34:21.130
- Hi, my name's David.

01:34:21.130 --> 01:34:23.600
My last Little League
season was in 1999,

01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:25.250
which was Pedro prime time.

01:34:25.250 --> 01:34:30.007
So I'd love to ask him about
Don Zimmer or his amazing change

01:34:30.007 --> 01:34:35.070
up, which, by the
way, 25% of batters

01:34:35.070 --> 01:34:37.322
swung and missed at
the change up in 2002,

01:34:37.322 --> 01:34:39.030
and that wasn't even
Pedro's best season.

01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:39.571
- Statistics.

01:34:39.571 --> 01:34:41.270
[LAUGHTER]

01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:44.350
- So, but I have to ask
Sam a question, which

01:34:44.350 --> 01:34:45.940
is you talked about
the pain that you

01:34:45.940 --> 01:34:49.870
felt when you heard what had
happened with Adam Jones.

01:34:49.870 --> 01:34:52.870
And I think all of us
who grew up as fans

01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:57.280
and feel the way you do can also
read the history about Jackie

01:34:57.280 --> 01:35:00.550
Robinson's sham tryout
at Fenway and feel

01:35:00.550 --> 01:35:04.900
that same type of pain,
and shock, and really

01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:08.740
embarrassment, because this is a
team that we feel ownership of.

01:35:08.740 --> 01:35:13.900
So with that in mind, why isn't
the Yawkey Morse code coming

01:35:13.900 --> 01:35:16.130
off the Green Monster?

01:35:16.130 --> 01:35:19.790
- A very timely question
and something that we've

01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:22.560
been talking about internally.

01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:25.970
For right now, we have
decided that we're

01:35:25.970 --> 01:35:32.360
going to keep recognition
of Mr. And Mrs. Yawkey that

01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:34.580
exist inside the ballpark.

01:35:34.580 --> 01:35:37.040
Tom Yawkey's in the
Red Sox hall of fame.

01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:39.900
He's in the Cooperstown
hall of fame,

01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:43.610
and the Morse code initials
have been on that board

01:35:43.610 --> 01:35:45.260
since the '70s.

01:35:45.260 --> 01:35:50.600
And really our thinking
around that could change,

01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:55.910
but right now we've been focused
on the message of inclusion

01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:56.990
at the ballpark.

01:35:56.990 --> 01:36:03.350
And the name on the front door
where 85%, 90% of our fans

01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:06.530
come through gate A
and gate D has been

01:36:06.530 --> 01:36:08.780
what we've been focused on.

01:36:08.780 --> 01:36:16.550
And you have a tricky time
going back and looking

01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:18.810
at the history of
every single player,

01:36:18.810 --> 01:36:22.190
for example, that's been
recognized in the Hall of Fame

01:36:22.190 --> 01:36:25.880
either in Cooperstown
or with the Red Sox,

01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:27.890
but that's where
we are right now,

01:36:27.890 --> 01:36:33.830
and we've really been focused on
that symbol on our front door,

01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:36.260
but that position
or that decision

01:36:36.260 --> 01:36:37.530
could change in the future.

01:36:37.530 --> 01:36:39.269
But that's where
we are right now.

01:36:39.269 --> 01:36:41.560
- I know we're all very
engrossed in this conversation,

01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:43.330
but in order to
keep things moving,

01:36:43.330 --> 01:36:45.850
I think we're going to take
two questions at a time

01:36:45.850 --> 01:36:50.570
and try to make sure everybody
gets where they need to go.

01:36:50.570 --> 01:36:51.070
- Thanks.

01:36:51.070 --> 01:36:54.100
My name is Ronald
Herman, and thank

01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:57.610
you, folks, for being here and
spending some time with us.

01:36:57.610 --> 01:36:59.980
I'll try to sneak
in two questions.

01:36:59.980 --> 01:37:02.830
Dominican born, my dad
would be really upset

01:37:02.830 --> 01:37:04.430
if I didn't get a question in.

01:37:04.430 --> 01:37:06.760
So to make him proud,
I'm going to ask two.

01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:08.500
The first is for you, Pedro.

01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:10.540
I think one of the things
that made you great

01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:12.630
was your competitiveness.

01:37:12.630 --> 01:37:16.180
And so now that you're
retired, how do you

01:37:16.180 --> 01:37:19.110
continue to feed that
competitiveness in you?

01:37:19.110 --> 01:37:22.000
And the second question
is for you, Sam.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:27.790
In baseball today-- or more so
in the Red Sox organization,

01:37:27.790 --> 01:37:32.190
what kind of programs are
there for foreign born players

01:37:32.190 --> 01:37:34.720
that struggle to
fit in culturally

01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:37.794
into baseball or into Boston?

01:37:37.794 --> 01:37:38.710
How do you help those?

01:37:38.710 --> 01:37:40.900
And I ask that because
I moved to this country

01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:42.275
when I was eight
years old, and I

01:37:42.275 --> 01:37:44.230
struggled with that in Boston.

01:37:44.230 --> 01:37:49.770
And so I wonder what the Red
Sox is doing for players.

01:37:49.770 --> 01:37:54.450
- Well, how do I deal with the
competitiveness that I have?

01:37:54.450 --> 01:37:55.951
I pitch to my kids.

01:37:55.951 --> 01:38:00.190
[LAUGHTER]

01:38:00.190 --> 01:38:03.380
I'm still eager
to go and compete.

01:38:03.380 --> 01:38:05.770
When I see those series
that come over special

01:38:05.770 --> 01:38:09.760
with the Yankees and stuff, and
the rivalry and stuff, my god,

01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:14.410
I wish I was there sometimes,
but my time is done.

01:38:14.410 --> 01:38:17.300
But the reason why
I was so competitive

01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:19.980
was really I was hungry.

01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:21.420
I wanted it.

01:38:21.420 --> 01:38:23.250
I wanted it against the best.

01:38:23.250 --> 01:38:26.430
I wanted it against the biggest.

01:38:26.430 --> 01:38:30.610
And I wanted it well done.

01:38:30.610 --> 01:38:37.720
And so I really dragged myself
to compete in the best way

01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:40.180
possible against the best.

01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:42.130
And I did not want
to fall short,

01:38:42.130 --> 01:38:45.910
because I would be dishonoring
what my mom and dad told me.

01:38:45.910 --> 01:38:46.870
And I told you.

01:38:46.870 --> 01:38:48.550
It was all about the base.

01:38:48.550 --> 01:38:51.900
They told me to be strong,
and compete, and kick

01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:55.170
and scratch for whatever
I wanted to get.

01:38:55.170 --> 01:38:57.410
And that's why I was
fearless out there.

01:38:57.410 --> 01:39:01.330
Regardless of what happened, I
was going to try to go forward.

01:39:01.330 --> 01:39:02.780
So that's my pure answer.

01:39:02.780 --> 01:39:03.700
Now you.

01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:09.730
- Well, in terms of our
international signings

01:39:09.730 --> 01:39:15.430
and bringing players into
the Red Sox organization,

01:39:15.430 --> 01:39:19.820
it's a hugely important part of
what we do each and every day.

01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:22.600
We've had players from the
Dominican, from Puerto Rico,

01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:25.750
from Venezuela, from--

01:39:25.750 --> 01:39:26.260
- Panama.

01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:27.370
- From Panama.

01:39:27.370 --> 01:39:27.890
From China.

01:39:27.890 --> 01:39:29.150
- Nicaragua.

01:39:29.150 --> 01:39:30.130
- Nicaragua.

01:39:30.130 --> 01:39:31.090
- It's expanding.

01:39:31.090 --> 01:39:32.920
- And we go on, and on, and on.

01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:36.140
And we have many
people that focus

01:39:36.140 --> 01:39:40.730
on the development of our
young players on the field.

01:39:40.730 --> 01:39:45.760
We also have a very important
support network off the field,

01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:50.800
and there is a 20 year
incredible employee of the Red

01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:54.345
Sox, a woman named
Raquel Ferreira,

01:39:54.345 --> 01:39:57.880
who was our Vice President
of Baseball Operations.

01:39:57.880 --> 01:40:01.090
She was actually just on a
panel with Bekah the other day.

01:40:01.090 --> 01:40:07.630
She is also a rock star, and she
deals with the players and all

01:40:07.630 --> 01:40:13.870
of the issues related to getting
anything they need in terms

01:40:13.870 --> 01:40:19.750
of financial services, or
transportation, or residential,

01:40:19.750 --> 01:40:23.140
medical, and dealing
with families

01:40:23.140 --> 01:40:24.460
living in another country.

01:40:24.460 --> 01:40:28.806
So she has a department of
folks that work on those issues.

01:40:28.806 --> 01:40:30.430
And the second thing
we do is something

01:40:30.430 --> 01:40:32.520
we started about a
decade and a half,

01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:36.210
maybe 12 years ago, as the Red
Sox rookie development program.

01:40:36.210 --> 01:40:38.860
So when players come in,
when they're in that sort

01:40:38.860 --> 01:40:41.200
of triple-A year, we think
they're going to get ready

01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:43.600
to make that jump
to the big leagues,

01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:47.090
we have them come to Boston
for a week in January to try

01:40:47.090 --> 01:40:50.470
and make sure they know how to
get everything they might need

01:40:50.470 --> 01:40:52.120
in the city of Boston--

01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:54.250
where to live,
where to stay, how

01:40:54.250 --> 01:40:57.115
to make the transition from
Rhode Island, Pawtucket,

01:40:57.115 --> 01:40:58.060
up to Boston.

01:40:58.060 --> 01:41:01.660
So we have about 330 men and
women that work at the Red Sox

01:41:01.660 --> 01:41:04.450
and about 150 in
baseball operations

01:41:04.450 --> 01:41:07.432
set up as that
apparatus for support.

01:41:07.432 --> 01:41:08.890
- And I wouldn't
be a true feminist

01:41:08.890 --> 01:41:10.420
without saying that
we also have support

01:41:10.420 --> 01:41:12.120
for the wives of the
players that come.

01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:12.870
- Yes, good point.

01:41:12.870 --> 01:41:15.040
- So it is a huge
transition for, I think,

01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:17.140
a wife or partner of
a lot of these players

01:41:17.140 --> 01:41:19.180
to come into a new
city with nothing--

01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:20.730
with no friends,
with no knowledge

01:41:20.730 --> 01:41:21.730
of where to go for what.

01:41:21.730 --> 01:41:24.260
And so we have staff that
are dedicated to making sure

01:41:24.260 --> 01:41:26.260
that the wives feel
comfortable and assimilated,

01:41:26.260 --> 01:41:30.210
and have their needs met for
their children, for themselves.

01:41:30.210 --> 01:41:32.290
And we make sure that
there are connections there

01:41:32.290 --> 01:41:34.300
between the wives
and the players,

01:41:34.300 --> 01:41:37.030
and their agents, and
front office staff.

01:41:37.030 --> 01:41:39.250
So just making sure
that we can also--

01:41:39.250 --> 01:41:41.230
the whole family is
taken care of, not just

01:41:41.230 --> 01:41:42.700
the players, as well.

01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:45.160
- And we're going
to try this again.

01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:46.870
Just two questions--

01:41:46.870 --> 01:41:47.650
- Two people.

01:41:47.650 --> 01:41:49.760
- Two people at a time.

01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:51.400
- Thank you so much
for involving us

01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:53.370
in asking questions.

01:41:53.370 --> 01:41:53.960
I'm Ray.

01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:56.380
I'm a public library
volunteer, and I just

01:41:56.380 --> 01:41:58.960
wanted to shine a light
on the excellent program,

01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:01.690
Read Your Way to Fenway, that's
been a part of my children's

01:42:01.690 --> 01:42:04.450
lives and the communities'
lives for as long

01:42:04.450 --> 01:42:06.010
as I've lived in Boston.

01:42:06.010 --> 01:42:07.540
And I just wanted
to ask quickly,

01:42:07.540 --> 01:42:10.030
what are your plans to support
the program in the coming

01:42:10.030 --> 01:42:12.761
years?

01:42:12.761 --> 01:42:15.260
- So I'm going to-- sorry, you
want the second question now?

01:42:15.260 --> 01:42:15.540
- Wait, wait.

01:42:15.540 --> 01:42:17.206
Second-- just if you
could come forward.

01:42:17.206 --> 01:42:19.430
Just going to try to speed
things along a little bit.

01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:22.450
- My name is Francisco, and
I'm first generation, born

01:42:22.450 --> 01:42:24.610
Dominican, born here in Boston.

01:42:24.610 --> 01:42:26.940
So played in the RBI
league and did all that.

01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:27.490
- Yay.

01:42:27.490 --> 01:42:29.802
- And growing up,
when Pedro pitched,

01:42:29.802 --> 01:42:31.385
I felt like in the
Dominican community

01:42:31.385 --> 01:42:33.850
it was like a holiday.

01:42:33.850 --> 01:42:34.960
And I want to know if--

01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:36.089
- It's called a curfew.

01:42:36.089 --> 01:42:38.130
It was called a curfew
that day in the Dominican.

01:42:38.130 --> 01:42:38.880
- Yeah, seriously.

01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:40.894
- Even the president
would take it off.

01:42:40.894 --> 01:42:42.550
[LAUGHTER]

01:42:42.550 --> 01:42:44.722
- When you were
taking that mound,

01:42:44.722 --> 01:42:46.930
was that something that was
in the back of your mind,

01:42:46.930 --> 01:42:48.600
knowing that here
in Boston there

01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:50.770
is such a strong
Dominican community that

01:42:50.770 --> 01:42:53.740
was rooting for you?

01:42:53.740 --> 01:42:54.840
- Yes, it was.

01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:59.970
It was always a sense of
responsibility for it.

01:42:59.970 --> 01:43:06.480
Like I said, there are
things that you don't know

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:09.060
that come with the package.

01:43:09.060 --> 01:43:12.310
Being Dominican, representing
the Dominican Republic

01:43:12.310 --> 01:43:15.820
was something that
I was always aware.

01:43:15.820 --> 01:43:18.640
I was aware that I was
carrying the Dominican flag,

01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:22.380
as well so I was competing.

01:43:22.380 --> 01:43:27.620
So for me, it was really
important that I did it right

01:43:27.620 --> 01:43:32.200
and that I carried the honor
of representing my country.

01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:34.937
It was always important.

01:43:34.937 --> 01:43:36.520
- Then I can take
your first question.

01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:38.978
I'm going to pull my I've been
on this job for three months

01:43:38.978 --> 01:43:41.630
card right now and say
that I have not yet learned

01:43:41.630 --> 01:43:43.224
or know in depth
about that program,

01:43:43.224 --> 01:43:44.890
but I'm happy to give
you my card after,

01:43:44.890 --> 01:43:46.400
and we can follow up and
make sure to support.

01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:46.899
- Thanks.

01:43:46.899 --> 01:43:48.280
- And the Read
Your Way to Fenway

01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:51.225
program is still going
on and will continue.

01:43:51.225 --> 01:43:51.970
- [INAUDIBLE].

01:43:51.970 --> 01:43:53.530
- And we'd be in
big trouble if we

01:43:53.530 --> 01:43:56.125
didn't, because my
mother-in-law is a librarian,

01:43:56.125 --> 01:43:57.810
and big time in the library.

01:43:57.810 --> 01:43:59.530
So we can talk offline.

01:44:03.980 --> 01:44:07.060
- Hi, I'm a teacher.

01:44:07.060 --> 01:44:18.210
[SPEAKING SPANISH] I
want to kind of just

01:44:18.210 --> 01:44:27.870
present that Pedro
has been a person who

01:44:27.870 --> 01:44:31.800
has inspired everyone in
this room, but especially

01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:33.252
my students.

01:44:33.252 --> 01:44:34.860
- Thank you.

01:44:34.860 --> 01:44:37.710
- Back when I first
started, I had

01:44:37.710 --> 01:44:45.810
Tony Pena, who came to my
school, and the town lit up.

01:44:45.810 --> 01:44:49.760
I was a teacher in
Boston and also in Salem.

01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:53.350
But there are other people
who were predecessors--

01:44:53.350 --> 01:44:57.200
Mike Fornieles, Earl Wilson.

01:44:57.200 --> 01:44:59.900
If you study what
happened to Earl Wilson,

01:44:59.900 --> 01:45:04.640
the legacy is there that is so
sad, but we have in front of us

01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:10.930
someone who is celebrated
instead of denigrated.

01:45:10.930 --> 01:45:13.020
And that, to me, is
extremely important

01:45:13.020 --> 01:45:16.940
going through the years.

01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:20.380
If we looked at Reggie Smith,
if we looked at Elston Howard,

01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:22.994
I was there for the first
game for Pumpsie Green.

01:45:26.370 --> 01:45:28.800
My father had season tickets.

01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:31.490
Can you imagine, in the
'50s, season tickets?

01:45:31.490 --> 01:45:33.060
But we did.

01:45:33.060 --> 01:45:35.520
Jim Rice has stories--

01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:38.440
Reggie Smith.

01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:45.570
1967 in my life was the
most integrated team.

01:45:45.570 --> 01:45:47.790
That was the first
time that we-- gee,

01:45:47.790 --> 01:45:49.686
we were in the World Series.

01:45:53.060 --> 01:45:56.660
I also have to mention,
while I was in Boston

01:45:56.660 --> 01:45:58.850
was in the early '70s.

01:45:58.850 --> 01:46:07.086
My student was the first
black bat boy for the Red Sox.

01:46:07.086 --> 01:46:09.530
- And do you have a question?

01:46:09.530 --> 01:46:13.160
- My question is I wanted to
get all to the good stuff.

01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:16.400
Now I'm going to something else.

01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:17.390
Two things.

01:46:17.390 --> 01:46:21.130
When Pedro was pitching,
no one talked in our house.

01:46:21.130 --> 01:46:22.505
We only watched the game.

01:46:25.970 --> 01:46:30.160
But we have a problem here
in the United States right

01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:37.340
now with immigration, and I
see families being torn apart

01:46:37.340 --> 01:46:42.920
in my community, and I
want to know, as I look up

01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:45.130
here exploring sports
and citizenship,

01:46:45.130 --> 01:46:51.290
how the Red Sox can help with
our families being torn apart

01:46:51.290 --> 01:46:54.060
and deported?

01:46:54.060 --> 01:46:56.677
- We'll take another question,
and we'll kind of address--

01:46:56.677 --> 01:46:57.260
- [INAUDIBLE].

01:46:57.260 --> 01:46:59.290
- You sure you don't
want to handle that one?

01:46:59.290 --> 01:47:01.260
I don't want anyone to forget.

01:47:01.260 --> 01:47:02.920
- Sam, you said you can handle--

01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:05.740
- Well, why don't we-- in the
interest of keeping this--

01:47:05.740 --> 01:47:09.340
pace of the game is an
initiative for baseball

01:47:09.340 --> 01:47:10.390
these days.

01:47:10.390 --> 01:47:13.390
Just to quickly thank you
for sharing your memories

01:47:13.390 --> 01:47:15.500
and your question.

01:47:15.500 --> 01:47:20.290
We said it before, but Fenway
is a community gathering place,

01:47:20.290 --> 01:47:24.050
and it's a place that hopefully
people can come together.

01:47:24.050 --> 01:47:30.400
We've actually had immigration
ceremonies at Fenway Park.

01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:31.360
- Latino night.

01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:34.750
- We have Latino
night, Latino festival.

01:47:34.750 --> 01:47:39.010
We have Latino youth recognition
days each and every month.

01:47:39.010 --> 01:47:40.900
In fact, tonight was
one of those at Fenway.

01:47:40.900 --> 01:47:42.700
We missed it because
we were here,

01:47:42.700 --> 01:47:44.950
but I just think
Fenway is a place where

01:47:44.950 --> 01:47:47.680
we can all come
together and be one

01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:50.500
cheering for a common cause.

01:47:50.500 --> 01:47:52.720
When Pedro pitched, boy,
it was-- you're right.

01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:53.830
It was not a game.

01:47:53.830 --> 01:47:54.850
It was an event.

01:47:54.850 --> 01:47:58.630
So hopefully we can keep that
spirit going at Fenway Park.

01:47:58.630 --> 01:48:00.670
- And I'll just quickly
add that we also--

01:48:00.670 --> 01:48:03.340
our Red Sox Scholars
program can be

01:48:03.340 --> 01:48:05.410
given to undocumented students.

01:48:05.410 --> 01:48:09.040
And so in my past life, being
an ED for a nonprofit called

01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:11.052
Scholar Athletes, we
actually sought out

01:48:11.052 --> 01:48:12.760
undocumented students
because they're not

01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:14.320
eligible for federal aid.

01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:17.655
And so our dollars are critical
to help them pursue education.

01:48:17.655 --> 01:48:19.030
So that's yet
another way I think

01:48:19.030 --> 01:48:20.334
that we're really helping.

01:48:20.334 --> 01:48:21.250
- Can I add something?

01:48:21.250 --> 01:48:25.780
I'm just going to say something
on behalf of immigrants.

01:48:25.780 --> 01:48:29.140
The reason I'm here,
and celebrated, and not

01:48:29.140 --> 01:48:32.570
denigrated, like you
said, it was because I

01:48:32.570 --> 01:48:35.660
was granted an opportunity.

01:48:35.660 --> 01:48:38.640
So if in any way,
this panel is going

01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:43.060
to be useful for
this kind of matter,

01:48:43.060 --> 01:48:46.190
it's saying I don't
have a problem.

01:48:46.190 --> 01:48:49.890
We don't have a problem
with investigating

01:48:49.890 --> 01:48:53.890
who's the right fit or
maybe the right person

01:48:53.890 --> 01:48:58.555
to give an opportunity,
but please do it.

01:48:58.555 --> 01:48:59.930
You never know
where you're going

01:48:59.930 --> 01:49:02.460
to find another guy like me.

01:49:02.460 --> 01:49:03.660
[LAUGHTER]

01:49:03.660 --> 01:49:07.890
And you never know
what kind of human

01:49:07.890 --> 01:49:09.960
is going to be
helping another human.

01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:16.897
This gentleman over here asked
me who I probably influenced.

01:49:16.897 --> 01:49:19.230
I don't like to talk about
myself when it comes to that.

01:49:22.330 --> 01:49:26.640
This moment that I have
here that I can probably

01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:31.320
express myself and
express my feelings--

01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:33.540
those are the kind of things
that I would like to do.

01:49:33.540 --> 01:49:37.690
If anybody wants to be
influenced by what I'm saying,

01:49:37.690 --> 01:49:42.290
grant an immigrant that you
feel is right an opportunity.

01:49:42.290 --> 01:49:45.538
And the results
might be surprising.

01:49:45.538 --> 01:49:46.506
Give some opportunity.

01:49:46.506 --> 01:49:50.378
[APPLAUSE]

01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:57.520
- Hi, I'm Jim Solomon.

01:49:57.520 --> 01:50:00.570
I'm not a plant from
Shira, I promise,

01:50:00.570 --> 01:50:05.320
but I'm one of the owners of
the Harford Yard Goats, Colorado

01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:07.330
Rockies double-A team.

01:50:07.330 --> 01:50:13.270
And I want to first applaud
everything that the Boston Red

01:50:13.270 --> 01:50:15.790
Sox do for their community.

01:50:15.790 --> 01:50:20.260
It's noticed, and it's
truly appreciated.

01:50:20.260 --> 01:50:28.410
I'm wondering if you see
opportunities with regard to--

01:50:28.410 --> 01:50:32.850
well, you define this evening
as Red Sox nation, not just

01:50:32.850 --> 01:50:34.170
Boston Red Sox.

01:50:34.170 --> 01:50:39.180
And so I imagine that
includes Pawtucket, Portland,

01:50:39.180 --> 01:50:42.480
and the organization as
a whole, and that you

01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:46.830
have an interest in protecting
the brand vertically

01:50:46.830 --> 01:50:50.340
throughout the organization
and reaching out

01:50:50.340 --> 01:50:53.180
into the community
at all levels.

01:50:53.180 --> 01:50:57.450
And so what I want to know is
there are great cities like New

01:50:57.450 --> 01:50:58.050
Hampshire--

01:50:58.050 --> 01:51:01.840
Manchester for New
Hampshire Fisher Cats,

01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:05.785
Portland for the Sea Dogs,
and Hartford for the Yard

01:51:05.785 --> 01:51:09.420
Goats, but there are also a
number of minor league clubs

01:51:09.420 --> 01:51:12.870
that play in areas
that really need help

01:51:12.870 --> 01:51:14.740
even more than those cities.

01:51:14.740 --> 01:51:18.840
So what I want to know
is if you see opportunity

01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:22.650
for the big team,
the major league team

01:51:22.650 --> 01:51:26.100
to reach down to the
minor leagues, one,

01:51:26.100 --> 01:51:30.240
to encourage the ballplayers
to have more contact.

01:51:30.240 --> 01:51:37.480
Like the way you said Jackie
Bradley Jr. Talks to the kids

01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:40.860
doesn't really cost
money, but it's something

01:51:40.860 --> 01:51:44.850
that's really doable,
or the possibility

01:51:44.850 --> 01:51:47.350
of people in your minor
league organization,

01:51:47.350 --> 01:51:50.040
say, working with you on
community to get some more

01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:51.880
ideas of what they can do.

01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:53.700
So anyway, I want to know--

01:51:53.700 --> 01:51:56.520
and I don't know the experience
for a minor league player

01:51:56.520 --> 01:51:59.010
and how nervous
they are about just

01:51:59.010 --> 01:52:03.570
making the team, how
that affects their desire

01:52:03.570 --> 01:52:05.610
to get out and do anything
with the community.

01:52:05.610 --> 01:52:07.900
So I throw it out
there for anybody.

01:52:07.900 --> 01:52:09.900
- We're going to try to
do the two person thing.

01:52:09.900 --> 01:52:12.720
We have one more, I
think, question behind,

01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:14.560
so we'll get to some of that.

01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:15.510
Yes?

01:52:15.510 --> 01:52:17.940
- Hi, I'm Josh Coen, and
I'm in the eighth grade,

01:52:17.940 --> 01:52:20.276
and I'm a huge Red Sox fan,
so this is really cool.

01:52:20.276 --> 01:52:22.168
So, thank you.

01:52:22.168 --> 01:52:25.479
[APPLAUSE]

01:52:26.898 --> 01:52:30.140
So I just have a
pretty basic question.

01:52:30.140 --> 01:52:32.510
What is the biggest
change that pro athletes

01:52:32.510 --> 01:52:35.720
need to make in order to be
better role models for youth?

01:52:37.935 --> 01:52:40.435
- I'm guessing you're asking
this pro athlete, not this one.

01:52:40.435 --> 01:52:44.240
[LAUGHTER]

01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:48.260
- I think if you're
raised the proper way

01:52:48.260 --> 01:52:54.650
in every aspect I think
the change is not drastic.

01:52:54.650 --> 01:53:00.160
Just like I said before,
because of the way

01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:04.940
my upbringing was made me
strong in everything I did.

01:53:04.940 --> 01:53:08.410
And baseball is no
exception, and when

01:53:08.410 --> 01:53:11.770
you get to the big leagues
or you get anywhere,

01:53:11.770 --> 01:53:14.410
what you have to
do is stress what

01:53:14.410 --> 01:53:22.330
you learn before you got
there, execute, remain loyal.

01:53:22.330 --> 01:53:24.700
Like I said before,
you have to be

01:53:24.700 --> 01:53:29.800
consistent about what you did
to get you to where you are.

01:53:29.800 --> 01:53:32.090
You don't have to really go
through a dramatic change

01:53:32.090 --> 01:53:39.070
in things in order for you to be
from Pawtucket to the Red Sox.

01:53:39.070 --> 01:53:40.510
You just continue
to do the things

01:53:40.510 --> 01:53:44.170
that you were doing right
and do it with consistency.

01:53:44.170 --> 01:53:48.590
Same thing with your goals,
whatever they are in life,

01:53:48.590 --> 01:53:51.730
in baseball, sports, whatever.

01:53:51.730 --> 01:53:56.210
Just be consistent of
the things that you were

01:53:56.210 --> 01:53:58.800
taught before you got there.

01:53:58.800 --> 01:54:01.200
- That addressed those
questions in some way,

01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:03.520
and I think we're going to
have to wrap it up here.

01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:07.750
I want to say thank you
again to the panelists--

01:54:07.750 --> 01:54:11.590
Pedro, Bekah, Sam--
and also thank you

01:54:11.590 --> 01:54:14.440
to the Radcliffe Institute
for Advanced Study at Harvard,

01:54:14.440 --> 01:54:18.400
and to BUR, Boston's NPR news
station, for hosting the event.

01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:21.200
A special thank you to
Radcliffe's Becky Wasserman,

01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:23.920
who's been my partner in
crime, and to Amy MacDonald--

01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:26.322
lots of late night e-mails.

01:54:26.322 --> 01:54:28.030
And I look forward to
seeing what the Red

01:54:28.030 --> 01:54:31.390
Sox are going to do in the
future both on the field

01:54:31.390 --> 01:54:32.290
and off of it.

01:54:32.290 --> 01:54:33.490
Thank you all for coming.

01:54:33.490 --> 01:54:37.440
