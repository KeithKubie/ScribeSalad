00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.600
How do you go about decrypting ciphered

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.190
traffic that uses these Enigma machines?

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.019
Can you do it by hand? And what actually
happened at Bletchley Park - what,

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:14.320
historically, was the order in which things

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.320
took place? This has been very much
prompted by the appearance of the film

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.710
called "The Imitation Game"

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.890
with Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing
[ALAN TURING: ... I'm afraid these men would 
only slow me down ...]

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.060
[STEWART MENZIES: ... popular at School were you ?]
Two of the first people through the doors

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.880
of Bletchley Park,

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.050
in Sept '39, were Alan Turing

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.860
and his colleague at Cambridge, another
mathematician, called Gordon Welchman,

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.219
who I think was was a year ahead of Alan Turing,
actually, in taking the Maths Tripos and of

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.480
course getting a First.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.870
You will find throughout this story 
Bletchley Park was full

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.770
of first-class mathematicians.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.690
Even before war broke out the Allies
had had a big success

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.469
in that a German spy had actually defected,

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:03.149
before the war started, and handed over a
military Enigma machine

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.409
and a starter Enigma codebook-

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.540
what better tutorial?! I think he handed
it over to the French Secret Service.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.820
The French contacted

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.030
the English, who by that stage had moved
to Bletchley Park.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.790
Their chief cryptanalyst was a guy
called Dilly Knox who'd had a lot of

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.590
success with this stuff - going back
to the First World War.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.920
But I mean, to cut a long story short, the
French and the British initially

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.970
dithered. They just

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.049
did not want to do ... know what to do ...
with this stuff;

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:40.539
war hadn't yet broken out. But fortunately
the French, I think, passed it on

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.649
under conditions of great secrecy, to the
Polish Cipher Bureau

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.109
and we, and Bletchley Park, owed them a lot because

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:52.110
they had a team there led by a very, very
good mathematician, called Marian Rejewski.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.030
He spotted straightaway that with all of this system of

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.360
rotors, reflectors

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.640
plugboards it was basically just running
through the permutations.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.410
So what better way to really get to
grips with all of this, and all of its

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.289
possibilities,

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.349
than to have somebody who was an expert in
what's called the theory of

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.410
Permutation Groups, and Marian

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.349
Rejewski was very good from that point
of view. They were dealing with machines

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:20.959
where there were just three rotors -

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.950
six combinations. No choices of 3 out of 5
at that stage,

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.000
and that made life a lot simpler.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.040
A plug-board did come along and

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.410
the Poles, originally, found that they
could invent

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.480
what you might call "by hand" methods. They used
the method of perforated sheets

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.569
and amazingly by sliding these over one another

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.940
and perforating them according to the
ciphertext that you had received ....

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.200
but as it became more and more
complicated it really did

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.010
need some machinery and full credit to
the Poles,they realized this

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.139
and they built a a machine called the
Bomba. And with the Bomba

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:01.870
so long as it was only three wheels, so long

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.760
as there weren't too many cross-settings
on the plug-board, on input and output,

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.970
and so long as the initial message setting

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:17.400
was transmitted in a way that got banned
by the end of 1938, because the Germans

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.450
realized it was not very secure.
Essentially you chose

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.020
a three-letter word and you sent it twice.
And even though it appeared at the other end

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.600
as six cryptographically mapped symbols - you
know, you might type in UNS,

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.470
the German word, so you type it in twice
UNS UNS and it would appear as

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.750
LJQWXZ - something like that. Nevertheless

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.050
if you knew that those first six letters had

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.450
to map into a repeated German 
three-letter word

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.620
boy, did it cut down the number of settings

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.760
of the Enigma that could possibly have
produced that! So with all those

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.650
simplifications and weaknesses the Poles were
able to make a very good start.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.300
What really blew them out of the water, first of all,

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.000
was tragically being invaded, of course,
by Germany. How can you run a cipher bureau,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.840
or any sort of operation, when
your country is being invaded ?

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.430
But, even prior to that, the idea of choosing

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.530
3 out of 5 before

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.990
you arrange the three on the spindle, as
we've seen, that led to 60 combinations.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.010
They'd need not six Bombi, but sixty Bombi.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.690
Out of the question - couldn't afford it.
Pressure in Poland was such that

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.770
they'd probably never get around to building
them anyway.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.800
The handing over of the whole situation - as
to where the

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.110
Polish Bomba had got to - got Bletchley Park off
to a flying start.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.220
I mean clearly they were up against
bigger plug-boards; not just three out of

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.430
five rotors

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.520
but, looking at the Naval stuff coming along,
it was looking like three out of eight.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.650
The whole idea of

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.840
machinery was an excellent one, but it
had to be made even more

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.510
powerful and robust. It was driven by
Alan Turing

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.150
and, of course, as we now know, he was probably
one of the ideal persons to do it.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.150
Not only was he a theoretical 
mathematical logician,

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.750
while he was at Princeton he'd actually
built hardware. He loved

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.780
soldering relays together, making his
own little replicas of how his

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.200
Turing Machines might work.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.289
As people will tell you, Andrew Hodges in

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:27.770
in the biography says he was 'ham-fisted'.
He was enthusiastic but not good at it.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.210
Shaun Wylie his colleague in Hut 8 said
"Very enthusiastic

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.259
but he was so clumsy".  He used to insist
on using high-voltage soldering irons because

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:40.629
they were more efficient, and he'd give
himself electric shocks - 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:44.360
and if it wasn't electric shocks making him
scream, he'd burnt himself.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.639
No. Enthusiasm, but not

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:50.949
the person you would want to build your
home computer. He

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:56.249
said, look, we've got to do this by
building a Bombe. Let's call it a B-O-M-B-E,

00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:59.580
partly as a nod in the direction of the Poles and
saying "Thank you".

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.129
He drew up a specification of what needed to
be done. You see this in action in

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:04.129
"The Imitation Game":

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:07.319
[ALAN TURING: I'm designing a machine that will allow us
to break every message, every day, instantly]

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:12.089
But the good thing, of
course, in the movie, is that it

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:15.330
doesn't have to produce any results. It
just has to rotate a lot

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.419
and look very, very impressive. Thanks to a
superb effort at

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:22.119
what is now the Bletchley Park Museum
they have actually rebuilt

00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:25.959
a Bombe - and it works. But let's just explain
that for

00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:30.300
every vertical column of three in
this decryption device

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.939
the top one here. on the Bombe, corresponds to 
the rightmost

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:38.669
drum - the fastest one. The middle one
corresponds to the middle one

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:43.289
and the bottom one of the three, in any
column, corresponds to the leftmost

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:45.099
drum which was rotating

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:48.689
slowest of all. Essentially what you've got
is lots and lots of

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:52.699
Enigmas in parallel, as it were. And you
can try out

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:57.879
different 'menus', as they were called -
different programs basically - saying "Well

00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:01.769
you see that Enigma replica at the top
left. I'd like to make the

00:07:01.769 --> 00:07:07.740
top drum be a Type II drum; the middle
one be a Type V and the bottom one be a

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:08.599
Type III,

00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:12.949
because I think that was the drum ordering. And 
on those drums I'd like to make the

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:16.269
ring settings - you know where you put
your little stud

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:20.050
to do the initial offset. I'd like to
make them - reading from the top -

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.080
V, A and H. Can you do that please?"

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.540
Oh! and this is where Turing's

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:30.480
ideas came in - he said "Look, y'know,
we are going to have to get more and more

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.560
and more

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.800
into the idea of decrypting by
trying to use known

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:40.770
plaintext". You know, if you're listening
in to a certain

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:47.330
weather station that's sending out Enigma
code, you know that phrases like "storm" 

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:51.600
and "heavy rain" and stuff are going to occur.
Sometimes you wouldn't succeed,

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.470
you know, you'd have to give up and say "No I
think the idea was wrong, we'll have to

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:56.610
try something else."

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:59.830
The fact that Enigma never

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.920
enciphered anything to itself was a

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.440
huge help. If you look at James Grime's video

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:10.450
you can see him using pieces of paper
tape, as it were,

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:15.050
to show ciphertext and showing some
guessed plaintext underneath it.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:18.850
And you slide them along and you keep on
trying different positions

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:24.430
and if, at a given position, a letter in
the ciphertext exactly corresponds to a

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.620
letter in the plaintext, than that cannot
be right.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:31.400
You can't have an A encrypting
as an A. So you must keep

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.830
sliding it along - this guessed plaintext

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:38.540
- and you might stand a chance at the
places where

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:43.979
there are no correspondences - there's no 
places where a letter is encrypted to itself.

00:08:43.979 --> 00:08:47.860
And I think one of the stories told was 
that they sent out an RAF plane

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:51.610
to bomb a crucially important light buoy
at the mouth

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:54.750
of a harbour, yeah, and they knew

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:58.090
which station would be reporting that
back to headquarters,

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:02.570
listened to the ciphertext looking
for - I think 

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:05.980
the German word is something like 'Erleutaschtonne' 
for light buoy [actually: "Erloschen ist Leuchtonne"]

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:09.790
and if you see something saying, y'know,
"The light buoy has been destroyed",

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:13.540
Wonderful! You've got known plaintext. 
Now, at Bletchley

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:17.030
the house itself was nowhere near big
enough to accommodate

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:21.770
all of the personnel that were needed. It wasn't
just cryptanalysts and mathematicians it was

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:26.410
service personnel, intelligence people, clerks,

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:31.390
admin - all that stuff. So as well as
occupying the entirety of the house,

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:35.340
out in the grounds there were various
Huts. And different

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:39.290
units, with different tasks, were in 
different Huts.

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:42.530
The 3-rotor Army and Air Force

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:47.510
Enigma service was based in Hut 6. It was
run by Gordon Welchman,

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:51.170
Turing's near-contemporary at Cambridge.

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:54.640
The bigger problem, the much harder 
problem, was

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.600
Naval Enigma. As we have already discovered

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:02.360
Naval Enigma didn't just choose three rotors

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:07.580
out of five. It chose three rotors out of
eight -  massively complicating things.

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:11.750
And then Doenitz, the head of the German Navy

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:15.360
being yet more suspicious, and wanting his
codes to be super-secure,

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:20.600
introduced the idea of a fourth rotor. I
think that was particularly so for the U-boat

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.610
traffic. Now that was a much harder
problem - so for a long time

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:29.290
3-rotor Enigma could almost go into
production.  4-rotor Enigma

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:33.660
was still at the research stage. And for 
some desperate months. I think in

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:37.290
late '41, early '42, there was a time when

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:41.470
Naval Enigma was off the air completely.
They just couldn't get into it and they

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:42.810
couldn't decrypt anything.

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:46.020
I think they were helped eventually by
a 'pinch', which was

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:50.350
to get a codebook off a submarine that
had been depth charged.

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:56.709
[NEWSREEL: " ... depth charges fly out over

00:10:56.709 --> 00:11:01.139
the ocean. Shattered by depth bombs the stricken 
raider is abandoned. One of dozens that are meeting

00:11:01.139 --> 00:11:05.529
the same fate"]
And gradually as their skills built up

00:11:05.529 --> 00:11:08.949
they were more and more successful with
Naval Enigma.

00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:13.329
But I think you could say - even right to
the end of the war - it was always harder

00:11:13.329 --> 00:11:17.990
than doing the Army and the Air Force
stuff. So, what it came down to, then, 

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.910
at Bletchley, was

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:21.929
Hut 6: 3-rotor Enigma.

00:11:21.929 --> 00:11:25.999
Hut 8: Naval

00:11:25.999 --> 00:11:29.209
4-rotor or 3-rotor

00:11:29.209 --> 00:11:32.209
Enigma - all done in Hut 8 under

00:11:32.209 --> 00:11:35.959
Alan Turing. Now - when you now look at

00:11:35.959 --> 00:11:41.649
"The Imitation Game" you will notice that it's
all centred around Hut 8.

00:11:41.649 --> 00:11:47.199
Massive simplification! They merge Hut
6 personnel in with Hut 8 personnel;

00:11:47.199 --> 00:11:51.069
they mention Hugh Alexander the double
British Chess Champion - quite right,

00:11:51.069 --> 00:11:57.160
he was there with Alan Turing in Hut 8.
They mention this wonderful extension

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:02.329
to the back of the Bombe, called a Diagonal
Board, which helped a lot.

00:12:02.329 --> 00:12:05.509
It was a bright idea and the implication
is given in "The Imitation Game"

00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:07.179
that this was invented by

00:12:07.179 --> 00:12:11.249
Hugh Alexander. No it wasn't! It was
invented by Gordon Welchman

00:12:11.249 --> 00:12:15.129
of Hut 6, but this is Hollywood for you.
You have to live with this.

00:12:15.129 --> 00:12:18.480
Yes, there was a guy called Jack Good in

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:22.699
Hut 8, you'll see him in the movie as
well. He was a very good statistician,

00:12:22.699 --> 00:12:24.699
almost as good as Alan Turing himself,

00:12:24.699 --> 00:12:28.249
and was also good at chess, but not as
good as Hugh Alexander.

00:12:28.249 --> 00:12:32.959
And yes, Joan Clarke, it's not an artificial
"Oh! we must have a woman in this, let's

00:12:32.959 --> 00:12:33.660
make one up".

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:37.360
No, she really existed. She also had a first-class

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.720
Maths degree from Cambridge. She went to the
women's College, Newnham,

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.819
but Gordon Welchman, I think, had been
one of her tutors, or one of her

00:12:43.819 --> 00:12:45.620
lecturers, and thought highly of her.

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:49.759
So again - spoiler alert! - inside 
"The Imitation Game"

00:12:49.759 --> 00:12:54.490
Joan Clarke did not get recruited as a
result of doing a crossword puzzle

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:57.649
in 5 minutes and 34 seconds. She got recruited

00:12:57.649 --> 00:13:00.749
because Gordon Welchman and Alan Turing knew
all about her

00:13:00.749 --> 00:13:04.639
and just took great care to get hold of
her. They started building

00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:07.999
machines with the help of a very
talented hardware engineer

00:13:07.999 --> 00:13:11.610
called 'Doc' Keen - or Harold Keen to give 
him his proper name.

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:15.299
You had to work out the wheel
combinations and the wheel ordering

00:13:15.299 --> 00:13:16.230
first of all.

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:21.459
You needed Bombe time to try them out and
in the early days

00:13:21.459 --> 00:13:28.389
Doc Keen did his best and made, I think, Bombes
that could be used for either 3-rotor or 4-rotor work.

00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:33.720
Hut 6 needed them all the time for
production work,

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:38.079
y' know, they pretty well knew what the
settings were it was straightforward but

00:13:38.079 --> 00:13:41.089
they needed Bombe time.
[SEAN: When you say "production work" in that instance

00:13:41.089 --> 00:13:44.850
you're talking about just day-to-day decoding?]
Day-to-day decoding

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:49.679
we know we're going to crack this, y'know, we'll
just send it through and

00:13:49.679 --> 00:13:52.069
just double check that this is right.

00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:56.949
But, y' know, with the Army and 
Air Force stuff

00:13:56.949 --> 00:14:00.839
they were never in any serious doubt
that, from about late '41 onwards, they

00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:01.559
could do it.

00:14:01.559 --> 00:14:05.269
What you didn't want was the Hut 8 mob
coming in and saying

00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:09.799
"It's our turn on that machine now - it's
not fair, we're meant to share these things!"

00:14:09.799 --> 00:14:15.009
The problem for Hut 8, you see, was that their
usage was a lot more speculative -

00:14:15.009 --> 00:14:19.279
it would lead to a lot more failures until
you got some idea

00:14:19.279 --> 00:14:23.110
of what the wheel ordering was. And then
Alan Turing came up with a really

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:27.230
very, very bright idea, which showed how good 
a statistician he was.

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:32.629
What he said was: "Look we could maximize our -

00:14:32.629 --> 00:14:35.740
what's the word? - payoff, from these Bombes

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:39.220
if only we knew, without getting on to
the things,

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:42.600
which wheels were in use at the right and
the middle.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.129
Those are the ones that are going to rotate
first. You know, you feed in your first

00:14:46.129 --> 00:14:47.079
bit of ciphertext,

00:14:47.079 --> 00:14:50.679
it's the right one that goes round 26 times.
And then

00:14:50.679 --> 00:14:53.839
the next one starts to move. So by the 
time you've done

00:14:53.839 --> 00:14:58.250
six hundred and - whatever 26 squared is -
characters,

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:00.660
you've seen a fair bit of ciphertext.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:05.390
If you take that ciphertext and think
that it came from German,

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:09.340
but with certain wheel settings on
the right and the middle - but we don't

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:10.340
know them yet -

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:15.280
what do you know from the frequency
statistics of letters

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:19.300
in German as to how that might

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:23.060
give itself away a little bit

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:27.380
even in ciphertext, depending on exactly
what the cross

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:30.380
wirings were in the right and

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:35.350
middle rotors. In other words, could we
say that a number I and a number III

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:36.990
rotor, that we're trying here,

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:42.560
matches this vague matching process
rather better than a number V and a

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.390
number II ?

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:48.700
Those of you who know some statistics will
realise this is Conditional Sequential

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:50.370
Bayesian Probabilities.

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:53.860
And all that happened when you convoluted,

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:59.300
as it were, arbitrary German text with
this ciphertext, is certain little

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:00.890
indications would come out.

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:04.650
They didn't do it on the Bombe, they did
it by another method of

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:07.740
sheets. And their sheets were made in Banbury.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:11.530
You punched holes in sheets and put them
over a lightbox, and

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:16.330
slid one over the other. And you looked
at these great long strings of stuff

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:20.270
coming out with certain little groupings
of letters there that were giving the game

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:21.660
away statistically.

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:26.430
It turned out that it was deadly work.
You had to concentrate

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:31.550
and yet not fall asleep. And you had to
remember what had gone before; you had to

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:34.980
try and think what might come up. I don't
understand all the

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:38.250
details but I'm not surprised in the
slightest to find that

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:42.519
the person who was best at spotting this
was Hugh Alexander,

00:16:42.519 --> 00:16:45.930
the chess champion. And by common consent
in Hut 8

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:49.649
he was the best. Probably the next best
- second equal I

00:16:49.649 --> 00:16:53.010
think - was Jack Good, also a statistician

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:56.880
and a good chess player but -  I don't play
chess -

00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:00.959
Hugh Alexander was Top Board at Bletchley.
Jack Good

00:17:00.959 --> 00:17:04.770
was Fourth Board. Right? Those two.

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:09.890
But I think Hugh Alexander thought the world
of Joan Clarke. He thought that possibly Joan

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:13.780
and Jack were the next best, after him, at decoding

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:18.380
using this Alan Turing technique which,
because it used sheets made in Banbury,

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:22.020
was inevitably given the Latinised name
of Banburismus.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:25.839
But it was helpful, because if you did it
properly

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:28.860
you could say: "We can reduce

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:32.940
the time on the Bombe, when we get on to
it, because we know that

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:36.590
this ciphertext, really, has almost 
certainly come

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:40.059
from having a number V in the middle
and the number I on the right.

00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:43.150
So all we've got to do is to work out 
what this left rotor is.

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:47.540
[SEAN: So just as a very rough kind of instance 
of that might be something like

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.070
we know E comes up more than any ...]
Exactly!

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:54.380
[SEAN: ... other letter and it's probably been turned into an L ...]
... been turned into an L and and all sorts of things.

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:58.270
But knowing the cross-wirings of those

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:03.790
two that you're assuming, you could work
out how the pattern of heavy Es would 

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:08.200
come out into certain other patterns that
would give the game away, but only ever

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.410
so slightly. It would look

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:14.240
almost random - but not quite. And you had
to be trained how to spot

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:19.070
the non-randomness. What helped a lot, of
course, was when they started building

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:20.070
more Bombes.

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:24.440
And even for production work from
[Hut 6 and] Hut 3,

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:29.980
there was no way that the Bombes they could 
build at Bletchley Park were enough. They had 
to start putting them out in

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:35.990
other derelict manor houses, within about
a 20 mile radius. They ended up I think

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:41.679
by the beginning of  '42 with about 3 other 
manor houses full of Bombes; eventually 6 by

00:18:41.679 --> 00:18:42.640
the end of the war.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.070
I think the overall estimates are that there

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:49.289
were about 40 or 50 Bombes, of various
sorts, in the UK.

00:18:49.289 --> 00:18:52.820
When you add it how many there were,
built in America -

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:57.149
because that was the other factor. The plans
for these were handed ouver to the Americans -

00:18:57.149 --> 00:19:00.250
Special Relationship, all that - taken to
America

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:05.490
and with American not being under daily air
raids and having no shortage of raw materials,

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:11.009
they built, I think in the end, something
approaching a couple of hundred

00:19:11.009 --> 00:19:16.279
Bombes of various sorts. And the interesting
story is that in late

00:19:16.279 --> 00:19:21.779
'42 early '43, I think it was, Alan
Turing made a

00:19:21.779 --> 00:19:25.320
journey to America and went to see the

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:29.899
Naval decryption operation, and also the

00:19:29.899 --> 00:19:33.519
the Army one as well, because they were
separate in America - not under

00:19:33.519 --> 00:19:38.799
a combined roof as there were at Bletchley -
and I think the Naval admirals were really,

00:19:38.799 --> 00:19:42.110
right at the start of the war, y'know,
very worried saying: "We can build this

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:42.919
machinery but

00:19:42.919 --> 00:19:46.350
you know we're up against it. We've
got Doenitz against us

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:49.539
and he's 3 out of 8, not 3 out of 5.

00:19:49.539 --> 00:19:52.720
Now, our mathematician people tell us 
3 out of 8

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:57.090
turns out to be 336. OK, Alan! So here's 
the deal -

00:19:57.090 --> 00:20:00.090
we've got to build 336 of these Bombes,
haven't we?"

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:04.210
And Alan said: "No -- you don't! You use my
Banburismus

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:07.440
technique, to sort out which

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:11.320
rotors you almost certainly have got - off

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.330
the Bombe - before you ever get on it, and
then you can make do.

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:17.820
And I think they thought this was
wonderful. I think in the end they built -

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:22.370
I don't know what the compromise was - to
build somewhere between 60 and 100 rather than

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:25.649
336. But so highly

00:20:25.649 --> 00:20:29.779
did they think of this technique - the Americans - 
that there's a very interesting story.

00:20:29.779 --> 00:20:34.529
That conditional sequential Bayesian
probability, Banburismus,

00:20:34.529 --> 00:20:37.789
technique has been classified from then

00:20:37.789 --> 00:20:42.080
until 2010. That's how sensitive it was.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:46.899
The reason that made it even more
sensitive was that it wasn't just used in

00:20:46.899 --> 00:20:51.100
4-rotor Naval Enigma, where it was
important but it

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:55.769
fed on into the other machine that we are going 
to do a separate video about at some stage,

00:20:55.769 --> 00:20:57.389
the well-known Colossus

00:20:57.389 --> 00:21:01.159
machine. That technique was of great use there
as well.

00:21:01.159 --> 00:21:06.339
One final indication of how they got on
top of the problem - again from Hugh Alexander.

00:21:06.339 --> 00:21:09.849
With use of the Banburismus techniques

00:21:09.849 --> 00:21:13.940
the sheets, and extra Bombe time - that was
the point -

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:17.190
everybody wanted Bombe time, they
eventually got enough

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:20.940
and what Alexander said -- and I had no 
idea this took place -- he said:

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:25.669
"You do realise,  of course, they
weren't all physically in England?

00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:29.529
We had dedicated transatlantic

00:21:29.529 --> 00:21:32.659
underwater cables between us and

00:21:32.659 --> 00:21:35.899
the NCR place which was doing
Naval Enigma

00:21:35.899 --> 00:21:40.839
in the USA.  So they were very nice. We 
didn't have to ship any of their machinery over

00:21:40.839 --> 00:21:43.259
to us, which we would have never been
allowed to do

00:21:43.259 --> 00:21:47.049
but what we did was we just sent our
jobs over to them -

00:21:47.049 --> 00:21:50.889
the ones that we didn't have the Bombe
time to do - we could send them the menu

00:21:50.889 --> 00:21:54.559
- the settings on the Bombe plugboard that
enable you

00:21:54.559 --> 00:21:58.019
to set up the drums to be of a certain type,
and in a certain order,

00:21:58.019 --> 00:22:01.649
and ring settings and all that, so the full spec.
for that menu

00:22:01.649 --> 00:22:05.820
(which we would call a 'program' nowadays),
could be sent over the undersea cable

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:10.729
and the result usually came back within
an hour". And that made a huge difference

00:22:10.729 --> 00:22:15.109
to the amount of traffic that they could get
on top of. So it's sobering to

00:22:15.109 --> 00:22:16.579
reflect that

00:22:16.579 --> 00:22:19.989
just over seventy years ago now, 

00:22:19.989 --> 00:22:23.279
rather than undersea fibre-optic, or
anything like that,

00:22:23.279 --> 00:22:26.599
even on good old-fashioned undersea
copper cables

00:22:26.599 --> 00:22:29.999
you were still sending programs

00:22:29.999 --> 00:22:33.749
into the Cryptographic Cloud, as it were,

00:22:33.749 --> 00:22:36.869
at the other side of the Atlantic.
