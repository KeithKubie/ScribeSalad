BRADY HARAN: Hi there,
everyone.

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.410
Today I want to talk to you
about perfect numbers.

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.130
No, not those perfect numbers.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.395
We've done them already.

00:00:06.395 --> 00:00:08.320
I want to talk to you about
the perfect numbers

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.145
of sports and games.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.910
Now, probably the sport most
associated with the term

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.840
perfect game is baseball.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.910
That's because a baseball
pitcher can

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.530
throw a perfect game.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.910
Barring unusual circumstances,
that's 27 up, 27 down.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.150
Retiring every batter without
any of them making it to base.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.760
Seeing we're kind of talking
about strikes, 12 in a row is

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.790
the goal for 10 pin bowlers.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.510
That's a score of 300
across 10 frames.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.630
There are two extra balls
to satisfy the

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:46.785
quirky scoring system.

00:00:46.785 --> 00:00:49.483
Now, my preferred sport
is cricket.

00:00:49.483 --> 00:00:52.690
Now, a cricket bowler can bowl
a hat trick, but that's not

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.800
really, really special.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.410
Cricket in perfection, in my
opinion, is for the batsman.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.430
And the accomplishment
thereafter is

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.300
six 6's in an over.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.505
It's only happened twice in
first class cricket, and twice

00:01:06.505 --> 00:01:08.090
at international level.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.700
In darts, it's a
9 dart finish.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.030
501 points from just 9 throws.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.425
Apparently, there are 3,944
different ways to accomplish

00:01:20.425 --> 00:01:25.040
it, the majority requiring a
bullseye with the final throw,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.570
although that's not always the
most common way to do it.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.680
On the snooker table, a perfect
break is the much

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.290
sought after 147.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.080
All 15 reds with a black,
then the 6 colors.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.280
But although it is called a
maximum, higher breaks are

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.850
technically possible.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.800
Athletics used to have the four
minute mile, but that's

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.560
long gone since Roger Bannister
broke that one.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.300
What is it at the moment?

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.430
Probably the best one is
the 2 hour marathon.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.130
Who's going to be the first
person to run that race in

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.900
less than 120 minutes?

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.340
Tennis has a golden set.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.600
Six games in a row without
conceding a point.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.270
That is 24 points in a row.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.190
It's extremely rare, though
it did happen at

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.710
Wimbledon this year.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.770
Golfing perfection, well, that's
as simple as it gets.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.440
A hole in one.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.230
Many professionals wait a
lifetime to hit one, although

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.190
former North Korean leader Kim
Jong Il once hit five in a

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.210
single round.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.750
Well, allegedly.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.330
It's not all about sport.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.700
There are other games where
you can achieve numbery

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.460
perfection, and anyone who's
been watching my videos lately

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.110
will know I've become a little
bit obsessed with dice.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.820
In the game of Yahtzee, if
you're using the bonus point

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.930
system, the miracle score
would be 1,575.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.400
And I'm pretty sure that's never
happened, unless Kim

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.870
Jong Il played Yahtzee once.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.900
The odds of being directly dealt
poker's ultimate hand, a

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:04.120
royal flush, is 649,713 to 1.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.070
So how amazing was that?

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.880
The highest opening
move in a game of

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.160
Scrabble is this 128 pointer.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:19.890
Or using another dictionary,
this 130 pointer.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.130
The highest possible move in
general play, well, that's a

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.870
vexed question, and
it depends on what

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.670
dictionary you're using.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.280
But if this hypothetical board
ever presented itself, you

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.350
could play this move
for 2044 points.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.660
And I bet even Kim
Jong Il would be

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.330
impressed by that one.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.380
So we'll leave it there for now,
but I know there's a lot

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.140
more games and sports
where we could talk

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.830
about perfect numbers.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.240
Perhaps leave some ideas
underneath the video, we'll

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.850
make another video soon.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.710
And finally, a short apology to
all those Red Sox fans out

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.880
there.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.320
--Somehow continue to
find it amazing.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.060
I haven't done 105
of these yet.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.330
You can see some cool patterns
coming and going on the top.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.440
People watching the video can
count along to make sure I've

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.480
done all 105.
