00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now, we're almost ready to tell the question

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
that we started this unit with--how to keep the Netherlands dry.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Let's do one process an example before we jump in.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
For this example--let's say you've dump 2 kg of water down a

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
12 m hill and it loses 40 J of energy to friction.

00:00:16.000 --> 99:59:59.000
How fast is that water going at the bottom of the hill? And the answer here in meters per second.
