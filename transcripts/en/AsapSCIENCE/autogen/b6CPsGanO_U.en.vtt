00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720
 You may have heard about the impact of climate change on our planet, specifically on the Arctic 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.120
 Which is heated twice as fast. But what will happen? 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.120
 If all the ice melted on the ground? 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.560
 Bill: I can help out here! When we drink water you and me 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.900
 We drink non-salty water, we drink fresh water. 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.000
 Of all the water in the world, most of it is brackish water, only 3% of it is non-salty. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.040
 You can not get all those 3% in 70% of those 3% 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:35.480
 Frozen! Thirty million cubic kilometers of frozen water! 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.860
 It is a large amount of frozen water, so big that if you put a layer of it 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.320
 With a width of a thousand meters, will cover North America. 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.320
 This is a very large amount of frozen water, group! 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.460
 On the ground, frozen water forms glaciers, ice sheets, frosty soil and snow 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.960
 But a great part of the Arctic is an ocean, so there, the frozen water takes shape 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.960
 Floating sea ice, such as icebergs. Because it is in direct contact with the water that becomes warm 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.480
 Sea ice will be the first thing to dissolve as the planet warms up 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.840
 In fact, this year, NASA has published reports that the amount of Arctic ice has reached its lowest level 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.660
 In January, February, April, May and June 2016. 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.700
 Bill: Then the world becomes warmer and warmer and the ice melts 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.500
 Very soon you will be able to sail your ship from Europe to Russia, 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.080
 Cross the frozen pole directly, with no ice on your way. 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.720
 This may be good for some shipping companies, but for marine life species such as polar bears 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.580
 The seals! They do not have their own natural habitat, all their citizens disappear, melt underneath. 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.660
 Animals living in the ocean, such as the hippocampus and the sea, are not immune to this change either. 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.880
 With the melting of sea ice, energy companies take the opportunity to look for 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.940
 Unutilized sources through a method known as seismic explosion, 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.180
 Where they release air explosives into the water to set the ocean floor 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:02.280
 And find oil. Of course, this method causes damage to the entire Northern Ocean ecosystem. 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.040
 Causing physical trauma and re-settlement of whales. 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.340
 For sea levels, the melting of sea ice will not have a noticeable effect. 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.520
 This is because the floating ice actually displaces an equal amount of water 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.920
 Which will produce when dissolved, so this effect can be ignored. 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.460
 Moreover, more than 95% of the Earth's ice is on land 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.860
 It is often found in the vast glacier covering Greenland and Antarctica 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.860
 Where there are complete mountain chains, almost the size of the Alps, buried completely under the ice 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.500
 So, what if all the ice melted on land? 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.700
 Bill: If all this ice melts, the oceans will have more water 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.860
 If the sea level, as measured from the coasts, will rise. 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.060
 Will rise by 70 meters. This is a large quantity, group. Half the population of the Earth 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.980
 They live on the coasts of the seas, where you get all the business activities! 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.920
 They will have to move to another place, where will they go? 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.500
 And who will pay for them? 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.260
 Tokyo, New York, Sao Paulo, Mumbai, Shanghai and Jakarta, all on the coast 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.340
 They also get the largest cities in the world. 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.600
 Even rising sea levels by a few feet could cause $ 1 trillion of damage due to flooding 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.800
 in the year. An increase of 10 meters may cause migration of more than 630 million people 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.120
 About 10% of the population. 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.780
 At 25 meters, 1.4 billion people, almost 20% of humanity, will be homeless. 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.580
 To illustrate the impact of 70 meters, the sea continues to rise and will sink a majority 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.760
 Sea borders in the eastern United States, the majority of the West Coast 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.080
 The entire state of Florida, vast areas of Asia including Bangladesh. 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.660
 A large area of ​​northern China, and will create a new inland sea in Australia. 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.300
 In the North and South Pole of the planet, we have a lot of ice. Ice white. 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.720
 Ice reflects the sunlight of space. 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.640
 But there is a feedback mechanism, everything leads to the other. With increasing earth temperature 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.380
 The ice melts. With melting ice, reflects less amount of sunlight into space 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.860
 Making the world continue to be warmer. The sunlight is absorbed 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.380
 By dark liquid oceans. If, with thawing 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.100
 The world becomes warmer. The sea becomes livid. 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.020
 The world's oceans cut off currents that serve as giant conveyor belts. 

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.120
 These currents are partially operated by the difference in salinity 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.280
 Between the parts of the ocean. 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.740
 If, if melting of the ice layer of Greenland cause the discharge of a large amount of fresh, unsalted water to the North Atlantic 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.180
 It can cause turbulence in currents. 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.020
 Bill: If the conveyor belt takes chemicals, takes nutrients around the world, 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.920
 Which in turn feed plankton. 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.860
 Which in turn feed the fish. 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.240
 Which we feed. 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.520
 Half the oxygen you breathe is made by ocean plants. 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.740
 So, no one wants to mess with it. 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.180
 Moreover, with the increasing warmth of the sea surface 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.340
 From Greenland, Gulf currents are likely to change slightly. 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.960
 If these currents change, which keeps Europe warm now, 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.100
 Europe may not keep that warmer anymore. So crops will need to grow elsewhere. 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.900
 Who will plant them, who will pay them, and who will feed the other 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.720
 And what happens? This is serious! When we melt the ice. 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.380
 We've actually gone to the North Pole to see things put out now by ourselves 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.860
 While we recorded it all and we were really shocked by what we found. 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.200
 Click here to see our documentary, "End of the Arctic" 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.960
 Where we learn about the Eskimo communities that are fighting to defend their human rights 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.260
 Against oil companies and the Canadian government 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.840
 All this while trying to save the Arctic from the harsh impact of climate change 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.140
 And seismic explosion. 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.100
 You can help us raise awareness by sharing this video and signing our petition 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.140
 To press the government to prevent seismic explosion in the Arctic 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.900
 Which causes long-term impact on wildlife 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.220
 And the people of the Iskimo who live in northern Canada.
