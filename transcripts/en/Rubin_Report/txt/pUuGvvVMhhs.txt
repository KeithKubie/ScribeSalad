Speaker 1:          00:00:00       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:00:04       joining me today as a sociologist, a physician, a professor at Yale University, and author of the new book blueprint, the evolutionary origins of a good society. Nick Christakis, welcome to the Rubin report. Thank you for having me, dude. I am happy to have you here sir. But I'm depressed that I have to start the show the way I sort of have to start the show and I suspect, you know how I have to start the show. Yeah. So do you want to set it up for me?

Speaker 3:          00:00:31       Well, I mean we do just have to get this out of, I know, I know. I mean, I knew when the book was published. I mean, I've been working in the book for nine years and I knew when it was published that I would have to revisit those events from 2015 which, you know, we're just a challenging period of my life. Um, thankfully in the past. I'm really glad to have it behind me. Yeah. But I recognize that. So you tell whatever part of it you want to tell.

Speaker 2:          00:00:54       Okay. So you are and were a professor at Yale? Yes. This is, this is in I think the fall of 2015. Yes, it fall of 2015. And your wife Erica, who's also a professor, uh, childhood development. She was an instructor but yes. Yes. So uh, she basically wrote a piece that said it was a defensive free speech and it was sort of worked around the Halloween costume idea that you know, you should wear what you want but you can try to be respectful of people but you know, we shouldn't have some sort of top down version where people, you know, administrators or professors are telling students what were, you offered her a bit of a defense on that and now I'll throw it in the clip. Is that fair? Fair. Okay. Let's throw it to the clip.

Speaker 4:          00:01:39       Don't need to bend down. I'm not bending. What's your name? I don't want this. I do not want you to take care. I do not want, I do not respect you. I'm going to hear that. I'm looking at this rec in your face like I'm disgusting. Okay. I am off and I'm sick watching them argue with you. I believe we've been standing on stage literally for at least five to six hours between you and Halloween, which we last night to now, we've been arguing with people who are not willing to be listened to for a long time. And all I see from you is arrogance and ego. I am sick looking at you. I am disgusted watching, argue with you. You are not listening. You are disgusting.

Speaker 4:          00:02:23       I don't think you understand that. And before I wasn't I before, I was not angry per say, I was disappointed. Maybe I thought maybe there was room for it before an apology. You've clearly told us that you did not plant. Offer an apology for your words. You left the meeting last night to go home and vent. Tweak. Do not interrupt me to tweet from your Twitter and then the filaments. Twitter, you showed no remorse. You tried to let your wife leave that conversation without having answered for herself. That is disgusting. That is sick. And now I wasn't angry before. I was not angry before, but now I am actually angry sir. I really do not interrupt me. I was not angry. And now I want your job to be taken from you. I don't want you to have this job. I am disgusted knowing that you work at Yale University where I will get my degree.

Speaker 4:          00:03:11       Well, I will look back and think I have to argue with you. All right? Don't Miss Sarah. Don't do it. Don't do it. Third, to not do it. This is not the day you do not want to play this game with meters out of thing. You don't wanna play this game with me. Okay? Understand that. Look me in my face first of all and understand that you are such a disappointment to this university, to your students, to yourself. Do the things that you do claim to agree with you are you want free dialogue. You want free speech. This is how it works. Someone speaks, you listen, you're not cut them off. You did not do these, these condescending gestures. You do not smirk. You look them in the face and you wait. You wait until it's your turn.

Speaker 3:          00:03:51       Okay? So before we even dive into that, the second we played the clip, you let out a big exhale. You just not was interested in this anymore or it's depressing to look back at. Both are true. It's, you know, it's, um, I was in the courtyard for two hours and 15 minutes from four to six, 15 about an hour of footage has been released of from five or six different vantage points. You showed one clip that's typically not the clip that's shown. Um, so many people put stuff online you can read, you can piece together the whole hour between five and six. For the first hour that I was out in the courtyard, I listened quietly to the students. Um, you know, there's a lot of stuff that, that young woman said that's just factually wrong. Um, she's alluding to an event that occurred the night before at the Afro Afro American Cultural House at Yale where there was a huge event with hundreds of students.

Speaker 3:          00:04:44       Um, it had been announced at the beginning that, that we would have to leave that event at the conclusion it was, I can't remember the precise timing, but I think it was scheduled from six to eight. My wife had to teach a class from seven to nine, so she deals in the evening. So she told her students she'd be late and we'd stay from six to eight. She did in fact speak to the crowd. She, um, had to leave to teach an eye. We had a student in the hospital actually that evening that I was responsible for and that also was known. So, so when she said that we tried to leave, that's not, that's false. Um, you know, I think that um, many of the students were swept up in a kind of a mob fervor. I think they behave badly. Um, they should have known better.

Speaker 3:          00:05:31       I think they were trying to assert power. If I had a tool when I was that age that could get grownups into trouble. Right. Uh, you know, probably I would just get doing it nonstop, you know, and they have found a tool often are doing it. Yes. Yes. And so, but so I think what distressed me is I think at some point in the background of that footage that one of the administrators, actually the author, what happened is, is a man by the name of Howard. I had moved from north western university to Yale and had assumed a new position there. And he had written an email. He had written a memo while at Northwestern, uh, admonishing students not to wear a offensive costumes. And I should say for the record that many of the students that many of the costumes that he or anyone else would find offensive, I too would find offensive.

Speaker 3:          00:06:20       I wouldn't like these costumes. I, I'm well aware of the long history of racism in our society. I am well aware of the ways in which, uh, there's trafficking and certain cultural tropes that put down other groups. I reject. I am of, I've a very pro immigrant policy. I believe system. I, I think that anyone can be an American. I love the idea that we have open borders, you know, I mean I have all set of beliefs that are around openness and welcoming or lefty. Yeah. I am quite lot. I am a lefty. I'm left of center plate. I mean I have some conservative ideas, some libertarian, I think of myself as a classical liberal and I think of myself as very pragmatic and policymaking. So I like, I like markets to address most allocation of goods, but I also very concerned about market failures and then I want government intervention.

Speaker 3:          00:07:07       Anyway, so, um, so, uh, so that, anyway, that man who was, I then had moved to Yale and then he took out of mothballs this email that he had sent at Northwestern five or 10 years earlier, got a bunch of Yale administrators to sign it and then send it off. And in it he had links to approved and non-approved costumes are very costumes which were deemed to be offensive in his email. There were links to lots of those ostensibly offensive costumes and the students, there had been a lot of conversation at the time. The New York Times had a big piece like the previous month about the growing use of Halloween costume advice at American colleges. So it was in his, like guys, this was the third, his email was the third email that had been sent out telling students, giving them advice. So in my wife's class, many of the students in the class and other students in the college where we, the subpart of Yale that we were responsible for had told her that they felt this was very infantilizing and they didn't really need advice on what to wear.

Speaker 3:          00:08:03       And so my wife from a developmental perspective wrote a response to this email, which itself had been, was signed by 13 administrators. It, it didn't, it was framed as guidance, but it sort of had the color of law. And um, so she wrote a response saying, and her intellectual point was not wear whatever you want. Right. Her intellectual point was, do you students at Yale in your twenties early twenties late teens, early twenties really need older adults to tell you what to wear, provide you guidance. You should think about that and decide whether you really, and apparently many students did want such guidance. And so then I was then thereafter, then all hell broke loose. And I was in the court courtyard and did the best I could. Yeah. What do you make of the reason we chose that cliff was because there is the other more famous clip of, of the growth, really liberating with, there were many, many, they were hired on you that, that was the one that I think we should note here. And I think that's the most of our little bubble. I thought that one was interesting because the angle was a little different and you could see some of the other kids and the, and the, you know, the either tears or the look of horror, all of these things when you actually didn't do anything.

Speaker 3:          00:09:16       Well that's another whole topic. I think that, um, I mean many people have analyzed those events and honestly, I don't, I don't know if I have anything to add to those analyses. I think that the thing that was very interesting to mean, so, so one of the ideas that I've been thinking about for a long time is this tension between our individuality and our group of shyness. And we have evolved to, first of all, it's a very interesting idea. We've evolved to be individuals, so we humans have unique identities. So we have unique faces. So you can look out at a sea of people and can tell who's who. And not only do we have the ability to signal our uniqueness, we use our faces for that, but we have the cognitive apparatus to detect that uniqueness. So you can have a lot of brainpower you haven't done, you allocate to tell who's who.

Speaker 3:          00:10:03       So this ability to be individuals is crucial for our ability to function in groups. It's very paradoxical because you need the capacity to tell who's my offspring, who's my friend? Who do I reciprocate? Kindness to, who do I cooperate with? Who's my enemy? All of these things. So all of these capacities of individuality are crucial to our collective expression, our ability to live together. But equally we, um, we have this desire to surrender ourselves to the group, to do something called two d individually, to form a part of a collectivity to suppress our individual desires, which also allows us to work together. But the irony is when you'd get too much of that, you get mobs, you get panics, you get, you know, uh, uh, all kinds of collective phenomena that are destructive rather than constructive. So when I was in the crowd, when I was in that mob, I, I knew what was happening, I could tell.

Speaker 3:          00:10:59       So one of the things I started doing was as I started asking people, what's your name? And I was trying to connect to them person to person saying, you know, hi, I'm Nicholas. Who are you? So you're a person and I'm a person. You're not a part of this, a mob. You're a human being. And I am a human being. And in fact, the, the one thing that happened that that isn't as an intellectual idea, that's part of this book that I've been working on for 10 years. But that also I made in the heat of the moment is in the moment I said to the students, I said that I believe in our common humanity. I believe that even though this person and this person is superficially different than me, nevertheless, we can talk to each other. We all have life experiences where human beings and ended.

Speaker 3:          00:11:42       And then if you, if you don't believe that, if you don't believe we have a common humanity, which I see as a wonderful thing. Yes, yes. Cause I'm an optimist. I'm an optimist. If you don't believe our common humanity, why are you even trying to talk to me and the students geared to, yeah, they jeered it's on film. They jeered and I honestly, I think that's one of the most depressing things that's happened that I've ever seen actually said the yields students in the 21st century would jeer at what I regard to be a fundamental, humane, wonderful claim about human beings is that we have a common humanity.

Speaker 2:          00:12:20       So, all right. So I know you don't want to spend the whole time, but I do. But I think a lot of this does segue to your book for reasons that you just laid out. So those trying to do that. Yeah, I know you're a very clever, you're tid bits. You can, I'll watch what, I'm going to go back in there. How did they get us there then? Okay. Right on his back. Um, but that look that you're talking about when, when you say that, like we have to be able to share a common humanity. I've been there too. I mean I face these mobs to do and what I find is there's an actual look they have in their heads where the individual that you just spoke about is gone. Um, did you think there was anything, so I guess there's really, in that case, for the people that are watching this that think that one day they are going to go against the mob, is there any other advice you would have for them on how to, how to do it? Because that doesn't always work. I mean, saying, I, I've done that where I've said, I'm standing right in front of you. I'm listening to you. My name's Dave and it doesn't work that

Speaker 3:          00:13:15       I think that, um, I, I don't know. I, I don't know. You know, there's that, there's that scene in Lord of the rings where Aragorn rushes the gates, you know, um, and have more door. And I of course love those movies and uh, you know, I don't know if I would have, I don't think, I don't know if I would be capable of such bravery, but, um, intellectually I definitely am. That is to say I'm not easily cowed. Um, and I, I have spent my life training myself to think as clearly as I can to look at evidence to collect evidence. I'm an if scientist, I'm an empiricist. So, um, so in the, in the case of a mob, I don't think I would yield to a mob intellectually. Now, physically, you know, if they're, if they're throwing bricks at you as a different thing, but I think

Speaker 2:          00:14:12       you too often that threat is always there. Even if they're not holding a weapon that threads, right.

Speaker 3:          00:14:17       It's a dangerous situation. I would agree. But mass, you know, [inaudible] are always dangerous. But my point is that I think that if you, if you can keep your calm, you can think clearly about what you're saying. Also, if you've thought about these ideas before in the cool of the day, so it's not the heat of the moment said, look, I really thought about these ideas. This is not just a sudden heat of passion. Like I've, I've thought about this topic or this point, whatever it is. It doesn't have to be a political point. It can be scientific point or something. Then when you're pressed, you know, you can say, you know, I'm listening to you. Here's what I think. Okay. What do you think? I think you can, I think you can, you can, I won't say you can win the battle of ideas, but you can at least fight it.

Speaker 3:          00:14:56       Well. Yeah. What was the administration's response after this older, well, I think the administration faced a difficult challenge in deciding what to do. Many people have commented on what they did or didn't do. I'm not sure I want to go into it. Um, it took them quite awhile to come to, to release any kind of public statement in support of us. Um, so, and you know, many members of the administration, junior members were actually involved in, so in the crowd that day, they were four, four administrators actually, uh, who, um, you know, who's others have since identified. But um, you know, I think, I don't think it was Yale at its best. And um, and I don't in the students were not at their best and I was not at my best. I did my best, but you know, I think I could've done even better.

Speaker 3:          00:15:41       So as someone that then has lived through it, where did this go wrong? On college campuses because for the past couple of years, every time I see one of these stories I think either, well, I used to think, oh this, this is the end of it. Now people will really get it. Like I remember you're the one with you from the other video clip that we didn't show that people had seen. It was like, this is so patently absurd. Maybe this will finally be the wake up call. I've now come to believe that the wake up call, these can come at anytime soon, sadly. Um, but what, when do you think as well, I think this is a complicated topic. I see. You know, this is not, it was not my area of expertise. I am a natural and social scientist. I run a lab with computer scientists and molecular biologists and sociologists and evolutionary biologists, and we work around the world who do all kinds of stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:16:29       So I was, I have always been committed to liberal principles including to free speech. When, when I was at Harvard, before I moved to Yale in 2013, uh, my wife and I came to the defense of minority students who were being, um, having their right or speech rights squelched on campus. So I'm committed to these ideas, but it wasn't the most central part of my life. And I'm not an expert like John Height or, or Greg Lukey off look Kiana far, however, so, so I see conflicting evidence. I agree with you that there are a lot of these salient cases which, which they weren't before. And Jonathan feels that they're still rising and they have their own theories. Jonathan and Greg about why I see other evidence that looks at surveys of college students and finds that they are no more or less likely to want to suppress the speech of others than adults and older adults.

Speaker 3:          00:17:20       It's very tempting to silence people who don't agree with, right? I mean, everyone wants to do that, but I don't, I want to talk to them and persuade them like it would be, it would be, it's very tempting to like, you know, shut the anti-vaxxer is up, you know, prevent them from speaking. But that doesn't win, right? That that's not a victory. What we need to do is persuade them. Why do you believe, think this? So, so if you compare college students to adults, some evidence suggests they're not more sanctimonious. Some evidence suggests there are some polls, uh, if you look a disadvantage there clearly rising, but they're still small. So, so the critics say there's a rising level of [inaudible], which I deplore let me just, can I go on a degression? Yeah. Yes. So I have no, let me be very clear because there's a lot of sloppy thinking about this.

Speaker 3:          00:18:04       Nobody has a right to speak on a college campus. So I'm not claiming that anyone has the right. But once a group on campus invites you to speak, you cannot yield to the mob Verdis invitation. It totally destroys the university. It's, it's the antithesis of what a university should be like. So you can protest that person, but you cannot have dissertations. That's just ridiculous. So, so they're, so those have been rising, but so the critics say, look, this invitation had been rising, but the defendant saying yes, but millions of Tok state place and nobody objects. So it's a tiny minority. So to answer your question, I don't, I don't think we're beyond the hump, but I'm not the expert to tell you. How bad is it?

Speaker 2:          00:18:45       Does it say something about the state of liberalism or in a way that, that this was sort of the end conclusion of liberalism? I hate to say it, that it would get sort of usurped by progressivism or whatever the new collectivist idea was. In other words, liberals are tolerant. Liberals generally are live and let live. So it was sort of fertile ground for people with bad ideas to Russian and kind of take over where perhaps conservatives are a little harder to get in at

Speaker 3:          00:19:15       they derivatives. Yeah. Yeah. But conservatives have their own political failings. Right. But I have no doubt. Yeah. They'll move in lock step so you can get them to like, you know, you two to mark to get, to get to organize an inquisition. Right. So, you know, it's not like, right. We can conserve. I'm Larry, I'm not comparing either one. I'm just saying that there is a weakness of liberalism, which is very sad for me to say. The openness is exactly what invites, yeah. So this is the radicalism within. So I mean I think this is, I mean I think, you know, the open society and its, and its enemies. Um, you know, I think there is a sense in which you can use the, the tools to destroy the foundation. Um, but I also think, and this is one of the arguments that I made and I actually believe politically, which is that these very core commitments to freedom of assembly, freedom of expression, which the students were using right now. Then we're also engaging in harassment, which is a different topic. And because I was an actor in those events, I was, I didn't feel at liberty to help the students see the difference between freedom of expression and harassment. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:20:22       Yeah. Somehow I don't think they would've been like, oh, let's sit down and listen to him as you

Speaker 3:          00:20:25       explains why, you know, so you can, so the classic example is the, you know, is that, you know, you can, you can march through the streets of Skokie, Illinois, but you can't stop in front of my house, right. Because, you know, that is a threat, uh, the political expression and a public places not so, so, uh, so the students, so the, so, uh, um, I lost my train of thought. Where was I going? Uh, well, basically the idea that the liberalism and that, yeah. So, so the, so the, so, so these are chord, that sort of non-corrupt judiciary sort of impartial separation of powers, freedom of assembly, freedom of speech. I regard these as like foundational principles of our democracy, which are essential liberal principles. Liberal principles. Yes, yes. Liberal Bristles, which the students in some ways we're using, right. Um, except to call for people to be fired for expressing their ideas in a collared campus is using these principles but to liberal ends.

Speaker 3:          00:21:19       And this is what you're asking, I think, which is what you're saying is can these tools be used to like degrade the, and the answer is yes, there is a kind of threat from within, but I still wouldn't abandon the principles and I don't want to abandon the peanut goes either. Okay. There we go. You want to shift to the book or you want to keep going? No, no, no. Please, please, please. I would much rather talk about this book. All right. So it's called blueprint, the evolutionary origins of a good society. So let's start with the tag there. So we actually live in a good society. I can't believe it. I thought we live in the worst society. Capitalism is evil and the patriarchy and so many terrible things, and we've done horrible things, but say this is good. Yeah, I'm appalled. Can you please explain this about commercial statement?

Speaker 3:          00:22:01       Yes. Okay. So I think there has been a long tradition in the sciences and in the public domain as well of um, focusing on the bad side of human nature, on our propensity for tribalism or selfishness or violence or hatred. But equally we are natural selection of our evolution has equipped us and shaped us for love and friendship and cooperation and teaching and all these other wonderful qualities. And in fact, I would argue that these good qualities and their benefits must necessarily have outweighed the bad qualities and their costs. Because if I came near you, I'm now speaking over evolutionary time, over tens or hundreds of thousands of years. If I came near you and you killed me or filled me with lies or otherwise injured me, I would be better off living separately. So, so the, so the fact that we live socially suggests that on balance, the benefits of a connected life must outweigh the costs.

Speaker 3:          00:22:59       So the books, the book, what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to push back at these claims that we are, that humans are inexorably evil. And these arguments I should make, I should say, are supplementary to the, uh, the body of ideas that Steven pinker and others had been advancing about the sweep of history. So where Stephen is interested in historical forces, I'm interested in the books over there. So, yeah, an Amy's I see in a bunch of other younger Steve and Amy. Oh, my friends Neil Neil crew by data. So you want to be yes, please put me over there with those guys. Yes, exactly. Some of those guys. Yes. And Schirmer's book. I can see. Yeah, these are great. Um, okay, so, uh, uh, yeah, the moral arc. [inaudible] great. So I'll make sure you have a copy. Okay. But anyway. Um, so, so, um, so, uh, uh, so Steven is arguing that, uh, you know, basically since the enlightenment, the philosophical principles in the scientific discoveries, discoveries of the enlightenment, the world has been getting better and he's unquestionably bright.

Speaker 3:          00:24:00       We are safer, less violent, healthier, live, longer, wealthier, better off at every, every possible dimension. And that is largely a product of historical forces. But what I'm arguing and technological forces, but what I'm arguing is that we don't just have to look to our history to find this goodness. We can look to our pre history and actually over tens of thousands of years we've been shaped to be good. We have been shaped to be able to live together in productive ways, in good ways, actually in morally good ways. I even argue. So, so the both works synergistically, these two forces and in, and in fact, I would even argue that these historical and technological forces are actually just a thin veneer on top of much more powerful forces. So he's there a bizarre evolutionary force that, that inclines us to focus on the negative. Oh no, that's a good question.

Speaker 3:          00:24:50       I suspect if I had to get one per show, no, no, no, no, no. Um, I would say right because if you a person or things good or bad, people generally tend to bed. We watch the local news. That is all terrible news. We're conditioned sort of. So there must be something that's leading to that. Yes. I think that, I think, I know this has been studied. I'm trying to quickly call the literature to my mind. Um, if I had to speculate on what the conclusions of that literature would be, it would be that there's more advantage to paying attention to bad news and good news that, that the fitness advantage is survival advantage. The advantage to your wellbeing from, um, noting a fire in your vicinity or a Predator or a killer, uh, is more advantageous to you than, than, uh, than noted the noting the on, on average the presence of water or a food or a kindly person.

Speaker 3:          00:25:42       So I think, I think that that's probably why we're hardwired to be pessimistic, but actually we're not, let me be clear. So, uh, so we have both pessimistic and optimistic, uh, inclinations. People. And of course there's Inter individual variation. People vary in this, these personality traits. But I think on overall we are definitely inclined to the good. So when you described yourself as an optimist before, if you had to try to parse that out between what you think human nature is versus upbringing and everything else, could you give it some percentages? I mean where your parents optimists so that then push a well as ideas to you or I think it's important not to conflate personality traits. Uh, which I am a optimist. I think it person by personality with um, sort of, um, how to put this exactly the kind of characteristics of our species.

Speaker 3:          00:26:34       So I think we, for example, we are cooperative species. We cooperate with strangers, which is very unusual. Other animals will cooperate with, but we also cooperate with non-kin. It's rare in the animal kingdom. So I don't know how you would describe that. I wouldn't call that optimism exactly. I would call that something good cooperativity. That's a characteristic of our species. And then above and beyond that we also have personalities. Some of us are optimistic, some of us are not. But all of us, for example, love our mates. So here's an interesting idea. Why? Why do we do that? It other animals have sex with each other. We're not the only animals that do this, but we also love each other. We formed sentimental attachments to the people we are having sex with. We are also tend to be monogamous and that we can be by monogamous, I don't mean social monogamy or even heterosexual monogamy.

Speaker 3:          00:27:24       I mean we form a longterm attachment to the person we're having sex with. Whether it's polygynous, polyandrous, straight or gay, doesn't matter. We love the person we're with. Why? Why do we evolve this capacity? Well, I talk a little bit about that. Why would do that? And it's universal. Everywhere in the world you go, no matter what the marital system, people love their partners instantly. We get too proud of ourselves. Birds. 90% of bird species are also monogamous. But anyway, so the point is is that there are all these qualities we have or we befriend each other. Why do we do that? We, we don't just reproduce with each other. We form longterm non reproductive unions with other members of our species. Namely, we have friends. This is very rare in the animal kingdom. We do it, certain primates do it, whales, orcas and dolphins do it.

Speaker 3:          00:28:10       And elephants do it. Why? Well, there's a reason we do it and it's a wonderful quality of our species. So do you think societies should be organized to help these institutions? I mean, this is where I could throw out Jordan Peterson's enforced monogamy and you know, people had a field day with that at all. He really was saying was that societies should kind of look at marriages, it Justin thing, because it's a foundational thing that will help you build a family, help you build it for full of life. Do you agree that that's part of what would lead to a good society or which should be instilled? Well, I say I talk about that in the book. Uh, when I talk about is that we should be very wary of efforts to engineer society in opposition to our evolved proclivities. So societies that try for example, to prevent loving attachments.

Speaker 3:          00:28:58       I talk about communes for example, communes have a problem because in a commune they want you to feel loyalty to the group, to the commune. So therefore feeling of love for your partner is a threat. So many communes have gone two opposite extremes, both of which are attempting to solve the same problem. So on the one hand you have the shakers who say no sex, no loving attachment. On the other hand you have communes that say polyamory. Everyone loves everybody or can have sex with everyone. Both of those are attempting to sever an individualistic connection between two people, which therefore you in the same thing happens in eastern Germany where they tried to separate connections with friends, right? You don't you who my friends could be spying on me or ratting out to the Staci [inaudible] sitting there for a second. Cause it's a fascinating idea that it's the same force at work.

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       Whether you say to people don't have any relationships, is actually the same divorce as have relations with everybody. I mean that's, that's not something that the average person is thinking about. But if you're just having relations with everybody, yes, you're actually having on special nobody. That's right. So they're both, both of those extreme strategies are tackling the same problem, which is the threat to the collectivity of individual relationships, whether it's with your partner, your sexual partner, or as I was about to say with your friends or others. So collectivist societies will often, every everyone call you comrade. So everyone is your friend. Same as having polyamory, right? It's like the polyamorous equivalent to everyone dresses the same. We all call each other friend. No individual identity. It's a kind of, it's a kind of science fiction dystopia actually. So the argument I make is, is that we should be very wary of efforts to engineer society in opposition to our interests.

Speaker 3:          00:30:32       They're bound to fail is my argument. Now there are brief moments of time and certain cultures where you can apply a tremendous cultural force and suppress some of these innate tendencies. So, for example, I talk about the not, so if you look at societies around the world that the, the, the, the expression of love for your partners, seeing universally, except perhaps with one exception, which is the not people in the Himalayas who've organized society around a brief sexual encounters, you're not supposed to love your partner. And so this is a matrilineal society. The women stay at home. The men will go out at night basically cruising for dates. So there'll be like, and it's not uncommon for every woman to have had sex with every man in the village. And the men will be knocking on the door, take me tonight, take me. And she'll pick this guy tonight and they'll have a brief fling.

Speaker 3:          00:31:19       Maybe he can come back and at any moment, either of them can break off the relationship, but even in it, and so there's a whole complex cultural edifice. Marco Polo describes this when he gets to China, the Chinese government thought it was sapping productivity, that everyone was having sex all the time. They were, they were saying, we need to stop this. They tried to stamp it out, but it still has existed. This, this culture, this cultural set of rules. But even in this society, there are people who want the forbidden fruit of having a, a committed relationship and who flee for because they want to be with each other, forsaking all others. So even this society cannot fully suppressed this desire for love. And I look also at friendship and show that there are some societies, very few which seem to have no, um, experience of this notion of friendship.

Speaker 3:          00:32:10       But those societies are extremely rare and also have certain idiosyncrasies. So the simple way of saying that'd be that there's basically an evolutionary force that no matter how far you go to one extreme, it has to sort of push you. Yes. Or that it's extremely difficult to entirely suppressed. You can, through force of arms, you know, you can slaughter populations. You can, you can, you know, you can, uh, you can, um, have very elaborate, uh, sort of autocratic governments. You, you can have procedures or other highly evolved stylized that have cotton to this. For example, there's a play is universal and children and there's one society, the [inaudible] people who really think play is awful and really try to suppress the innate tendency of children to play. So there's very little play among children in that society, but it's, these societies are rare and they require very large cultural forces to suppress these innate tendencies.

Speaker 2:          00:33:01       You know, I was thinking as we've been talking about this, that there's something also sort of related to our political situation right now about this that it seems like we're sort of going off the deep end. I would say the argue more on the left at the moment. Um, but I guess if I'm an optimist here and I described myself as a world weary optimist that you're saying at some point and whether Jonathan Haidt says it's two years down the road or whenever it is that at some point we'll eventually have to rebound right. Secrets. Sure. Cause it, what is it? If it doesn't rebound then, then that's just, no, I don't think Jordan Peterson would say is just chaos. Right?

Speaker 3:          00:33:35       Yeah. I think, I think, I mean, I, I can't, I think we're in for another, I think there'll be about five or 10 years. Our society is going to go through a long period of, of, of acrimony. Um, no, I have to say I'm not, you know, um, sort of, I don't have a wig ish view of history. Like, oh, in the olden days, you know, uh, everything was great. I mean, let's not forget we had, we had colonialism, we had slavery, we had a, we had to anti immigrant sentiment forever and our couldn't even vote. Yes. Women couldn't vote. Exactly. Do you have gay rights? You know, so, so there's always been this uh, this incredible disconnect between our wonderful principles in our society. All men are created equal. You know, the bill of rights can bring tears to your eyes if you read it.

Speaker 3:          00:34:20       And the fact that we didn't always, but we are, I think getting better. This is the progressive in me. You know, the society, we're getting better and better. We are expanding the franchise to more and more people. We are opening up our democracy. We are, we are extending rights, we are extending liberties. Um, now of course the libertarian, we'll say the government doesn't grant liberties. We are protecting liberties are, you know, we are trying to stay out but took it right out of it is exactly. And I agree with that actually. I don't think the liberties over the governments to grant, but anyway, so, uh, but I think our society is getting better in these regards. Um, I don't think you can, you could say otherwise. So I think that we, we will get there. It's just going to take some time.

Speaker 2:          00:35:03       So how do you navigate through a messy time like this? If you're someone that's just kind of awake to these ideas and you want to be able to express your individuality, but there is a mob or a morphous machine that is silencing things, or as you just said before, that you don't want a society that's going to push down things that were sort of always accepted for a long time. I'm slightly paraphrasing, but, so right now it's like if you call a man a man, they'll tell you you're a folk. These, these basic things that seem, now we hear about them constantly as if, as if this is just the most important thing happening.

Speaker 3:          00:35:37       No, I think

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       there are other, this is the other thing. I think that I think there are certain segments of Twitter in certain segments of our society that have made these particular topics than others. A very central in everyone. You know, the people who want to, who are concerned about climate change or people who come as I am, they're people who are concerned about the private Prentice prison industry as I am. These are two hot topics at Harvard right now. So there was a heckler situation where the president of Harvard was, was not allowed to speak about, he was at an educational conference and these groups that were opposed to private ownership of prisons, which I am and, uh, concern about climate change, which I also am, they shut the president down, which is ridiculous, you know? I mean, why did they shut him? Because he thought he wasn't taking, paying enough attention to their concern.

Speaker 2:          00:36:17       So you, you have this kind of ruled by minorities, right? Where a vocal minority can hijack the conversation about whatever particular topic they have. So everyone's entitled to have their topics of interest. But that doesn't mean you have to go along with it, right? You can have your own ideas about the topic or you can switch conversation. Like, I'm not interested in talking about trans rights today. Today I'd like to talk about, uh, how, uh, motor vehicle accidents are the one of the leading killers or the opioid crisis. There's another important dilemma. Where are the guns? You know, we, we, we have, we have more people are killed by guns in our society per capita than any society in the world almost. It's craziness. So, um, so all of these are different people have different, anyway, the point I'm making is that if you wish to engage in a conversation with someone about a topic they feel strongly about, I think it's incumbent on you to listen to their arguments, think and then respond.

Speaker 2:          00:37:05       So do you think there's an evolutionary reason that people either basically become sort of government people or freedom people? So the way you were laying out that argument, is that going to go, it's like you were telling me your progressive, uh, sort of prayed, which I have to do all the time, but then you basically said, yeah, but all these things can be accomplished by libertarianism if you don't believe that it's the government's job to give these things. So that basically it sort of shows why the progressive's are the ones screaming on campus all the time. And it's in larger society because they think the system can be perfected to get it however they want it. Where are the Libertarians? I think just say I'm very wearable system. Yeah. I don't think the system can be perfect. So let's just keep it out of our lives. I mean, I think, you know, which, which idea I'm more sympathetic to. But do you think there's a reason that what occurs? That yes.

Speaker 3:          00:37:52       Okay. So there are, there are a set of ideas about where do, where do so, so the content of political beliefs, like whether for example you believe in, um, whatever it is, pick I know any, the, the, the belief you have about a particular topic is of course not evolutionarily shaped, but there is a kind of evolutionary shaping to whether or not you are more conservative or liberal. That's what I'm trying to get. Yeah. So some people are more rule abiding and there's an, there's a good, for example, children that learn children that listen to their parents might be more likely to survive. So listening to your parents is actually a good survival strategy. On the other hand, too much obedience is also bad. You can be led like a lemming off a cliff. So occasionally you need to not listen to what everyone else is doing.

Speaker 3:          00:38:40       So both are advantageous and we're, we're equipped with both abilities and there's variation across people and it's a complicated topic. So nobody thinks there's like a genetic background to being a Democrat or a Republican. But there is evidence that there is a kind of genetic predisposition to certain political polls. But what I would say though is that we live in a plural democracy. So you're going to have to compromise, you know, uh, if you're a libertarian who thinks x, Y, and Z, and you're going to be in a society with other people who think different things, we have decided to come together as a people and vote to resolve our disputes. And t by the way, not just to vote, but to educate ourselves and to teach each other stuff, right? To communicate. Right. The founders recognize that in order for us to get to the wisest decision, we have to have free and open conversation.

Speaker 3:          00:39:30       Well, I think that's why, which I support I do here. Well of course you do. But that's why so many people are so concerned about this at the college layer. You know, I'll hear some of our critics will say, oh, they're just obsessed with what's happening on colleges and they're handing over all this power to the, to the mob oncologist. But then, but then every day we see it then leak out. And also these people will be the leaders of tomorrow. That's why I don't think it's, I don't think it's overestimating. And even if it is a small minority, which we agree, the amount of power they can extend, they definitely needs to be way disproportionate to the numbers. For sure. I would agree with that. Uh, I would agree that the vast majority of students on any college campus just want to get a good education and, um, and many of them have other political concerns other than some of the ones that are getting a lot of attention.

Speaker 3:          00:40:14       So, um, you know, even for example, even with the, you know, so you know, people are concerned about the opioid crisis. They're concerned about gun violence, are concerned about police brutality. They're concerned about the climate change, are concerned about all of these issues, which I think weren't concerned. We can perfect our society, we can be better than we are. And I generally, we can perfect it. I, I do better than we are. But you think we can perfect it. No, I don't think we can have a perfect society, but I think we can make it better than it is. So by perfect, I mean improve. Um, so I think we can make our society better and better. I don't think we're done yet. I think there's still deficits are, for example, our spending is crazy. I mean, I think we do better fiscal fiscally. Um, you know, I think we have, we have a carceral state.

Speaker 3:          00:40:55       We have, I think, I think this number's right, that upper on a per capita basis. We have as many people in prisons as Stalinist Russia. I mean, it's insane. You know, we have millions of Americans are in prison and it's way out of proportion to other countries. Um, you know, there are lots of things about our society. We have very high, we have century long heights of income inequality in our society. There's a big debate about whether that is an unavoidable side effect of growth. You know, everyone is better off. So what do we care if the income is unequally distributed? But I think I tend to be agree with the critics that are concerned that this level of inequalities not sustainable to have a common wheel to like have a, a sense that everyone is a part of the society. We've had no income growth in the middle.

Speaker 3:          00:41:35       Uh, like the meeting American has seen in a generation and see no growth in wages. Right? So the bottom actually has raised and we've watched the top go bananas, but the middle of the bottom hasn't even gone up that much either. Well, let me, let me put it this way. They have absolutely not been living standards, right? So like a poor American today is vastly better off than a poor American a generation ago. But in terms of wage growth, there's been very little growth. My understanding of statistics and most of the accumulation of wealth in the last generation has gone to the top, top 1% 0.1%. Anyway, there's a debate about why that happened. The technological advance that we have. The same thing during the industrial revolution. These are important deep ideas, which as a society we should be debating and discussing. What's the best for our society anyway, there are, these are all much more important topics in my view, and have much more bearing on the wellbeing of our society than a lot of the other crap that gets so much attention.

Speaker 3:          00:42:27       So what's the evolutionary reason for that? I mean, your previous book was about social media, right? So there's gotta be some link there. I mean, and it's already getting back to what I was saying. I know I've got depressing local news. I don't know. I mean, I'm trying to talk about things that I think are important. Um, you know, I, I, um, I'm doing my part as best I can, who's done a society in a more quote unquote good way than we have right now. So, uh, so the book, so I don't, I don't, I'm not, it's not a work of history, so I'm not, I'm not, I don't primarily talk about, um, like the last 200 or even 2000 years of human evolution or experience. I'm much more interested in the long arc of our history. And if you look at, um, forged your societies around the world as I do, and you, and you look at their qualities, you will see that again and again.

Speaker 3:          00:43:19       These societies have these desirable properties. They, there's variation of course, and how cooperative they are. And there's variation in marital systems and there's variation in sustenance systems. There's a lot of variation. But also there's a lot of commonality. And those common features I argue are universal. See, here's the other argument. The argument is that, uh, there are these universal qualities that are shared across all societies. They are shaped by our evolution. They're not just a product of historical forces. Can you just list out a couple of them again, just so, so love, love a friendship, uh, cooperation where cooperative species, you'll be kind to a stranger on the first tee. You know, uh, teaching the fact that we teach each other stuff, which actually is the ultimate source of all our wealth and wellbeing. The fact that we can accumulate knowledge and distributed across time and place.

Speaker 3:          00:44:09       So I can tell people far away something. And when I'm born, I benefit from all the other knowledge that has been produced for the many hundreds of thousands of years before me is astonishing. And I would again argue this is why what's happening on college. Yes, I would argue with, I would agree with that. There's a connection there. Like our capacity to teach and to create environments in which we foster teaching and learning are crucial anyway. Also hierarchy. We are a species that we cannot survive with no hierarchy. We need some leaders and I discussed that but we also don't like too much hierarchy. So when you get too autocratic power, the little guys down below band together and basically kills. So Richard Wrangham has been making this argument that we self domesticated as a species that over millennia bands of weaker members would say, you know, that guy's too powerful and he's getting all the dates and this we're going to kill them.

Speaker 3:          00:44:57       And basically they did. So we got more peaceful as time went by. Is One of the ideas, mild hierarchy in group bias. So some tribalism is unavoidable in human beings. Um, this capacity for identity that we discussed at the beginning. These are all qualities. So identity, love, friendships, social networks, mild hierarchy in group bias, teaching and social learning. These are seen everywhere and they lie and I believe at the core of a good society and, and institutions, uh, uh, try to suppress those at their own peril. Yeah. How can you be sort of, have a healthy dose of in group preference without starting to fall into the trap of identity politics. So for example, you're agree guys. Yes. Greek thing I did. I love Greek, my best child friends growing up in the Greek, we're still great friends. Um, I love Greek culture and the way that opened a Greek and the interest in intellectual wisdom and I love feta cheese and all of those things.

Speaker 3:          00:45:54       Span of Kopi dialogue. Yes. Yes. Great. So, and you can open a Greek restaurant. As far as I'm concerned, I wouldn't object. That'd be totally fine. [inaudible] I know that port, that poor girl, it's insane. It's toe Chinese residents without being Chinese. And not just that there was the, there's the person in in Oregon that had a Mexican restaurant. Yes. There's so many examples of this is unbelievable. So how can you say love a call? I just told you all the reasons I left this year. But let's pretend, let's say it's roughly the same feelings about your own culture. How can you embrace all of those things without falling into the trap of identity politics? Because I think that's, yeah, so I think there are a lot of people are at these days. Okay. So I have a couple of ideas and responses. The first thing I would say is, is that that this is one of the both the most, it's still not totally clear how we evolved to have this capacity.

Speaker 3:          00:46:42       It's felt that this ingroup bias, this I, this tribalism that we have was crucial to our ability to cooperate. That the ability to draw a distinction between us and them, that the challenge, the problem that, that this ability that we evolved. So, so there's whether we cooperate with each other and whether we are xenophobic or tribalistic or draw distinctions between us and them. And this property, this tribalism property is a property that reduces the scale of interactions. So instead of you having to cooperate with everybody, you only cooperate with your guys. And this is innate in human beings and it is felt that this ability to draw distinction between us and them was crucial in the emergence of the variability to cooperate with other people. Okay. So they're tied, they're connected to each other. What's is, is it necessary to hate the other group? Why can't you just love your own group, right?

Speaker 3:          00:47:35       So why could you be indifferent to the other group or even admire and say that to them? They're not us. We like them or we are in different to them. Why do we have to kill them? Right? Like why, you know, where does the killing part come from? Right? And this is complicated. We don't exactly know like where the hostility comes in weather, but we tend to see this hostility. So for example, are famous experiments that have been done with little toddlers. You can randomly assign toddlers to different tee shirts. You can test at the toddlers understand that this was random, that there was no merit to whether they got the yellow t shirt or the green t shirt. And yet as soon as you give them the t shirts, the yellow t shirt, kids say those green t shirt children, they shouldn't have toys.

Speaker 3:          00:48:14       They're bad children. They don't deserve, you know, anything. It's insane. Look like you can see this is called the minimal group experiments. So the most trivial of interventions you can elicit in us this, this, this, dislike of the other. However, this is not the only tool that evolution has given us to live together, this disability to draw the boundary between us and them. Uh, there are a couple of other tools and before I tell you what those two other tools are, let me just say one other thing. So if you think of our society is, here's our whole society and here's our groups in the middle and here, individuals at the bottom. If you're struggling with the problem of tribalism, there are basically two ways you can go. You can go up a level and broadened the boundary and you can say, for example, we are all Americans, right?

Speaker 3:          00:49:02       You can say, because we all have the capacity to draw the boundary, we are evolved to have that capacity. Now you just say, actually these little group boundaries that we were paying attention to, they're not, they're not relevant and basically take all the ethnic divisions or other than the religious or immigrant or whatever it is, and we're all American. We're all American. This other group, yes, at a higher level. Exactly. So you move up a level and you efface tribalism by appeal to larger groups. This has been part of our history since the beginning to talk. They'll talks about this where nature of joiners, you know anyone can be an American, that that itself is part of the American project. It's astonishing. The belief which I share that anyone can be an American is a statement that the groups don't matter. Anyone can be an American, you just have to buy our liberal principles.

Speaker 3:          00:49:45       And then you could be an American even though there's a debate about that. But there's also an interesting parable to Trump here because at some level it's like he's talking about a miracle all the time. So that is the higher group for all of this. And yet I suspect your feelings on what he's doing. Yes. There's some other things, probably not, no, but I would be like, anyone can be an American. If you come to our country and you work and are productive and, and obey our laws and our constitution, you're an American as far as I'm concerned. It didn't matter whether you came from Mexico or you know, one of the four Mexican countries as he's, you know, anyway, okay, so a whole other show. Okay, good. So, so, okay, so, so, but another solution, okay to the group is of the tribalism. Mr.

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       Go down a level. Remember we talked earlier about individuals. So now you can say instead of looking at people as which groups are they a member of, you look at them as individual people. And this too has been a part of our history. So Martin Luther King's famous sentiment, I, you know, I'm look forward to a society in which people are judged by the content of their character rather than the color of their skin isn't appeal to our individuality. Seen groups don't matter. Individuals matter. So, so if we're struggling with tribalism, we'd go up or we can go down both help, however lateral to that point, there's another set of ideas, which is tribalism is not even the only tool we have in order to reduce the sense of scale and to cooperate. So natural selection is also equipped us with friendship, friendship, the really one of the reasons it is felt, we evolved the capacity for friendship is again to reduce the sense of scale. So instead of now and being in a big group, everyone has to cooperate with everyone. Each of us has a subset of people who are our friends that we cooperate with. So it's similar to tribalism, but different because now instead of defining it by group, membership is defined by each person has their particular friends. So this is another tool that we innately have that we can use to sustain our cooperative instincts and push aside the tribalism.

Speaker 2:          00:51:45       So how much do you think on a day, day and a day to day basis, are we, uh, normally I get the water for people. You had to be so wrapped up there. That's what I forgot. Uh, on a day to day basis, how much movement do we as individuals have to sort of

Speaker 3:          00:51:58       either go around, let's say go around our evolutionary behavior? Well, I don't think, okay. So I think I do believe in free will. I mean, I think you have, um, some capacity to self mastery and make her own decisions in life and your own, you know, um, but you're also born with certain innate qualities and you're also born a human being, which is you're part of a particular species that has a particular set of characteristics. Um, so I, I think that as individuals, you know, we have some control over how we act. I don't think our individual actions will individually change the whole society. But I think if each of us is attempting to do the right thing, I think ultimately that makes things better. Look, there's a lot of famous ideas. Uh, so a Victor Frankl who was in the concentration camps, his, his wife was killed.

Speaker 3:          00:52:57       He survives the Nazi concentration camps and he goes and he writes a famous book called Man's search for meaning after he's liberated it right to 10 days after his liberation. And he talks about how he came to the recognition that even in this camp in the most vile possible circumstance where his life was threatened every day, where people were dying all the time. He was starving to death. He had no shoes. It was in the winter. I mean it was a slave even there he recognized that he was the master of his own internal state. You know, that how he saw the world was something that was in his own control. So he was able to find a sense of self discipline and mastery even in an environment in which the structures around him were engineered to crush him, to kill him. So, so I think that there are, and there are many examples of this, I mean another one of my favorite examples is a Buddhist monks that were studied at MIT years ago.

Speaker 3:          00:53:49       I think I'm going to get the facts of this work correct. So, so, so they were very interested in how meditation changes the structure of your brain and how are these monks so able to be so peaceful in these very stressful circumstances. And they scan them, they put them in the MRI scanner and they looked at different parts of their brain in which parts were enhanced or diminished compared to other more ordinary mortals. And uh, and then, and they saw the different parts of the brain and Buddhist monks were different than the rest of us. But what interested me was not even the neuroanatomical discoveries that were in that paper, but it was the interviews with amongst and so at amongst would say was that, for example, let's say you and I are in traffic and someone cuts us off a normal response, certainly one that I often have is who is that jerk?

Speaker 3:          00:54:35       You know, you'd be really pissed off and your blood pressure would rise and maybe you'd race that guy and uh, you know, you would, you would think ill of them. That would be our natural goto thing. That's a thoughtless, maybe they're idiotic or they're inattentive or you would have all these bad thoughts about this person who, you know, in a road rage kind of way. The monks don't do that with, amongst do is they train themselves to regenerate. So when that happens, so then they say, maybe that's a man who's taking his wife to the hospital because she's delivering the baby. The baby's being born in the car in front of me. Isn't that amazing? There's a new life, I should help that man to get to the mean and they're doing it not for the sake of that person, but for their own wellbeing.

Speaker 3:          00:55:16       You see, so, so I think it's possible to, to, to, to re, even though it's difficult, it's very difficult to exercise some internal self control. I think you're mostly saying that there are no monks on Twitter. Yes, very few. The Dalai Lama, my things on Twitter, I think I follow up on do I think I have to check. He's on Facebook, I'm pretty sure. What else do you think sort of the average person that's watching this can do to help order a good society? Because I think people, you know, everything's become so political. Yes. I think people think that's the only solution to sort of help make a better, I think granting charity to your enemies I think is important. I think listening to them, cultivating, listening, you know, um, that's pretty big of you to say after everything. Well, I was listening in the clip you showed, I was listening.

Speaker 3:          00:56:03       I thought that was so ridiculous. The young woman who said, I'm not listening to her. I was really listening. I mean I was listening then and before and after. Um, I don't agree with what she was saying, but I heard what she was saying. I could summarize what she was saying but even, but what do you do in that case then? It just sort of, yeah, we don't have to bring it back to that specific instance, but in general, because I think a lot of people are going through this. You're being berated by somebody. They're saying all the worst things about you and your motives. They're attacking you as a person. All of those things now you can listen, you can absorb and ignore. You can ignore. All Ruth Bader Ginsburg says survival in life is ignoring a lot of the stupidities, which I also think is good.

Speaker 3:          00:56:42       I think that's the answer and what was ignore and also who was that famous actress that found this guy in Texas that had said horrible things to her and then, or him I can't remember, was an actor, an actress and it was an actress and made it her business. To find out about this guy's life. And he had lost his health insurance and he, and then she intervened and raised money for his healthcare and, and, and he felt seen and heard, wow, I can't, which one? It's an incredible story. And um, and I think that a lot of times people, and I think anonymity is a real, it can contributes to bad behavior online. So I think sort of as Jordan Peterson says, you know, man up as it were a woman up and have the strength of your convictions. This is what I think, this is what I'm going to say.

Speaker 3:          00:57:25       But is there a problem there? I mean, Jordan, I've done this many times where then depending on how that hierarchal structure is operated, if you are saying something that's an politically correct, well, I mean you have to have the strength or revise your opinions or stick to them or make good arguments but are listening. But you know, let's don't engage. Let's say you're a Trump supporter. You just don't want to lose your job because you think if you say that [inaudible] I'm against people losing their jobs for their opinions. Yeah. So, uh, so you know, so I think that, I think there's a thing where I think a little bit of bravery, a little bit of civil discourse, a little bit of commitment to granting charity to our opponents. Um, a little bit of like for example, when I would have an argument with people who are opposed to vaccination, I think there is no merit to their ideas.

Speaker 3:          00:58:09       I understand their fierce. I understand that there have been either some actual cases of vaccine induced neurological conditions, one in a hundred thousand one and 500,000 cases, which is awful. And I understand that there are a lot of coincidences where people think that there's a relationship, but no, it's just that you have, you know, you have lot of vaccines are being administered, there are a lot of illnesses occurring. There's going to be an overlap in those two sets. But, and I also know the data on how that's very been, how vaccination is like a 20 20th and 25th, actually more like even a 19th century triumph. I mean, you know, we've, we've mastered these diseases. We humans, it's astonishing what we've done through our capacity to teach and learn and engage in science and so forth. But I would engage that person. I would try it, I would talk to them.

Speaker 3:          00:58:51       I would say, you know, let me talk to you about your beliefs. And because I think that that's the only way to get them to revise their beliefs. I think telling them they're fools doesn't, doesn't help. Yeah. Um, so a true liberal, I am a liberal. Yes I am buying. I am a liberal. Yeah. But do you think one side is a little, it's a little bit easier to do that right now. And does that flip over time? So for example, right now I find it much easier to go to consider. I get invited by conservative cliffs. Libertarians is no problem. But let's say conservatives that I have disagreements on, on abortion, gay marriage, and legalizing marijuana.

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       And the death penalty. And we could do the list cause I, oh wait, hold on. So I'm for legalization of marijuana. Yes. What is your position on death penalty? I'm against the death. Let me too. What were the other gay marriage? Yes. Yeah. Uh, legalizing weed. Um, so, but yes, sorry, I hate to tell you, I'm guessing that you only would get invited by conservative groups to basically to college as well. I don't know. Um, I don't know. I don't get that many. I mean usually my invitations are scientific. Like I am a scientist. Like I give talks about my science. So I have not historically been very politically but, right. So, but what I'm getting, I really is that at the moment it seems very obvious to me. Like I don't know that I could be clearer or anything on the center right there is, there is a, an ability and actually a desire to discuss ideas. I would agree to disagree and that just isn't happening right now. And I would suspect her argue, and I'm sure you can give me examples where that, I mean during the McCarthyism for example, I think, you know, it was very difficult to be a communist for sure and even, you know, left where they were so they weren't inviting communist talk to them. That's right.

Speaker 3:          01:00:26       So I think, um, I honestly don't know the answer to that question. I think there are subgroups on campus which are still committed to debate the get the political unions. These guys love to argue these young people. Um, I think there are other vocal minorities on campus that don't want to hear opinions that they don't agree with and they think that even the hearing of it, there's this, there's this very sloppy conflation of speech with violence, which I think is ridiculous, um, which seems to really be ramping up. Yes, I would agree with that. And you also see it, for instance, in Pakistan, they will, they will kill apostates that's answering speech with violence. If you actually think that someone believing in a different God and expressing that belief is violence, then then the country justifies killing that person. Or in Brunei recently, they had the same kind of um, situation.

Speaker 3:          01:01:12       I think this, this is, I strongly reject that belief. There's, there's uh, we have different words and there's a totally different meeting between speech and violence. So, uh, so I don't know how we got onto that topic, but uh, oh, so, so I think that, I think there are groups of people on campus who do conflate speech and violence. I think that's a problem. Um, but there are also many groups that are very, very vigorous political debates. I think one thing that is different, so I'm in my fifties when I was in college in my, in the eighties, we would stay up late and argue about politics with our friends, with our friend's notice. I said my friends, I would argue with my friends about politics and a, and they were my friends. I don't think that happens very much anymore. It does in the political unions and the debates societies. But in the broader college, I think if you have a different opinion about abortion, for example, um, you really can't express that. But

Speaker 2:          01:02:05       the weird thing is that it is happening with conservatives. Well cause they, because they do believe, I mean I go to these things and I have these debates, we have kids all over, all of their better debaters cause they have more experience. Yes. Arguing with people they disagree with. Yes. They get a better education in some ways because they have to constantly defend their opinions. It's a weird thing to say then. Yes, yes, yes. I think, well, I mean if you, this is the thing why in the martial arts for example,

Speaker 3:          01:02:29       why don't we bow to our opponent? You'll learn more from the people you disagree with and from the people you agree with. Right. In Jay's mill's famous saying, you know, he who knows only his side of the case knows little of it. Um, so, you know, I think, I think that's where your ideas get better when they are tested. Um, when you argue with someone you disagree with, um, and, and, and I think, and I think cultivating those kinds of conversations, disciplining yourself to be able to have arguments with people you disagree with, uh, improves your ideas. And actually you should be grateful to that person. There's more interesting person in some ways. Um, now you don't have to be best friends with that person necessarily, although you can be. Um, but I think it makes you smarter

Speaker 2:          01:03:18       that my friend is a nice closing statement and you've lived through it. I mean, that's the point. You lived through the forces that so many of us see now as, as such dangerous forces in society and now they live through it. You flourished and you've got another book out and all of those things. So, well, I would say, I mean, yeah, well I would close with saying, you know, I really believe that, um, that the arc of our evolution as long,

Speaker 3:          01:03:41       but it bends towards goodness.

Speaker 2:          01:03:43       Sounds good to me. You guys can follow nick on Twitter at Naa Christakis and we'll have a link to his book. Write down below.
