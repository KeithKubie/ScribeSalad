[WIND RUSHING]

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.215 --> 00:00:11.350
MICHAEL STEINMETZ: So,
our ultimate contribution,

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.800
our ultimate
product, is not just

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.710
going to be an app-- though
we're good at that, Diego.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.620
And it's not going to be about
delivering the absolute best

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.640
weed in the world,
which we have.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.170
We're here to stand for the
clean cannabis movement.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.782
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:26.782 --> 00:00:28.240
LAURA LING: Meet
Michael Steinmetz,

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.210
a pot entrepreneur who's trying
to change the face of weed.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.050
Michael, what did you do before
you got into the marijuana

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.550
industry?

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.730
MICHAEL STEINMETZ:
So originally, I'm

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.001
an engineer by background.

00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:40.500
I started off going to school
at Carnegie Mellon University,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.740
and then I worked at
NASA for some time.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.729
After that, I moved
into investment banking.

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:46.520
Really quickly realized
I didn't love that.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.560
LAURA LING: What attracted
you to this industry?

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.101
MICHAEL STEINMETZ:
I've always wanted

00:00:50.101 --> 00:00:52.820
to see it go mainstream
in a different light

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.880
than putting a stigma
and stereotype around it.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.120
LAURA LING: Michael is the
co-founder of a marijuana

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.855
delivery service, flowkana.com

00:00:58.855 --> 00:01:00.230
MICHAEL STEINMETZ:
What we really

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.890
like is being called
the Whole Foods of weed,

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.660
because we want me to be kind of
that higher echelon of quality.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.350
We're about 100% transparency.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.229
We connect patients directly
with value-based farmers

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:10.937
up in the Emerald
Triangle, a place known

00:01:10.937 --> 00:01:13.684
in Northern California to
have pretty much the best

00:01:13.684 --> 00:01:14.600
cannabis in the world.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.850
And we believe in getting
really, really good medicine

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:17.600
to patients.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.060
So you just go to flowkana.com
You open up the app.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.689
You can browse our sample packs.

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.980
So we have the Active Pack,
you have the Inspired Pack,

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.180
Chill Pack, Zen Master Pack.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.380
And then when you click
on one, it'll open up,

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.020
and it'll tell you a brief
description of the plant,

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.603
and it will also
show you who grew it.

00:01:31.603 --> 00:01:34.530
And then you can very
easily add it to your cart.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.870
LAURA LING: After an order
is placed and processed,

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.020
Mason jars of marijuana are
sent out by bike messenger

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.312
to be delivered door-to-door
as fast as pizza.

00:01:42.312 --> 00:01:44.020
MICHAEL STEINMETZ:
When you work with us,

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.740
we're going to do the
best possible thing we

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.136
can to give you
the absolute best

00:01:47.136 --> 00:01:49.010
medicine, the absolute
best customer service.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.470
And we want everybody
to be totally

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.845
wowed from the minute they
use our app to the minute they

00:01:52.845 --> 00:01:55.424
get our package
delivered to their home.

00:01:55.424 --> 00:01:58.350
LAURA LING: From pot delivery
services, to marijuana yoga

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.410
sessions, to high-end
dinners featuring

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.870
different strains of
weed rather than wine,

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.011
a new cannabis
culture is emerging.

00:02:05.011 --> 00:02:06.510
MICHAEL STEINMETZ:
And I think we're

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.259
going to start seeing
cannabis start being

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.680
more deeply integrated
into social environments

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.810
which you participate in.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.150
When you go to have
dinner with your friends,

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.615
you have a little glass of wine.

00:02:14.615 --> 00:02:16.990
Why wouldn't it be the case
that you could order a joint?

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.364
LAURA LING: And
pot entrepreneurs

00:02:18.364 --> 00:02:20.650
like Michael are all
trying to get into a game

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.910
that they believe will explode
once recreational marijuana

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.720
becomes legal in California.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.390
TROY DAYTON: In
this industry, this

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.360
is a market that already
exists, and it's just

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.216
bad laws that were in the way.

00:02:32.216 --> 00:02:34.170
LAURA LING: Troy
Dayton is the CEO

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.490
of The ArcView Group, an
investment and research

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.020
firm devoted to the
cannabis industry.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.370
TROY DAYTON: Once we were
on the cover of Fortune,

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.060
that's when a lot of the
calls started coming.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.680
And over the last
two years or so,

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.810
we've seen about $41
million go to 54 companies.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.540
LAURA LING: While pot use
is still illegal federally,

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.580
23 states and the
District of Columbia

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.410
have at least some form of
legal medical marijuana.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.570
Four states and DC
have legalized it

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.230
for recreational use.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.050
But legalization of recreational
pot use in California

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.925
could be a watershed.

00:03:05.925 --> 00:03:08.840
GAVIN NEWSOM: California is
all of these other states that

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.590
have either moved
forward legalization

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.430
or are contemplating
legalization combined.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.950
We're the largest producer
of marijuana in the nation.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.440
But the impact will be felt
all across this country,

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.940
as is typical of a
state as large as ours

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:22.977
in scope and scale.

00:03:22.977 --> 00:03:25.185
LAURA LING: How big do you
see this industry getting?

00:03:25.185 --> 00:03:30.010
TROY DAYTON: Well, we predict
that if cannabis was regulated

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.570
like alcohol in all 50
states across the country,

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.940
that we'd be looking at
about a $36 billion market.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.630
That doesn't include all
the ancillary businesses

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.420
that surround it, which
could probably eclipse that.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.090
In 2014, it really
shifted out of just

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.190
being an interesting
cocktail conversation

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.700
and into being a unique American
dream kind of opportunity

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.215
for a lot of people.

00:03:54.215 --> 00:03:57.130
LAURA LING: Up next, fine
dining with a side of weed.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.830
SUBJECT: Now we're
doing four courses,

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.520
starting off with a
medicated amuse-bouche

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.990
before the four courses.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.340
And in between each
course, we will be doing

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.292
intermezzo cannabis joints.

00:04:07.292 --> 00:04:08.930
