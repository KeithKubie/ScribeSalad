00:00:06.793 --> 00:00:08.921
Throughout the history of mankind,

00:00:08.921 --> 00:00:12.384
three little words have sent poets
to the blank page,

00:00:12.384 --> 00:00:14.762
philosophers to the Agora,

00:00:14.762 --> 00:00:17.102
and seekers to the oracles:

00:00:17.102 --> 00:00:19.099
"Who am I?"

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.723
From the ancient Greek aphorism
inscribed on the Temple of Apollo,

00:00:22.723 --> 00:00:24.459
"Know thyself,"

00:00:24.459 --> 00:00:27.192
to The Who's rock anthem, "Who Are You?"

00:00:27.192 --> 00:00:30.312
philosophers, psychologists, academics,

00:00:30.312 --> 00:00:34.514
scientists, artists,
theologians and politicians

00:00:34.514 --> 00:00:38.433
have all tackled the subject of identity.

00:00:38.433 --> 00:00:42.990
Their hypotheses are widely varied
and lack significant consensus.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.600
These are smart, creative people,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.540
so what's so hard about coming up
with the right answer?

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.559
One challenge certainly lies

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.301
with the complex concept 
of the persistence of identity.

00:00:56.301 --> 00:00:58.490
Which you is who?

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.095
The person you are today?

00:01:00.095 --> 00:01:01.383
Five years ago?

00:01:01.383 --> 00:01:03.402
Who you'll be in 50 years?

00:01:03.402 --> 00:01:05.382
And when is "am"?

00:01:05.382 --> 00:01:06.875
This week?

00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:08.005
Today?

00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:09.143
This hour?

00:01:09.143 --> 00:01:10.531
This second?

00:01:10.531 --> 00:01:13.390
And which aspect of you is "I"?

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.094
Are you your physical body?

00:01:15.094 --> 00:01:16.695
Your thoughts and feelings?

00:01:16.695 --> 00:01:18.368
Your actions?

00:01:18.368 --> 00:01:22.153
These murky waters of abstract logic
are tricky to navigate,

00:01:22.153 --> 00:01:25.752
and so it's probably fitting
that to demonstrate the complexity,

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:31.373
the Greek historian Plutarch
used the story of a ship.

00:01:31.373 --> 00:01:34.207
How are you "I"?

00:01:34.207 --> 00:01:38.669
As the tale goes, Theseus, the mythical
founder King of Athens,

00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:43.161
single-handedly slayed 
the evil Minotaur at Crete,

00:01:43.161 --> 00:01:45.757
then returned home on a ship.

00:01:45.757 --> 00:01:47.656
To honor this heroic feat,

00:01:47.656 --> 00:01:54.394
for 1000 years Athenians painstakingly
maintained his ship in the harbor,

00:01:54.394 --> 00:01:58.285
and annually reenacted his voyage.

00:01:58.285 --> 00:02:01.319
Whenever a part of the ship
was worn or damaged,

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.592
it was replaced with an identical piece
of the same material

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:09.439
until, at some point, 
no original parts remained.

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:11.372
Plutarch noted the Ship of Theseus

00:02:11.372 --> 00:02:14.549
was an example 
of the philosophical paradox

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:17.667
revolving around 
the persistence of identity.

00:02:17.667 --> 00:02:20.305
How can every single part 
of something be replaced,

00:02:20.305 --> 00:02:24.022
yet it still remains the same thing?

00:02:24.022 --> 00:02:26.053
Let's imagine there are two ships:

00:02:26.053 --> 00:02:29.299
the ship that Theseus 
docked in Athens, Ship A,

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:35.101
and the ship sailed by the Athenians
1000 years later, Ship B.

00:02:35.101 --> 00:02:40.517
Very simply, our question is this:
does A equal B?

00:02:40.517 --> 00:02:45.408
Some would say that for 1000 years
there has been only one Ship of Theseus,

00:02:45.408 --> 00:02:48.493
and because the changes made to it
happened gradually,

00:02:48.493 --> 00:02:53.667
it never at any point in time
stopped being the legendary ship.

00:02:53.667 --> 00:02:56.267
Though they have absolutely 
no parts in common,

00:02:56.267 --> 00:03:01.200
the two ships are numerically identical,
meaning one and the same,

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.772
so A equals B.

00:03:03.772 --> 00:03:08.981
However, others could argue
that Theseus never set foot on Ship B,

00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:12.698
and his presence on the ship
is an essential qualitative property

00:03:12.698 --> 00:03:14.762
of the Ship of Theseus.

00:03:14.762 --> 00:03:17.169
It cannot survive without him.

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:20.478
So, though the two ships 
are numerically identical,

00:03:20.478 --> 00:03:23.295
they are not qualitatively identical.

00:03:23.295 --> 00:03:26.993
Thus, A does not equal B.

00:03:26.993 --> 00:03:29.523
But what happens 
when we consider this twist?

00:03:29.523 --> 00:03:33.605
What if, as each piece 
of the original ship was cast off,

00:03:33.605 --> 00:03:38.744
somebody collected them all,
and rebuilt the entire original ship?

00:03:38.744 --> 00:03:43.783
When it was finished, undeniably
two physical ships would exist:

00:03:43.783 --> 00:03:45.798
the one that's docked in Athens,

00:03:45.798 --> 00:03:48.242
and the one in some guy's backyard.

00:03:48.242 --> 00:03:51.875
Each could lay claim to the title,
"The Ship of Theseus,"

00:03:51.875 --> 00:03:55.085
but only would could actually
be the real thing.

00:03:55.085 --> 00:03:56.374
So which one is it,

00:03:56.374 --> 00:03:59.583
and more importantly, 
what does this have to do with you?

00:03:59.583 --> 00:04:01.727
Like the Ship of Theseus,

00:04:01.727 --> 00:04:05.420
you are a collection of constantly
changing parts:

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.628
your physical body, mind, emotions,
circumstances, and even your quirks,

00:04:11.628 --> 00:04:16.629
always changing, but still in an amazing
and sometimes illogical way,

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:19.074
you stay the same, too.

00:04:19.074 --> 00:04:24.431
This is one of the reasons that 
the question, "Who am I?" is so complex.

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:25.875
And in order to answer it,

00:04:25.875 --> 00:04:28.445
like so many great minds before you,

00:04:28.445 --> 00:04:33.897
you must be willing to dive into the
bottomless ocean of philosophical paradox.

00:04:33.897 --> 00:04:35.441
Or maybe you could just answer,

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:40.809
"I am a legendary hero sailing 
a powerful ship on an epic journey."

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:42.434
That could work, too.
