00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:02.841
- [voiceover] Intimacy, love, and marriage

00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:07.100
are three different, if
interrelated subjects.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.170
The way it's phrased right
over here, the writer is saying

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.708
these are three different subjects,

00:00:12.708 --> 00:00:14.513
but they're giving a
little bone to the idea.

00:00:14.513 --> 00:00:17.504
I admit that they are interrelated.

00:00:17.504 --> 00:00:19.500
Even though they are
definitely interrelated,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.041
they are different subjects.

00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:22.508
That's how it reads there.

00:00:22.508 --> 00:00:23.975
It's not badly written.

00:00:23.975 --> 00:00:26.112
Intimacy, love, and marriage
are three different,

00:00:26.112 --> 00:00:28.310
if interrelated, subjects.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.635
It feels a little bit,
a little bit convoluted.

00:00:31.635 --> 00:00:34.177
I might want to say that
three different subjects,

00:00:34.177 --> 00:00:38.046
although they are definitely
interrelated as well

00:00:38.046 --> 00:00:40.247
or something like that.

00:00:40.247 --> 00:00:41.704
Let's just look at the other options.

00:00:41.704 --> 00:00:43.304
This is as it's written.

00:00:43.304 --> 00:00:44.446
Not horrible, but let's think

00:00:44.446 --> 00:00:46.244
of a better way to phrase that.

00:00:46.244 --> 00:00:50.572
Intimacy, love, and marriage
are three interrelated subjects

00:00:50.572 --> 00:00:53.378
being however different.

00:00:53.378 --> 00:00:55.313
That's just convoluted.

00:00:55.313 --> 00:00:58.633
The real point of it is
that they're trying to say

00:00:58.633 --> 00:01:00.502
that they're different subjects,

00:01:00.502 --> 00:01:04.511
although I'm willing
to admit that they are,

00:01:04.511 --> 00:01:06.700
they're not completely unrelated.

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:09.636
This one right over here, this one

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:12.039
is emphasizing that they're
interrelated subjects

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:14.241
and giving a little bit bone
to them being different.

00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:16.436
This is a different meaning
and it's very convoluted

00:01:16.436 --> 00:01:19.170
being however different.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.911
It's unnecessarily they put
all these commas in there

00:01:22.112 --> 00:01:24.508
and it's kind of hard
to read and really long.

00:01:24.508 --> 00:01:25.709
Let's look at choice C.

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:29.422
Intimacy, love, and marriage
are three different subjects,

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:32.234
whereas they are interrelated.

00:01:32.234 --> 00:01:34.310
Once again, okay.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.712
They're making the point that they're

00:01:35.712 --> 00:01:37.509
three different subjects.

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.176
Whereas they are interrelated.

00:01:40.176 --> 00:01:41.640
I don't know.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.640
Whereas seems kind of
formal, kind of legally.

00:01:47.838 --> 00:01:49.773
Whereas they are interrelated.

00:01:49.773 --> 00:01:53.636
That also, because of
that convoluted phrasing

00:01:53.636 --> 00:01:55.770
and using of whereas seems
a little bit unnecessary.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.506
This definitely not as
good as the first choice.

00:01:57.506 --> 00:01:59.379
Intimacy, love, and marriage
are three different,

00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:01.713
if interrelated, subjects.

00:02:01.713 --> 00:02:03.243
Intimacy, love, and marriage

00:02:03.243 --> 00:02:05.776
are three different
subjects when interrelated.

00:02:05.776 --> 00:02:07.302
That's just definitely wrong.

00:02:07.302 --> 00:02:09.579
They're not only different
when they are interrelated.

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:12.836
That's not, that the
completely incorrect meaning.

00:02:12.836 --> 00:02:16.767
Intimacy, love, and
marriage are three subjects

00:02:16.767 --> 00:02:21.375
that are different although
being interrelated,

00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:23.646
although being interrelated.

00:02:23.646 --> 00:02:25.244
It starts off okay.

00:02:25.244 --> 00:02:27.047
Intimacy, love, and marriage

00:02:27.047 --> 00:02:30.246
are three subjects that are different.

00:02:30.246 --> 00:02:35.246
If this was a period
and then say and or but

00:02:36.176 --> 00:02:38.646
or even it was a comma,
but they are also related,

00:02:38.646 --> 00:02:40.510
then something like that
might have been okay,

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.181
but although being related.

00:02:44.181 --> 00:02:46.572
This is once again, this is kind of

00:02:46.572 --> 00:02:49.368
a weird phrase that's
thrown on the end of it.

00:02:49.368 --> 00:02:52.046
I'll cross that one out.

00:02:52.046 --> 00:02:55.248
Really the best one is it as it's written.

00:02:55.248 --> 00:02:57.968
They're three different,
if interrelated subjects.

00:02:57.968 --> 00:02:59.246
It's kind of the cleanest.

00:02:59.246 --> 00:03:00.248
It's the shortest.

00:03:00.248 --> 00:03:01.570
It's getting to the point.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:02.974
They're different subjects,

00:03:02.974 --> 00:03:04.900
although you're giving a
little bone to the idea,

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.303
throwing a little bone into the idea.

00:03:06.303 --> 00:03:08.045
They are interrelated, but they are

00:03:08.045 --> 00:03:09.778
three different subjects.

00:03:09.778 --> 00:03:12.214
I'll definitely go with choice A.
