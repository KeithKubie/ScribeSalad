00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.970
You know that nightmare in all the TV shows,
where you’re standing in front of a podium,

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.480
you look down, and you’re not wearing any
clothing?

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.090
That split second of terror when the audience
is laughing at you and you feel unprepared,

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.550
helpless, alone, and so cold, is excruciating.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.640
We’re here to help you avoid that feeling
in real life, whether you’re on a stage

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.800
or in a one-on-one meeting with your boss.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.450
So take a deep breath, and get ready to improve
your public speaking skills to make sure your

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.450
ideas stick.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.899
I’m Evelyn from the Internets.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.580
And this is Crash Course Business: Soft Skills.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:45.660
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.120
We’ve all survived book reports and group
projects in school, but public speaking isn’t

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.700
always standing in front of a slide deck.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.780
Depending on your job, you may need to sell
an idea with a pitch or give a talk to a crowd

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.640
But you’ll also need to contribute to meetings.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.850
Or just chat with your coworkers.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.110
And if you’re in your mid-twenties, you
might be giving a speech at a wedding soon.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.740
Every time I go on Facebook, I feel more
single.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.190
No matter how confident you think you are
speaking in public, there are ways to improve

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.090
and gain the trust of your audience.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.770
A big part of this is how you speak.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.790
Like, think about some of the most well-known
speeches of all time.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.710
Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream”
would have been way less effective if he had

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.290
stared straight down at the podium.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.340
If you’re giving a presentation, this means
you should avoid reading from the slides or

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.380
straight off a page of notes.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.810
This keeps your tone casual and makes sure
that you avoid sounding like a robot.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.010
If you have slides, they should be visual-heavy.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.750
If your audience is reading a ton of information,
you could have sent a memo instead.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.550
Let’s say you were trying to convince someone
that Lemonade was one of the most visually

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.340
compelling albums of all time and propelled
Beyoncé to new heights as an artist.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.350
[Like anyone would really need convincing.]

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.850
You could tell people that her song “Formation”
won a Grammy for Best Music Video.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.350
But it would be better to show a clip of Queen
Bey in all her glory.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.940
And since you’re confident in what you’re
saying and not reading off your notes, put

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.610
those eyes to good use!

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.600
Make eye contact with your audience.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.040
Just like on a first date, it shows you care.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.430
And it keeps you from fixating on that fake
plant that’s in the back of every office

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.430
meeting room.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.540
If you’re uncomfortable making direct eye
contact, looking at people’s foreheads can

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.860
be a good way to fudge it.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.740
Remember how we said content matters more
than formatting in written communication?

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:36.379
Well, when you’re speaking, what you say
is just as important as how you say it.

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:38.939
So, always remember to aim for SUCCES.

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:39.939
Two Cs.

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:40.939
Two Ss.

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:45.480
It’s a 6-step framework that helps you deliver
your points clearly and concisely.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.180
First up, a Simple ‘S.’

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.060
Or, the K.I.S.S. method.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.060
Keep it simple, silly.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.239
Identify the one thing you want your audience
to come away with, and stick to that core

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.290
message.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.329
You might even craft a memorable sound byte
that summarizes your main points.

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.370
For example, if you were trying to convince
someone to watch your favorite TV show, you

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.590
might say that “Stranger Things is like
Stand by Me, but with aliens.” or “Psych

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.890
is like The Mentalist, but with shenanigans!”

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.500
Next, use the Unexpected.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.510
You know those YouTube videos where some
screaming ghoul pops out of nowhere?

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.180
Yeah, I’m not gonna do that.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.239
And neither should you.

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.400
But do something memorable!

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.209
Maybe crack a joke to make a mundane topic
fun, like that one Southwest Airlines flight

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.180
safety presentation.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.200
Or highlight a knowledge gap.

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.709
Make the audience feel like they need to pay
attention by creating a scenario where they

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.540
have to know the answer.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.220
How will this product help me save 15 minutes
during my morning routine?

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.939
Why is 42 the meaning of life?

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:43.980
But be careful to avoid gimmicks or misleading
people.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.529
We’ve all been frustrated by clickbait articles
that aren’t what they promised.

00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:50.279
Your audience will feel the same way.

00:03:50.279 --> 00:03:53.010
Third, anchor your work with something Concrete

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.029
Founders of the SUCCES framework use an analogy
called the Velcro Theory of Memory.

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:01.980
The more hooks you have, the more an idea
is going to stick in your brain.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.680
You want to explain your main point using
examples your audience already knows or can

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.590
understand, without confusing language.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.099
For example, JFK didn’t say he wanted to
‘increase scientific funding for exploration

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.419
of natural satellites in order to increase
the reach of homosapiens.’

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:20.260
He said he wanted to put a man on the Moon.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.930
And if you’re explaining tricky business
concepts, like emotional influence, you might

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.220
use pop culture references, like Harry Potter,
to make analogies your audience will remember.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.889
Fourth, to show you did your homework, keep
it Credible.

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:38.120
Facts, figures, and experts will help people
understand what you’re trying to say.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.009
Your audience may want to hear from people
with external credibility, like Ivy League

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:45.250
professors or high-achieving professionals,
like CEOs.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.770
You also need to think about internal credibility,
or the appeal of your argument.

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.250
You’ll have low internal credibility if
your message conflicts with the way your audience

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.490
sees the world.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.750
So, if you’re a broke college student surviving
on ramen but trying to convince your friends

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.760
to eat healthy, you could cite a nutritionist
to explain why the peppers on that Domino’s

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.150
pizza do not count as vegetables.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.250
Fifth, make it Emotional.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.400
Make people care.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.389
There’s a reason that those commercials
with Sarah McLachlan are so effective.

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:21.110
To make your message memorable, use something
that pulls on the heartstrings and makes people

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.800
think about their own identities.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.620
Are you a kind person who wants to help a
dog in need?

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.919
Or, deep down, do you love cats enough to
adopt another?

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:36.680
Finally, make your speech legen -- wait for
it -- dary by telling a great Story.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.450
Stories act like motivators.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:43.630
Think about how inspired you might feel after
watching a movie about a ragtag team of underdogs

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:44.669
trying to make the playoffs.

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:49.830
And a well-crafted story can also show people
how to act by providing a template or example.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.810
So, for instance, if you were soliciting funding
for the Li’l Sebastian scholarship, you

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:00.229
could tell the story of a Pawnee student who
overcame all odds thanks to the generous donations

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:01.909
of community benefactors.

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:07.160
Now, SUCCES relies heavily on understanding
who your audience is, so you can adjust what

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.680
you’re saying to meet their needs.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.520
Just like with writing, it’s helpful to
conduct an audience analysis before you speak.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.569
Understanding who they are will help you build
trust and emotional influence.

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:20.520
And it’s also important that you listen
to what your audience has to say.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.500
Active listening can help you seem more competent
in any conversation.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.360
Focus on the person or people you’re talking
to, whether they’re making a statement or

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.990
asking a question.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.750
Try to really understand them before mentally
preparing your response.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.909
Wait for them to finish their thought, no
matter how strongly you feel about a thing.

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:42.310
Interruptions can also be a subtle form of
discrimination, so it’s best to make sure

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.669
you’re not accidentally #mansplaining or
anything.

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:49.341
And don’t be afraid of short pauses or silence
-- it can give you time to think.

00:06:49.341 --> 00:06:53.450
To make sure you’ve understood someone,
you can try circle speak and paraphrase them

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:54.450
to double-check.

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:59.090
So, if your friend was debating with you about
the best Shondaland show, you might say, “So,

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.850
you’re saying you can’t get enough of
the non-stop plot twists in How to Get Away

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:03.850
with Murder?””

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.720
And they’ll either say, “exactly!”

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.759
Or correct you, and say, “No, you missed
my point.

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:12.780
I watched that show religiously until it was
way too much drama.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.689
My Twitter fingers couldn’t keep up!”

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:19.270
So, now that we’ve covered basically everything
there is to know about speaking publicly,

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:20.360
what would it look like?

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.160
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.300
Let’s say you were a representative from
Harvard Law School.

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:29.849
And you were giving a presentation to a room
of third-year undergraduate women who are

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:32.669
starting to think about what’s next after
graduation.

00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:38.210
Your job is to use your stellar speaking skills
to persuade them to consider careers in law.

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:42.290
To be effective, you don’t have to use all
6 parts of SUCCES.

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:45.360
But using 3 or 4 will still help your words
resonate.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.379
Since you’re working with a diverse group
of undergrads who may know very little about

00:07:49.379 --> 00:07:55.159
law, you would start with your thesis sentence:
law is a fulfilling career and an incredible

00:07:55.159 --> 00:07:56.409
way to change people’s lives.

00:07:56.409 --> 00:08:01.560
To show that there’s space in the job market,
you could share some salary and job-growth

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.560
projections.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.789
To make your points more relatable, you could
talk about issues affecting women’s rights.

00:08:06.789 --> 00:08:12.270
You could reference cases that have personally
impacted women’s lives, like U.S. v. Virginia,

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:16.370
which eliminated VMI’s male-only admissions
policy.

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:20.849
Then, you could share the inspirational story
of Sonya Sotomayor, who grew up in a housing

00:08:20.849 --> 00:08:23.960
project in the Bronx and is now a supreme
court justice.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.419
Finally, you’d open it up for questions,
or even debate.

00:08:27.419 --> 00:08:32.409
Because you did an audience analysis, you’re
ready for questions about the LSAT, the amount

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:37.380
of school required to become a lawyer, the
cost of education, or even work-life balance.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:42.099
And you’ve practiced active listening, which
will help you answer any tough questions thrown

00:08:42.099 --> 00:08:43.099
your way.

00:08:43.099 --> 00:08:46.680
You’ll be calm and concise, even if you’re
mentally scrambling for an answer.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.300
But you know your stuff!

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:53.510
So you can confidently tell them that a secondary
degree is long but rewarding, there’s financial

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:57.640
aid, and women can successfully balance whatever
they want.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.680
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.490
All these tips are a lot to digest, and the
best way to make sure you’re prepared for

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:03.820
public speaking is practice.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:08.389
Practice will help you become more comfortable
in low-stakes situations before that important

00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:09.950
meeting or thesis defense.

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:12.620
You can even check yourself before you wreck
yourself.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.790
And by that, I mean record yourself practicing.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.070
Now, I get it.

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:19.800
Unless you’re a YouTuber or a screen actor
or something, you probably don’t like seeing

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.149
yourself on camera.

00:09:21.149 --> 00:09:23.829
And to be honest, it’s still weird for
me.

00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:27.720
But it can help you catch things you may be
doing wrong and help you practice what you’re

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.720
already doing right.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.540
With a recording it’s really easy to watch
how you’re speaking.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:37.310
Maybe you didn’t realize that you’re pacing
back and forth a lot, staying glued to one

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:41.200
spot, or gesticulating so much that it’s
almost interpretive dance.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.800
You can also watch for rambling.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.250
I get it.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.510
Nerves are real.

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:49.780
But shaking them off and keeping an even pace
will make sure people understand you.

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:54.540
And since what you say is as important as
how you say it, practicing frequently or with

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:58.600
different people will help you make sure that
none of your main points are confusing.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.240
With that, we’re done talking about talking.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:05.829
So, if nothing else, remember these key takeaways:

00:10:05.829 --> 00:10:11.510
Practice will help you foster good habits,
from how you speak to how you stand.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:16.480
Aim for SUCCES to make your speech more impactful.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:21.910
Use active listening to understand your audience’s
questions and ideas, so you can answer competently.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:23.970
That wraps up our fundamentals.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:27.610
Next time, we’ll talk about how to apply
your new business knowledge to navigate the

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:28.900
job search.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:32.570
If you’re fresh out of college and on the
hunt for that dream job or just looking for

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.360
something new, you’re in luck!

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.779
Crash Course Business is sponsored by Google, and it’s made with the help of all these

00:10:37.779 --> 00:10:41.350
nice people and Thought Cafe is our amazing
animation team.

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:43.660
