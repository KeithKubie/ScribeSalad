00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.120
Ziploc bags fantastic product but
unfortunately they're not

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.870
one-size-fits-all, especially if you have
little gizmos gadgets or small trinket

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.130
that you're trying to package up so much
bag for so little items so for this

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.429
video I'm going to show you how you can
modify your Ziploc bags to be any size

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:14.929
or shape you want. not sponsored by
Ziploc but I wish it was.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.720
now one quart freezer bags like these
are made of polyethylene which is a

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.500
lightweight plastic polymer and it can
be melted which means if we took

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.220
something long thin and made of metal
like these old metal coat hangers we

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.910
should see theoretically be able to heat
them up and cut our bags in half now if

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.370
you're wondering where you can even get
these metal coat hangers anymore just

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.879
try stopping by your local dry cleaners
they'll probably give them to you for free if

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.300
not four for a buck now we're also going
to need some kind of a cloth or a towel

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.510
and you're going to want one that is not
super meaningful to you because it's

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.000
going to get scorched it's going to get
burned and it's probably gonna get

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.390
covered in plastic as well I'm using one
of these shop rags and its purpose is

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.480
just to provide a little bit of cushion
now what we want to do with our rag is

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.180
set it down on the counter and fold it
up into thirds and this is just going to

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.850
build up the height a little bit so it
provides a little more cushion next we

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.120
want to take our ziplock bag and lay it
down onto the rag in the direction we

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.640
want to make the cut now this is the
part where things start heating up a

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.939
little bit so it's a good idea to have
some protective gloves maybe some safety

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.030
glasses if you're into that and for a
heat source we're going to be using

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.020
either a BBQ igniter or if you have one
a propane torch works great as well you

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.810
can also use the open flame from a gas
range as well if you've got one of those

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.049
in any case we just need some kind of a
hot open flame that we can concentrate

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.850
on the bottom of our wire

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.060
okay so our wire is heated up now we're
just going to drop it by the top line it

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.190
over our bag and press it straight down
we can hold that in place grab the

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.440
corner of our bag and just peel it right
up and as easy as that we now have a

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.480
customized ziploc bag check that out
look how clean the edges are as well

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.530
it's absolutely beautiful actually
worked out better than I thought and

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.200
because we're using metal as it heats-up
it will have a tendency sometimes to

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.130
bend upward so it's not a bad idea just
to bend it down and heat up first

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.520
because then when you compress it will
press down into the material rather than

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.450
having an awkward middle part that
doesn't get touch at all

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.208
when it's smoking

00:02:07.208 --> 00:02:10.290
you know it's ready

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:28.180
beautiful comes off just like chicken
strips alright so here we are guys we

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.480
just did four cuts we turn one ziplock
bag into five different strips and

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.330
here's the coolest thing about them
these are 1-inch strips you can see the

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.080
edges are still very very clean and a
cool thing is there's still watertight

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.930
as well which means you can still fill these things up with juice and put them in the

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:50.850
freezer and make your own frizzy pop how
cool is that

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.319
not only can you use this trick to make
custom frizzy pops which is awesome but

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.860
you could use it to make travel-sized
toiletries as well figure out this throw

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.129
a little shampoo a little bit of lotion
maybe some mouthwash in a bag you can

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.250
seal it off completely so there's not
even any Ziploc at all it's just

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:47.580
completely sealed and watertight

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.209
now this trick doesn't work just for
making popsicles it works really well

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.269
for sorting and organizing for example
you can make little pouches to help

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.930
organize your sets of screws or to make
a little trial packets of samples you

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.750
want to send to people in the mail we
also found that if you heat up the

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.540
bottom of the hanger and press it into
the plastics but pull it away before it

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.930
has a chance to melt through it weld the
two sides of the bag together and

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.190
creates little compartments in the same
bag now let's stop and take just a

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.370
second to talk about what happened first
of all we discovered today that sandwich

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.850
bags are made of polyethylene the heat
sensitive plastic and by heating up

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.880
something like a metal coat hanger we
could almost use it as a heat knife to

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.510
cut a ziplock bag into custom shapes and
sizes we found that by cutting up one

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.720
bag into different strips we can fill
each of those strips up with juice and

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.139
freeze them to make improvised frizzy
pops we found that by heat treating the

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.039
top once again we could permanently seal
all the liquid inside next we tried

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:39.830
cutting out a couple of small pouches
for organizing small trinkets and

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.310
gadgets and we filled up other small
bags that can be used for storage or

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.880
samples and by pressing a hot hanger to
the bag but pulling away before it

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.760
melted through we found that we could
create different compartments in one

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.750
single bag so there you have it guys the
shapes sizes and functions you can pull

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.680
from a sandwich bag are now is unlimited
as your imagination thanks for joining

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.139
for this experiment today I'll be
looking for you the next one talk to you

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:06.320
then it just peels right off, oops that slipped
looks like my coat hanger was a

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:22.130
little bit bent the wrong way
