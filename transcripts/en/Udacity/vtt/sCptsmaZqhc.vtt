00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.150
Patterns in GoF have three other sections. One is sample code and this may be

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.782
the largest section, in which in a variety of languages including C++ and

00:00:09.782 --> 00:00:15.370
Smalltalk examples of coded uses of the pattern are included.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.940
As a side note, this particular book was written before Java become popular,

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.080
so there are no java examples. However there are other books which include java

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:32.250
solutions to similar pattern problems. Next section is known uses.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.741
As I said the authors of GoF were master designers and they had themselves had

00:00:36.741 --> 00:00:42.350
written [or were familiar with many important object-orientated systems. And

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.130
they indicate which system use which patterns in this section of, of

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.170
each pattern description. And finally, in the final section is related patterns.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.690
That is, how the given pattern relates to other patterns. Turns out that

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.590
elegantly written applications often use multiple co-operating patterns.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.590
This is sometimes called pattern density. This section of

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.240
the book lists other patterns which might be used together with this pattern.
