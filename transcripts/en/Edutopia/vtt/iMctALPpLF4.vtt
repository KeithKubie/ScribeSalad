00:00:04.086 --> 00:00:05.936
&gt;&gt;Alli: Anybody want to share
about how they're feeling today?

00:00:06.416 --> 00:00:07.326
Evan, how are you feeling?

00:00:07.606 --> 00:00:07.926
&gt;&gt;Evan: Hungry!

00:00:08.146 --> 00:00:08.886
&gt;&gt;Alli: You're feeling hungry.

00:00:08.886 --> 00:00:09.936
Big surprise, right?

00:00:10.516 --> 00:00:11.696
Owen, how are you feeling today?

00:00:12.086 --> 00:00:14.396
&gt;&gt;Owen: I'm feeling sleepy,
excited and fine.

00:00:14.536 --> 00:00:16.526
&gt;&gt;Alli: Wow, you're feeling
lots of emotions today.

00:00:16.526 --> 00:00:17.196
And finally, Chloe.

00:00:17.196 --> 00:00:20.176
&gt;&gt;Definitely noticed a change
in some of my shyer students.

00:00:20.446 --> 00:00:22.166
At the beginning of the
year they're really kind

00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:23.776
of clammed up, and they're nervous.

00:00:24.086 --> 00:00:26.596
But then as the year
progresses, they really open up

00:00:26.596 --> 00:00:29.596
and feel comfortable sharing
things about their family or things

00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:31.306
that might not be so
comfortable to share.

00:00:31.916 --> 00:00:33.976
And we become a support
system for each other.

00:00:39.076 --> 00:00:41.856
&gt;&gt;No matter what kind of morning they
had at home, they're going to come

00:00:41.896 --> 00:00:44.836
into my classroom, they're going to sit
in a circle and be with their friends.

00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:49.976
Just having that kind of clear structure
and expectation just puts them at ease.

00:00:51.046 --> 00:00:52.206
&gt;&gt;And I hope you have a great time.

00:00:52.236 --> 00:00:52.716
&gt;&gt;Thank you.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.936
&gt;&gt;Alli: In order to get any kid to
learn, they really have to feel safe.

00:00:57.006 --> 00:00:58.146
They have to feel respected.

00:00:58.816 --> 00:01:03.096
Without that, you're not going
to accomplish much academically.

00:01:04.076 --> 00:01:07.216
&gt;&gt;The greeting part of Morning
Meeting, it really changes day-to-day.

00:01:07.636 --> 00:01:09.626
Sometimes we'll do a Mingle Greeting.

00:01:09.626 --> 00:01:11.636
&gt;&gt;So today I'm going
to hand you one card.

00:01:12.056 --> 00:01:15.886
And your job is to try
to find your match.

00:01:16.206 --> 00:01:21.446
You want to find the person who has the
improper fraction to match your model,

00:01:21.496 --> 00:01:24.366
or if you have a model, you
want to try to find the person

00:01:24.746 --> 00:01:26.836
that has the matching improper fraction.

00:01:27.116 --> 00:01:28.666
You're going to make eye contact.

00:01:29.186 --> 00:01:31.636
Give them a little fist
bump to say "Good morning."

00:01:32.206 --> 00:01:36.356
And the question I want you to ask
today is just, "How are you feeling?"

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:37.286
Mingle.

00:01:40.706 --> 00:01:41.746
&gt;&gt;How are you feeling?

00:01:42.136 --> 00:01:42.456
&gt;&gt;Okay.

00:01:44.086 --> 00:01:44.696
&gt;&gt;How are you feeling?

00:01:44.696 --> 00:01:45.906
&gt;&gt;Okay, thanks.

00:01:47.046 --> 00:01:49.436
&gt;&gt;Alli: The more that you
can make the behavioral stuff

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:53.156
for your entire classroom, instead
of just focusing on individual kids,

00:01:53.156 --> 00:01:55.926
it really helps those
kids not feel so isolated,

00:01:56.036 --> 00:01:58.726
for things that they're
trying to work on.

00:01:58.726 --> 00:02:00.106
&gt;&gt;Today is?

00:02:00.106 --> 00:02:00.976
&gt;&gt;Students: Wednesday!

00:02:01.066 --> 00:02:01.966
&gt;&gt;Alli: And then I typically
move into Calendar.

00:02:01.966 --> 00:02:04.106
That's where I really get a chance
to go over their day with them,

00:02:04.106 --> 00:02:05.186
so they know what to expect.

00:02:05.626 --> 00:02:07.016
They don't have to be on their toes.

00:02:07.826 --> 00:02:10.086
And then we move into sharing.

00:02:10.556 --> 00:02:13.956
&gt;&gt;Student: This is a very special
fan, and I can really do this.

00:02:15.016 --> 00:02:15.776
You can pick up the--

00:02:16.016 --> 00:02:19.876
&gt;&gt;Alli: Some parts of Morning Meeting
may be longer in certain grade levels,

00:02:19.956 --> 00:02:23.156
but every Morning Meeting really
has the same structure to it.

00:02:23.496 --> 00:02:24.376
&gt;&gt;Good morning, Harrison.

00:02:24.526 --> 00:02:25.326
&gt;&gt;Good morning, Elliot.

00:02:25.616 --> 00:02:26.646
&gt;&gt;Hope you have an amazing day.

00:02:27.026 --> 00:02:27.916
&gt;&gt;Thank you, you, too.

00:02:27.916 --> 00:02:29.096
&gt;&gt;I hope you have a stellar day.

00:02:29.096 --> 00:02:30.046
&gt;&gt;Good morning, Jason.

00:02:30.186 --> 00:02:30.806
&gt;&gt;Good morning, Mia.

00:02:31.036 --> 00:02:32.626
&gt;&gt;Hope you have an extraordinary day.

00:02:32.746 --> 00:02:33.626
&gt;&gt;Hope you have a great day.

00:02:33.866 --> 00:02:34.646
&gt;&gt;Thanks, you, too.

00:02:34.846 --> 00:02:37.216
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: A lot of times, we'll
include some sort of a question

00:02:37.216 --> 00:02:40.256
with our greeting, and so the kids
are sharing a piece of themselves.

00:02:40.576 --> 00:02:41.446
They want to be heard.

00:02:41.446 --> 00:02:42.056
&gt;&gt;They want to be heard.

00:02:42.056 --> 00:02:42.596
They want to be seen.

00:02:42.846 --> 00:02:44.676
They want to make those
connections with each other.

00:02:44.996 --> 00:02:46.946
&gt;&gt;Student: If you could go
to any State in the U.S.,

00:02:46.946 --> 00:02:48.066
which State would you go to?

00:02:49.056 --> 00:02:52.256
&gt;&gt;Student: Probably Alaska, 'cause
they have a lot of cool fish there.

00:02:52.256 --> 00:02:57.156
&gt;&gt;Harrison: I would probably go
to Hawaii, because I like flowers.

00:02:58.236 --> 00:03:03.116
&gt;&gt;Alli: And then finally, and
probably the most famous part

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:04.776
of Morning Meeting, is the activity.

00:03:05.326 --> 00:03:07.726
We tend to work a lot on teamwork.

00:03:08.376 --> 00:03:12.096
&gt;&gt;It's important that we
always know how to be kind

00:03:12.096 --> 00:03:13.946
to each other, how to work together.

00:03:14.456 --> 00:03:17.506
We're going to try our best
to work together as a team,

00:03:17.566 --> 00:03:21.166
so that we can maybe
exceed our goal of 19.

00:03:21.456 --> 00:03:26.126
&gt;&gt;In the teacher role, you're also
making sure that the kids understand,

00:03:26.336 --> 00:03:29.976
if the tower falls, how can we support
the person who's putting that block on?

00:03:31.076 --> 00:03:32.246
&gt;&gt;Nineteen blocks!

00:03:32.246 --> 00:03:32.976
Excellent!

00:03:32.976 --> 00:03:34.376
[ cheering ]

00:03:34.376 --> 00:03:35.596
&gt;&gt;Alli: This is a safe zone...

00:03:35.596 --> 00:03:37.136
&gt;&gt;Audience is nice and quiet.

00:03:37.206 --> 00:03:39.746
&gt;&gt;...If the blocks fall, life
will go on, we will be okay.

00:03:41.046 --> 00:03:41.356
&gt;&gt;Students: Ohhhhh!

00:03:43.186 --> 00:03:43.846
&gt;&gt;Alli: Oh, that's okay.

00:03:43.846 --> 00:03:44.776
That's okay!

00:03:44.776 --> 00:03:44.843
[ applause ]

00:03:44.843 --> 00:03:45.356
&gt;&gt;Give her a hand.

00:03:45.356 --> 00:03:45.976
That was awesome.

00:03:48.046 --> 00:03:50.036
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: We try to include
some leadership activities

00:03:50.036 --> 00:03:52.106
and group challenges
with the 5th graders.

00:03:52.176 --> 00:03:53.646
So we try to raise it up a level,

00:03:53.646 --> 00:03:56.556
to think about how are they
communicating with each other?

00:03:56.556 --> 00:03:58.516
How are they solving
problems as a group?

00:03:58.756 --> 00:04:01.806
&gt;&gt;With Group Juggle, we're
trying to safely get our birds

00:04:01.806 --> 00:04:03.756
to each other, and not touch the ground.

00:04:03.756 --> 00:04:04.736
What's your strategy, Mia?

00:04:05.166 --> 00:04:08.596
&gt;&gt;Mia: Sometimes if you say their
name, it helps them to join in a little

00:04:08.596 --> 00:04:09.686
if you're about to throw to them.

00:04:10.146 --> 00:04:11.616
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: And Calvin,
what do you think?

00:04:11.686 --> 00:04:14.176
&gt;&gt;Calvin: If somebody
misses, don't start laughing,

00:04:14.176 --> 00:04:16.136
because it kind of gets
you all wound up.

00:04:16.136 --> 00:04:18.286
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: All right, here we go.

00:04:19.606 --> 00:04:22.376
&gt;&gt;It builds as they get older and
older, they're more comfortable with it.

00:04:22.626 --> 00:04:24.606
It helps them with public speaking.

00:04:24.736 --> 00:04:27.096
They're not stressed out
about sharing their ideas

00:04:27.096 --> 00:04:28.236
when they're right here
in the classroom.

00:04:28.916 --> 00:04:29.596
&gt;&gt;Alli: I love it.

00:04:29.736 --> 00:04:33.216
I can see right away by
looking around my circle who's

00:04:33.216 --> 00:04:34.376
in a good space, who's not.

00:04:34.786 --> 00:04:38.136
So I really use that information to
help with the kids be ready to learn.

00:04:39.626 --> 00:04:40.906
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: We hold each
other accountable.

00:04:41.076 --> 00:04:43.036
If I'm going to listen to what
you're sharing in the morning,

00:04:43.036 --> 00:04:44.426
you're going to listen
to what I'm sharing.

00:04:44.806 --> 00:04:47.256
We're going to do it in a
respectful way and a caring way.

00:04:47.256 --> 00:04:50.116
And that respect carries
out throughout the school,

00:04:50.186 --> 00:04:52.026
and also out onto the playground.

00:04:52.026 --> 00:04:53.976
And ideally, out into their community.
