00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.110
PROFESSOR: Good afternoon.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.780
Today we're going to go
beyond the way we've

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.480
spoken about before.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.180
We've talked about how
psychologists measure the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.690
mind, how neuroscientists
interrogate the brain.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.080
And so now, we'll talk about the
first human faculty that

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.790
we'll consider in a series
of faculties

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.460
through the course, Vision--

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.450
How We See.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.015
And for today's lecture, I got
help from Melissa Troyer, one

00:00:55.015 --> 00:00:56.790
of your teaching assistants.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.060
So, one of the things we can
think about is what are the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.180
purposes of vision?

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.080
What do we use sight for?

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.440
And we'll talk about that.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.695
Problems that the visual
system has to overcome.

00:01:06.695 --> 00:01:09.530
What are the obstacles for
vision to work accurately and

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.700
efficiently?

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.130
And how does the brain
organization of vision serve

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.160
the human capacity to see?

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.740
So human perceptual abilities
are amazing, as are perceptual

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.680
abilities of many species
in different areas.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.450
But humans can detect a candle
30 miles away on

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.190
a dark, clear night.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.120
They can detect cochlear
displacements

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.400
that's in your ear--

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.500
equal to the width of
a hydrogen atom.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.240
You can taste 1 teaspoon of
sugar, even when it's mixed in

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.200
two gallons of water.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.900
You can smell a drop of perfume
diffused into the

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.200
space of a three-bedroom
apartment.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.260
So the human capacity to
perceive the world in a highly

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.750
sensitive way is remarkable.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.130
We're going to focus on vision
specifically today.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.110
And think, what do we
use vision for?

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.030
Well, how does it serve us in
dealing with the world?

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.680
And researchers have thought
about two major reasons that

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.350
we see, two purposes
of vision.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.800
One of them is object
recognition.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.550
Recognizing things
in the world.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.200
People we know, words
we can read,

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.750
chairs, tables, animals--

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.300
all kinds of things that
we see out there.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.190
And we need to know who they are
or what they are in order

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.040
to operate in the world.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.050
And the second one is a little
bit different, navigation--

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.020
getting around in the world.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.590
When you're running, when you're
jumping, when you're

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.440
reaching to grab something,
you're not usually much

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.470
interested in what something
is, as where you're moving,

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.310
where you need to move
to avoid something

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.510
being thrown at you.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.160
So two big purposes
of vision--

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.930
what things are and where they
are, so you can navigate

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.540
around quickly in the world.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.570
And when we think about purposes
of vision, for what

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.720
things are or where they are,
psychologists and people

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.040
working in computer vision have
recognized a series of

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.360
problems that our visual
system has to solve.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.990
We have to link unique images.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.310
Because when we see something,
it'll almost always look

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.500
different from one perceptual
moment to the next.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.000
We can see the same person,
for example, but under

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.180
different conditions of
illumination, darkness or

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.440
lightness or shadows, the angle
we see them at, the

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.160
distance we see them at, the
expression on their face-- a

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.140
smile or frown--

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.690
shadows that might be being
cast, occlusion, a thing

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.380
blocking part of their face.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.760
And yet, we can recognize a
person very well under all

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.550
these circumstances.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.630
So what arrives in our
eye is different from

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.150
all of these views.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.600
But what we interpret them
is all the same.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.250
That's a person I know.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.230
The same thing with letters.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.550
We can see letters in all kinds
of fonts and all kinds

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.420
of handwriting, and yet we can
interpret what they are in a

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.670
uniform way.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:37.440
Or body.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.810
We can see bodies of all kinds
of different positions.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.440
But our visual system
lets us know right

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.210
away that it's a person.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.530
And so psychologists have tried
to formalize these kinds

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.990
of problems to ones
of equivalents.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.550
So something is the same thing
at different views.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:51.440
Generalization--

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.770
something has a very
different shape.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.320
Or impoverished input, where
there's poor lighting or

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.690
something's complicated.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.210
And you still figure
out what it is.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.430
For getting around in the world
or where things are in

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.640
the world, you're moving
through space

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.420
and tracking things.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.310
And there's many sources
of movement.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.630
Your eyes are constantly
moving.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:09.440
Your head is moving.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.670
Your body is moving.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:11.880
And the world is moving.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.890
And you have to sort
all those out.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:14.460
Run quickly.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.380
Jump [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.370
world spatially.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.399
And so here's some examples.

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:23.490
Here's a shape constancy
problem.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.020
Here's two different
versions of a cat.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.320
It's trivial for you to know
that even though these things

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.790
have different shapes, they
represent the same thing.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.310
But that's an achievement of
your visual system, to easily

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.690
make that equivalence across
two very different shapes.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.430
And we know, from computer
vision, how hard these

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.580
problems are.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.780
No computer vision system sees
with anything like the

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.110
generalized ability of
a very young child.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.820
So our visual systems are so
brilliant that psychologists

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.990
and vision scientists really
interrogate our visual system

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.060
to figure out, how
do we do it.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.410
If people didn't do this, we'd
think it would be impossible

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.250
to accomplish at all.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.640
Here's another example that's
easily solved by people-- not

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.940
so easily solved by machines.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.080
If you see something like a car
at different angles, we

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.790
know that's the same thing,
pretty easily, even though,

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.800
again, the information that
arrives to our eyes is

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.710
radically different.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.170
And the same thing can be said
of something like all these

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.500
different versions
of the letter C.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.220
Radically different shapes.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.550
But we can readily interpret
almost all them-- this one

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:26.740
won't be too tough--

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.410
as the letter C.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.260
So our visual system does
this brilliantly.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.140
And also you get very
impoverished views.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.740
A key might be covered by
something, clothes on a hook.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.430
There might be a
book over here.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.240
There might be a fire hydrant
over here or a person.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.160
And yet, even though you get
only partial information, it's

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.790
relatively trivial to discover,
for you, what it is

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.820
you're looking at.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.770
Or you can see things like
you've never seen before.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.900
The pink elephant, this odd
picture, this striped ...

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.960
you've never seen them before
but it's not really ...

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.610
So again, your visual system
is just so brilliant at

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.110
matching what it sees with what
you know to figure out

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.070
what's in front of you.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.960
So today we're going to talk
about how our minds and brains

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.730
allow us to see the
world vision.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.920
And we'll talk about it in three
parts; how philosophers

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.620
and psychologists have thought
about the idea of seeing; how

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.320
when information first enters
your eye-- your retina--

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.190
which are set of layers in the
back of the eye; how that

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.110
retina's already organized to
help you see the world; and

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.940
how that information is then
transported into the cortex,

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.930
where higher-level processing
lets you know where you are

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.480
and what you're looking at.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.760
So the ideas about how we learn
to see the world have

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:47.840
their roots in philosophy.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.690
For example, John Locke is
associated with the idea of

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.110
the blank slate or
tabula rosa.

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.350
He said, "Let us suppose the
mind to be a white paper void

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.640
of any characters, without
any ideas.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.360
How comes it to be furnished?

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.050
Whence comes it by that vast
store, which the busy and

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.920
boundless fancy of man has
painted on it with an almost

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.960
endless variety?" Where do we
get the information for how

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.780
the world works when
we look at it?

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.810
And his answer to that
was experience.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:17.120
That we notice things around us,
and experience drives our

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.940
understanding of the world.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.870
And that position that there's
a blank slate and we learn

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.420
objectively from the world
around us has been called the

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.870
Objectivist view.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.350
And maybe, that we see the world
that we build up through

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:31.410
experience, knowledge about how
to accurately represent

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.190
what's around us.

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.330
The alternative you has
emphasized how much our mind

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.640
organizes what we see, instead
of what's out there itself.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.390
And so Gestalt psychologists or
Gestalt views on perception

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.820
say, it's not what's out there
in the world, but the way our

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:48.710
mind organizes and believes
what's out there.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.670
And these two things
can come together.

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.650
So for example, when you think
about how you listen to a

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:57.420
piano, music comes from
piano the same way a

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.880
pianist strikes chords.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.600
There's things out there in
the world that you see.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.900
The piano has certain
limitations.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.570
It can sound like somethings
but not others.

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:06.590
It can't be a clarinet.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.240
There's constraints in the world
on what's possible to

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.740
see what's out there.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:14.190
And our percepts are evoked
by nature in this way.

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.420
But they are personal and
not a copy of nature.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.010
In the words, we each,
individually, figure out

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:20.950
what's going on there by
our own experiences and

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:22.450
interpretation.

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.350
And they're exactly that-- an
interpretation, not a simple

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:28.770
mirroring or copy of nature.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.560
So I'm going to try and convince
you of something that

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.190
might not be obvious to people
when they first think about

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:35.470
it, that vision is an
interpretation of the

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:36.289
world around us.

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:39.940
It's not simply a video camera
or mirror, it's an active

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:41.630
calculation of what's
out there.

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:45.760
And we see, through inference,
what we believe that we see.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:46.930
And that visual illusions--

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:49.180
and you've seen some before, and
I'll show you some again--

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:52.810
are not just illusions to trick
people and confuse them.

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:55.850
But they're demonstrations of a
gap between what's actually

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:59.490
out there in the world and
how we interpret it.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:01.480
Most of the time we don't
have illusions.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.770
We don't walk into walls.

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:06.030
We don't misidentify people
we know commonly.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:08.170
Because illusions are rare,
because our minds and brains

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:11.110
have evolved to interpret the
world that's out there, and

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:14.310
the system works so brilliantly
coupled with the

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:15.970
environment that we actually
live in, that we

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:16.840
don't think about it.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.690
So the person on the street
says, well, what

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:20.500
do I need to see?

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.250
I open my eyes.

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:25.200
But that's because our visual
system works so brilliantly,

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.000
effortlessly, and
automatically.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.410
It's such a calculating machine
that that's why it

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:31.820
feels so simple.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.820
So here's one, small example.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.960
And I'll show you a number of
visual illusions that show us

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.960
how we're constantly
interpreting even the most

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.060
simple thing.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.060
So for example, here's
two people.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.390
And we're not worried that this
is one of the shortest

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:48.220
men you've ever seen, because we
know, through prospective,

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.260
this person's standing
back there.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.940
Even though, if they were
standing right next to

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.710
somebody, you'd worry about
the size of that person.

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:57.910
So we're constantly interpreting
information by

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:00.660
the context in which
we see it.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.800
Here's another example of the
choice of interpretations.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:04.900
You can see a vase.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.580
Or you can see two faces here. ,
Usually it's hard for people

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:08.930
to see them both
simultaneously.

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:10.580
They tend to flip
back and forth.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:11.390
But you can choose the

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:14.620
interpretation of what you see.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:17.190
So let me pick one example where
people have studied a

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:20.390
lot, which is the issue of
brightness constancy.

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:23.140
So here's the problem for
the visual system.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:26.380
The ambient brightness, the
brightness around us, varies

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.290
in staggering ratios.

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:30.570
When we're outdoors in the
sun-- and even that's not

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:31.110
constant, right?

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:32.150
Sometimes it's a bright day.

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:33.860
Sometimes it's a cloudy day.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.670
Sometimes we're indoors under
bright conditions or less

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:37.300
bright conditions.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.330
So huge changes in the
ambient illumination.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.520
Or in shadows-- we'll make
it even more complicated.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.790
That means in a purely
measurement sense, in a purely

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:49.810
physics sense, a piece of coal
in sunlight reflects 10 times

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:51.570
as much light as snow
in the shade.

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.410
So think about that
for a moment.

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:55.030
You're not disturbed if
you see a piece of

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:56.400
coal inside or outside.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.730
They both look, to you, like
black, dark pieces of coal.

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:02.270
And snow looks, pretty much, the
same to you if it's inside

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:03.500
or outside.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.990
But if you're visual system
worked like a simple,

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:10.100
objective light meter, you would
conclude that the piece

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.270
of coal in the sunlight is a
much brighter thing-- in an

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:14.490
objective sense--

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:16.200
than snow in the shade.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.770
And yet, you never make that
conclusion, because you're

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:22.210
constantly, automatically,
without effort, adjusting

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:25.350
mentally for the ambient
light condition.

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:27.800
So we use brightness all the
time to help us figure out is

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.750
that a piece of coal
or sunlight?

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:33.410
But that brightness perception
is constantly adjusted to

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:36.430
interpret brightness in the
context we're sitting in.

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:41.000
And perceptual psychologists
have worked on how people

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.020
calculate this.

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:46.040
So here's an example of a dark
letter T. Again, the black T

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.460
would be 10 times brighter
outdoors than

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:52.130
white paper is indoors.

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:53.600
And yet, you're never
bothered by that.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.500
You can read a newspaper or
something else indoors or

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.980
outdoors with equal these,
because people are calculating

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:00.890
the ratio of the ambient
lighting--

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:04.010
lower inside, much brighter
outside, from the sun--

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:06.780
and using that information to
make inferences about the

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:10.630
relative brightness of a
stimulus they're looking at.

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:13.870
And there's all kinds of
examples or illusions that

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:15.130
show us this.

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:18.965
So for example, here, you detect
a white tile in the

00:12:18.965 --> 00:12:21.320
shade and a gray tile
in brightness.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.970
And that's how you
interpret it.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:25.120
But that's because you're taking
already into account--

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.960
without even thinking about
it for a moment--

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.560
the fact that this is in the
shadow, and this is in the

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.340
bright light.

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.400
You're right in your
interpretation.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.540
But if we show a constant
background, you could see that

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:41.340
those two are actually identical
in brightness.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:45.090
The same thing-- you could take
a look at this cube and

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.670
this cube as part of these
Rubik's cubes.

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:48.680
This looks orange.

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.370
This looks brown.

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:52.400
You're adjusting for light,
as you make those

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.640
interpretations.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.110
And if you make the background
constant, you can see those

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.470
are identical in color
and luminance.

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:00.550
So this shows you that we're
constantly making these

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:01.770
interpretations.

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:05.470
Only these tricks of visual
illusion make us realize that

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:07.790
our inferences are occasionally
wrong.

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:10.540
But they're incredibly right
almost all the time.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.790
So here's another example
of taking a local

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:15.220
luminance into account.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:18.180
So typically, people see
this as a lighter gray.

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:19.570
And this is a darker gray.

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:22.090
Again, they're using the
contrast that surrounds it to

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:23.860
make that interpretation.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.330
Because if we give it a constant
background, you can

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.530
see that in an objective sense
the two are identical.

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:34.570
People use edges as a very
powerful source of information

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:35.540
to make these inferences.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:37.240
And you can see that
in one moment.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.300
Because this boundary, here,
is used to make judgments

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:43.670
about the relative brightness
around an object.

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:45.890
So you just do this.

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:48.850
The boundary disappears, and
the two things look equally

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:50.920
gray, one above the other.

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:54.960
Or no less spectacular, but
measured example, here's two

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.530
different shades of gray.

00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:59.560
And if you're in a light meter,
objectively looking at

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:02.990
how much light is reflected from
this, here that changes.

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:05.490
This looks almost the
same as this.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.220
But really, there's just
a manipulation at the

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:07.750
boundaries.

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:08.780
Again, here's a light meter.

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:09.720
Here's a boundary.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.280
So these two sides are
really identical.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.130
It's just been manipulated
by the boundary.

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:17.950
And you can see that, because
if you get rid of that

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:19.570
boundary, now you can
see that these two

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:21.040
sides are equally bright.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:27.100
Another example, again, of how
we're constantly using local

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.650
information about brightness
to make

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:30.500
judgments about objects.

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.610
Here, you see a picture
of a woman.

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:33.530
Here's her forehead.

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:35.880
Here's her darker hair.

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.980
But in fact, that's a judgment
in interpretation.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:41.920
Because if we cover up the
surrounding information, the

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.470
hair is identical to the face.

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:48.510
Here's some other illusions,
not all about brightness.

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.750
But, again, they're just
reminders that what we see is

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:53.360
constantly a calculation and an

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.730
interpretation of many factors.

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:56.995
So here's a fun spiral.

00:14:56.995 --> 00:15:00.510
You can see it zooming around,
going from inner tightness and

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:02.860
unwinding peripherally.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:07.030
And so we can add
a dot to that.

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:09.475
And now, we can let this travel
around to the middle.

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:15.910
You can see it's not quite
making the middle.

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:18.440
And we can try that again.

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.560
Because in fact, in this
picture, every line, every

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.700
circle is a circle.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.310
And none of them are connected,
one to the other.

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:26.980
They just appear that way.

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:30.940
This illusion, that Richard
Gregory describes, was

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:34.120
inspired because he saw a wall
in a cafe that looked like it

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.900
had not been well assembled
by the person building it.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:39.870
As if they had been consuming
something from the cafe as

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:41.780
they built the wall.

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:46.650
And bizarrely, having all kinds
of lines that are not

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:47.980
lined up, as you'd expect in

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.480
well-constructed tiles on a wall.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:53.260
But in fact, every line, here,
is perfectly straight.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.830
And you're interpreting the
black and white edges to

00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:00.770
confuse you about the lining
up across the horizontal.

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:02.110
This is very striking.

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:06.260
Here's Rubik's cubes that,
again, now they're adding one

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.020
more story into this,
which is color.

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:10.970
But we use that often in every
day sight, of course, to make

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:13.020
conclusions about things.

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:15.670
And here, you can see the
difference between, for

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:19.410
example, this yellow cube
and this brown cube.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.320
What did I want to do?

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.710
You can see the difference
between this brown cube--

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:30.170
sorry, let me get my
illusion correct--

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:34.400
and this darker cube, lighter
brown and darker brown.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.480
But if we cover those up,
those are identical.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.250
And they're gray.

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:41.710
Here's another one that shows
you it's not just the color

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:43.680
itself but the spatial
location.

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:48.410
So here's a pink circle, near
the middle of this display.

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:51.110
And here's a more orange one.

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:55.780
So we're just simply going to
expand those out and get it

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:57.800
bigger and bigger.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:01.030
And as it's moving
across your eye--

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.655
even though, objectively, it
remains pink and orange, or

00:17:03.655 --> 00:17:05.530
the things will lead you
to you interpret that--

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:08.440
as it gets big enough, the color
difference disappears to

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:10.660
your perception.

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.400
And sometimes you can
get-- and this is a

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.430
very complicated one--

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:15.609
illusions--

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:17.604
I don't know if it's
working for you--

00:17:17.604 --> 00:17:21.200
that these things are actually
turning, even though none of

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.450
them are moving at all.

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.690
OK.

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:29.370
And one last, simple example.

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:31.180
Here's yellow on gray.

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:32.680
Here's light gray on yellow.

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.490
But in fact, these X's
are identical.

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:36.170
And you can see that when
they meet here.

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:41.160
So again, we're constantly
interpreting color, shape,

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.720
brightness, by things that
are surrounding it.

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:47.070
And everything is being the
product of an interpretation,

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:50.530
not what's out there in an
objective sense of self.

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:52.920
And so, if we think about this
Objectivist view that that

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:56.390
can't be right, that the limit
of this objective view would

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:58.180
be that everybody sees
everything differently all the

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.140
time, that would be a
confusing world of

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:00.830
hallucinations.

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:02.590
We don't live there
either, mostly.

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:05.020
So we think it's the because
there's a relationship between

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:06.150
these, or a synthesis.

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:08.330
We perceive only within limits
of our nervous system.

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:10.900
There's a way that
we see the world.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.750
But the way that our nervous
system computes and makes

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:16.590
inferences about the world
reflects many properties of

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:19.900
the world that are efficient
and accurate.

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:23.460
So how do we get information
into our brains to see?

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:26.130
So, if you were to design a
system that was hopelessly

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:29.220
failed, the first thing you
would do is think the visual

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.090
system is going to fail.

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:33.810
The first thing it does is it
takes objects in the world and

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:35.800
it flips them upside down-- and
how they're perceived in

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.070
the eye, the front of the eye,
the back of the eye.

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:39.510
Here's the retina.

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:42.860
And the first place in your
brain that sees something is

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.370
in the back of your eye.

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:46.190
You'd think you would put it
in the front of your eye.

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:48.510
And information bounces
back into the

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:49.280
deepest part of the eye.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.930
And then it comes out and leads
through the optic nerve.

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:54.890
You also know, from prior
classes, that the world is

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:58.070
organized by left and right
visual fields, instead of the

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:02.090
way we intuitively think
about the world.

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:03.840
Let's take a closer look
at the retina.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:07.980
These layers of cells in your
eye that begin vision.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.900
So light comes in and bounces
through the back.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:14.350
And here are the rods and cones
where vision begins.

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:17.030
The cones are primarily
near the fovea.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:18.655
The rods are primarily
peripheral.

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:26.750
And I'm reminding you, again, as
the optic nerve leaves, it

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:28.020
goes through the optic chiasm.

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:30.350
The fibers get sorted out by
whether they're having

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:33.250
information from the left or
right side of the world, and

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:34.520
then enter the cortex
that way.

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:42.830
Within the retina, within your
eye, here is a graphic of the

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:43.810
different kinds of cells.

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:46.340
Here's what the cells
actually look like.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:54.900
And here's a blow up of these
remarkable cones, these larger

00:19:54.900 --> 00:20:00.620
entities and the rods that you
can see are very small, but

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:02.300
many of them.

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.890
And the big difference between
rods and cones is that the

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:07.660
rods are receptive to
information at only one

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:08.400
wavelength.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.760
They're effectively
color blind.

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:10.940
We'll come back to that.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:13.910
But that's a good wavelength
to pick up information, for

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:15.980
example, in low light.

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:19.570
The cones are selective for
blue or red or green.

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:22.350
That's the stuff of
seeing color.

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:24.990
But it doesn't operate too well,
unless you have a pretty

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:28.430
well illuminated situation.

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:32.880
And the rods and cones have
a striking physical

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:33.960
organization.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.930
So here's the distribution
of cones for color.

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:40.880
Pretty much, all of them in the
fovea in the middle part

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.280
of the retina.

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:45.450
And then the rods are spread
out peripherally.

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:50.050
So there's this big difference
in where they're located.

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:53.260
And another big difference is
that the cones, the ones that

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:57.860
respond to color, and that are
in the middle of the fovea,

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:01.130
have an almost one-to-one
relationship between the

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:04.070
receptors for color information
and the neurons

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:05.730
that leave the eye with
information that

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:07.350
will go into the brain.

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:09.420
The rods have a many-to-one
relationship.

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:13.510
Many rods are contributing for a
combined calculation of some

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:16.040
kind to a single neuron
that leaves the brain.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:18.620
So you can already see, at the
very first moment of reception

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:21.330
from the rods and from the cons,
very different kinds of

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:26.430
processes are being begun,
as you begin to see.

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:29.180
Two ideas have been very helpful
for understanding how

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:30.810
vision is organized
in the brain--

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:33.640
our receptive fields
and retinotopy.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.760
Receptive fields are, simply,
an area of external space.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.560
It's a physical spot
in space in which a

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:40.885
stimulus activates a neuron.

00:21:40.885 --> 00:21:44.290
So neurons, early in vision,
will respond to specific

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:46.850
locations in space when you're
looking straightforward.

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:48.460
One neuron might cover
this area.

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:51.880
Another neuron might cover
that area and so forth.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:55.085
Retinotopy refers to topographic
or spatial maps of

00:21:55.085 --> 00:21:56.540
visual space across
a restricted

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:58.100
region of the brain.

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:02.240
And so, retinotopy keeps these
receptive fields lined up.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.000
So if the neuron is seeing this
spot, this retinotopic

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.330
map, and so the next spot
stays next to it.

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:08.750
And the next spot stays
next to it.

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:11.730
So you can reconstruct what
you see, based on a lot of

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:16.480
very local glances at
the environment.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.670
And then it travels from the
eye, through the optic nerve,

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:22.060
into something called the
lateral geniculate nucleus.

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:24.760
The nucleus is simply a
collection of cells.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.670
This is part of the thalamus.

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:29.490
And from there, the fibers will
travel into the cortex to

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:31.920
begin conscious visual
perception.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.200
And you have one on the left
and one in the right of the

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.930
lateral geniculate nucleon.

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:38.440
And if you look at
this blown up--

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.430
this is a sample from a monkey,
but the human one

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:41.850
looks very similar.

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:46.960
You can see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6 layers of cells in each

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.180
lateral geniculate nucleus.

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:51.060
The first two look a little
bit different.

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:55.470
If you look carefully, they're
comprised of larger cells.

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:58.870
The other four are comprised
of smaller cells.

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:01.350
So people describe the cell
layer, made up of larger

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:02.710
cells, as magnocellular--

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:03.890
big cells.

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:07.620
And the other four layers as
parvocellular, or small cells.

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:11.950
The mangocellular layers tend
to have large cells.

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:14.190
A lot of their information comes
from the rods, the black

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:17.650
and white elements, good for
seeing in low vision.

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:19.430
They have large receptive
fields.

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:21.380
They cover relatively
large patches of the

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:22.460
world for each neuron.

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:25.820
Three times larger than the
parvocellular ones, the

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:29.610
neurons fire rapidly,
transiently, are color blind.

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:33.460
They're good in low contrast,
low lighting.

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:35.430
The parvocellular ones
are smaller.

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:37.260
They get a lot of their
input from the cones.

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:39.750
They have smaller receptive
fields.

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:42.770
They have slow, sustained
responses.

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:45.010
They don't turn on and
off very quickly.

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:46.150
They're wavelength sensitive.

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:48.170
So they can respond to color.

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:50.690
They operate best when things
are very bright.

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:52.240
They're unique to primates,
and there are 10

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.280
times more of them.

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.420
But again, even before you get
to the cortex, there's this

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:58.510
huge organization between
two modes or pathways of

00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:00.040
perception, so you
can construct the

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:02.150
world as you see it.

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:04.770
And then we've gone over
before that as you

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:06.310
leave the nuclei --

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:08.310
the lateral geniculate nuclei--
then the next fiber

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:11.570
pathway takes you into the
primary visual cortex in the

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:12.820
back of your brain.

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:18.950
Now, vision is so important for
primates and people, that

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:22.370
when people estimate how much of
the neocortex is devoted to

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:25.520
different modalities, a common
estimate is that about half of

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:29.000
the brain is primarily
devoted to vision--

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.700
11% to touch, 3% to audition.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:33.380
These are ballpark estimates.

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:38.430
But it shows you how visual we
are with our fellow primates.

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:42.080
There's many specialized
areas within the

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.260
human visual cortex.

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:47.390
They estimated some years ago it
was 32 distinct areas, each

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:50.450
performing a different tasks,
lots of specialization.

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:54.610
And another fascinating aspect
of vision is proliferation as

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:58.970
we go up into higher stations
of visual processing.

00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:02.440
So in one lateral geniculate
nucleus in your brain-- and

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:03.960
you have two of them, one on
the left and one on the

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.780
right-- you have about
a million neurons.

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:10.210
They will send information that
will be interpreted by

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:14.280
about 250 million neurons
in your visual cortex.

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:17.460
Those will communicate about
400 million neurons in the

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:19.450
next level of processing.

00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:22.120
And finally, there'll be
something like 1.3 billion

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.580
visual cortical neurons
in the brain,

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:26.030
overall, in a gross estimate.

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:28.610
It's as if to discover what
you're seeing, you're having

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:31.620
larger and larger populations
of neurons unpacking the

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:34.520
mystery of what initially
came into the brain very

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:38.010
impoverished information, that's
expanded to begin to

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:41.760
understand what you need to
perceive a face or a word or a

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.160
physical movement.

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:47.230
So a single lateral geniculate
neuron, it could be estimated,

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:51.900
will take 600 cortical neurons
to interpret what this lateral

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:53.870
geniculate neuron has
been exposed to.

00:25:56.850 --> 00:25:59.380
Here's this area in the visual
cortex, where the information

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:02.185
arrives first into your brain
and primary visual cortex.

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:09.150
And when we think about cortex
in perception, in several

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:10.900
modalities, one of the striking
things is how it's

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:13.670
organized to achieve
certain goals.

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:15.910
So here, we're going to switch
for a moment to the parts of

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:17.690
your brain that move
your body--

00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:21.890
motor cortex or that have
your sense of touch.

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:24.740
And when people stimulate these
and look at what they're

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:25.380
related to.

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:27.310
For example, in patients
undergoing treatment for

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:30.080
epilepsy or an animal study--
support this where you can do

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.330
much more expensive
experimentation--

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:36.320
a very striking thing occurs,
which is the number of neurons

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.880
devoted to different parts of
your body are radically

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:41.680
different than your
actual body size.

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:44.390
So this funny looking,
so-called homunculus

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:46.930
represents how many neurons,
for example, in your motor

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:50.590
cortex are devoted to different
parts of your body.

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:53.640
So it turns out that we do
incredible things with our

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:57.050
hands, so we devote, it seems
like, a tremendous amount of

00:26:57.050 --> 00:26:57.960
this area to the hand.

00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.210
That's what that
looks so large.

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:04.030
There's a reason we do
handshaking and handwriting

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:07.140
and typing with our hands
and not with our hips.

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:09.260
Because although our hips are
physically larger than our

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:11.750
hand, we devote an incredibly
small number of

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:13.320
neurons to do that.

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:16.630
So it's a trick of the brain,
given a certain limited size,

00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:19.970
to blow up its representation
of what needs to be done

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:21.270
brilliantly.

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:23.910
And to reduce its representation
of parts of the

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:26.420
body that it doesn't have
to do too much with.

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:27.290
So what's blown up?

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:28.840
Your hand?

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:32.130
Things to do with your face,
so that you can speak?

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:34.220
Your tongue, because that has to
accomplish a lot, in terms

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:36.810
of speech, in terms of eating.

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:39.540
And things like your toes
and ankle are gypped of

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:41.900
representation, because you
don't do that much that's

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:42.640
brilliance.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.510
There's a very clever strategy,
by the brain, to

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:48.760
devote the amount of neural
resources to make that part of

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:51.600
your body accomplish either
very complicated things or

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.850
very simple things.

00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:59.440
And if people on the outside
looked like this--

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.010
this is what they
would look like.

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:04.490
Giant hands, giant head, and
a very shriveled up trunk.

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:07.410
So that's not what we look like,
but that's the way our

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:10.820
brain represents us, our bodies,
so that we could have

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:14.540
fantastically complicated
control of our hands and

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:18.960
things having to do with speech
around our mouth.

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.670
It's different for different
modalities.

00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:22.900
For hearing, things
are organized

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:26.220
by frequency, tonotopy.

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:29.350
For vision, things are organized
in two ways.

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:31.050
Spatial relations
are maintained.

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:33.650
They have to be, so you know,
as different neurons saw

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:36.500
different receptive fields,
how's that all kept up?

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:39.520
Here's a kind of a rough
experiment, where a monkey

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:42.730
saw-- before it was, as they
politely say, sacrificed--

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:44.480
a display like this.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.520
This is the brain of the
monkey, flattened out.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:49.620
And you can see it has this
representation, like this.

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:51.240
Now you could say, well,
that's how we see.

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.100
We line everything up.

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.240
But this is not the part of our
brain that we associate

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:56.130
with conscious perception
at all.

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:59.880
But if you didn't keep the
spatial information aligned

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:02.530
correctly, you could never
interpret things, in the end,

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:04.830
correctly that go together, like
different parts of a hand

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:07.190
or different letters
within a word.

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:10.470
In humans, it's also in
the back of the brain.

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:12.000
It also keeps spatial
information.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.800
But what do humans do,
and other primates?

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:18.710
They greatly expand the central
part of vision.

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:21.940
So here's the central part of
vision, the so-called fovea,

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:24.560
which is a small part of
the visual display.

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:27.240
Here is everything else that's
in peripheral vision.

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.960
So this is dark green,
dark purple.

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.690
But when it comes to the
representation in the visual

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:34.260
cortex, this small area
of what we see

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:35.095
becomes pretty large.

00:29:35.095 --> 00:29:37.110
It's way overrepresented.

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:42.010
So just as the motor cortex over
represents the hand, the

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:45.750
visual cortex over represents
the cone

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:49.380
foveal part of the brain.

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:51.960
So they can do much more
examination, much more

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:55.460
computation on that small
foveated area.

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:57.980
So that's why it matters,
tremendously, where people put

00:29:57.980 --> 00:29:58.870
their eyes.

00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:01.270
Where they put their eyes is
where neuromachinery is

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:04.050
dedicated to do its most
brilliant analysis.

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:06.590
And peripheral regions, which
are large, in vision, get

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:08.570
relatively small
representation.

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:11.640
All we do, in the periphery,
is notice if something is

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:13.930
whizzing at our head.

00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:15.655
And for that, we don't need
to be that sophisticated.

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:21.330
Now, what do neurons
communicate in

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:22.410
primary visual cortex?

00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:24.510
Well, this is the, sort of,
seminal Nobel Prize-winning

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:27.240
work from Hubel and Wiesel, at
Harvard, who discovered that

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:32.130
what neurons respond to in
primary visual cortex is the

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:34.850
orientation of a piece of
something like this.

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:37.955
So here's a neuron that loves
a little bit of a stimulus.

00:30:37.955 --> 00:30:39.340
You notice that disorientation?

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:43.200
Here's each of these lines
as of the neuron firing.

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:46.960
It generalizes if a bar is close
in orientation, it will

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.820
still like it, somewhat.

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:51.980
And if the bar moves away from
its preferred orientation, it

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:53.330
won't respond and all.

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:55.920
So these neurons are coding
something about local

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.830
orientation of little lines.

00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:59.820
Those little lines will be
assembled later on in the

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:03.420
brain to represent a letter,
a word, a book, a face, a

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:04.540
chair, and so on.

00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:07.240
But these neurons simply know
they're seeing a line of this

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:10.020
angle or that angle that will
be assembled later on for an

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:12.840
entire conscious percept.

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:15.940
And then that information will
go from primary visual cortex,

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:19.210
in two pathways, that have two
quite different properties,

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:22.020
but turn out to be the
super-information processing

00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:25.220
pathways of your brain
and my brain.

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:27.390
So where do we first learn
about this fundamental

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:30.510
organization of how we see into
two giant highways of

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:31.880
information processing?

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:34.270
Well, the first studies where we
should study's in monkeys.

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:36.600
And I'll show you work
in humans as well.

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:39.430
And the major discovery was
this, that in our brains,

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:42.220
there's a so-called where
pathway that goes up in the

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:46.010
brain into the parietal cortex
and a what pathway that goes

00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:48.730
into temporal lobe
or lower cortex.

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:52.190
And if you make lesions in these
different regions, one

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:54.900
form of vision is spared
and one is impaired

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:55.910
in selective ways.

00:31:55.910 --> 00:31:57.660
So how did they discover this?

00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:59.590
So again, here's the
big picture.

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:02.960
Early visual processing
information a what pathway to

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:06.480
know what objects are a
face, a word, a chair.

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:09.400
Or where things are, that
you might run to,

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:12.410
grab, or jump over.

00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:13.280
So here was the experiment.

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:14.820
It was pretty simple.

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:16.460
Here were two food wells.

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:19.840
And monkeys that were eager to
get food would get rewarded,

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:23.260
if they would pick the
correct food well.

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:25.790
They didn't see where the food
was that was hidden, but they

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:27.930
would get to pick one
or the other.

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:32.700
And in one task they would have
to pick which food well

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.540
is closer to the stimulus.

00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:35.680
That's a where task.

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:36.970
Where is this located?

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:38.570
That's the piece of information
that will tell me

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:40.140
where to get my food.

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:41.850
And you can see, here's the
performance of the animals,

00:32:41.850 --> 00:32:42.420
their errors.

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:43.360
So it's good to be low.

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:44.800
They are eager to
get their food.

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:48.370
But if the animal had a
surgical lesion in the

00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:51.180
parietal cortex, the where
pathway, they were very poor

00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:52.810
at performing this task.

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:55.740
As if they couldn't appreciate
the spatial relation between

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:59.360
where the cylinder was located
and the food well.

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:01.370
On the other hand, monkeys who
had lesions made in the

00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:05.720
temporal cortex were poor when
they had to make this task.

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.270
They would see two different
objects.

00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:09.760
And they were taught that
one always meant that's

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:10.400
where the food is.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.350
Let's pretend it's
the cylinder.

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:14.000
So in order to know the correct
answer, they would

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.200
have to say, OK, is it next to
this object or this object?

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.480
That's a what discrimination.

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.450
Is it a cylinder or a cube?

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:22.670
And now, the temporal lobe
lesions were the ones that

00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:24.130
affected performance.

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:26.850
So it's as if one part of the
brain tells you where things

00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:27.740
are, in vision--

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:28.810
parietal lobe.

00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:30.610
And one tells you
what they are--

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:32.030
the temporal lobe.

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:35.170
So that's lesion studies
in monkeys.

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:38.170
But there's very interesting
things about when we look at

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:41.110
what cells communicate in these
two pathways that makes

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:44.140
sense in what we understand to
be the goals of these systems.

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:46.710
So for example, in the where
pathway, in the parietal

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:50.780
cortex, many neurons pick up
information from the fovea,

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:52.580
the central part of vision.

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:57.340
But the majority are sensitive
to stimuli in the periphery.

00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:59.240
So if you imagine, a good
thing to know if you're

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.840
running, is in the periphery.

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:04.020
Are there things coming at your
head, things to avoid?

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:06.610
You might grab something here,
if you need to grab it there.

00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:09.030
You would want to have a lot of
peripheral information for

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:10.909
spatial things around you.

00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:14.679
And in fact, if a monkey was
looking at this spot, which is

00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:17.610
away, entirely, from the
stimulus, it would respond to

00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:20.409
both a large and small stimulus
in the periphery

00:34:20.409 --> 00:34:21.690
quite strongly.

00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:24.120
So these neurons are responding
to a pretty broad

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:27.480
range of space where things
could happen.

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:31.360
Neurons in the what pathway
have almost their entire

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.870
responsiveness in the fovea.

00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:35.750
Because you know what something
is, if you're

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:37.469
reading a word and
looking at it.

00:34:37.469 --> 00:34:39.360
If you're looking at a face,
they're figuring out

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.460
who the person is.

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:43.586
So it's only responding, these
kinds of neurons, to

00:34:43.586 --> 00:34:44.940
information in the center.

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:47.500
But it has some very interesting
properties, even

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.360
at the level of singular
neurons.

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:50.650
So here's a depiction of an

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:52.110
experiment, now, from a monkey.

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:53.889
You're looking at a
single neuron or

00:34:53.889 --> 00:34:55.429
small group of neurons.

00:34:55.429 --> 00:34:57.370
And you present something
like a hand.

00:34:57.370 --> 00:35:00.170
And you can see that those
neurons really like the hand.

00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:03.850
Now, don't forget, for a primary
visual cortex, it just

00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:04.390
sees lines.

00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:06.430
It doesn't think about
the entire objects.

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:08.740
But by the time you get to the
higher levels of vision, it's

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:09.840
encoding an entire object.

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.870
And then, you can do experiments
that basically

00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:15.530
interrogate, what does this
neuron discover in the world?

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:17.270
What is it interested in?

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:20.890
So if you turn the hand over,
it's still very interested.

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:22.900
You show it a less
detailed hand.

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:23.790
It's still very interested.

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:26.900
Maybe a bit less, but it's
still very interested.

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:29.190
A hand, this way, where all
the spatial relations have

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:31.990
changed still recognizes
a hand.

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:34.920
It still recognizes a hand with
a bit less enthusiasm.

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:38.660
But now, a mitten, which kind
of looks like a hand.

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:40.200
That barely counts
as a hand at all.

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:43.800
That neuron has lost interest
in coding that as a hand.

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.170
And you're showed other
things that have some

00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:47.100
similarity in shape.

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:48.520
Because these all have
four elements in

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:49.920
them, like four fingers.

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.230
This neuron's not responding
at all.

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:53.970
It's not that it has four
things or lines.

00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:55.290
It's a hand.

00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:56.390
And then, you could even
worry about things.

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:57.940
Well, maybe this, because
it's from a person.

00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:01.450
But if they see the face, this
neuron doesn't care.

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:03.400
So it's nothing about
the gross shape

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:04.540
or that it's a person.

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:08.500
This neuron is specialized,
foveally, for spotting a hand.

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:10.580
And not only that, these kinds
of neurons already have the

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:14.080
properties we described that are
big problems for vision.

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:17.100
So here's a neuron that's
responding to an upright face.

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:23.020
And then it's responding if the
face is turned on its side

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:24.050
pretty well.

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:26.670
The face is turned upside down,
a little less well, but

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:28.680
it's still responding
to a face.

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.290
If the face is distant,
it's still responding.

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:33.120
If the face changes expression,
it's still

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:34.704
responding.

00:36:34.704 --> 00:36:37.450
And if we put a green filter on
it, so you have a Martian

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:38.690
person, it's still responding.

00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:41.980
So all kinds of ways that a
face changes in the world,

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:43.170
this neuron is still firing.

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:46.520
And interestingly, this neuron
was firing for one of the

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:47.790
experimenters.

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:50.430
But it wasn't too interested
in the other experimenter.

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:53.170
So it's a neuron that's
generalizing all the different

00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:55.260
views that you might
have of a person.

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:57.930
But it's responding to one
neuron versus another.

00:36:57.930 --> 00:37:00.940
And there's been a lot
of fun in monkey

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:01.840
neurophysiology stuff.

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:05.840
There's a so-called Jennifer
Aniston cell, where

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:07.740
researchers have discovered
neurons, in monkeys, that seem

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:10.280
to respond to Jennifer Aniston,
for whatever reason.

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:14.760
And other specific
famous people.

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:17.690
Although, not particularly
meaningful to the primates.

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:20.920
And of course, in human brain
imaging, you can do tasks that

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:23.045
emphasize what an object
is or where it is.

00:37:23.045 --> 00:37:25.505
And corresponding to the monkey
work, we see activation

00:37:25.505 --> 00:37:29.040
in this where pathway towards
the parietal cortex.

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.450
If you have to make a
spatial judgment,

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:32.030
where things are located.

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:34.760
Or this lower temporal
lobe, what pathway.

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:37.135
You have to make a judgment
about what object you're

00:37:37.135 --> 00:37:38.550
looking at.

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:41.880
So that lines up in intact
humans very much, with what we

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:46.410
see in primates with
invasive studies.

00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:49.710
So we're going to end today
by discussing two kinds of

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:54.480
lesions in humans and some
spectacular impairments in the

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.590
what or where pathways.

00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:58.360
So let me get you ready for
these films for a moment.

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:02.480
So one film you're going to see
is the patient who has a

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:05.950
great injury to the parts of
the brain in the parietal

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:09.490
cortex that serve our
where system.

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:12.470
So this is so-called Balint's
syndrome, in the Neurology.

00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:14.400
These are bilateral injuries.

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.910
That means on both sides
of the brain, in

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:17.780
the parietal region.

00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:19.830
They're pretty good at knowing
what something is, because the

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:22.570
temporal lobe pathway, the
what pathway, is intact.

00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:24.480
But they have problems in
knowing where things are,

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.930
reaching for things, where to
put their gaze, estimating

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:29.090
distances, and navigation,
in general.

00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:32.440
So I'll show you an example
of a patient like this.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:35.640
And then the converse, a patient
who has big problems

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:36.410
in the what system.

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:39.970
And we'll start with that.

00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:42.530
And I'll tell you just one last
bit of information to

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:43.100
think about.

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:45.140
That the what and where
distinction, sometimes, is not

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:48.940
as complete in every way
as you might imagine.

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:51.140
And so, sometimes people have
said, really, the where system

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:55.060
is better described as not
where things are, but the

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:58.770
information you need for
physical action in the world,

00:38:58.770 --> 00:38:59.830
which is very close to where.

00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:00.720
But it's a little
bit different.

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:04.280
And let me give you the kind
of what type of information

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:07.320
that the where system still
seems to have in it.

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:10.580
So here's a patient with
extensive damage in the what

00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:12.870
system, in the lower parts
of the brain and

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:14.580
posteriorly for vision.

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:17.300
Terrible perception of shapes
and orientation of shapes.

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:21.220
Very bad what ability.

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:24.300
And she was asked, then, to
reach with an envelope to a

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:27.790
slot at different
orientations.

00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:30.820
And what's striking is even
though if her hand was a

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:33.670
distance away-- so if she would
have to think, what is

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:35.260
the angle I would need
to approach it with--

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:36.320
she was terrible.

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:39.550
When she actually moved her hand
towards the slot, she was

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:40.910
surprisingly good.

00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:43.640
So let me show you
the feeling.

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:47.790
So if this patient would have
to put her hand so that this

00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:50.320
letter would fit into
this slot--

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:56.780
she was very poor at spatial
relations and knowing what

00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:57.650
things were--

00:39:57.650 --> 00:39:59.450
she couldn't line
them up at all.

00:39:59.450 --> 00:40:01.370
But now, they said, well, please
put your hand out and

00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:02.500
just stick it in.

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:05.977
And as her hand approaches it,
she changes orientations and

00:40:05.977 --> 00:40:07.280
is correct.

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:10.320
Because in order to do things,
like to grab something--

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:10.780
think about it.

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:13.760
When you grab something, like a
pencil or a cup, you need a

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.260
little bit of knowledge
to know what it is.

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:18.230
You wouldn't grab things
similarly, whether they could

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:21.320
spill easily or be pointy
or painful.

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:24.550
A little bit what information
helps you guide even something

00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:27.790
like a simple reaching, which
is a special task.

00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:29.640
So it's not so much, maybe,
that the where

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:32.050
system is only where.

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:34.600
But it has just enough
information to guide actions

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:37.780
in the world, which has a tiny
bit of information about what

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:39.600
things are that you're
jumping over.

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.240
If you're going to run into
something, is it likely to be

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:42.490
soft or hard.
