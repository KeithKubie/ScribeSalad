00:00:00.761 --> 00:00:04.147
- [Male Voiceover] This
UCSD-TV program is presented by

00:00:04.147 --> 00:00:06.585
University of California Television.

00:00:06.585 --> 00:00:07.950

00:00:22.658 --> 00:00:25.731
- [Male Voiceover] We are
the paradoxical (mumbles).

00:00:25.731 --> 00:00:27.029
Bipedal,

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.484
naked,

00:00:28.484 --> 00:00:29.651
large brained.

00:00:30.763 --> 00:00:34.988
Long the master of fire,
tools and language,

00:00:34.988 --> 00:00:38.405
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:39.353 --> 00:00:42.543
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:44.626
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.284
We grow up slowly.

00:00:48.284 --> 00:00:50.647
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:50.647 --> 00:00:52.730
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:54.102 --> 00:00:56.163
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:56.163 --> 00:00:58.330
understanding of the past.

00:00:59.842 --> 00:01:03.500
Carta brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.667
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here,

00:01:09.637 --> 00:01:11.538
an exploration made possible by

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:14.371
the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:30.031 --> 00:01:33.198
(intense piano music)

00:01:59.608 --> 00:02:02.852
- As humans, we often ponder
the pleasures of life.

00:02:02.852 --> 00:02:04.747
Things like good food,

00:02:04.747 --> 00:02:08.716
a drink with friends
after a long week of work,

00:02:08.716 --> 00:02:09.569
falling in love.

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.272
That's a great thing in life, right?

00:02:12.272 --> 00:02:13.888
Spending time with family.

00:02:13.888 --> 00:02:17.167
These are all undoubtedly great things

00:02:17.167 --> 00:02:20.027
that we enjoy in our lives.

00:02:20.027 --> 00:02:22.524
I'd also argue that sleep is one

00:02:22.524 --> 00:02:24.725
of those great things in our lives.

00:02:24.725 --> 00:02:28.627
There's nothing better than
sleep when you're truly tired

00:02:28.627 --> 00:02:32.172
and the feeling of climbing
into bed, pulling up the covers,

00:02:32.172 --> 00:02:36.217
putting your head down and
falling asleep is pure bliss.

00:02:36.217 --> 00:02:40.855
And we see this in cases of
extreme sleep deprivation.

00:02:40.855 --> 00:02:43.711
For example, here's a
picture of Peter Tripp.

00:02:43.711 --> 00:02:46.860
He was a DJ in New York in the 1950's.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.799
As a publicity and fundraising stunt,

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.254
he tried to stay awake
for as long as he could.

00:02:53.254 --> 00:02:56.013
He managed to stay awake
for over eight days,

00:02:56.013 --> 00:02:57.083
which is pretty remarkable.

00:02:57.083 --> 00:02:59.701
On the air the entire time.

00:02:59.701 --> 00:03:01.236
What's even more remarkable to me

00:03:01.236 --> 00:03:04.436
is that others came along
and actually beat his record.

00:03:04.436 --> 00:03:07.346
I can't imagine why anyone
would want to do this.

00:03:07.346 --> 00:03:09.707
But on a less extreme scale,

00:03:09.707 --> 00:03:11.392
I bet that most everyone in this room

00:03:11.392 --> 00:03:13.733
follows the same pattern that I do

00:03:13.733 --> 00:03:16.422
and that is we sleep too
little during the week

00:03:16.422 --> 00:03:20.228
and then we catch up on
sleep on the weekend.

00:03:20.228 --> 00:03:22.552
So I bring up these examples
to illustrate the love-hate

00:03:22.552 --> 00:03:25.520
relationship that we
seem to have with sleep.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.429
On the one hand, we love sleep

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:29.902
and people often say I love sleep,

00:03:29.902 --> 00:03:31.978
but on the other hand, we always have

00:03:31.978 --> 00:03:34.416
something better to do than sleep.

00:03:34.416 --> 00:03:35.833
Isn't that right?

00:03:37.432 --> 00:03:40.825
Sleep is seen as something
that we can do without

00:03:40.825 --> 00:03:43.339
or that we would like to do without

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:46.664
and certainly we cut
into it very commonly.

00:03:46.664 --> 00:03:48.663
So just like we hear
people say I love sleep,

00:03:48.663 --> 00:03:53.337
we also hear them say I wish I
could function on less sleep.

00:03:53.337 --> 00:03:56.443
Today, I want to present some findings

00:03:56.443 --> 00:03:59.007
from my lab over the last couple years

00:03:59.007 --> 00:04:01.654
that suggest that this
love-hate relationship

00:04:01.654 --> 00:04:04.245
is not a new phenomenon.

00:04:04.245 --> 00:04:07.842
It's not a new phenomenon
associated with television

00:04:07.842 --> 00:04:10.623
or social media or artificial lighting

00:04:10.623 --> 00:04:13.005
or all the other kinds of
evils you might think of

00:04:13.005 --> 00:04:16.755
if you're in sleep
medicine or sleep biology.

00:04:17.923 --> 00:04:21.741
Instead, our findings are
suggesting that natural selection

00:04:21.741 --> 00:04:25.377
has been whittling away
sleep along the human lineage

00:04:25.377 --> 00:04:28.217
probably for millions of years.

00:04:28.217 --> 00:04:30.407
We also think that this
might have implications

00:04:30.407 --> 00:04:33.612
for understanding some
aspects of human health.

00:04:33.612 --> 00:04:35.844
So I want to start with a
little bit of background.

00:04:35.844 --> 00:04:37.669
First of all, what is sleep?

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.415
Sleep is a reversible state of rest.

00:04:40.415 --> 00:04:42.187
So it's not like a comma.

00:04:42.187 --> 00:04:44.570
It can be easily reversed, sleep can.

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.158
It involves reduced awareness

00:04:46.158 --> 00:04:48.568
and responsiveness to surroundings.

00:04:48.568 --> 00:04:50.176
It involves a rebound effect.

00:04:50.176 --> 00:04:51.417
I just talked about that with our

00:04:51.417 --> 00:04:52.878
catch-up sleep that many of us are going

00:04:52.878 --> 00:04:55.829
to have tonight after
this long week of work

00:04:55.829 --> 00:04:57.270
and travel and everything else.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.349
You have to compensate for lost sleep.

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:02.466
And very importantly,
sleep is not one thing.

00:05:02.466 --> 00:05:05.624
It's actually two different things.

00:05:05.624 --> 00:05:06.457
When you're not awake,

00:05:06.457 --> 00:05:08.993
you're actually in two different states.

00:05:08.993 --> 00:05:12.456
You're in non-REM sleep or in REM sleep,

00:05:12.456 --> 00:05:14.701
rapid eye movement sleep.

00:05:14.701 --> 00:05:15.607
REM sleep is, of course,

00:05:15.607 --> 00:05:18.690
when the most visual dreaming occurs.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.506
A sleep biologist can differentiate

00:05:21.506 --> 00:05:24.790
these two stages based on EEG.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.567
Now I want to just walk
you through what would

00:05:26.567 --> 00:05:31.279
be considered an ideal
or normal night's sleep.

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:32.955
This is showing an eight hour time period

00:05:32.955 --> 00:05:36.167
from about 11 p.m.
until roughly seven a.m.

00:05:36.167 --> 00:05:39.914
So an eight hour block
of consolidated sleep.

00:05:39.914 --> 00:05:43.487
Ideally you would follow into the deeper

00:05:43.487 --> 00:05:45.987
stages of non-REM sleep first.

00:05:46.965 --> 00:05:49.681
You'd spend some time in
non-REM sleep and then you'd

00:05:49.681 --> 00:05:53.134
actually arouse out of
non-REM and go into REM.

00:05:53.134 --> 00:05:54.169
It's a different stage.

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:57.148
It's not just a deeper
stage of non-REM sleep.

00:05:57.148 --> 00:05:59.768
That cycle then continues
throughout the night.

00:05:59.768 --> 00:06:02.962
You go in a second bout
now of non-REM sleep

00:06:02.962 --> 00:06:07.797
into deep slow wave sleep and
you come out into REM sleep.

00:06:07.797 --> 00:06:09.524
Now periodically throughout the night,

00:06:09.524 --> 00:06:11.739
you would also awaken.

00:06:11.739 --> 00:06:14.326
I want to really focus
on one question today.

00:06:14.326 --> 00:06:16.791
How does human sleep differ from

00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:19.325
the sleep we see in other primates?

00:06:19.325 --> 00:06:21.577
I want to be a little bit more provocative

00:06:21.577 --> 00:06:24.902
and ask are humans evolutionary outliers

00:06:24.902 --> 00:06:27.248
in terms of the kinds
of sleep that we have.

00:06:27.248 --> 00:06:29.857
In terms of the
characteristics of our sleep.

00:06:29.857 --> 00:06:32.267
And so, of course, we think
in evolutionary anthropology

00:06:32.267 --> 00:06:35.006
a lot about how humans are
different from other primates.

00:06:35.006 --> 00:06:38.038
Often those are questions
about discrete traits,

00:06:38.038 --> 00:06:39.700
qualitative traits.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.809
Bipedalism, how we use tools
or whether we use tools

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:44.475
or whether we have a theory of mind.

00:06:44.475 --> 00:06:47.409
Here, I'm interested in
a quantitative trait.

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:49.826
The characteristics of sleep.

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:52.354
And so I need to first define what

00:06:52.354 --> 00:06:54.597
I mean by an evolutionary outlier.

00:06:54.597 --> 00:06:57.940
This is a trait that's more
extreme than one would predict

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.704
based on the modeling of trait evolution

00:07:00.704 --> 00:07:03.407
on a phylogeny, on an evolutionary tree.

00:07:03.407 --> 00:07:06.932
So based on what we know about
the various socio-ecological

00:07:06.932 --> 00:07:10.094
factors that influence
sleep in primates as well as

00:07:10.094 --> 00:07:13.117
the phylogeny and where
we fall on that phylogeny,

00:07:13.117 --> 00:07:16.628
we can predict sleep
characteristics in humans.

00:07:16.628 --> 00:07:18.955
So for example, we know
that predation risk

00:07:18.955 --> 00:07:22.968
across mammals will tend
to reduce sleep times.

00:07:22.968 --> 00:07:25.718
If animals do not have
a safe place to sleep,

00:07:25.718 --> 00:07:27.180
they sleep less.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.145
And so we can use that
knowledge across mammals

00:07:29.145 --> 00:07:32.572
to actually predict what
human sleep would look like.

00:07:32.572 --> 00:07:34.648
And then, of course, once
we have a good prediction

00:07:34.648 --> 00:07:36.752
and some confidence intervals on it,

00:07:36.752 --> 00:07:38.567
we can ask where does our observed value

00:07:38.567 --> 00:07:42.255
of human sleep fall compared
to what is predicted.

00:07:42.255 --> 00:07:43.871
And if it falls outside that distribution,

00:07:43.871 --> 00:07:44.880
we would be an outlier.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.765
We're different from what
you would predict based

00:07:46.765 --> 00:07:49.705
on what's known about
sleep in other primates.

00:07:49.705 --> 00:07:52.770
And so we use a method that's
been developed in my lab

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:55.249
called phylogenetic
prediction where we use

00:07:55.249 --> 00:07:58.175
a statistical model in
phylogeny to predict a phenotype

00:07:58.175 --> 00:08:01.303
in a particular species,
in this case humans.

00:08:01.303 --> 00:08:05.060
We basically have a bunch
of different variables

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.950
that can go into this and
we estimate these parameters

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:12.099
in the model, and we also
incorporate evolutionary history.

00:08:12.099 --> 00:08:13.258
We implement this.

00:08:13.258 --> 00:08:15.518
We make estimates of this model using

00:08:15.518 --> 00:08:18.536
a Bayesian approach that
produces a posterior

00:08:18.536 --> 00:08:21.936
probability distribution of predictions.

00:08:21.936 --> 00:08:25.474
So this is what you might
see in this kind of a case.

00:08:25.474 --> 00:08:29.180
We use this approach and
we come up with a posterior

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:33.346
probability distribution of
predictions as you see here.

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:36.523
Then the question, of course,
is where do humans fall?

00:08:36.523 --> 00:08:38.863
Are we above this distribution?

00:08:38.863 --> 00:08:41.747
Is our observed sleep time
above this distribution?

00:08:41.747 --> 00:08:44.096
We would be a positive outlier.

00:08:44.096 --> 00:08:46.186
Or we could be a negative outlier,

00:08:46.186 --> 00:08:48.401
the observed value falls
below this distribution.

00:08:48.401 --> 00:08:50.678
Or we can be about what you would expect

00:08:50.678 --> 00:08:53.364
if we were a typical primate.

00:08:53.364 --> 00:08:55.498
So the critical question in all of this,

00:08:55.498 --> 00:08:59.604
of course, is what value do
we put on this distribution?

00:08:59.604 --> 00:09:02.522
So what is the duration of human sleep?

00:09:02.522 --> 00:09:04.212
What would be a good estimate

00:09:04.212 --> 00:09:07.068
of the duration of human sleep?

00:09:07.068 --> 00:09:09.986
Well, here I'm gonna use
a value of seven hours

00:09:09.986 --> 00:09:12.526
and I think that's a fairly
conservative estimate

00:09:12.526 --> 00:09:14.950
based on several different
lines of evidence.

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:17.374
Some of this evidence is
from our own work studying

00:09:17.374 --> 00:09:19.854
a traditional population agriculturalist

00:09:19.854 --> 00:09:21.437
who live in Madagascar and they're

00:09:21.437 --> 00:09:24.120
a population without
access to electricity.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.363
And in this population,
I'll talk about this

00:09:26.363 --> 00:09:28.048
in a little bit later in my talk,

00:09:28.048 --> 00:09:29.637
we find that people sleep on average

00:09:29.637 --> 00:09:31.559
six and a half hours a night.

00:09:31.559 --> 00:09:34.401
We've also studied the
Hadza hunter-gatherers

00:09:34.401 --> 00:09:36.111
and there we find that the average

00:09:36.111 --> 00:09:39.520
sleep time is 6.2 hours per night.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.153
Likewise, a recent study
of 300 gatherer groups

00:09:42.153 --> 00:09:44.828
found that the average sleep time across

00:09:44.828 --> 00:09:46.961
those three groups was 6.5 hours.

00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:48.163
Pretty short.

00:09:48.163 --> 00:09:49.682
These guys don't have TV, right?

00:09:49.682 --> 00:09:51.299
They don't have all the
things that we have,

00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:53.710
the social media and all
the artificial lighting,

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:56.812
and they're actually
sleeping a little bit less.

00:09:56.812 --> 00:09:58.176
Another study of a non-electric

00:09:58.176 --> 00:10:00.070
population also gives seven hours.

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:02.247
Or we can look at Western populations

00:10:02.247 --> 00:10:06.399
and it's about seven hours
in a recent meta-analysis.

00:10:06.399 --> 00:10:08.001
And so we think that
this is a conservative

00:10:08.001 --> 00:10:11.428
estimate of typical human sleep.

00:10:11.428 --> 00:10:12.598
Seven hours.

00:10:12.598 --> 00:10:15.148
OK, so here's a picture of a Hadza man

00:10:15.148 --> 00:10:19.231
sleeping with his fire,
some weapons next to him,

00:10:20.735 --> 00:10:23.105
and on the ground which is different

00:10:23.105 --> 00:10:24.781
from most other primates.

00:10:24.781 --> 00:10:27.191
And I just want to share
with you the three things

00:10:27.191 --> 00:10:29.740
that we found from our analysis.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.527
First of all, humans sleep
less than would be predicted,

00:10:32.527 --> 00:10:34.227
so we're a negative outlier,

00:10:34.227 --> 00:10:37.557
we spend a greater proportion
of time in REM sleep,

00:10:37.557 --> 00:10:39.229
that rapid eye movement sleep,

00:10:39.229 --> 00:10:43.118
and we are very flexible in our sleep.

00:10:43.118 --> 00:10:46.283
More flexible than would be predicted.

00:10:46.283 --> 00:10:48.322
All right, so let me walk
you through the evidence

00:10:48.322 --> 00:10:50.022
for each of these three points.

00:10:50.022 --> 00:10:51.513
First of all, here's the distribution

00:10:51.513 --> 00:10:54.856
of sleep times for primates
where we have data.

00:10:54.856 --> 00:10:56.737
We have a pretty good number of species

00:10:56.737 --> 00:11:00.025
now studied for their sleep
and what you see is that

00:11:00.025 --> 00:11:04.250
humans are the shortest
sleeping of all the primates.

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:07.153
Now, again, we want to
control for phylogeny

00:11:07.153 --> 00:11:09.428
and for these other ecological variables,

00:11:09.428 --> 00:11:11.571
and so we've used this
phylogenetic prediction

00:11:11.571 --> 00:11:13.309
approach that I talked about.

00:11:13.309 --> 00:11:15.399
Here's our equation that we're using

00:11:15.399 --> 00:11:17.656
to predict sleep duration in humans.

00:11:17.656 --> 00:11:19.607
And here's our posterior probability

00:11:19.607 --> 00:11:21.780
distribution of those predictions.

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.452
And what you can see is that the observed

00:11:23.452 --> 00:11:26.726
value falls below this distribution.

00:11:26.726 --> 00:11:28.258
We are a negative outlier.

00:11:28.258 --> 00:11:30.529
In fact, the mean predicted sleep duration

00:11:30.529 --> 00:11:34.355
for humans is 10.3
hours from this analysis

00:11:34.355 --> 00:11:36.687
and we're clearly different from that.

00:11:36.687 --> 00:11:39.725
Here's the second result
involving REM sleep.

00:11:39.725 --> 00:11:41.968
Humans, again, have the highest percentage

00:11:41.968 --> 00:11:44.169
of REM sleep of all the primates.

00:11:44.169 --> 00:11:46.941
Now, again, we wanted to
use this outlier approach,

00:11:46.941 --> 00:11:49.184
this phylogenetic prediction approach,

00:11:49.184 --> 00:11:53.113
and so, again, here's our
equation relating REM sleep

00:11:53.113 --> 00:11:57.028
to activity period, body
mass, brain size, diet,

00:11:57.028 --> 00:11:59.564
interbirth interval,
group size, and phylogeny.

00:11:59.564 --> 00:12:01.960
And you can see the posterior
distribution in this case

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.966
and here's the observed value.

00:12:03.966 --> 00:12:06.993
So here, we're a positive outlier.

00:12:06.993 --> 00:12:09.649
And we know that this is
achieved via higher than expected

00:12:09.649 --> 00:12:12.674
REM sleep, so if we just look
at the total amount of REM,

00:12:12.674 --> 00:12:14.541
we're looking here at
the percentage of REM,

00:12:14.541 --> 00:12:17.424
at the total REM we have
higher than expected REM

00:12:17.424 --> 00:12:20.058
and less than expected non-REM.

00:12:20.058 --> 00:12:21.883
It looks like both of these are shifted.

00:12:21.883 --> 00:12:25.463
OK then, the final set of
results I want to share with you

00:12:25.463 --> 00:12:30.018
involves a hypothesis that
we came up with based on

00:12:30.018 --> 00:12:33.800
the ethnographic literature,
based on experimental studies,

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.835
and based on the historical record,

00:12:35.835 --> 00:12:38.565
and that is that natural
human sleep is more

00:12:38.565 --> 00:12:41.777
flexible than we usually appreciate.

00:12:41.777 --> 00:12:43.155
And so let me just walk you through some

00:12:43.155 --> 00:12:46.226
of the findings that
were already out there

00:12:46.226 --> 00:12:48.896
before we came into this sphere.

00:12:48.896 --> 00:12:52.323
Here's an example from the
ethnographic literature,

00:12:52.323 --> 00:12:55.373
work by Dan Everett on
the Piraha South American

00:12:55.373 --> 00:12:58.709
hunter-gathers were reports
that the Piraha take naps,

00:12:58.709 --> 00:13:01.356
15 minutes to two hours at the extreme

00:13:01.356 --> 00:13:02.889
during the day and night.

00:13:02.889 --> 00:13:06.344
There's loud talking in
the village all night long.

00:13:06.344 --> 00:13:08.671
Consequently, it's very
difficult for outsiders

00:13:08.671 --> 00:13:11.076
to sleep well among the Piraha.

00:13:11.076 --> 00:13:15.209
In a more, sort of a review
article of all of this

00:13:15.209 --> 00:13:18.016
ethnographic literature on sleep patterns,

00:13:18.016 --> 00:13:20.113
Carol Worthman notes that
human nights are filled

00:13:20.113 --> 00:13:23.471
with activity and significance
and nowhere do people

00:13:23.471 --> 00:13:26.787
typically sleep from evening until dawn.

00:13:26.787 --> 00:13:28.459
In terms of the historical records,

00:13:28.459 --> 00:13:31.305
some of you might be familiar
with Roger Ekirch's work

00:13:31.305 --> 00:13:33.863
in which he looked through
the historical record

00:13:33.863 --> 00:13:36.424
in multiple cultures in Europe over

00:13:36.424 --> 00:13:38.728
the past couple of thousand years

00:13:38.728 --> 00:13:42.145
and found evidence in much of the written

00:13:43.086 --> 00:13:47.276
record there for references
to a first sleep and a second

00:13:47.276 --> 00:13:51.818
sleep with a period of
nighttime activity in between.

00:13:51.818 --> 00:13:53.565
So he found evidence for what would

00:13:53.565 --> 00:13:55.455
be called segmented sleep.

00:13:55.455 --> 00:13:57.044
And likewise, in experimental studies,

00:13:57.044 --> 00:13:58.837
for example, Tom Wehr's studies,

00:13:58.837 --> 00:14:02.320
when he put humans into
a long night condition,

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.479
so a 14 hour condition where people were

00:14:04.479 --> 00:14:06.626
not allowed to have access to lighting,

00:14:06.626 --> 00:14:09.923
they shifted into a
biphasic sleep condition.

00:14:09.923 --> 00:14:11.259
So again, segmented sleep.

00:14:11.259 --> 00:14:14.606
Of course, other primates
also show nighttime activity,

00:14:14.606 --> 00:14:17.730
but my colleagues and I in my lab

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:19.264
have hypothesized that humans are

00:14:19.264 --> 00:14:22.390
more extreme than other primates.

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:24.324
Well, unfortunately, we don't
have data on other primates,

00:14:24.324 --> 00:14:28.157
but we can look at how
flexible sleep is among

00:14:29.117 --> 00:14:31.611
people living in traditional populations.

00:14:31.611 --> 00:14:34.506
So as I mentioned, we've
been doing work in the Hadza.

00:14:34.506 --> 00:14:37.733
This is work led by a postdoc
in my lab, David Samson.

00:14:37.733 --> 00:14:39.257
We've been doing work in the Hadza

00:14:39.257 --> 00:14:41.918
using actigraphy devices
that are just watches

00:14:41.918 --> 00:14:44.509
basically that measure activity levels.

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:45.823
And from that with algorithms,

00:14:45.823 --> 00:14:48.619
we can make inferences about sleep.

00:14:48.619 --> 00:14:51.470
And also, in the Malagasy population,

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:53.574
the agriculturalists, we've
been using actigraphy,

00:14:53.574 --> 00:14:54.992
but also EEG.

00:14:54.992 --> 00:14:58.604
So we actually have the gold
standard measure of sleep

00:14:58.604 --> 00:15:00.805
in one of these two populations.

00:15:00.805 --> 00:15:01.752
And I just want to share with you

00:15:01.752 --> 00:15:03.401
some of the things that we find.

00:15:03.401 --> 00:15:07.942
This is a big table, but let
me focus on two elements in it.

00:15:07.942 --> 00:15:11.302
This is total sleep duration
in the Madagascar population.

00:15:11.302 --> 00:15:14.008
6.5 hours as I mentioned previously

00:15:14.008 --> 00:15:16.860
compared to seven in a
typical Western population,

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:19.766
in this case in the USA,
using the same techniques.

00:15:19.766 --> 00:15:22.831
Likewise, the sleep fragmentation metrics

00:15:22.831 --> 00:15:27.011
are much higher in the Malagasy population

00:15:27.011 --> 00:15:29.449
and sleep efficiency is much lower.

00:15:29.449 --> 00:15:32.573
So they're up a lot more during the night.

00:15:32.573 --> 00:15:35.881
Likewise, we found some
evidence for segmented sleep.

00:15:35.881 --> 00:15:38.750
The same kind of segmented
sleep that Roger Ekirch

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:42.048
has documented in European
historical record.

00:15:42.048 --> 00:15:45.482
So this is showing a
functional linear modeling,

00:15:45.482 --> 00:15:49.673
the circadian patterns among
the individuals in our sample.

00:15:49.673 --> 00:15:53.741
And this is the nighttime
hours in this population.

00:15:53.741 --> 00:15:57.805
And what we find is a
significant bump up in activity,

00:15:57.805 --> 00:16:00.780
especially in men, just after midnight

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:03.023
for a substantial amount of time, in fact.

00:16:03.023 --> 00:16:04.899
And this is at the time
when there's over 12 hours

00:16:04.899 --> 00:16:08.072
of darkness in this population.

00:16:08.072 --> 00:16:09.620
So their winter.

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:12.266
In as well, we find in
the Hadza hunter-gatherers

00:16:12.266 --> 00:16:15.616
that once they go to sleep,
there can often be long

00:16:15.616 --> 00:16:19.441
periods of wakefulness
and quite fragmented sleep

00:16:19.441 --> 00:16:21.976
as you can see from some of these plots

00:16:21.976 --> 00:16:24.874
where the dark lines are
indicating sleep time

00:16:24.874 --> 00:16:27.521
with the first one being
the inferred sleep onset

00:16:27.521 --> 00:16:30.819
and then lots of activity at night.

00:16:30.819 --> 00:16:33.273
OK, so I want to wrap
up with three questions,

00:16:33.273 --> 00:16:35.624
very quickly go through three questions.

00:16:35.624 --> 00:16:37.978
First of all, why are
humans such short sleepers?

00:16:37.978 --> 00:16:39.483
What is going on with this?

00:16:39.483 --> 00:16:42.086
Based on this, should we
be short sleepers today?

00:16:42.086 --> 00:16:43.861
Is this giving us some
reason to think that

00:16:43.861 --> 00:16:45.873
maybe we don't need all of this sleep?

00:16:45.873 --> 00:16:47.253
And then finally, does the evolution

00:16:47.253 --> 00:16:50.454
of short sleep potentially affect health?

00:16:50.454 --> 00:16:52.886
OK, so why are humans such short sleepers?

00:16:52.886 --> 00:16:56.526
Our answer to that is
that, just like today,

00:16:56.526 --> 00:16:57.902
throughout human evolution,

00:16:57.902 --> 00:17:02.812
our ancestors have had better
things to do than sleep.

00:17:02.812 --> 00:17:04.427
Some of the potential selective forces

00:17:04.427 --> 00:17:06.364
that might be at play
to shorten sleep along

00:17:06.364 --> 00:17:10.442
our lineage is that we
sleep on the ground.

00:17:10.442 --> 00:17:13.267
We know from other
species, other primates,

00:17:13.267 --> 00:17:15.425
there's great predation
risk on the ground.

00:17:15.425 --> 00:17:18.463
If you are experiencing
greater predation risk,

00:17:18.463 --> 00:17:20.696
that should select for less sleep.

00:17:20.696 --> 00:17:24.054
As well, being on the ground
may expose individuals

00:17:24.054 --> 00:17:26.659
to greater inter and intragroup conflict

00:17:26.659 --> 00:17:28.686
where it would be easier
for a conspecific,

00:17:28.686 --> 00:17:30.707
another member of Homo sapiens,

00:17:30.707 --> 00:17:34.942
to attack at night because
of this terrestrial sleep.

00:17:34.942 --> 00:17:38.495
But as well, sleep comes
with opportunity costs

00:17:38.495 --> 00:17:40.989
and one of those involves
social interaction.

00:17:40.989 --> 00:17:42.611
When you're sleeping,
you're not socializing

00:17:42.611 --> 00:17:45.511
and we know how important
socializing is for humans.

00:17:45.511 --> 00:17:47.763
And in particular, it's
important in the context

00:17:47.763 --> 00:17:52.516
of social learning from
the awake time to acquire

00:17:52.516 --> 00:17:55.484
and transmit new skills and knowledge.

00:17:55.484 --> 00:17:58.041
So we think that many of the
things that have made humans

00:17:58.041 --> 00:18:01.624
so successful have also
favored less sleep.

00:18:02.557 --> 00:18:04.998
Now as well, the higher
percentage of REM sleep

00:18:04.998 --> 00:18:08.900
may relate to this last
issue because it's thought

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:10.911
that REM sleep also plays a role in

00:18:10.911 --> 00:18:13.680
consolidation of memories
and simulating various

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.023
kinds of threats and problem solving.

00:18:17.023 --> 00:18:21.051
So do these results suggest
that we should sleep less?

00:18:21.051 --> 00:18:25.469
Should we be considering a
Paleo-sleep plan of some kind?

00:18:25.469 --> 00:18:28.158
I think our findings and
those of others are suggesting

00:18:28.158 --> 00:18:31.920
that a Paleo-sleep plan
would involve very short

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:36.370
and fragmented sleep, very
brutish in another way.

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:38.277
And I think we can turn
to evolutionary medicine

00:18:38.277 --> 00:18:40.368
to help us think about this issue.

00:18:40.368 --> 00:18:43.192
A central tenant of evolutionary
medicine as we've heard

00:18:43.192 --> 00:18:45.979
in the previous talks is that
natural selection operates

00:18:45.979 --> 00:18:49.058
on reproductive success, not on health.

00:18:49.058 --> 00:18:51.106
In fact, short, fragmented sleep

00:18:51.106 --> 00:18:53.767
is associated with many
poor health outcomes.

00:18:53.767 --> 00:18:55.829
Those include cardiovascular disease,

00:18:55.829 --> 00:18:58.067
higher rates of cardiovascular disease,

00:18:58.067 --> 00:19:00.133
metabolic dysfunction of various sorts

00:19:00.133 --> 00:19:04.003
involving diabetes, for
example, and cancer.

00:19:04.003 --> 00:19:06.388
So there are serious problems with

00:19:06.388 --> 00:19:08.867
having a short, fragmented sleep.

00:19:08.867 --> 00:19:12.044
Yet, many of these problems
would actually occur likely

00:19:12.044 --> 00:19:15.360
later in life, post-reproduction
and the selection shadow.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:19.020
And so perhaps we need
to think about whether

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:20.981
reproductive success is more relevant

00:19:20.981 --> 00:19:24.216
to us today or health and longevity.

00:19:24.216 --> 00:19:26.250
If reproductive success is important,

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:28.674
maybe a Paleo-sleep plan is a good one.

00:19:28.674 --> 00:19:30.371
But I bet that most people in this room

00:19:30.371 --> 00:19:33.565
are more concerned about
health and longevity,

00:19:33.565 --> 00:19:35.975
in which case this is
a probably a bad idea.

00:19:35.975 --> 00:19:37.661
And in fact, I would suggest that humans

00:19:37.661 --> 00:19:40.057
today are having the best sleep that we've

00:19:40.057 --> 00:19:43.678
ever had in our evolutionary history.

00:19:43.678 --> 00:19:45.950
So you can imagine that this gentleman's

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:48.159
having a much better sleep on average than

00:19:48.159 --> 00:19:51.517
this individual is going to have tonight.

00:19:51.517 --> 00:19:53.077
And there are many reasons to enjoy this.

00:19:53.077 --> 00:19:55.232
For those health benefits I just mentioned

00:19:55.232 --> 00:19:58.544
as well as for better cognitive function,

00:19:58.544 --> 00:20:01.149
better immune function, et cetera.

00:20:01.149 --> 00:20:02.651
Does evolution help us understand

00:20:02.651 --> 00:20:03.965
modern sleep and sleep disorders?

00:20:03.965 --> 00:20:06.548
Of course, many people
do not get to experience

00:20:06.548 --> 00:20:10.891
this kind of nice, relaxing
sleep, consolidated sleep.

00:20:10.891 --> 00:20:12.508
For example, many people, about 10% of

00:20:12.508 --> 00:20:15.899
the U.S. population has
some kind of insomnia.

00:20:15.899 --> 00:20:17.785
Based on our findings,
I guess one question

00:20:17.785 --> 00:20:20.237
that arises is should we
really expect to sleep

00:20:20.237 --> 00:20:21.964
through the night, every night?

00:20:21.964 --> 00:20:23.114
That doesn't look like it's really been

00:20:23.114 --> 00:20:25.397
a part of our evolutionary history.

00:20:25.397 --> 00:20:29.207
That seems to be a modern
phenomenon that we strive for.

00:20:29.207 --> 00:20:32.225
And so perhaps
middle-of-the-night insomnia

00:20:32.225 --> 00:20:35.748
is not so unexpected, especially
for those of us that may

00:20:35.748 --> 00:20:40.541
have ancestors who had that
kind of segmented sleep pattern.

00:20:40.541 --> 00:20:43.075
As well, you can imagine that individuals

00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:45.717
who experience threats
of various kinds would

00:20:45.717 --> 00:20:48.116
have an adaptive response to not sleep.

00:20:48.116 --> 00:20:50.660
And, of course, in modern society many

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:53.739
people do experience these threats.

00:20:53.739 --> 00:20:56.749
People living in inner city
environment, for example,

00:20:56.749 --> 00:20:58.956
or people is a relationship where

00:20:58.956 --> 00:21:01.076
there might be domestic violence,

00:21:01.076 --> 00:21:04.710
as well there're societal
threats such as racism.

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:07.685
Many people are now showing
that these kind of threats

00:21:07.685 --> 00:21:10.848
affect people's sleep
leading to sleep disparities,

00:21:10.848 --> 00:21:12.531
and they're even linking
that up to some of

00:21:12.531 --> 00:21:15.121
the other health
disparities that are known,

00:21:15.121 --> 00:21:18.490
for example, among different
racial groups in the U.S.

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:20.183
And so finally, does the evolution of

00:21:20.183 --> 00:21:22.872
short sleep help us to understand disease?

00:21:22.872 --> 00:21:24.878
Is there a case of that?

00:21:24.878 --> 00:21:28.967
Recently, Randy Nesse,
Tuck Finch, and I proposed

00:21:28.967 --> 00:21:32.251
that this may help us
understand Alzheimer's disease

00:21:32.251 --> 00:21:34.779
which is thought to be
a uniquely human disease

00:21:34.779 --> 00:21:37.745
as we heard previously in Ajit's talk.

00:21:37.745 --> 00:21:41.403
And our idea relates to
the glymphatic system.

00:21:41.403 --> 00:21:43.051
This is system of the brain that's only

00:21:43.051 --> 00:21:45.522
recently been discovered
in the last several years.

00:21:45.522 --> 00:21:47.908
It's an amazing set of discoveries.

00:21:47.908 --> 00:21:50.455
This glymphatic system
is involved in removing

00:21:50.455 --> 00:21:53.758
metabolic byproducts,
including amyloid beta,

00:21:53.758 --> 00:21:56.168
which is involved, of course, as you know,

00:21:56.168 --> 00:21:58.383
in Alzheimer's disease.

00:21:58.383 --> 00:22:00.780
And so a lot's being
learned about this system

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:02.911
of how the cerebral spinal fluid moves

00:22:02.911 --> 00:22:05.949
through the brain and
picks up various kinds

00:22:05.949 --> 00:22:09.974
of pollutants in the brain
and carries them away.

00:22:09.974 --> 00:22:13.095
And most importantly for our hypothesis

00:22:13.095 --> 00:22:17.289
is that this system functions
most effectively during sleep.

00:22:17.289 --> 00:22:20.121
So we're proposing that
this is one trade-off,

00:22:20.121 --> 00:22:23.331
they're probably others,
of evolution acting

00:22:23.331 --> 00:22:26.824
to reduce sleep along the human lineage.

00:22:26.824 --> 00:22:30.398
So I hope I've convinced
you that this evolutionary

00:22:30.398 --> 00:22:32.614
perspective is useful for
understanding this love-hate

00:22:32.614 --> 00:22:35.316
relationship that we have with sleep.

00:22:35.316 --> 00:22:37.455
I want to thank you all for staying awake.

00:22:37.455 --> 00:22:38.533
I didn't see anyone sleeping.

00:22:38.533 --> 00:22:39.366
Thank you.

00:22:40.442 --> 00:22:42.950
And I want to especially thank my

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:45.615
collaborator in a lot
of this, David Samson.
