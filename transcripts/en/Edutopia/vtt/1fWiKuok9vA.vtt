00:00:08.046 --> 00:00:13.816
&gt;&gt;Today we're going to start our
study of nuclear weapons and atoms

00:00:13.816 --> 00:00:17.826
and chemistry by giving a
little context to why some

00:00:17.826 --> 00:00:22.016
of this science-y stuff is
important to study about.

00:00:22.016 --> 00:00:24.686
&gt;&gt;Narrator: A bold experiment
in education is under way

00:00:24.686 --> 00:00:28.636
at ASCEND School in the Fruitvale
neighborhood of Oakland, California.

00:00:28.636 --> 00:00:36.336
&gt;&gt;So, I'd like you to write down
your feelings and facts that you have

00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:40.316
as you look at each of these photos.

00:00:40.316 --> 00:00:42.866
&gt;&gt;Hae-Sin: Quality education is
a curriculum that pushes kids.

00:00:43.496 --> 00:00:44.906
It's not making them feel safe

00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:47.416
or comfortable all the
time or successful.

00:00:47.416 --> 00:00:49.186
It's supposed to be frustrating.

00:00:49.186 --> 00:00:50.636
It's supposed to make
kids really think.

00:00:50.636 --> 00:00:52.776
It's supposed to push them
out of their comfort zone,

00:00:52.776 --> 00:00:55.616
give them new experiences,
ask questions,

00:00:55.756 --> 00:00:57.526
find answers to their questions.

00:00:57.526 --> 00:00:59.586
Understand that, like,
life is not an answer.

00:00:59.586 --> 00:01:00.446
Life is a question.

00:01:00.446 --> 00:01:05.416
&gt;&gt;I think that some people would say

00:01:05.416 --> 00:01:07.556
that seventh-graders shouldn't
be looking at these images

00:01:07.556 --> 00:01:11.636
and that they're too young,
and I don't agree with that.

00:01:11.796 --> 00:01:13.466
I think that you look
at the video games

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:16.906
that our third-graders are playing
and they're just as graphic.

00:01:17.336 --> 00:01:20.886
The first day that I was here,
one of my brand-new students came

00:01:20.886 --> 00:01:22.396
in to me during lunch time,
and he was like, "Keiko,

00:01:22.396 --> 00:01:23.756
have you ever seen
anybody get killed?"

00:01:24.916 --> 00:01:28.926
And I said, "Well, in fact, I have
seen somebody, you know, get shot."

00:01:29.386 --> 00:01:31.966
And he's like, "Yeah, I've
seen 11 people get shot,"

00:01:32.526 --> 00:01:35.936
and so our kids are really dealing

00:01:36.396 --> 00:01:40.506
with some very heavy
issues in their lives.

00:01:41.126 --> 00:01:43.966
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Heavy issues
like violence, overcrowding,

00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:47.786
low test scores and low
expectations led parents

00:01:47.786 --> 00:01:49.306
in this East Oakland community

00:01:49.306 --> 00:01:52.686
to demand something
better for their kids.

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:56.096
&gt;&gt;This about the child's future,
and we the parents need to learn

00:01:56.096 --> 00:01:59.946
that we can make a difference just
by getting involved at the school,

00:02:00.046 --> 00:02:02.716
so I think that's so important
for parents to understand

00:02:02.716 --> 00:02:05.166
that we're not going to let
other people decide for our kids.

00:02:06.996 --> 00:02:09.396
&gt;&gt;Narrator: With help from the
nonprofit Oakland community

00:02:09.396 --> 00:02:12.736
organizations, a group of
parents lobbied the school board

00:02:12.736 --> 00:02:15.346
to create a new
K-through-eighth-grade school

00:02:15.496 --> 00:02:16.776
for 200 students.

00:02:17.656 --> 00:02:21.376
One of five new schools to
open in the fall of 2001,

00:02:21.376 --> 00:02:25.546
ASCEND stands for A School
Cultivating Excellence

00:02:25.856 --> 00:02:27.066
Nurturing Diversity.

00:02:28.246 --> 00:02:31.726
&gt;&gt;Hae-Sin: We're actually out to
reform the public school system,

00:02:31.886 --> 00:02:35.826
and I think that we've definitely
taken a step in the right direction.

00:02:36.466 --> 00:02:39.206
&gt;&gt;One key to the reformation
effort is the concept

00:02:39.206 --> 00:02:43.246
of expeditionary learning, a teaching
method that encourages students

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:45.536
to dig deeply into a single subject.

00:02:45.536 --> 00:02:48.436
&gt;&gt;So that's not absolutely
set in stone.

00:02:49.296 --> 00:02:51.886
&gt;&gt;Twice a year, students work
with their teachers to come

00:02:51.886 --> 00:02:55.066
up with a question or area of
inquiry that they will pursue

00:02:55.066 --> 00:02:56.426
for the next several months.

00:02:56.796 --> 00:02:59.896
They integrate math, science
and English studies and,

00:02:59.896 --> 00:03:03.476
with the help of local artists,
express themselves in artwork,

00:03:03.946 --> 00:03:08.226
dance, video, drama and music.

00:03:08.226 --> 00:03:08.606
[ girl singing ]

00:03:08.606 --> 00:03:16.006
The process of deep inquiry into
a single subject is the same,

00:03:16.046 --> 00:03:18.466
whether it's seventh-graders
studying the war

00:03:18.876 --> 00:03:21.286
or first-graders focusing on frogs.

00:03:21.356 --> 00:03:25.186
&gt;&gt;That green dot is
called a spiracle.

00:03:25.916 --> 00:03:29.056
&gt;&gt;If you study something really
deeply, you become very invested

00:03:29.056 --> 00:03:31.796
in it, so what you're seeing, even
with the frogs in the first grade,

00:03:31.856 --> 00:03:33.466
is tremendous investment.

00:03:33.856 --> 00:03:36.276
Kids really, really care about frogs.

00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:39.426
It wouldn't have been as deep if
they'd studied frogs for two days

00:03:39.426 --> 00:03:40.416
and lizards for two days.

00:03:41.236 --> 00:03:45.356
&gt;&gt;It's just a frog that we made
that sticks out its tongue.

00:03:46.026 --> 00:03:51.476
A lot of people wanted a
tongue, but they didn't have

00:03:51.556 --> 00:03:56.976
to get a tongue, but I did.

00:03:57.066 --> 00:04:00.576
&gt;&gt;For their science class, ASCEND's
seventh-graders explored the impact

00:04:00.576 --> 00:04:01.236
of AIDS.

00:04:01.536 --> 00:04:02.936
&gt;&gt;Can you believe this arrogance?

00:04:03.196 --> 00:04:04.806
They think they can stop us.

00:04:04.806 --> 00:04:06.376
Nothing can stop us

00:04:06.376 --> 00:04:06.471
[ cheers ]

00:04:06.471 --> 00:04:06.566
.

00:04:06.566 --> 00:04:11.836
&gt;&gt;Our question was: How does AIDS
affect us physically and socially?

00:04:11.916 --> 00:04:14.816
We read stories of
teenagers who had HIV.

00:04:15.176 --> 00:04:17.056
We learned about the immune system.

00:04:17.396 --> 00:04:21.526
We went and we visited a house
where HIV-positive people live.

00:04:21.526 --> 00:04:25.706
&gt;&gt;And it's for people who have
HIV/AIDS who are homeless.

00:04:26.056 --> 00:04:29.296
&gt;&gt;And so the students got a
chance to meet about five people

00:04:29.296 --> 00:04:31.626
who were living with AIDS and
they got to hear their stories.

00:04:32.276 --> 00:04:35.476
And then we started making the movie.

00:04:35.946 --> 00:04:37.806
So we actually filmed the
whole movie in a week.

00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:39.646
One group went through and was like,

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:40.926
"Where are we going
to shoot these scenes?

00:04:40.926 --> 00:04:42.276
How are we going to
contact these people?

00:04:42.276 --> 00:04:46.076
So the kids were actually part
of the logistical organizing,

00:04:46.076 --> 00:04:47.276
and they really got into it.

00:04:47.276 --> 00:04:50.796
&gt;&gt;Do you really think I'm scared
of your pathetic immune system?

00:04:51.526 --> 00:04:53.586
&gt;&gt;It was really exciting for me

00:04:53.676 --> 00:04:56.066
to see how they could really
learn science in the context

00:04:56.066 --> 00:04:57.226
of a really important issue.

00:04:58.026 --> 00:04:58.766
&gt;&gt;You're crazy.

00:04:58.816 --> 00:04:59.636
I'll never help you.

00:04:59.846 --> 00:05:00.966
&gt;&gt;Oh, yes, you will.

00:05:01.496 --> 00:05:03.266
You see, you're going to be my host.

00:05:03.616 --> 00:05:06.076
I will enter you and
hijack your nucleus.

00:05:06.076 --> 00:05:08.096
&gt;&gt;After studying AIDS,

00:05:08.096 --> 00:05:10.616
the seventh-graders dedicated
their second semester

00:05:10.616 --> 00:05:12.476
to the study of the war in Iraq.

00:05:12.536 --> 00:05:15.986
&gt;&gt;At the end of our last
semester, which ended in January,

00:05:16.016 --> 00:05:21.686
I gave the students a survey
asking them what topics and themes

00:05:21.686 --> 00:05:26.686
in history they wanted to study
more about, and the results were

00:05:26.686 --> 00:05:28.636
that the kids wanted
to study about Islam.

00:05:28.726 --> 00:05:32.806
They wanted to study about the
Middle East and they wanted to study

00:05:32.806 --> 00:05:37.296
about war, and in order to do that,
the kids immediately realized,

00:05:37.296 --> 00:05:40.146
"We need to hear multiple voices,
and one of those voices we want

00:05:40.196 --> 00:05:42.486
to hear are Iraqi people
and Iraqi children."

00:05:42.536 --> 00:05:45.276
And so we had e-mail
pen pals in Baghdad.

00:05:45.456 --> 00:05:47.086
&gt;&gt;My name is Jolis.

00:05:47.416 --> 00:05:49.126
We are people who love peace.

00:05:49.186 --> 00:05:50.586
We won't accept occupation.

00:05:50.856 --> 00:05:52.676
We say no to war, yes to peace.

00:05:53.576 --> 00:05:56.306
&gt;&gt;Dear Joanna, I was so
excited to hear from you.

00:05:56.546 --> 00:05:59.986
I really don't want this war,
because it is pretty harmful.

00:06:00.656 --> 00:06:01.546
&gt;&gt;What do they want?

00:06:02.096 --> 00:06:04.306
Our oil? It's not theirs, after all.

00:06:04.806 --> 00:06:06.376
&gt;&gt;We're about to march in there.

00:06:06.506 --> 00:06:10.616
They're doing this massive buildup,
and you sense the tension building,

00:06:10.806 --> 00:06:12.086
and we're getting it firsthand.

00:06:12.086 --> 00:06:13.836
I mean, this is a primary source.

00:06:14.256 --> 00:06:18.846
It's a brilliant way for these
children to learn about Iraq.

00:06:19.456 --> 00:06:23.386
&gt;&gt;Anyway, I felt better when I knew
that someone really cares over there.

00:06:23.386 --> 00:06:28.066
&gt;&gt;President George W. Bush: My
fellow citizens, this hour American

00:06:28.066 --> 00:06:31.866
and coalition forces are in the
early stages of military operations

00:06:32.196 --> 00:06:34.746
to disarm Iraq, to free its people

00:06:34.746 --> 00:06:37.196
and to defend the world
from grave danger.

00:06:37.621 --> 00:06:39.621
[ bomb explodes ]

00:06:40.046 --> 00:06:43.116
&gt;&gt;When the war started, right
away they started asking questions

00:06:43.196 --> 00:06:45.226
that were -- sort of
came out naturally.

00:06:45.726 --> 00:06:47.576
Well, you know, we're
seeing all of this coverage,

00:06:47.606 --> 00:06:48.976
but where are stories about children?

00:06:49.146 --> 00:06:50.866
What about our pen pals?

00:06:51.056 --> 00:06:51.616
Are they okay?

00:06:51.766 --> 00:06:55.046
These anonymous lights in the sky,
but what are those bombs hitting?

00:06:55.046 --> 00:06:56.036
Are they hitting my friend?

00:06:59.546 --> 00:07:01.426
&gt;&gt;They gathered at Market
and Powell this morning

00:07:01.426 --> 00:07:04.116
around 9:00 A.M. holding
pictures of Iraqi children.

00:07:04.386 --> 00:07:07.676
Today they say their march was
about expressing their feelings

00:07:07.796 --> 00:07:09.886
and it's not an antiwar march.

00:07:10.086 --> 00:07:12.276
&gt;&gt;I said it's not black and white
when you're talking with kids.

00:07:12.276 --> 00:07:13.346
They have complex emotions.

00:07:13.396 --> 00:07:14.086
They're confused.

00:07:14.376 --> 00:07:14.726
They're sad.

00:07:15.066 --> 00:07:18.736
They're frustrated, and they feel
disempowered, because they feel

00:07:18.736 --> 00:07:20.206
like people don't listen to children.

00:07:20.546 --> 00:07:21.976
And they are worried
about their friends.

00:07:22.056 --> 00:07:27.036
&gt;&gt;I think that we shouldn't have this
war, because Iraq already is kind

00:07:27.226 --> 00:07:28.676
of at war in a way, and it's, like,

00:07:29.046 --> 00:07:30.956
50 percent of the people
there are children,

00:07:31.026 --> 00:07:32.976
so basically more children are
getting bombed than parents.

00:07:34.826 --> 00:07:37.556
&gt;&gt;The march was really
cool, because it was silent.

00:07:37.726 --> 00:07:43.116
It was with the posters, and then
this man came up to us, saying,

00:07:43.196 --> 00:07:44.396
"Get back to your country.

00:07:44.396 --> 00:07:45.946
Why are you over here marching?

00:07:45.946 --> 00:07:47.616
You're not even from this nation."

00:07:48.076 --> 00:07:50.716
And I felt really bad, because
this is actually my nation

00:07:50.716 --> 00:07:52.666
and it made me feel,
like, intimidated,

00:07:52.666 --> 00:07:55.346
but then I believed
they're just saying

00:07:55.346 --> 00:07:58.396
that so the young kids will
feel scared and not come out

00:07:58.606 --> 00:07:59.866
and speak out what they feel.

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:04.236
&gt;&gt;The seventh-graders' peaceful
protest caught the attention

00:08:04.236 --> 00:08:09.516
of news media around the world,
from CNN to NBC's "Today Show."

00:08:10.186 --> 00:08:12.216
&gt;&gt;Reporter: Huber, are you
concerned about your friends?

00:08:13.156 --> 00:08:19.196
&gt;&gt;If they're dead, it's really
sad, so I don't know what to do.

00:08:19.196 --> 00:08:21.386
I feel really confused.

00:08:21.426 --> 00:08:25.966
&gt;&gt;Reporter: Some of the response was
not positive for the antiwar protest.

00:08:25.966 --> 00:08:28.156
In fact, there were many
adults who said they felt

00:08:28.156 --> 00:08:31.086
like the students were being
used as pawns for the adults.

00:08:31.796 --> 00:08:34.046
Do you think that that's the case?

00:08:34.046 --> 00:08:37.926
How would you respond
to those people?

00:08:38.556 --> 00:08:42.546
&gt;&gt;Those people are wrong, because
we all have a mind of our own.

00:08:42.546 --> 00:08:45.206
If they want to believe that
our teacher was forcing us

00:08:45.236 --> 00:08:46.456
to do that, they didn't.

00:08:46.516 --> 00:08:50.356
Some students refused to go,
but I really wanted to go,

00:08:50.356 --> 00:08:52.276
because I really wanted
to get my voice out.

00:08:52.276 --> 00:08:52.956
&gt;&gt;Reporter: All right.

00:08:52.956 --> 00:08:56.216
Well, Carina, thank
you for joining us.

00:08:56.216 --> 00:08:59.136
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Having become the
subject of media coverage themselves,

00:08:59.356 --> 00:09:01.396
the students gained new insights

00:09:01.396 --> 00:09:05.346
as they studied how the war was
being covered in print and on TV.

00:09:05.346 --> 00:09:07.336
&gt;&gt;I have a list of questions here.

00:09:07.336 --> 00:09:11.056
Not all of them apply to every
photo, but in this photo,

00:09:11.206 --> 00:09:15.096
who do you identify with and
who do you feel empathy for?

00:09:15.376 --> 00:09:16.746
&gt;&gt;The Iraqi civilian.

00:09:17.116 --> 00:09:18.136
&gt;&gt;The Iraqi civilian?

00:09:19.456 --> 00:09:24.116
What other kinds of things
do you think you might think?

00:09:24.806 --> 00:09:27.426
&gt;&gt;Well, I realize this:
It's like if you look

00:09:27.516 --> 00:09:30.856
at this picture you feel
sorry for the soldiers,

00:09:30.856 --> 00:09:34.126
and that kind of makes you want to
support the war, but then if you look

00:09:34.126 --> 00:09:37.796
at this picture, you feel sorry for
the Iraqis, and that makes you think

00:09:37.836 --> 00:09:41.646
that the war isn't necessary.

00:09:42.436 --> 00:09:43.726
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At the
end of the semester,

00:09:43.726 --> 00:09:47.396
the seventh-graders held
an evening class teach-in

00:09:48.256 --> 00:09:55.706
for their parents about the war.

00:09:55.706 --> 00:09:56.336
&gt;&gt;Student: [in Spanish]

00:09:56.336 --> 00:09:58.036
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For the
parents, it was a chance

00:09:58.036 --> 00:10:01.236
to discover how much their
children had learned about the war

00:10:01.586 --> 00:10:08.566
and to get new information
on the subject.

00:10:09.086 --> 00:10:11.266
&gt;&gt;We've been studying
this a really long time,

00:10:11.266 --> 00:10:14.066
and they don't have the
education like we have.

00:10:14.526 --> 00:10:16.216
They just learned a whole lot.

00:10:17.146 --> 00:10:19.026
&gt;&gt;Academically, we're starting

00:10:19.026 --> 00:10:21.966
to see what difference
these schools can make.

00:10:22.586 --> 00:10:25.646
Our Stanford 9 test scores just
came out across all the schools,

00:10:25.646 --> 00:10:30.206
and our school, as well as the other
small schools, showed dramatic gains.

00:10:31.246 --> 00:10:32.196
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The last stop

00:10:32.196 --> 00:10:35.956
on the seventh-grade expedition
was Fantasy Studios in Berkeley,

00:10:35.956 --> 00:10:38.666
where the class recorded
a CD of peace songs,

00:10:39.176 --> 00:10:41.486
hoping to send the
proceeds from their sales

00:10:41.486 --> 00:10:51.976
to their pen pals in Iraq.

00:10:51.976 --> 00:10:52.166
&gt;&gt;All: [singing "Imangine" ]

00:10:52.166 --> 00:10:55.556
&gt;&gt;The beginning of the war, we
started working with our musician,

00:10:55.556 --> 00:10:58.426
Sara, on singing songs of peace,
and as we started singing them,

00:10:58.426 --> 00:11:02.456
it was such a relief in the middle
of all this misery to be able to sing

00:11:02.456 --> 00:11:07.976
and create something beautiful and
express our feelings in that way.

00:11:08.046 --> 00:11:09.796
&gt;&gt;I think there's a switch
in all of us, you know,

00:11:10.196 --> 00:11:13.926
something that turns you on to
suddenly not only, like, learning,

00:11:14.176 --> 00:11:16.336
but just your own thinking.

00:11:16.826 --> 00:11:19.416
I feel like our seventh-graders
have become thinkers now.

00:11:20.146 --> 00:11:21.136
The switch is on.

00:11:21.136 --> 00:11:23.206
They're thinking of
themselves as change-makers,

00:11:23.376 --> 00:11:26.466
as people who have
voices, who have power,

00:11:26.506 --> 00:11:28.926
who can articulate,
who are respected.

00:11:29.596 --> 00:11:30.956
They just made this huge leap.

00:11:31.736 --> 00:11:36.526
Suddenly they are deep, critical,
reflective, powerful thinkers,

00:11:36.526 --> 00:11:44.496
and I think this curriculum
turned the switch on.

00:11:44.496 --> 00:11:46.046
&gt;&gt;All: [singing "Imangine" ]

00:11:46.046 --> 00:11:47.966
&gt;&gt;I look at a few of my kids and
I say, "He would have dropped out.

00:11:47.966 --> 00:11:49.626
Any other school, by
now he would be out.

00:11:50.016 --> 00:11:53.406
This one would never be singing like
this in front of all his peers."

00:11:53.666 --> 00:11:56.856
They're learning stuff that they're
going to remember for their lives.

00:11:56.936 --> 00:11:58.696
They are so motivated.

00:11:58.786 --> 00:12:00.746
These kids are going
to go to college.

00:12:00.746 --> 00:12:02.966
That's why I'm a teacher, and I
couldn't be a teacher anywhere else,

00:12:02.966 --> 00:12:04.686
because it doesn't happen
like that elsewhere.

00:12:04.686 --> 00:12:07.936
You know, what I envisioned and
what I hoped would happen here is

00:12:07.936 --> 00:12:10.966
happening, and it makes
it all worth it.

00:12:12.256 --> 00:12:19.046
