00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.301
The goal is to count up all of
the valence electrons that you

00:00:22.301 --> 00:00:28.507
have in a molecule and then
distribute those valence

00:00:28.507 --> 00:00:36.052
electrons so that between each
two atoms there are at least two

00:00:36.052 --> 00:00:39.910
electrons.
And then what you do is you

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.156
take the rest of the electrons
and distribute them around the

00:00:44.156 --> 00:00:48.190
molecule, so that each atom has
an inner gas configuration

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.596
around it.
That's usually an octet,

00:00:50.596 --> 00:00:53.073
unless you're dealing with
hydrogen.

00:00:53.073 --> 00:00:56.683
That's the main idea.
And so what that means is that

00:00:56.683 --> 00:01:01.000
you have to know what those
valence electrons are.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.102
And so that is something that
you should get used to knowing,

00:01:06.102 --> 00:01:10.524
so you could just really write
that down immediately.

00:01:10.524 --> 00:01:15.797
But we also saw last time that
a very critical concept was this

00:01:15.797 --> 00:01:20.815
concept here of formal charge.
Formal charge is a measure of

00:01:20.815 --> 00:01:25.747
how much an atom has gained or
lost an electron when it has

00:01:25.747 --> 00:01:30.000
formed a bond in a particular
structure.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.409
And we saw how this idea of
formal charge was really

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.077
critical in being able to
determine what was the lowest

00:01:39.077 --> 00:01:42.968
energy structure.
In fact, what was the lowest

00:01:42.968 --> 00:01:46.253
energy skeletal structure.
Often times,

00:01:46.253 --> 00:01:50.403
when you start out,
you don't know what atoms are

00:01:50.403 --> 00:01:54.639
connected to each other.
You have to take a guess.

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:57.925
You take a guess.
You put out the Lewis

00:01:57.925 --> 00:02:01.788
structure.
You draw out the Lewis

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:05.934
structure, and then you
calculate the formal charge.

00:02:05.934 --> 00:02:10.650
And if you find on that Lewis
structure that any atom has a

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.227
formal charge,
a minus 2 or a plus 2 or minus

00:02:14.227 --> 00:02:18.536
3 or plus 3, that cannot
possibly be the lowest energy

00:02:18.536 --> 00:02:21.382
structure.
And then you start again.

00:02:21.382 --> 00:02:25.772
You find another skeletal
structure, draw out the Lewis

00:02:25.772 --> 00:02:30.000
diagrams, calculate the formal
charges.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.083
And you keep doing that,
until you find a skeletal

00:02:34.083 --> 00:02:38.416
structure that gives you the
lowest set or the lowest

00:02:38.416 --> 00:02:41.166
absolute values of formal
charges.

00:02:41.166 --> 00:02:43.833
This is a very important
concept.

00:02:43.833 --> 00:02:48.166
That's how you do it.
Now, we also saw last time that

00:02:48.166 --> 00:02:53.250
we were able to draw a couple of
different skeletal structures

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.000
where the set of formal charges
was the same.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.809
Except that,
in those two different Lewis

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:07.428
structures, one structure had a
formal negative charge on an

00:03:07.428 --> 00:03:12.000
oxygen, and the other one had it
on the nitrogen.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.095
In that case,
we want to always make sure we

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:21.523
put the negative formal charge
on the most electronegative

00:03:21.523 --> 00:03:24.000
element.
And then, finally,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.333
in our discussion of formal
charge, we were talking about

00:03:29.333 --> 00:03:34.000
this ion here,
NO3 minus.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.023
And this formal charge concept
helped us to understand when we

00:03:38.023 --> 00:03:40.530
had a resonance structure.
For example,

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.564
we did a Lewis structure that
looked like this.

00:03:43.564 --> 00:03:47.258
And we put this double bond
here between one nitrogen and

00:03:47.258 --> 00:03:50.424
one of the oxygens,
but we realized we could have

00:03:50.424 --> 00:03:53.722
also put it between this
nitrogen and oxygen and we

00:03:53.722 --> 00:03:57.482
realized we could have put it
between this oxygen and this

00:03:57.482 --> 00:04:00.125
nitrogen.
And, of course,

00:04:00.125 --> 00:04:04.550
in all three cases we've got
the same set of formal charges.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.224
They look identical.
So what happens in this case?

00:04:08.224 --> 00:04:12.349
Well, when you've got this
situation where it looks like

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:16.250
you've got three different
structures, and the formal

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.000
charges are the same,
well, this is a hint that you

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.675
have a resonance structure.
That is that these two

00:04:23.675 --> 00:04:26.975
electrons here,
these two extra electrons are

00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:32.000
not sitting between just one
nitrogen and an oxygen.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.904
But rather these two electrons
are delocalized over all three

00:04:36.904 --> 00:04:38.621
bonds.
That is to say,

00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:41.400
these three bonds,
nitrogen-oxygen,

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.016
nitrogen-oxygen,
nitrogen-oxygen,

00:04:44.016 --> 00:04:46.959
those three bonds are all
equivalent.

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:51.945
It is not the case where one of
the bonds is a double bond and

00:04:51.945 --> 00:04:56.359
the other two are single bonds.
Rather, those extra two

00:04:56.359 --> 00:05:02.000
electrons are distributed
equally over all three bonds.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.692
And so each one of these bonds
kind of looks like a bond and a

00:05:06.692 --> 00:05:09.461
third.
It's a little bit shorter than

00:05:09.461 --> 00:05:13.923
a single bond and a little bit
stronger than a single bond,

00:05:13.923 --> 00:05:18.153
but not as short as a double
bond and not as strong as a

00:05:18.153 --> 00:05:21.461
double bond.
When you have this situation of

00:05:21.461 --> 00:05:25.615
three sets, three different
structures, three different

00:05:25.615 --> 00:05:29.307
Lewis structures but same set of
absolute values,

00:05:29.307 --> 00:05:34.000
that's a clue you've got a
resonance structure.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Okay?
Yes?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.308
No, the lone pairs here are
not.

00:05:44.308 --> 00:05:49.219
They actually reside,
they're most close to the

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:55.837
actual atom that they're shown.
It's only the bonding electrons

00:05:55.837 --> 00:06:00.000
that exhibit this
delocalization.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.102
All right.
Now, what we want to do today

00:06:03.102 --> 00:06:07.477
is I want to show you some
exceptions to the octet rule.

00:06:07.477 --> 00:06:12.090
There are always exceptions.
And we started out saying that

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.704
these Lewis diagrams and the
octet rule, that worked 90% of

00:06:16.704 --> 00:06:19.488
the time.
Now I want to show you the

00:06:19.488 --> 00:06:22.590
other 10% when it actually
doesn't work.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:28.000
And so here is the first
exception when it doesn't work.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.027
It doesn't work when you have
an odd number of valence

00:06:33.027 --> 00:06:38.718
electrons, because these Lewis
diagrams are based on the idea

00:06:38.718 --> 00:06:42.891
that a bond shares,
a bond is composed of two

00:06:42.891 --> 00:06:48.203
electrons, and those two
electrons are shared between the

00:06:48.203 --> 00:06:51.807
two atoms.
And so, if you've got an odd

00:06:51.807 --> 00:06:57.119
number of valence electrons,
this whole idea breaks down.

00:06:57.119 --> 00:07:00.059
For example,
the methyl radical,

00:07:00.059 --> 00:07:05.106
CH3 dot.
A methyl radical has an odd

00:07:05.106 --> 00:07:09.710
number of valence electrons.
It has seven valence electrons.

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:14.080
It is because it has that one
unpaired electron that it's

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.684
actually really very reactive.
And so if you try to use your

00:07:18.684 --> 00:07:23.445
Lewis rules that we had on this
kind of situation where you've

00:07:23.445 --> 00:07:27.815
got an odd number of valence
electrons, everything really

00:07:27.815 --> 00:07:32.066
just breaks down.
So if you're given a structure

00:07:32.066 --> 00:07:35.992
to draw and you've got an odd
number of valence electrons,

00:07:35.992 --> 00:07:38.817
forget it.
You really cannot use the octet

00:07:38.817 --> 00:07:41.779
rule and then the Lewis diagrams
to do that.

00:07:41.779 --> 00:07:45.498
You need a more sophisticated
scheme for looking at the

00:07:45.498 --> 00:07:49.287
bonding of molecules which have
an odd number of valence

00:07:49.287 --> 00:07:52.111
electrons.
And we're going to look at some

00:07:52.111 --> 00:07:56.038
of those more sophisticated
schemes in a couple of days or

00:07:56.038 --> 00:07:59.000
so.
So that's one exception.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.045
But here comes a second
exception, and this is an

00:08:04.045 --> 00:08:09.721
exception to the octet rule.
The octet rule is going to

00:08:09.721 --> 00:08:15.818
break down, but we are still
going to draw a Lewis diagram.

00:08:15.818 --> 00:08:21.073
And I will show you how.
The octet rule is going to

00:08:21.073 --> 00:08:25.383
break down for these elements in
group 13.

00:08:25.383 --> 00:08:30.323
The octet rule is going to
break down for boron,

00:08:30.323 --> 00:08:36.000
aluminum, gallium,
indium in the group 13.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.211
You come to a problem where
you've got to draw a Lewis

00:08:40.211 --> 00:08:45.059
diagram for a group 13 element.
Do you know what should happen

00:08:45.059 --> 00:08:48.000
in your mind?
Buzzers ought to go off,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.450
buzz, buzz, buzz meaning
there's going to be an exception

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:53.801
here.
I mean this.

00:08:53.801 --> 00:08:58.172
Really, if you see boron,
aluminum, you're on heightened

00:08:58.172 --> 00:09:02.800
alert here.
Something unusual could happen.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.956
Let me explain this.
Suppose we are writing the

00:09:06.956 --> 00:09:11.834
Lewis structure for BF3,
we need the skeletal structure

00:09:11.834 --> 00:09:15.177
first.
Well, I said last time that the

00:09:15.177 --> 00:09:19.875
fluorines, they're just almost
always terminal atoms.

00:09:19.875 --> 00:09:23.398
Good guess.
Put the boron in the center.

00:09:23.398 --> 00:09:29.000
Now let's count up the number
of valence electrons.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.669
Well, we have four atoms here.
Each of the three fluorines are

00:09:33.669 --> 00:09:37.572
bringing in seven valence
electrons and the boron is

00:09:37.572 --> 00:09:41.246
bringing in three.
We've got a total number of 24

00:09:41.246 --> 00:09:44.614
valence electrons here.
I just drew them out.

00:09:44.614 --> 00:09:47.906
Now we want to count up our
step three here,

00:09:47.906 --> 00:09:52.575
the number of electrons that we
would have to have if each one

00:09:52.575 --> 00:09:55.407
of these atoms had an octet
around it.

00:09:55.407 --> 00:10:00.000
So we've got four atoms.
Each one wants eight.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.853
So we would have to have 32
electrons.

00:10:02.853 --> 00:10:07.172
To calculate the number of
bonding electrons in step four

00:10:07.172 --> 00:10:11.569
we subtract the number of
electrons that we'd have to have

00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:15.888
for an inner gas configuration
from the number of valence

00:10:15.888 --> 00:10:19.281
electrons that we do have.
And that is eight.

00:10:19.281 --> 00:10:23.678
And what I did last time is I
put a square here around the

00:10:23.678 --> 00:10:29.000
valence electrons that are going
to be bonding electrons.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.148
And our next step in the Lewis
diagram said we're going to

00:10:33.148 --> 00:10:36.641
assign those bonding electrons,
two to each bond.

00:10:36.641 --> 00:10:39.188
Let's do that.
Well, we just did it.

00:10:39.188 --> 00:10:40.935
Here is two,
here is two,

00:10:40.935 --> 00:10:43.919
here is two.
We used up six of the bonding

00:10:43.919 --> 00:10:46.320
electrons.
And our next step says,

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.377
do we have any remaining
bonding electrons.

00:10:49.377 --> 00:10:52.943
Well, yeah, we do.
We've got two bonding electrons

00:10:52.943 --> 00:10:57.612
here that we haven't used.
And we said last time,

00:10:57.612 --> 00:11:00.982
in this case what we usually
do, or what we do,

00:11:00.982 --> 00:11:04.500
is that we assign those
electrons so that we have

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.211
multiple bonds.
We have a double bond.

00:11:07.211 --> 00:11:10.142
For example,
we're going to choose one of

00:11:10.142 --> 00:11:14.612
these boron-fluorine bonds and
put in another two electrons so

00:11:14.612 --> 00:11:18.349
that we have a double bond
between the boron and the

00:11:18.349 --> 00:11:21.280
fluorine.
That's what our rules said last

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.137
time, so let's follow them for a
moment.

00:11:24.137 --> 00:11:27.288
So we did that.
Now we've used up all of our

00:11:27.288 --> 00:11:31.603
bonding electrons.
Do we have any valence

00:11:31.603 --> 00:11:33.498
electrons left?
We sure do.

00:11:33.498 --> 00:11:36.633
Gobs of them.
We only used eight of them for

00:11:36.633 --> 00:11:39.694
the bond so we've got 16 valence
electrons.

00:11:39.694 --> 00:11:43.703
That means we're going to have
to make eight lone pairs.

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:47.858
And we distribute them around
each atom in the molecule so

00:11:47.858 --> 00:11:51.138
that each atom has an octet.
So let's do that.

00:11:51.138 --> 00:11:55.075
Here we've got eight around
fluorine, eight around this

00:11:55.075 --> 00:11:59.302
fluorine, there's eight around
the boron and there is eight

00:11:59.302 --> 00:12:03.981
around the fluorine.
Everything looks normal.

00:12:03.981 --> 00:12:08.357
Everything looks great.
Now let's calculate the formal

00:12:08.357 --> 00:12:11.247
charge.
That is something else we've

00:12:11.247 --> 00:12:14.467
got to check.
Formal charge is number of

00:12:14.467 --> 00:12:19.009
valence electrons minus the
number of electrons that are

00:12:19.009 --> 00:12:24.045
lone pairs minus the number of
bonding electrons divided by 2.

00:12:24.045 --> 00:12:29.000
Let's calculate that for boron
in this structure.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
So we said boron has three
valence electrons.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.818
How many lone pairs does boron
have in this structure?

00:12:37.818 --> 00:12:40.090
How many lone pairs?
None.

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:45.636
They're all bonding electrons.
How many bonding electrons does

00:12:45.636 --> 00:12:47.181
boron have?
Eight.

00:12:47.181 --> 00:12:51.818
8 divided by 2 is 4.
The formal charge on this boron

00:12:51.818 --> 00:12:58.000
is minus 1, so we're going to
put a minus 1 right there.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.216
And then if you proceed to
calculate the formal charge on

00:13:02.216 --> 00:13:06.583
this doubly-bonded fluorine
right here, you would find that

00:13:06.583 --> 00:13:11.176
that formal charge was plus 1.
And if you go and you calculate

00:13:11.176 --> 00:13:14.865
the formal charges on the singly
bonded fluorines,

00:13:14.865 --> 00:13:19.534
you would find that that was 0.
So I will put a zero and a zero

00:13:19.534 --> 00:13:21.341
there.
And now, remember,

00:13:21.341 --> 00:13:25.858
last time we said that the sum
of those formal charges has to

00:13:25.858 --> 00:13:30.000
equal the overall charge on the
molecule.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.321
If it doesn't,
you've done something wrong

00:13:33.321 --> 00:13:36.481
somewhere.
And so I just summed them up.

00:13:36.481 --> 00:13:40.126
That sum is 0.
The overall charge on BF3 is 0.

00:13:40.126 --> 00:13:44.420
We did things correctly.
But now when you look at this

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:47.579
you say, well,
this looks like NO3 minus,

00:13:47.579 --> 00:13:52.116
in the sense that I
could have taken these two

00:13:52.116 --> 00:13:56.815
electrons and put them in this
bond to make that structure.

00:13:56.815 --> 00:14:02.000
If I did, I'd have the same set
of formal charges.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.741
Or, I could have taken those
two electrons and put them right

00:14:06.741 --> 00:14:08.953
here, like that.
If I did so,

00:14:08.953 --> 00:14:12.825
I would still have the same set
of formal charges.

00:14:12.825 --> 00:14:17.487
Look, this looks like one of
these resonance structures that

00:14:17.487 --> 00:14:21.280
I just told you about.
That's what it looks like.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.809
Why not resonance?
Well, why not?

00:14:23.809 --> 00:14:27.365
Because this beeper is going
off in your head,

00:14:27.365 --> 00:14:31.000
beep, beep, beep,
this is boron.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.754
Boron is an exception.
Let me show you how it is an

00:14:35.754 --> 00:14:38.131
exception.
Experimentally,

00:14:38.131 --> 00:14:42.029
if you look at these
boron-fluorine bonds,

00:14:42.029 --> 00:14:47.734
you would not see that there
would be one double bond and two

00:14:47.734 --> 00:14:50.872
single bonds.
You would not find a

00:14:50.872 --> 00:14:56.672
boron-fluorine bond that looks
like a double bond and two that

00:14:56.672 --> 00:15:02.505
look like single bonds.
You would also not find that

00:15:02.505 --> 00:15:07.784
these three bonds were a bond
and a third like in NO3 minus.

00:15:07.784 --> 00:15:11.363
Experimentally,
you would find that these

00:15:11.363 --> 00:15:15.389
boron-fluorine bonds all have
the same length,

00:15:15.389 --> 00:15:18.700
but they are typical of a
single bond.

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:23.263
Unlike in NO3 minus where it
was a bond and a third,

00:15:23.263 --> 00:15:28.721
these boron-fluorine bonds all
look like single bonds in terms

00:15:28.721 --> 00:15:34.000
of their lengths,
in terms of their strengths.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.717
Very different than NO3 minus.
Given that experimental

00:15:39.717 --> 00:15:43.601
observation, what are we going
to do?

00:15:43.601 --> 00:15:50.074
Well, we're going to write a
structure here where we're going

00:15:50.074 --> 00:15:54.929
to give every atom in that
structure an octet,

00:15:54.929 --> 00:16:00.000
except for the boron.
So what did I do?

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.767
I took the extra two electrons
here, removed it from the

00:16:04.767 --> 00:16:09.882
boron-fluorine bond and gave it
just to the fluorine so that

00:16:09.882 --> 00:16:14.910
every fluorine or every atom in
this molecule has an octet,

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:19.938
except for this outlier boron.
Still got the same number of

00:16:19.938 --> 00:16:24.879
electrons, everything is fine,
but I moved these electrons

00:16:24.879 --> 00:16:30.778
from here to the fluorine.
Let me calculate the formal

00:16:30.778 --> 00:16:33.350
charge here.
If I do that,

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:39.215
I find that the formal charge
on boron is 0 now instead of

00:16:39.215 --> 00:16:43.022
minus 1.
I find that the formal charge

00:16:43.022 --> 00:16:47.549
on this fluorine is 0,
this fluorine is zero,

00:16:47.549 --> 00:16:50.842
and this fluorine,
hey, that's 0.

00:16:50.842 --> 00:16:55.884
I've got a structure with all
zero formal charges.

00:16:55.884 --> 00:17:00.000
That is awesome.
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.860
The octet rule just broke down
here.

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:09.264
And that is the case for the
elements in group 13,

00:17:09.264 --> 00:17:15.772
or that is oftentimes the case
for the elements in group 13.

00:17:15.772 --> 00:17:19.632
In BF4 minus,
for example,

00:17:19.632 --> 00:17:23.272
the octet rule doesn't break
down.

00:17:23.272 --> 00:17:27.463
But in BF3, BCl3,
aluminum trichloride,

00:17:27.463 --> 00:17:33.184
same thing.
The group 13 elements are octet

00:17:33.184 --> 00:17:37.397
deficient.
So that's an exception that you

00:17:37.397 --> 00:17:40.684
have to know about.
And, in fact,

00:17:40.684 --> 00:17:45.616
this is the structure.
Experimentally we can tell

00:17:45.616 --> 00:17:48.801
that.
And it's the lowest energy

00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:52.910
structure.
We've got a set of zero formal

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:55.684
charges.
So that's group 13.

00:17:55.684 --> 00:18:02.307
That is our second exception.
This just repeats that.

00:18:02.307 --> 00:18:05.116
Great.
Now, here is our third

00:18:05.116 --> 00:18:09.029
exception.
So we've got an exception now

00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:13.543
where we don't put an octet
around some atoms.

00:18:13.543 --> 00:18:16.854
And now this is the opposite
case.

00:18:16.854 --> 00:18:22.773
The third exception is where
we're going to put more than an

00:18:22.773 --> 00:18:27.288
octet around an atom.
We're going to call this

00:18:27.288 --> 00:18:33.644
valence shell expansion.
And the example we're going to

00:18:33.644 --> 00:18:39.109
use is phosphorus pentachloride.
Let's draw the Lewis structure

00:18:39.109 --> 00:18:44.486
first, and then we will see how
our rules are going to kind of

00:18:44.486 --> 00:18:48.012
break down.
For phosphorus pentachloride,

00:18:48.012 --> 00:18:53.300
let's put the phosphorous in
the center because the chlorines

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:57.179
are usually terminal.
Not always but usually.

00:18:57.179 --> 00:19:00.830
So let's start there.
We do that.

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:04.377
Let's calculate the number of
valence electrons.

00:19:04.377 --> 00:19:07.471
Well, fluorine,
it brings in seven valence

00:19:07.471 --> 00:19:09.962
electrons.
There are five of them.

00:19:09.962 --> 00:19:13.886
Phosphorus, it brings five
valence electrons into the

00:19:13.886 --> 00:19:16.679
party.
We've got 40 valence electrons.

00:19:16.679 --> 00:19:21.056
How many electrons would we
have to have if we had an inner

00:19:21.056 --> 00:19:23.622
gas configuration around each
atom?

00:19:23.622 --> 00:19:28.000
Well, we've got six atoms.
6 times 8 is 48.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.128
So what do our rules say about
the number of bonding electrons?

00:19:33.128 --> 00:19:37.844
Well, our rules say that we've
got eight bonding electrons

00:19:37.844 --> 00:19:41.484
because 48 minus 40 is 8.
Well, that's great.

00:19:41.484 --> 00:19:45.372
Eight bonding electrons,
we can make four bonds.

00:19:45.372 --> 00:19:49.839
But we've got a problem.
You can see already that we're

00:19:49.839 --> 00:19:54.389
going to have to make at least
five bonds so we've got a

00:19:54.389 --> 00:19:57.367
problem.
Our kind of formula here for

00:19:57.367 --> 00:20:02.000
writing these Lewis structures
broke down.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.146
It's clear we're going to have
to make ten bonds,

00:20:06.146 --> 00:20:10.984
but in our procedure here it
let us make only four bonds.

00:20:10.984 --> 00:20:13.835
So what are we going to do?
Fudge.

00:20:13.835 --> 00:20:16.945
Good.
That's exactly what we're going

00:20:16.945 --> 00:20:19.277
to do.
We're going to fudge.

00:20:19.277 --> 00:20:21.955
We're going to forget our
rules.

00:20:21.955 --> 00:20:26.447
We're going to draw five bonds,
each one to chlorine.

00:20:26.447 --> 00:20:31.371
So now, of our 40 valence
electrons, ten of them have been

00:20:31.371 --> 00:20:37.849
used as bonding electrons.
That means we've got 30 valence

00:20:37.849 --> 00:20:41.617
electrons leftover.
We're going to have to

00:20:41.617 --> 00:20:46.488
distribute them around the
molecule so that each atom,

00:20:46.488 --> 00:20:50.625
except the phosphorus,
has an octet around it.

00:20:50.625 --> 00:20:54.944
We will do that.
Here are six for that chlorine.

00:20:54.944 --> 00:21:00.000
Now we used another six,
12 for that chlorine.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.397
Another six for that chlorine,
18.

00:21:02.397 --> 00:21:04.794
Another six for that chlorine,
24.

00:21:04.794 --> 00:21:07.191
Another six for that chlorine,
30.

00:21:07.191 --> 00:21:10.895
We just used them all up.
Let's calculate the formal

00:21:10.895 --> 00:21:13.728
charges.
The formal charge on phosphorus

00:21:13.728 --> 00:21:17.215
is the number of valence
electrons on phosphorus,

00:21:17.215 --> 00:21:19.903
which is zero.
Number of lone pairs on

00:21:19.903 --> 00:21:24.043
phosphorus, which is zero.
And number of bonding electrons

00:21:24.043 --> 00:21:27.966
divided by 2 on phosphorus.
Well, there are ten bonding

00:21:27.966 --> 00:21:32.421
electrons.
2, 4, 6, 8, 10 divided by 2,

00:21:32.421 --> 00:21:35.794
that's 5.
Formal charge on phosphorus is

00:21:35.794 --> 00:21:38.129
0.
And now if you go and you

00:21:38.129 --> 00:21:42.021
calculate the formal charges on
the chlorines,

00:21:42.021 --> 00:21:45.827
they are all 0.
And we've got another awesome

00:21:45.827 --> 00:21:50.237
looking structure here,
a set of zero formal charges

00:21:50.237 --> 00:21:54.302
for phosphorus pentachloride.
That is very nice,

00:21:54.302 --> 00:21:59.405
except for the fact that we've
got more than an octet around

00:21:59.405 --> 00:22:05.223
the phosphorus.
The phosphorus has what we call

00:22:05.223 --> 00:22:09.279
an expanded shell.
And that is the case,

00:22:09.279 --> 00:22:15.208
that will be often the case,
for elements which have their

00:22:15.208 --> 00:22:21.135
outermost electrons in a shell
where the principle quantum

00:22:21.135 --> 00:22:26.336
number is 3 or greater.
Those elements have empty d

00:22:26.336 --> 00:22:29.984
states.
Empty d states that can

00:22:29.984 --> 00:22:34.989
accommodate more than eight
electrons, that can accommodate

00:22:34.989 --> 00:22:39.218
more than an octet.
And phosphorus is one of those

00:22:39.218 --> 00:22:42.670
elements.
So when you start to get to the

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:47.329
larger elements like phosphorus,
like the next example,

00:22:47.329 --> 00:22:52.421
iodine, that I am going to show
you, we can put more than an

00:22:52.421 --> 00:22:55.355
octet around those larger
elements.

00:22:55.355 --> 00:22:59.842
Let's do another example here
with this valance shell

00:22:59.842 --> 00:23:05.647
expansion.
Here is the IF4 minus

00:23:05.647 --> 00:23:08.000
ion.
How do you draw,

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
first of all,
a skeletal structure?

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.882
What is a good guess for a
skeletal structure here?

00:23:17.882 --> 00:23:22.000
Well, chlorines are always
terminal.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Let's put them on the outside
and the iodine in the middle.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.782
Is there a question over there?
Can I help you out?

00:23:34.782 --> 00:23:37.556
Any questions right now?
Okay.

00:23:37.556 --> 00:23:41.478
Let's try it.
Let's count up the number of

00:23:41.478 --> 00:23:45.113
valence electrons.
Well, we've got one,

00:23:45.113 --> 00:23:47.791
two, three, four,
five atoms.

00:23:47.791 --> 00:23:52.860
And they are halogens.
Halogens bring in seven valence

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:56.017
electrons.
Five times seven is 35.

00:23:56.017 --> 00:24:03.000
But, and this is important,
we've got an extra charge here.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.483
This is an ion.
It is minus one.

00:24:05.483 --> 00:24:10.370
And so we're going to have to
add one to the number of valence

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:13.655
electrons.
We've got 36 valence electrons.

00:24:13.655 --> 00:24:17.581
Now, the number of electrons of
each had an octet,

00:24:17.581 --> 00:24:20.866
so that would be 40,
because we have five.

00:24:20.866 --> 00:24:24.391
5 times 8 is 40.
According to our rules then,

00:24:24.391 --> 00:24:30.000
the number of bonding electrons
is 40 minus 36 which is 6.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.797
Which is 4.
[LAUGHTER] It's 4.

00:24:32.797 --> 00:24:36.752
But what do we need?
We need eight bonding

00:24:36.752 --> 00:24:41.286
electrons, because we've got to
make four bonds.

00:24:41.286 --> 00:24:45.530
Here again, we have a breakdown
in our rules.

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:50.257
Something is wrong.
We are going to have to fudge,

00:24:50.257 --> 00:24:54.308
as somebody said.
We're going to ignore our

00:24:54.308 --> 00:24:57.781
rules.
We've got to make eight bonds.

00:24:57.781 --> 00:25:02.396
Oh, jeez.
We've got to make four bonds so

00:25:02.396 --> 00:25:05.489
we need eight electrons.
Let's make them.

00:25:05.489 --> 00:25:09.046
There they are.
So we used eight of the valence

00:25:09.046 --> 00:25:12.757
electrons as bonding electrons.
36 minus 8 is 28.

00:25:12.757 --> 00:25:17.164
We've got 28 remaining valence
electrons or 14 lone pairs.

00:25:17.164 --> 00:25:21.108
We're going to distribute them
around that fluorine.

00:25:21.108 --> 00:25:23.118
There are 6,
that fluorine,

00:25:23.118 --> 00:25:25.670
there is another 6,
and that's 12.

00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:30.000
That fluorine is 18.
This fluorine is 24.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.947
We just used up 24 of those
valence electrons,

00:25:33.947 --> 00:25:38.421
but we haven't used them all.
We've got four valence

00:25:38.421 --> 00:25:42.543
electrons remaining.
Where are they going to go?

00:25:42.543 --> 00:25:47.719
Well, where we are going to put
those four remaining valence

00:25:47.719 --> 00:25:51.491
electrons are around the iodine
right there.

00:25:51.491 --> 00:25:56.929
We're going to give them to the
iodine, and the iodine is going

00:25:56.929 --> 00:26:02.655
to have two lone pairs.
So the iodine here has four

00:26:02.655 --> 00:26:06.983
more electrons around it.
And we can do that,

00:26:06.983 --> 00:26:12.688
again, because the iodine has
got some empty 5d states that

00:26:12.688 --> 00:26:16.524
can accept these electrons,
and it does.

00:26:16.524 --> 00:26:21.934
Everything has got an octet
here, except for the iodine.

00:26:21.934 --> 00:26:27.934
Let's check the formal charges
and make sure we did everything

00:26:27.934 --> 00:26:32.147
correctly.
Calculate the formal charge on

00:26:32.147 --> 00:26:34.295
iodine.
Well, number of valence

00:26:34.295 --> 00:26:37.732
electrons, seven.
Minus the number of lone pairs.

00:26:37.732 --> 00:26:41.885
Look at how many lone pair
electrons we have on the iodine,

00:26:41.885 --> 00:26:44.319
two, four.
We've got four lone pair

00:26:44.319 --> 00:26:47.756
electrons on iodine.
Minus one-half the number of

00:26:47.756 --> 00:26:51.837
bonding electrons on iodine.
Well, we've got eight bonding

00:26:51.837 --> 00:26:53.556
electrons.
Here they are,

00:26:53.556 --> 00:26:55.059
two, four, six,
eight.

00:26:55.059 --> 00:27:00.000
These red ones don't count.
They are the lone pairs.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.229
8 over 2 is 4.
The formal charge on iodine is

00:27:05.229 --> 00:27:09.864
minus 1.
If you go and you calculate the

00:27:09.864 --> 00:27:15.213
formal charges on fluorine,
they are all zero.

00:27:15.213 --> 00:27:21.393
Some of those are minus 1.
That is indeed the overall

00:27:21.393 --> 00:27:25.553
charge on this iodine
tetrafluoride.

00:27:25.553 --> 00:27:31.400
So we did it right.
Here is another case where

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:35.646
there is an octet around each
one of the atoms,

00:27:35.646 --> 00:27:41.000
except for that larger atom,
the iodine, which has actually

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.969
two, four, six,
eight, ten, twelve electrons

00:27:44.969 --> 00:27:47.000
around it.
Yes?

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.545
No, these aren't d electrons
necessarily.

00:28:04.545 --> 00:28:11.590
These are in empty states here.
There is plenty of room even to

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:15.568
put some more in the case of
iodine.

00:28:15.568 --> 00:28:21.590
We saw that these Lewis
diagrams, the octet idea works

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:25.795
90% of the time,
but three exceptions.

00:28:25.795 --> 00:28:30.872
An odd number of electrons?
Forget it.

00:28:30.872 --> 00:28:34.970
You cannot use it.
We're going to find some more

00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:37.761
sophisticated models for
bonding.

00:28:37.761 --> 00:28:42.645
It doesn't work on group 13.
Group 13 elements often have

00:28:42.645 --> 00:28:45.872
less than an octet.
And then, finally,

00:28:45.872 --> 00:28:49.883
if you get to the heavier
elements like iodine,

00:28:49.883 --> 00:28:52.848
like phosphorus,
that we looked at,

00:28:52.848 --> 00:28:57.994
like chromium is one example in
the notes that I didn't work

00:28:57.994 --> 00:29:02.947
through.
But you will work through that

00:29:02.947 --> 00:29:07.369
in recitation.
You've got some empty d states.

00:29:07.369 --> 00:29:12.971
You can put more than an octet
around those heavier atoms.

00:29:12.971 --> 00:29:18.965
So that is what I wanted to say
here about the Lewis diagrams.

00:29:18.965 --> 00:29:25.156
And next, on Friday we're going
to start looking at a little bit

00:29:25.156 --> 00:29:29.578
more sophisticated model for
chemical bonding,

00:29:29.578 --> 00:29:34.000
which is molecular orbital
theory.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.017
But right now,
what I want to do is I want to

00:29:38.017 --> 00:29:43.130
talk about one other kind of
classical model for chemical

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:46.326
bonds.
It is a model that works only

00:29:46.326 --> 00:29:50.252
for a very ionic bond,
like sodium chloride.

00:29:50.252 --> 00:29:55.000
That is what we're going to
talk about here.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.120
And, in particular,
it's a model that is simple but

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:06.674
accurate in terms of giving us a
physical picture of actually how

00:30:06.674 --> 00:30:11.283
this chemical bond forms.
Let's talk about it.

00:30:11.283 --> 00:30:17.222
We're going to talk about the
formation of a bond between a

00:30:17.222 --> 00:30:22.650
sodium atom and a chlorine atom.
How does this happen?

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:29.000
Well, we've got sodium and
chlorine coming together.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.338
What happens here is this
sodium ejects an electron and it

00:30:34.338 --> 00:30:39.021
spears the chlorine,
and that electron now is stuck

00:30:39.021 --> 00:30:43.235
on the chlorine.
And so now the chlorine is Cl

00:30:43.235 --> 00:30:46.138
minus.
It's pretty big.

00:30:46.138 --> 00:30:49.697
Sodium is Na plus.
It's small.

00:30:49.697 --> 00:30:55.036
And once that happens that
sodium just ropes that chlorine

00:30:55.036 --> 00:31:00.000
right in.
It just pulls it right into it.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.614
It is called the harpoon
mechanism.

00:31:03.614 --> 00:31:09.994
Now, once that electron jump
happens of course these two ions

00:31:09.994 --> 00:31:14.459
come together.
What is this rope in between

00:31:14.459 --> 00:31:18.500
the sodium plus and the chlorine
minus?

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:23.709
Well, that rope is the Coulomb
interaction, right?

00:31:23.709 --> 00:31:29.557
Because once that electron has
jumped from sodium to the

00:31:29.557 --> 00:31:37.000
chlorine, we have a positive
charge and a negative charge.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.205
And they are attracted.
And they just zoom right in

00:31:41.205 --> 00:31:46.000
together until you get to the
bond length, and they form a

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.785
chemical bond.
That is literally what happens.

00:31:49.785 --> 00:31:54.579
The sodium ejects an electron.
That jumps to the chlorine,

00:31:54.579 --> 00:31:59.457
and then the two just zoop
right into each other and form a

00:31:59.457 --> 00:32:04.000
chemical bond,
called the harpoon mechanism.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.435
This is a mechanism here that
was really shown experimentally

00:32:09.435 --> 00:32:14.146
by Dudley Herschbach here at
Harvard in the Chemistry

00:32:14.146 --> 00:32:19.128
Department, John Polanyi in
Toronto and Yuan Lee in U.C.

00:32:19.128 --> 00:32:22.662
Berkeley.
And for this mechanism and for

00:32:22.662 --> 00:32:28.369
many other dynamics of chemical
reactions they got a Nobel Prize

00:32:28.369 --> 00:32:32.678
in 1986.
And Yuan Lee over here was

00:32:32.678 --> 00:32:36.593
actually my thesis advisor at
Berkeley.

00:32:36.593 --> 00:32:42.981
This seems like a very peculiar
kind of way for a chemical bond

00:32:42.981 --> 00:32:46.793
to form, but,
in fact, it is accurate.

00:32:46.793 --> 00:32:52.254
Let me talk about the
energetics here of this process,

00:32:52.254 --> 00:32:58.024
because that will help in
trying to understand physically

00:32:58.024 --> 00:33:04.000
really what is going on in this
bond formation.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.704
Because the first thing you're
saying is, well,

00:33:08.704 --> 00:33:13.102
when that electron jumps,
that costs energy.

00:33:13.102 --> 00:33:17.500
We know that.
We know that for a sodium atom

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:23.227
to remove an electron here,
that there is an energy cost,

00:33:23.227 --> 00:33:26.500
delta E.
That energy cost is what

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:31.000
physically?
The ionization energy.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.602
That's the ionization energy.
That's 496 kilojoules per mole.

00:33:36.602 --> 00:33:41.364
But it is also true,
that once that electron gets in

00:33:41.364 --> 00:33:45.753
the vicinity of chlorine,
the chlorine grabs it.

00:33:45.753 --> 00:33:49.768
That is the chlorine plus the
electron here.

00:33:49.768 --> 00:33:55.463
When that happens some energy
is released to make the chlorine

00:33:55.463 --> 00:33:57.144
minus.
That energy,

00:33:57.144 --> 00:34:02.000
delta E, is minus the electron
affinity.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.338
That was one of the definitions
that we worked on a few days

00:34:07.338 --> 00:34:10.504
ago.
And minus the electron affinity

00:34:10.504 --> 00:34:13.942
there is minus 349 kilojoules
per mole.

00:34:13.942 --> 00:34:19.099
So you get some energy back
when that electron attaches to

00:34:19.099 --> 00:34:22.201
the chlorine.
But, overall,

00:34:22.201 --> 00:34:27.472
if I sum things up here with a
sodium gas phase atom and a

00:34:27.472 --> 00:34:33.204
chlorine gas phase atom going to
sodium plus plus Cl minus ,

00:34:33.204 --> 00:34:38.289
the delta E for this

00:34:38.289 --> 00:34:43.559
reaction here overall is still
positive 147 kilojoules per

00:34:43.559 --> 00:34:46.425
mole.
You still have to put some

00:34:46.425 --> 00:34:50.863
energy into this system to make
this reaction go.

00:34:50.863 --> 00:34:53.914
And, of course,
this delta E here,

00:34:53.914 --> 00:34:59.000
I used the number 147.
I added these up.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:05.666
But delta E also can be written
here as the ionization of sodium

00:35:05.666 --> 00:35:09.793
minus the electron affinity of
chlorine.

00:35:09.793 --> 00:35:15.931
But it's still uphill to get
the electron to go from sodium

00:35:15.931 --> 00:35:19.000
to chlorine.
However --

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.810
-- the sodium and the chlorine
now, once they are two ions and

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:43.753
they come together,
we're going to have some energy

00:35:43.753 --> 00:35:47.223
released, because we're going to
form a bond.

00:35:47.223 --> 00:35:51.561
Sodium plus plus chlorine minus
going to sodium chloride,

00:35:51.561 --> 00:35:55.899
well, the delta E for that

00:35:55.899 --> 00:36:00.000
reaction is minus 592 kilojoules
per mole.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.580
Then, overall,
I am going to add up this

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:08.629
reaction to that reaction,
so these are going to cancel.

00:36:08.629 --> 00:36:13.678
We have sodium gas phase plus
chlorine gas phase to make

00:36:13.678 --> 00:36:17.718
sodium chloride.

00:36:17.718 --> 00:36:22.032
That is the initial reaction we
were looking at,

00:36:22.032 --> 00:36:28.000
sodium and chlorine to make a
sodium chloride molecule.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.921
Overall, that delta E is minus
445 kilojoules per mole.

00:36:32.921 --> 00:36:36.475
Overall, the action is
releasing energy.

00:36:36.475 --> 00:36:41.487
And that is good but things
still seem a little strange,

00:36:41.487 --> 00:36:44.859
right?
It still seems a little strange

00:36:44.859 --> 00:36:50.327
that this sodium is ejecting an
electron and that chlorine is

00:36:50.327 --> 00:36:53.881
grabbing it and then they come
together.

00:36:53.881 --> 00:36:59.258
This ejecting of an electron is
a little bothersome so let's

00:36:59.258 --> 00:37:05.000
look a little more carefully at
what is going on.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.640
An energy level diagram.
Those are the energetics.

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:15.606
And now I am going to put those
energetics that I just described

00:37:15.606 --> 00:37:21.571
onto a diagram to try to make it
a little bit more realistic for

00:37:21.571 --> 00:37:24.791
you.
What I drew here is the energy

00:37:24.791 --> 00:37:30.000
of interaction for sodium plus a
chlorine atom.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.659
This is the same shape that I
drew for two hydrogen atoms.

00:37:34.659 --> 00:37:39.482
It's the same shape because
whenever two atoms come together

00:37:39.482 --> 00:37:43.242
to form a bond,
the energy of interaction looks

00:37:43.242 --> 00:37:46.430
like this.
This is a general phenomenon.

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:49.700
Way out here the two atoms are
separated.

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:52.397
The energy of interaction is
zero.

00:37:52.397 --> 00:37:55.994
As they come together,
there is an attractive

00:37:55.994 --> 00:38:00.000
interaction.
The energy gets lower.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.421
It continues to get lower until
we get to some value which is

00:38:05.421 --> 00:38:08.674
the bond length.
It is at this point,

00:38:08.674 --> 00:38:14.006
this value of r that you have
the most stable configuration.

00:38:14.006 --> 00:38:19.066
This is the chemical bond.
You push them closer together.

00:38:19.066 --> 00:38:23.945
The energy goes back up.
And then this well depth here,

00:38:23.945 --> 00:38:30.000
from here to here or backwards
from down here to up here.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.731
From down here to up there,
that's the bond association

00:38:34.731 --> 00:38:37.798
energy delta E sub d.

00:38:37.798 --> 00:38:40.427
In this drawing,
I reversed it.

00:38:40.427 --> 00:38:44.809
I went from here to here.
It is minus delta E sub d.

00:38:44.809 --> 00:38:48.752
It's minus 445 kilojoules per

00:38:48.752 --> 00:38:51.381
mole.
That's this number that I

00:38:51.381 --> 00:38:55.587
calculated right here.
This is the bond strength,

00:38:55.587 --> 00:39:00.407
445 kilojoules per mole.
That's the bond strength in the

00:39:00.407 --> 00:39:07.099
sodium chloride molecule.
That's how much energy is going

00:39:07.099 --> 00:39:12.699
to be required to take sodium
chloride and pull it apart,

00:39:12.699 --> 00:39:18.500
into the neutral atom sodium
and the neutral atom chlorine.

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:22.300
That is physically what that
number is.

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:28.199
But now what did I say earlier?
I said that sodium ejects an

00:39:28.199 --> 00:39:33.000
electron which ends up on the
chlorine.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.671
And if that is the case,
that is if that sodium ejects

00:39:37.671 --> 00:39:43.223
an electron that ends up on the
chlorine and it does it when the

00:39:43.223 --> 00:39:48.599
sodium and the chlorine are far
apart, that's going to require

00:39:48.599 --> 00:39:53.006
147 kilojoules per mole.
That is what we calculated

00:39:53.006 --> 00:39:55.298
there.
That is this number.

00:39:55.298 --> 00:39:59.000
That is 147 kilocalories
uphill.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.917
So if sodium and chlorine are
really far apart,

00:40:02.917 --> 00:40:07.857
that is how much energy it is
going to require to pull that

00:40:07.857 --> 00:40:12.200
electron off of sodium and put
it onto the chlorine.

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:17.054
This is IE, ionization energy
minus the electron affinity.

00:40:17.054 --> 00:40:20.887
I said that that happens when
it is far apart,

00:40:20.887 --> 00:40:25.741
but now the sodium ion and the
chlorine ion come together.

00:40:25.741 --> 00:40:30.000
They come together to the bond
length.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.269
And at the bond length they
form this chemical bond.

00:40:35.269 --> 00:40:39.092
And when they form this
chemical bond,

00:40:39.092 --> 00:40:44.464
well, then what we have
released is this much energy,

00:40:44.464 --> 00:40:50.767
minus 592 kilojoules per mole.
Now, where did this number come

00:40:50.767 --> 00:40:54.177
from?
Well, that number comes from

00:40:54.177 --> 00:41:00.783
the following simple model.
That number comes from the

00:41:00.783 --> 00:41:07.526
potential energy of interaction
between a bare plus charge and a

00:41:07.526 --> 00:41:12.236
bare minus charge at r equals
2.36 angstroms.

00:41:12.236 --> 00:41:18.659
This is the potential energy of
interaction for a plus charge

00:41:18.659 --> 00:41:23.261
and a minus charge,
so it's minus e squared.

00:41:23.261 --> 00:41:26.687
r here is this bond length,
2.36.

00:41:26.687 --> 00:41:32.467
If you evaluate that at r
point, 2.36, you will get 592

00:41:32.467 --> 00:41:38.258
kilojoules per mole.
So what did I do here?

00:41:38.258 --> 00:41:43.495
I treated sodium ion and
chlorine ions like two bare

00:41:43.495 --> 00:41:47.808
point charges.
I forgot about the fact that

00:41:47.808 --> 00:41:51.401
sodium here has got other
electrons.

00:41:51.401 --> 00:41:57.049
I forgot about the fact that
chlorine here has got other

00:41:57.049 --> 00:42:01.532
electrons.
I just approximated it as two

00:42:01.532 --> 00:42:06.335
point charges and used the
Coulomb interaction between a

00:42:06.335 --> 00:42:11.487
bare plus charge and a bare
minus charge to get this energy,

00:42:11.487 --> 00:42:16.202
592 kilojoules per mole.
That is where that comes from.

00:42:16.202 --> 00:42:21.180
So when the sodium and chlorine
come together to this bond

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:24.935
length, well,
then they form a bond and this

00:42:24.935 --> 00:42:30.000
much energy is released within
this model here.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.538
So we're beginning to
understand what all these

00:42:33.538 --> 00:42:38.230
numbers are and physically what
is going on, except maybe what

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:42.769
is still bothering you is the
fact that it still looks like,

00:42:42.769 --> 00:42:47.384
in order for this reaction to
go, that I've got to put in 147

00:42:47.384 --> 00:42:51.769
kilojoules per mole into the
reaction before I am going to

00:42:51.769 --> 00:42:55.615
get any energy back.
It kind of looks like there is

00:42:55.615 --> 00:43:01.000
a barrier to this reaction from
what I've told you so far.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.428
But the answer is,
there isn't,

00:43:04.428 --> 00:43:11.400
because when the electron jumps
is not when the sodium and the

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:15.171
chlorine are infinitely far
apart.

00:43:15.171 --> 00:43:22.257
But when the electron jumps is
when the sodium and chlorine are

00:43:22.257 --> 00:43:26.142
right here at this value of r
star.

00:43:26.142 --> 00:43:31.866
Why right here?
Well, it happens right here

00:43:31.866 --> 00:43:35.688
because of this.
This blue line here,

00:43:35.688 --> 00:43:40.996
see this blue line?
What that is the Coulomb energy

00:43:40.996 --> 00:43:47.260
of interaction as a function of
r between two point charges,

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:50.976
plus 1 and minus 1.
So way out here,

00:43:50.976 --> 00:43:56.390
when r is very large,
that energy of interaction for

00:43:56.390 --> 00:44:02.336
these two ions is zero.
But as these two ions come

00:44:02.336 --> 00:44:06.110
closer together,
that energy of interaction

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:11.591
becomes more and more negative.
There is a 1 over r dependence

00:44:11.591 --> 00:44:14.826
here.
And that is what that blue line

00:44:14.826 --> 00:44:18.330
approximates.
At some point that Coulomb

00:44:18.330 --> 00:44:23.092
interaction energy crosses this
black curve here which

00:44:23.092 --> 00:44:28.034
represents the interaction
energy between a neutral atom

00:44:28.034 --> 00:44:33.555
and a chlorine atom.
Right here, the Coulomb

00:44:33.555 --> 00:44:40.333
interaction energy is the energy
difference between up here to

00:44:40.333 --> 00:44:44.888
down here.
Right here, this is the Coulomb

00:44:44.888 --> 00:44:50.777
interaction energy minus e
squared 4 pi epsilon nought

00:44:50.777 --> 00:44:57.000
at r star now, 
not equilibrium

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.417
distance.
At r star where the electron

00:45:01.417 --> 00:45:04.612
jumps.
Right here, this Coulomb energy

00:45:04.612 --> 00:45:09.362
of interaction equals this
energy difference between the

00:45:09.362 --> 00:45:13.334
two separated ions and the two
separated atoms.

00:45:13.334 --> 00:45:18.169
This energy difference here
measured from here to here is

00:45:18.169 --> 00:45:22.919
minus the ionization energy
minus the electron affinity.

00:45:22.919 --> 00:45:28.272
So right here this electron can
jump and it doesn't cost us any

00:45:28.272 --> 00:45:32.730
energy.
Because the Coulomb interaction

00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:36.428
has already set in.
Right here that Coulomb

00:45:36.428 --> 00:45:41.096
interaction energy is equal to
this energy difference.

00:45:41.096 --> 00:45:44.883
That is when the electron
jumps, right here.

00:45:44.883 --> 00:45:50.167
And then it is at that point
that the sodium and the chlorine

00:45:50.167 --> 00:45:55.627
are accelerated together up to
the equilibrium bond length form

00:45:55.627 --> 00:46:01.000
of bond and you have the sodium
chloride molecule.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.564
Let's calculate what this value
of r star is.

00:46:05.564 --> 00:46:10.855
At what value of r does this
electron actually jump?

00:46:10.855 --> 00:46:16.146
Well, we can do that.
This is minus e squared over 4

00:46:16.146 --> 00:46:21.645
pi epsilon nought r star.
That is going to be equal to

00:46:21.645 --> 00:46:27.351
minus the quantity ionization
energy of sodium minus the

00:46:27.351 --> 00:46:33.680
electron affinity of chlorine.

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:39.416
Let me rearrange this here.

00:46:39.416 --> 00:46:44.696
I am going to solve for r star.
r star is equal to e squared

00:46:44.696 --> 00:46:49.708
over four pi epsilon nought
times the quantity ionization

00:46:49.708 --> 00:46:54.719
energy of sodium minus the
electron affinity of chlorine.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:14.096
r star is equal to e squared,
e squared is 1.602x10^-19

00:47:14.096 --> 00:47:19.741
Coulombs squared over four pi
epsilon nought,

00:47:19.741 --> 00:47:24.709
you can look up epsilon nought,

00:47:24.709 --> 00:47:29.000
times this difference in
energy.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:36.102
The ionization energy of sodium
minus the electron affinity of

00:47:36.102 --> 00:47:42.972
chlorine, which way over here we
said was 147 kilojoules per

00:47:42.972 --> 00:47:47.047
mole.
So let me put that into joules

00:47:47.047 --> 00:47:53.219
so my units are consistent,
1.47x10^5 joules per mole.

00:47:53.219 --> 00:47:59.157
But now, be careful here.
When you calculate r star,

00:47:59.157 --> 00:48:06.230
this is for a molecule.
Not for a mole of molecules.

00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:13.500
I've got to change all of these
things that are in here per mole

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:18.461
to molecules,
so I have got to multiply this

00:48:18.461 --> 00:48:22.269
by 6.022x10^23 molecules per
mole.

00:48:22.269 --> 00:48:30.000
And then the value of r star is
equal to 9.45x10^-10 meters.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.845
That is when the electron
jumps.

00:48:33.845 --> 00:48:40.917
Let's draw a picture of what
actually the relative size is

00:48:40.917 --> 00:48:44.639
here.
So we have a sodium atom.

00:48:44.639 --> 00:48:51.338
That sodium atom has a diameter
of about 3.8 angstroms.

00:48:51.338 --> 00:48:57.789
And we have a chlorine atom.
That chlorine atom has a

00:48:57.789 --> 00:49:05.090
diameter of about two angstroms.
It is 9.45 angstroms.

00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:10.466
That is the distance between
those two neutral species,

00:49:10.466 --> 00:49:15.244
when that electron jump process
actually happens.

00:49:15.244 --> 00:49:20.918
So they are pretty far apart,
pretty far apart compared to

00:49:20.918 --> 00:49:25.000
the bond length of 2.36
angstroms.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.666
And, indeed,
it turns out that this number,

00:49:29.666 --> 00:49:35.555
9.45 angstroms is very,
very close to what is measured

00:49:35.555 --> 00:49:41.555
experimentally when that
electron jump process happens.

00:49:41.555 --> 00:49:47.555
This simple model treating
sodium and chlorine as point

00:49:47.555 --> 00:49:52.111
charges works,
but it works because sodium

00:49:52.111 --> 00:49:58.888
chloride is a very ionic bond.
This simple model will not work

00:49:58.888 --> 00:50:04.000
for bonds that are not very
ionic.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.755
All right?
Okay.

00:50:05.755 --> 00:50:06.755
See you Friday.
