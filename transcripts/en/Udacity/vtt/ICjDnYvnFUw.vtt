00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Welcome to Unit 7. This is the conclusion of the class.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I hope everyone's enjoyed it and learned a lot about cryptography.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I'll summarize the class briefly, and then I will talk about one new protocol

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and one new application of cryptography to do secure computation.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
One important point that I want to make today that I haven't made throughout the class enough

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
is that cryptography is very different from security.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
When we're thinking about cryptography, these are very abstract things.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We're thinking about whether we can use math to solve problems.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
On the other hand, security depends on a lot more than just cryptography.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Security is really mostly about people.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
No matter how good your math is,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
if someone picks "123456" for their password, it doesn't matter.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
You're not going to have security.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Security is also about the systems and how they interface with each other.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Many of the security problems are because of misunderstanding the connections between systems.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
In this class, we've largely focused on cryptography

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and not addressed the broader issues about security.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
But if you want to build secure systems, well these issues are very important.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
It's not just about the math.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Cryptography is all about secrets,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and we've seen lots and lots of ways to use secrets to solve problems.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
We started in Unit 1, looking at the one-time pad,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
where we could XOR a message with a key.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And we saw that that provides perfect secrecy in a strong theoretical sense

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
that an eavesdropper who intercepts this message can learn nothing at all about the message.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
But that it requires a perfectly random key that's never re-used that's as long as the message.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So it doesn't work well in practice.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
It also has all sorts of other problems like the malleability of the one-time pad.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
This led us in Unit 2 to look at some ways to use practical symmetric ciphers

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
to provide nothing close to perfect secrecy, but something useful for many purposes.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
We saw that we could amplify the security provided by a small shared key

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
to obtain a secure channel for sending long messages.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And we've talked about modes of operation that can do that with different levels of security.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And then we talked about cryptographic hash functions,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
which provide a way to map a message to a smaller value that provides pre-image resistance

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
so it's hard to find a message that hashes that value as well as collision resistance.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And this is usual for authentication as well as lots of other purposes that we've seen.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
The big limitation of symmetric ciphers is they require a shared secret between the two parties.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
In Unit 3, we talked about key distribution focusing on the Diffie-Hellman protocol for key agreement.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And that allows the 2 parties to establish a shared secret starting from an insecure channel.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
That led to asymmetric cryptosystems,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
in particular RSA as an example of a public key cryptosystem.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
That provide the additional functionality where the encryption function

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
doesn't reveal the decryption function.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
This enables lots of interesting uses of cryptography.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
In Unit 5, we saw how to use public key combined with symmetric ciphers to provide authentication.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And we focused in particular on the TLS protocol

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
that's used as the basis for electronic commerce on the web.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
In Unit 6, we looked at protocols for anonymous routing, voting, and digital cash -

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
all of which combined a mix of asymmetric and symmetric cryptosystems.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So I hope you've enjoyed this tour of cryptography.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
We've seen lots of different things that can be built from a few simple primitives.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
I'm going to cover one more protocol in this unit, which is looking at secure computation.

00:03:26.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And it uses many of the tools that we've seen in all of these previous units.
