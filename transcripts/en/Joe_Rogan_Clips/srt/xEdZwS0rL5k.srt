1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,090
Or teases past his prime
[inaudible] down there. Louis. Yes.

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:09,460
These prime. He's a good fighter.
But you know, give him, give him,

3
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:14,200
give him like 10 years. Yeah. And he
would've, he would've beat these guys.

4
00:00:14,201 --> 00:00:18,040
He would have given them a good, good
fight. But right now he's, you know,

5
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:22,390
he's obviously older and um,
he's an old fighter. Yeah.

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,350
Well they caught him doing some steroids.
A lot of times guys get older,

7
00:00:26,351 --> 00:00:30,280
they try to, yeah. You need it chews
up the old body. Yeah. So, you know,

8
00:00:30,281 --> 00:00:33,640
when you reached that point where you
need steroids mentally, it affects you.

9
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,540
You know, you go into the ring and it's
like, you know, you're missing something.

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,260
Something that was there in the past
and it made you feel good. Now. Um,

11
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,340
I don't feel as good. When
you were fighting, did
anybody that you were finding,

12
00:00:45,341 --> 00:00:49,870
did you suspect that they
were on something? Um, yeah.
Oh, a couple times. Yeah.

13
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:55,170
But the good thing is that I know is I
realized theorized steroids can never get

14
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:02,500
this strong. Your Chin. Chin. Yeah. So you
can take as much through as, as you want.

15
00:01:02,501 --> 00:01:05,710
But I'm going to hitting you on the chin.
You can't put muscles in your face.

16
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,540
Yeah. Yeah. And then you know
these body punches, you can't,

17
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:14,990
you can't protect around here, so they'll
affect you as well. So that's where you,

18
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,620
you know when you hit,
when you hit the guys around here,

19
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,400
body punches and you hit him on the chin.
Doesn't matter.

20
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:25,450
But don't you think that it does,
it makes them stronger physically,

21
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:26,560
gives them more vitality.

22
00:01:26,561 --> 00:01:30,160
It might make them able to absorb more
punishment for a minute. For minute.

23
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,870
Just for a little bit.
Yeah, for a little bit.

24
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,320
Who did you suspect was on
something when you follow them? Um,

25
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,230
I don't want to say you
don't want, yeah, go ahead.

26
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,260
Go ahead Nick Vander I plow.

27
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,780
Vander was the first guy
as far as I'm concerned,

28
00:01:43,781 --> 00:01:45,590
was the first guy on
steroids back in the day.

29
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,940
They look at the fucking
size of that guy in the,

30
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:51,220
in the late nineties especially
when he filed the clinics.

31
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,100
Have you ever asked him if
he's been on steroids now?

32
00:01:54,101 --> 00:01:55,510
I've never actually
hung out with a vendor.

33
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,580
I might've make your victory party 20
years ago to hanging around with the PE

34
00:01:59,581 --> 00:02:03,890
guys that were like into it. I didn't
know mark, whatever his name was, his,

35
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,800
he was the first guy to have like a
strength and conditioning coach and,

36
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:10,970
and all that kind of stuff's Dietitian.
Spanx did when he fought. Um,

37
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,750
when you fought Larry Holmes, he guy,
same guy. Mackey shall stone. Yeah.

38
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,361
Mackey shells.

39
00:02:15,361 --> 00:02:18,130
Stone got him in shape for Larry when
he was coming up from light heavyweight.

40
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,610
Yeah. That's the same guy that
Vander used and they're doing,

41
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:26,820
it was really interesting because at the
time the conventional wisdom was that

42
00:02:27,171 --> 00:02:29,590
box or should not lift weights
and the Vander was lifted,

43
00:02:29,591 --> 00:02:31,990
all kinds of weights and
he put on all this muscle,

44
00:02:31,991 --> 00:02:36,580
but really he was only about 200,
205 pounds when he first fought fog.

45
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,530
Heavy traps. Oh yeah. Jesus Christ.
He was built, it was built. It was PR.

46
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,730
Perfect body. Yeah. That's not steroids.

47
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:47,330
Steroids,

48
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:52,000
but necessarily you definitely
can get that big without it.

49
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:56,590
I mean there are guys, the words
allegedly, yeah. Alleged a good word,

50
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,170
but it's also possible to
get that big with steroids.

51
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,980
But it's not just steroids too. It's
EPO. There's a look at that one up there.

52
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,410
Yeah. But this is in the
night, eighties and nineties.

53
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,130
The good stuff wasn't available
back then, was it? Oh yeah.

54
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,520
What are you kidding me man?
Those Russians had everything
back then, man. I mean,

55
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:16,730
the eastern bloc women, they made world
records. That was when he was a, uh,

56
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,090
that was when he was a cruiserweight
look how thin he was. Yeah.

57
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:22,660
But you can't call them women if they
have the most [inaudible] penises,

58
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,540
fake beards and fat dicks.
They were, they were,

59
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:29,190
they set records that still to
this day haven't been broken. Wow.

60
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,900
And because they really were not women.
I mean,

61
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:36,070
there were women with massive amounts
of male hormones in their body. Flo Jo.

62
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,100
Yeah. She's, she's, uh,

63
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:42,970
thinks still sets the record right
now for what, whatever it was.

64
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:47,950
And she was also someone that was accused
of doing things. Yeah. I mean look,

65
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:52,900
track and field according to victor
contact, um, who uh, was the balco guy,

66
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,720
I had him on my podcast.
He was the guy that got um,

67
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:00,010
the clear to Barry bonds and all
those guys will undetected supposedly

68
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:03,730
undetectable steroids. He said track
and field is just a dirty sport,

69
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,300
just like Tour de France,
like just like cycling.

70
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:09,190
He's like disappointed them dirty sport.

71
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,250
You've got cars Louis trying to
call out Hussein bolt now. Right?

72
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,130
What are you showing us,
Janice at the top 100 meter times.

73
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,030
All the names crossed out.
Oh Wow. Steroids. Wow.

74
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,910
God Damn.

75
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,470
Well that's like when a Lance Armstrong
won the Tour de France and they took his

76
00:04:26,471 --> 00:04:27,304
title away.

77
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,270
If you had to give that title to someone
who didn't test positive for anything,

78
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,450
you had to go back to 18th place.
Wow.

79
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,940
I was a dirty sport. You know, Bill
Burke said it best. He's like, he goes,

80
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:43,150
our psycho is better than your psycho.
They were all, you were all dirty.

81
00:04:43,151 --> 00:04:47,380
There's a dirty sport. He was just better
at doing that sport while being dirty.

82
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,710
Yeah. If everybody's dirty,
then it's fair. Well, he won.

83
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:54,190
He won while everybody was
cheating. But I mean, did he have,

84
00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:58,600
so is it still cheating if everybody's
doing it? It is and it isn't. I mean,

85
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:02,620
it is definitely cheating, but
everybody's cheating. Yes. Weird.

86
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,850
It's not good. See, you know, they
went off to the wrong thing. You know,

87
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:09,850
people were looking for drugs
to help them get stronger.

88
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,570
When it's not true food
that makes you stronger,

89
00:05:12,571 --> 00:05:17,050
that's what you put into your system.
So you know, I know what you make them.

90
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:20,560
Food is great. You know,
yams, plantains, everything.

91
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:24,790
Beef bully beef, you know what's
better than that? That's that steroids.

92
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,470
Steroids are way better.

93
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,840
They work instantly better
if you just stay on them.

94
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,060
Like guys like Lance Armstrong,
they proved it.

95
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,340
You almost can't do toward the fronts
the way they were doing it without some

96
00:05:39,341 --> 00:05:43,090
sort of chemical help. Like I've
heard it argued by physiologists.

97
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:48,010
They say it's actually better for your
body to be on steroids while you're doing

98
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:51,550
something like the Tour de France because
you give your body a chance to recover

99
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:56,730
because they're doing so much work over
the course of this race that without

100
00:05:57,101 --> 00:06:00,780
having some sort of chemical enhancement
of your ability to recover, you do.

101
00:06:00,781 --> 00:06:03,440
You just not going to be able to do it.
Help out your body, can't do it right.

102
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:03,880
The town.
