&gt;&gt;Steve: We're very lucky to have Dr. Robert
Grudin here, who a few months ago finished

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:11.110
off a book called "Design and Truth," which,
if you haven't read it, there are order forms,

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.400
I think, on the way in. It's an excellent
book; I've read it myself. He's an accomplished

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.990
author. I'm gonna read a few things about
his biography and then we'll let Robert begin

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.320
with his reading. Robert graduated from Harvard
and received a Ph.D. in comparative lit from

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.520
the University of California at Berkeley where
he now lives. He's a Professor Emeritus in

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:37.170
English at the University of Oregon. Professor
Grudin's literary explorations have taken

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.820
him through a variety of literary genres,
from an encyclopedic article to Internet journalism.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.340
He's been credited with major contributions
to five different publishing fields. Throughout

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.070
his career, he's pursued the study of liberty;
it's genesis in the mind and its implications

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.710
in the real world. His work has been widely
reviewed and his many public appearances include

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.309
lectures to professional societies in the
science, technology, business, design, government,

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.850
medicine, education, political science and
creative writing. He was a Guggenheim Fellow

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.480
in 1992 and 1993. And as I said, he's here
to talk today about his book, "Design and

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.260
Truth." At Google, we think a lot about design
and so Roberts' gonna take us back to the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.200
roots of that idea and help us explore a bit
further. Roberts' actually also a personal

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:23.470
friend of mine. His son Nick and I went to
graduate school together. This weekend, Robert

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.690
saw his older son get married and for the
first time saw his first grandchild, so it's

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:30.690
an exciting trip out here to New York and
we're glad to have him here with us today

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:31.690
at Google. Robert, thank you.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:32.690
[applause]

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:47.750
&gt;&gt;Robert: Thanks a lot, Steve and thank you
Google and Jay Clugston for bringing me here.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.070
Just as a word of caution, the marriage and
the first grandchild were two different sons.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.170
[laughter]

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:04.240
I've got three brief episodes to share with
you today. One of, one of them is a blog that

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.140
I did about the book and then there are two
from the book. And then I hope we'll have

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:19.299
time for Q&amp;A. And the reason I chose these
three is that they are all, in a sense, unfamiliar

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:29.090
aspects of design. Until I started writing
this book, I thought of design as a -- I wasn't

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:36.720
a professional designer-- I thought of design
as a profession and I also thought of it as

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:44.049
an art. When I started writing this book,
I decided that design was also a philosophy;

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:51.981
a way of living. And that's what moti-, motivated
me through the course of my composition and

00:02:51.981 --> 00:03:00.040
does so now. I'm now going to take off my
hat. And the reason for this hat today, is

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.430
not the blinding sun, but that this hat has
some relevance to what I'm going to talk to

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:13.650
you about today. And it is a Polo Ralph Lauren
and they're not paying me.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.310
[laughter]

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:24.409
So, first is the blog and you can find this
on Powell's Blogs by Googling my name and,

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:27.340
and any big noun that I might use--

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.340
[Robert laughs]

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.340
in the course of writing this.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.989
[reads]

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.109
"Recently, I read a blog by a writer who was
in the course of a book tour."

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:43.480
I, those are the most boring blogs you can
possibly read, by the way. I went to this

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.140
place and gave a talk and then I went to this
next place and well, anyway.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.439
"It brought to mind the mini tour I'm about
to make and a few earlier ones, which range

00:03:53.439 --> 00:04:01.609
from the hilarious to the humiliating. And
it also reminded me that the only menu item

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:12.549
you can order with any confidence in all 50
states is ribs. Try something else in all

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:23.879
50 states. Writers in general are nesting
wildlife, and as one of them, the most edifying

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:29.830
book tour I can think of is the long series
of nests that, over the years, I have built

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:36.680
for the silent performances of my task. As
I sit in this kind of crow's nest that I've

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:43.650
set up in the Berkeley Hills, where I live
now,--"

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.180
Where are you?

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:54.460
"Glancing now and then at the wall of rain
coming in from the bay, I think back on 10

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:03.200
or so earlier nesting attempts. The most exotic
is on Maui: a large room, windowed and screened

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:09.990
on three sides, where I sometimes sit at an
oak desk, writing away to the tune of screeching

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:20.740
francolins--they're one of the worlds loudest
birds-- eloquent sparrows, confiding doves,

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:29.270
the occasional thump of a falling avocado,
which at my house get up to two pounds apiece,

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:36.560
and the more or less constant ground bass
of gas-powered leaf-blowers from the neighbors'

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.380
yards.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:45.860
But the two writer's nests that are most vivid
in memory are the following: There is the

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:52.229
academic jungle I set up in my University
of Oregon office when I was doing research

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:53.259
on a long article."

00:05:53.259 --> 00:06:02.990
And I had been assigned to write an article
on the history of humanism. Now, I did not

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:10.120
know the history of humanism and why the board
at the Britannica set me up to do it was that

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:17.740
the little bit of humanism that I knew impressed
them. There's no, I also thought back, there

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:24.810
was no scholar I knew, living or dead, who
knew the full history of humanism. So, I had

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:32.169
a lot of studying to do. And I set up my,
my writer's studio in my office, my office

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:39.479
was nine by fifteen feet, in the following
way: You'll have to think back, perhaps, at

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:50.099
the fabric picture hooks. You would have to
lick them. Do they still have those around?

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:55.539
Anyway, you had to lick them until you almost
got sick to your stomach and then hold them

00:06:55.539 --> 00:07:03.180
and press them against the wall. I set these
up on the ceiling and then, as I see from

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:08.860
the audience, most of you will have to look
back and imagine the early computer printers.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:17.430
This was late 1984, or early 1985 and the
printers you could buy then for personal use

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:24.680
were all tractor-feed. Now, tractor-feed,
right now, would look very, very clumsy and

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:34.600
extremely commercial. It did have some advantages
and that is you could hold a whole article

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:40.880
or even a whole book together and if it started
falling apart, you could just drag it behind

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:49.740
you like some, some kind of tail. Anyway,
I, I would take my notes for this kind of

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:58.580
research I was doing, which was major; thousands
and thousands of words of notes. And I had

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:04.879
a little ladder, a step ladder, I had all
these hooks on the ceiling and I would drape

00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:15.190
the tractor-feed over it so that I could multi-task.
That was my early ways of multi-tasking. I

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:23.139
could jump up from my seat and move from one
hanging tractor-feed set of notes to another

00:08:23.139 --> 00:08:31.659
as I was typing the article in. Well, the
upshot of all this was that my office looked

00:08:31.659 --> 00:08:39.370
like a jungle with sheets of tractor-feed
hanging down. And the sides of the office

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:44.350
were covered with books that wouldn't fit
in my already full bookcases, so I stacked

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:51.300
them. And fortunately, this accident didn't
happen until I had almost finished the article,

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:57.680
but at one point when I was trying to readjust
something, two or three piles of books came

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:04.880
down me from the ceiling, carrying with them
a festoon of tractor-feed. And I was in this

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:11.640
pile of books and tractor-feed on the floor
and unfortunately, I had, I had a guest at

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:20.480
the time so I had to wave to him, "Everything's
ok," out of the pile. That's one way an author,

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:31.410
at one point in time, designs his own nest.

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:36.810
Ok, I don't have to read from this thing anymore.
The second really dramatic thing had happened

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:45.760
a few years before, and that was that I was
on a sabbatical to, to write a book. And it

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:52.490
ended up being my book on time, which is just
a bunch of meditations. And we were forced

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:59.731
from our, our splendid house in Spain back
to Carmel Valley, California, where we had

00:09:59.731 --> 00:10:07.570
a wonderful, we had a medical emergency, we
had, everything worked out ok. But we had

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:16.830
a wonderful invitation to come to Carmel that
had support from many, many friends on both

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:20.440
sides of, of the continent. Found a little
house in Carmel and the only place I could

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:25.940
write in this house was in an al-, a kind
of alcove. It would've been the size of a

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:38.160
small walk-in closet, except that it had a
window. And I could just barely fit in. There

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:50.389
was a table there and I had a pen and a notebook.
And it was perfect for me. I didn't feel the

00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:57.410
claustrophobia that I do now when I get into
a room that small. I felt that I was completely

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:04.150
at home because I was so fascinated by the
book that I was writing, that the book had

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:13.360
become, in a sense, my house. Now, just think
about that. Think of a, of a project that

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:21.730
you have, an on-going project, that is so
absorbing that it, in a sense, becomes your

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:34.579
physical world. Another way I could put it,
and this is really specific to my book, is

00:11:34.579 --> 00:11:42.089
that it was a house of time. When you are
on a long, long project and you're sort of

00:11:42.089 --> 00:11:47.699
in charge, or you have a major responsibility
in it the way every member of a team should,

00:11:47.699 --> 00:11:57.959
in a well working team, it becomes your own.
It becomes something that you enter. It becomes

00:11:57.959 --> 00:12:06.850
a private room, or maybe a dialogic room that
you realize you can enter again and again

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:11.710
and you can call that a house of time.

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:19.670
And it's an interesting way of, of looking
at things that you do. Ok, if there's Q&amp;A

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:28.060
on that, save it for the end because I'm not
sure how long the next section is going to

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:37.170
take. The next section has to do with building
and restoring furniture. And designing and

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:45.509
building furniture, very simple furniture,
is the only design work, aside from writing,

00:12:45.509 --> 00:12:52.259
that I've ever done in my life. And now I'm
going to take you even farther back in time

00:12:52.259 --> 00:13:01.440
to the middle 1970s when my wife and I and
our growing family were working in Eugene,

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:06.110
Oregon. This is a section called The Baker's
Table.

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:08.259
[reads from book]

00:13:08.259 --> 00:13:15.220
"I have a theory about social class that goes
like this: No matter how much money you make,

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:21.350
you are upper class if you spend less than
you earn, and you are lower class if you spend

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:28.350
more than you earn. And if you spend exactly
what you earn, give or take a hundred bucks

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:33.339
or so a month, then you are anxious class.

00:13:33.339 --> 00:13:38.870
"My wife and I belonged to the anxious class
when we were bringing up our kids. We worked

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:46.509
hard and spent our monthly checks. The mortgage
got paid, and bread was on the table. A pre-owned

00:13:46.509 --> 00:13:53.340
car was always parked on the steep driveway
of our hillside house, presumably ready to

00:13:53.340 --> 00:14:00.730
head for campus or take the kids to soccer.
But ideas like buying a new car or taking

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:05.860
a hotel vacation were simply out of the question.

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:11.709
"Buying decent furniture was also well beyond
our means. But lumber was cheap, so I started

00:14:11.709 --> 00:14:15.529
building tables."

00:14:15.529 --> 00:14:22.259
And the way to start building your own stuff,
of course, is not an apartment unless you

00:14:22.259 --> 00:14:29.589
have a loft. You need a little studio; you
need a workbench. As it turned out, I found

00:14:29.589 --> 00:14:37.569
a Xerox of a design for a workbench that a
friend gave me from Mechanics Illustrated.

00:14:37.569 --> 00:14:46.009
So, I was able to build a workbench simply
out of used two by fours. So, I got this workbench.

00:14:46.009 --> 00:14:54.860
I had a tiny, tiny basement that Nick and
Nisha remember well, and I started decorating

00:14:54.860 --> 00:15:03.420
it with tennis posters. I put a vice; I bought
a really heavy vice and put it on the workbench.

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:11.660
And that's the very first thing to do if you're
building anything, is to get yourself a vice

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:15.770
because it's like having a friend help you
and I got some simple power tools and started

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:17.269
building stuff.

00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:18.769
[continues reading]

00:15:18.769 --> 00:15:22.610
"I designed an oak baby-changing table."

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:30.019
I'm not sure anyone else has ever designed
a baby-changing table. Mine would not have

00:15:30.019 --> 00:15:35.089
worked because it didn't have any means of
restraining a baby rolling off the top. So

00:15:35.089 --> 00:15:42.550
it was never used as a baby-changing table,
but nonetheless, it looked pretty good I must

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:46.560
say. It's all oak.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.560
[continues reading]

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:55.810
"I designed a coffee table, that's something
that we still have and an end table and had

00:15:55.810 --> 00:16:02.650
them assembled by the experts at a local wood
shop. These were too hard to do at home because

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:08.740
they, because they required diagonal cuts
and I didn't have that machine.

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:14.959
"Have I since become a famous furniture designer
with merchandise for sale at Skymall.com?

00:16:14.959 --> 00:16:22.860
Not quite. But these tables taught me something.
I realized that by designing them I had turned

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:31.220
impoverishment into enterprise. I had transcended
my own inhibiting academic world and briefly

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:38.389
explored the material presences of daily life.
I had freed my eyes and hands to converse

00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:46.630
with a varieties of shape and substance. I
had engaged my little world and changed it."

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:51.980
And that's what you do when you design and
build something, or have it built. Ever so

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:55.950
slightly, you change the world.

00:16:55.950 --> 00:17:01.589
"For these reasons, there is something special
for me about the practice of design.

00:17:01.589 --> 00:17:07.409
"My tables brightened up the living room and
had a generally civilizing influence on the

00:17:07.409 --> 00:17:13.630
house. But we still had no dining table, and
at a dining table I drew the line. My design

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:17.929
talents did not extend to the gracious and
the festive."

00:17:17.929 --> 00:17:22.641
By the way, in case any of you are interested,
I can now design a dining table.

00:17:22.641 --> 00:17:24.320
[laughter]

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:30.450
For a very modest price of a few thousand
bucks and in case any of you want one, just

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:40.530
get in touch. Very unusual design, I'll tell
you, but quite practical.

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:47.990
"That’s where Bill and Duffy Baker came
in. They lived very near us in a big red house

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:52.289
and they had a, they had a big great barn
behind it. They owned a few retail businesses

00:17:52.289 --> 00:17:58.690
in the campus village, including Duffy’s,
the saloon of choice for fraternities and

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:05.659
varsity athletes. Bill had a thing about furniture.
His house was crowded with antiques and handmade

00:18:05.659 --> 00:18:12.840
pieces, including a classy four-poster bed.
His barn was full of old stuff in the various

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:16.980
stages, in various stages of restoration or
decay.

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:23.950
"A gala garage sale at the Baker barn in the
late 1970s coincided, as it happened, with

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:30.640
my peaking anxious-class frustration and the
semiannual lust to start making mischief with

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:36.140
a piece of wood. When I told Bill that I needed
a good dining table but could not pay much

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:41.770
for it, he said, “Bob, I’ve got just the
thing for you!” and he led me back into

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:48.510
the darkly stacked reaches of the Baker Barn,
on the way trying to sell me his spare four-poster

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:54.890
bed, which was this enormous thing. A ray
of sunlight in back caught the object of Bill’s

00:18:54.890 --> 00:19:00.860
search, and soon I stood looking at the massive
oak table that would become, more than I thought

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:06.430
possible for an inanimate object, our family
icon for the next quarter-century."

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:14.159
And this is the table that still sits, I've
had to redo it twice now, but it still sits

00:19:14.159 --> 00:19:22.650
in our dining room in Berkeley. By the way,
the table was built in around 1900, in a factory

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:30.990
in Fon du Lac. Where is Fon du Lac, Wisconsin
or Michigan? Wisconsin. Where the furniture

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:37.030
building at that part, at that part of American
history, a large part of the furniture building

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:39.520
was done in Fon du Lac.

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:40.520
[continues reading]

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:47.750
"The table, the table was a daunting prospect.
Most of the original finish was missing, exposing

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:55.789
wood that was alternately dried out or stained;
patches of foggy shellac still clung to other

00:19:55.789 --> 00:20:06.750
areas. The five spiral-turned heavy legs--the
middle one was to hold up extra leaves for

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:13.300
the middle of the table-- looked solid enough
but would require hours of cleaning up and

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:18.710
staining. There were no extra leaves, and
one of the dowels, which was supposed to slide

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:26.440
into holes as the table was closed, was broken
off. But worst of all was the veneer top.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:32.870
Thumbnail-sized bits were missing altogether.
Large areas of veneer, frayed at the edges

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:39.429
and completely desiccated, had parted from
the surface and curled inches into the air,

00:20:39.429 --> 00:20:43.940
as though in defiance of anyone brash enough
to attempt a repair."

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:48.230
Ju-just imagine looking at that if you didn't
know anything about furniture restoration.

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:49.450
[continues reading]

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:54.570
"I said to Bill that it looked like a tough
fix.

00:20:54.570 --> 00:21:01.100
“Piece of cake, Bob. I’ll talk you through
it,” he said, taking my hundred dollars.

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:06.380
"For the next two months the table stood in
my garage, getting attention. After much advice

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:12.650
from Bill, and my friend Bill Rockett, and
others, I turned to the job of compelling

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:21.450
the rampant veneer to sit down where it belonged.
I moisturized the ancient sheet of wood, very,

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:29.029
very thin, until it was pliant but not soaked.
Then I wiped off the liquid residue and pressed

00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:37.779
the veneer down in place on a bed of glue.
I stabilized it with plywood, braced the job

00:21:37.779 --> 00:21:42.200
with a large cinder block, and left it overnight.
This worked."

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:48.679
It wasn't curling up anymore. It was lying
flat the way it had been when it was built

00:21:48.679 --> 00:21:51.490
at Fon du Lac all those years before.

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:53.090
[reads]

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:57.980
"When I removed the block and plywood the
next morning, the thing in the garage looked

00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:00.690
like a table again.

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:06.270
"That afternoon I picked up a small package
of oak veneer and an Exacto knife at the Planing

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:13.350
Mill, lined up grain with grain, and cut tiny
pieces in the shape of each damaged portion

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:21.250
of the surface. Once in place, these were
also glued and braced.

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:30.120
"Over the next few weekends, cutting a dowel,
bleaching stains, removing old varnish, sanding,

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:38.770
applying red oak finish, sanding again, finishing,
sanding, finishing, I completed the restoration.

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:46.159
No boredom in that job. Often at work I was
suffused with a quiet joy. The table was becoming

00:22:46.159 --> 00:22:51.169
a thing of beauty. I was bringing it back
to myself."

00:22:51.169 --> 00:22:58.360
So here in the simple job of restoration,
you have a new relationship to design because

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:05.271
you're restoring the design of something that
was past. You're bringing back the past. And

00:23:05.271 --> 00:23:13.020
with all of that in mind, I'd like to recommend
to you Eric Sloane's marvelous series of books

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:22.740
on antique wood, furniture, barns and tools,
which he illustrated himself and that's Sloane

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:29.419
with an "E" on the end. He wrote some of my
favorite books that I'm always re-read-, looking

00:23:29.419 --> 00:23:31.560
for to re-read.

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:32.560
[reads]

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:37.840
"Not that it wasn’t bringing things back
to me. Restoring beautiful and useful things

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:44.950
of the past, particularly items of family
use, is about as close as we can get to restoring

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:53.700
the past itself. The feedback is little short
of spiritual. As I lavished care on the table

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:59.520
I was taken back into the world of my earliest
memories, when, in my grandparents’ dining

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:07.690
room on Hewes Street in Brooklyn, my head
had gained enough altitude for me to notice

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:13.210
that the big cherry-wood dining table was
covered with a layer of glass. Occasionally

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:19.899
this glass was lifted to allow for the insertion
of some new piece of national history, clipped

00:24:19.899 --> 00:24:26.659
from a morning paper, the last of which was
the shocking notice, complete with photograph,

00:24:26.659 --> 00:24:37.940
that President Roosevelt had died suddenly
in Warm Springs, Georgia, on April 12, 1945.

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:43.770
"It was at this glass-covered table, my legs
dangling from the seat of a claw-foot chair,

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:51.270
that I first took note of design and invention,
when my grandfather Julius Carlson announced

00:24:51.270 --> 00:25:01.750
to me, in his high-pitched monotone, that
he had invented the adjustable cap."

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:11.490
So, I found this in a park in Berkeley about
a month ago, and I kept it, of course. And

00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:19.789
it got lost at the wedding, but it was found
for me by a faithful son. And this is a version

00:25:19.789 --> 00:25:30.870
of the adjustable cap of which Julius Carlson,
between 1921 and 1929, took out four patents.

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:38.350
Some of them look rather like this, not exactly,
and others are very different, but Julius

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:45.390
spent almost the whole of his 91 year life
fighting for the funds that came from those

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:51.649
patents and I think, not getting a cent out
of it. And that all has to do with the age

00:25:51.649 --> 00:25:59.740
old conflict between the man or woman who's
hired to invent or design and gets, actually

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:17.520
gets the patent and the company, who has contracted
him and is paying him to do the designing.

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.419
[reads]

00:26:19.419 --> 00:26:25.990
"What finally became of my grandfather’s
glass-topped cherry-wood table? As I stroked

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:33.400
on a second coat of shellac, I supposed that
I could track it down, but to what good? Restoring

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:39.529
my own table had brought me to see it with
the eyes of the past, as only a child can

00:26:39.529 --> 00:26:45.880
see it, and now that image would be mine forever.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:51.460
"A few days later, when the finish had cured
out, we carried Bill Baker’s table out of

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:58.770
the garage and set it down in the dining area,
which looked east toward the kitchen counter

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:06.180
and west toward a stand of Douglas fir. This
was in the hills of Oregon. It was splendid.

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:13.240
It completed the house as a family domain.
As it stood in that spot for the next twenty-five

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:19.990
years offering food and cheer as three kids
grew up and three cycles of dogs, stretched

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:26.760
out on a nearby carpet, listened to our friendly
chatter as soothing music or were troubled

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.409
by sudden stridencies."

00:27:29.409 --> 00:27:35.799
I remember lots of kids banging their heads
on that table.

[reads]

00:27:36.799 --> 00:27:42.290
"In my journal I describe a scene from the
mid-1980s, when Ted, our youngest, was four

00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:52.510
years old and sitting at the oak table. This
is April 23rd, 1987: Troubles with Anthony

00:27:52.510 --> 00:28:00.519
and Nicholas vanished in the magic of the
15th and Onyx parting; that's where I dropped

00:28:00.519 --> 00:28:11.250
them off. But Ted opened a new canto by refusing
to go to his daycare. As he put it, “Boring.”

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:19.040
I dragged him there via indirect routes, including
an elevator. I bet he’s right. At his frenetic

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:24.659
pace of growth, he has outgrown himself and
needs some new challenge. After squabble number

00:28:24.659 --> 00:28:32.510
one this morning, he asked me over the Cream
of Wheat, quote, “What is the future? Can

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:41.919
I see it?” Told, I told him only his mind
could see it, that he closed his eyes, had

00:28:41.919 --> 00:28:48.440
to close his eyes. So he did, and I began
trying to drum up Anthony as a big man, Nick

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:59.130
as a big man, Teddy as paterfamilias with
kids and beloved wife.

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:05.149
"In those days the oak table, situated as
it was at the hub of our indoor activities,

00:29:05.149 --> 00:29:10.919
had become the center and symbol of family
communication and sharing. It attracted and

00:29:10.919 --> 00:29:18.940
hosted the disorderly Grudin version of the
tea ceremony. Its broad square surface and

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:25.659
rich brown texture created a human space that
was always inviting, always available. Its

00:29:25.659 --> 00:29:33.611
waterproof skin accommodated hot cups and
chilled glasses a lot, alike. Its ample center

00:29:33.611 --> 00:29:40.779
almost cried out for a turkey or birthday
cake or major salad bowl. It certainly was

00:29:40.779 --> 00:29:47.740
in part the inspiration for the scores of
richly glazed cups, plates, and bowls that

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:55.450
my wife, and soon Nick, too, turned out on
the potter’s wheel on the deck and fired

00:29:55.450 --> 00:30:04.690
at a local kiln. It faithfully fulfilled the
purpose of all dining-room furniture: facilitating

00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:07.460
and enriching human dialogue."

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:16.289
I'm sorry I can't go on more with that section,
which I must say, gets rather sentimental.

00:30:16.289 --> 00:30:25.540
But there you have an idea that I think some
designers have forgotten and that is the idea

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:36.070
that a piece of furniture that actually becomes
a member of the family. And that is truly

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:45.190
dialogic in terms of what it provides for
the family. So, I'll do one more quick section

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:55.710
and then we'll do a Q of A. I'm now going
to bring you up to September 2001, and 9/11.

00:30:55.710 --> 00:31:04.370
I've got two chapters of this book about 9/11.
One of them is a rather complicated revisionist

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:11.429
history of the World Trade Center from beginning
to end. And the other one has to do with the

00:31:11.429 --> 00:31:20.929
psychiatric conference. Every year for the
last 20 years, my wife Nisha and I--Nisha

00:31:20.929 --> 00:31:31.250
is a-a-a scholar with a talent for doing drama,
or at least talking about it. We've been invited

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:39.590
to a big psychiatric conference to talk about
the plays that are put on at Ashland. And

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:45.510
this conference was going to be on, I think,
start on the 14th, had already cancelled our

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:56.960
airline tickets and we were going to drive
down. But I'll introduce this because this

00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:04.440
is actually a chapter about psychological
design that occurs in many different ways.

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.440
[reads]

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:11.580
"How do we manage the private thoughts and
pent-up emotions that are the inevitable legacy

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:18.149
of our personal experiences? To some extent,
we can regulate our private knowledge consciously;

00:32:18.149 --> 00:32:21.669
the way trainers control and train a dog."

00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:28.740
Like, you're at a counter and you're mad at
a server or, or someone who's selling you

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:34.669
a ticket and should be selling you the ticket
and is doing something else. And you get angry,

00:32:34.669 --> 00:32:38.019
but you control it.

00:32:38.019 --> 00:32:44.360
"But our inner energies are so volatile that
conscious control inevitably proves inadequate.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:51.230
We can also try acting out our feelings, but
expressing them can verge on the antisocial

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:58.730
and the chaotic. Our private knowledge is
the resident spirit alive within us, inalienable

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:02.130
and unquiet."

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:07.370
And so, here were a bunch of psychiatrists
trying to manage their own private knowledge.

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:15.320

2001, I sat in a committee room in Ashland,

Oregon, with a group of about 20 psychiatrists.
We were, we're all in various stages of recovery

00:33:22.769 --> 00:33:28.340
from the events of 9/11, and they had asked
me to join them in a kind of group therapy

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:29.340
session."

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:36.610
There were about two hundred psychiatrists
at the meeting. Twenty of them were so upset,

00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:41.340
well, I'm sure there were a number so, so
upset that they couldn't do anything, but

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:46.130
twenty were so upset that they got together
and decided to do group therapy and they asked

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:47.130
me along.

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:09.350
say about trauma to twenty traumatized psychiatrists?"

00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:16.810
And I'll summarize the next section; that's
where Shakespeare came in. See, there are

00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:24.060
various sta-, events you can't stage, especially
on Shakespearean stage. You can do them in

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:30.340
the movies, but you can't put them on a stage.
And one of them comes from Hamlet and that

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:42.440
is, the beautiful young noblewoman, Ophelia,
going mad and drowning herself in a stream.

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:50.700
Shakespeare couldn't do that at the time on
stage, so he had someone describe it. And

00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:54.000
this is Queen Gertrude describing it:

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.940
"There is a willow grows aslant the brook,
That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:07.340
There with fantastic garlands did she come.
Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:11.060
purples,
That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,

00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:15.870
But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call
them."

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:24.060
The distraught girl comes down to the stream;
she lies down or falls into it. She floats

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:35.430
away down the stream, slowly drowning. Notice
the way Shakespeare handles the precise details.

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:38.670
"Crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long
purples."

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:45.800
He's doing that to project the event into
the audience's consciousness, but he's also

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:55.590
doing something else. He's doing what I call
"The Death Story." And it's a story that we

00:35:55.590 --> 00:36:02.360
all have to know whenever we hear about the
death of someone we care about.

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:03.960
[reads]

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:11.570
"But it also occurred to me that the death
narrative was more than just a stage tactic.

00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:18.040
It was a cross-cultural folk tradition, affecting
us all and born of a universal psychological

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:24.900
necessity. Whenever we hear that somebody
important to us has died, we want to know

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:33.010
about every possible detail, and whenever
we are controlled, sorry, whenever we are

00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:39.800
in control of the details, we feel obliged
to pass them on to someone else who cares.

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:47.350
The death narrative offers a kind of relief.
It cannot curtail our mourning, but it can

00:36:47.350 --> 00:36:56.200
bring an otherwise intolerable truth into
the realm of day-to-day reality.

00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:03.410
"How did all of this relate to the psychiatrists
of 9/11? That Saturday, when my turn came

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:08.780
to speak, I spoke to them about narrative
as a means of organizing reality. I put it

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:15.310
to them that the first step in healing after
a traumatic event is to construct a narrative

00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:22.750
that places the event within a rational context.
A narrative allows the mind to couch the traumatic

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:31.240
event in knowable terms; a narrative stabilizes
an injured mind much in the way a splint stabilizes

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:39.070
a damaged limb. With this in mind, I suggested
that they all find out as much as they could

00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:49.950
about 9/11 and construct narrative of their
own."

00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:57.920
So, just to go into that, into a little more
detail, I had learned about the trauma narrative

00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:03.990
from Shakespeare; that was the first thing.
He had one reason for recounting a traumatic

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:11.550
narrative, but I saw that he was accessing
an old, old folk tradition and if you go back

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:20.130
to this yourself and you've heard about the
death of a loved one, someone will, will feel

00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:27.160
compelled to tell you every detail that she
or he knows. And you will feel compelled to

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:32.900
listen to the details because that person,
until that moment, has been alive to you.

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:40.570
And you can't just rip that person out of
your consciousness. You need a narrative.

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:49.520
In the same way, it is theorized. A traumatized
person, who, say, has been attacked, even

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:59.370
if it's long ago, can be encouraged to form
a narrative of that attack; of its reasons

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:09.170
and of its details. The narrative, again,
this is the theory, the narrative has the

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:20.600
effect of stabilizing the damaged part of
the brain so that the rest of healing can

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:29.040
begin. And the funny thing is, that most of
us re-, that a lot of us are so traumatized

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:37.890
that we try to suppress or conceal that narrative
from ourselves. And I can assure you that

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:47.960
doing that keeps the pain alive rather than
heals it. Anyway, when I, I had had this idea

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:54.470
completely on my own, thanks to Shakespeare,
so when I got home I found out what was the

00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:59.833
most famous book on the subject. In case you're
interested, it probably is this most, still

00:39:59.833 --> 00:40:06.850
the most famous book, it's called, "Trauma
and Recovery," by Judith Herman of Harvard

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:16.140
University. And I was incredibly relieved
when Judith Herman, I opened the book, I looked

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:24.630
up a narrative, she said the exact same thing
I had. Boy, am I smart.

00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:26.510
[Robert laughs]

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:32.310
Herman has gotten into a lot of trouble, by
the way, by taking people back into their

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:38.540
early traumatic days and finding some scapegoat;
"Daddy spanked me that day and I've never

00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:48.050
been the same since. I hurt for a long time,
I'm hurting now." So, there are a lot of anguished

00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:54.580
parents who are very angry at Judith Herman,
but on the other hand, I consider most of

00:40:54.580 --> 00:41:03.840
her ideas in that book extremely solid and
I support them. This chapter, by the way,

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:10.530
goes through a number of other ways in which
the mind unconsciously designs things that

00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:16.950
it needs.
There is the dream, for example. There's also

00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:24.450
the memory. And there's also what we call
subjectivity and that's when we have just

00:41:24.450 --> 00:41:31.440
a very few piece of evidence and our mind
unconsciously creates a line between those

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:38.650
dots. You have a piece of evidence that someone
was murdered and another piece of evidence

00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:45.560
that someone was very mad at her and saying
bad things; those are two dots and like some

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:50.210
detective you connect the two dots. Well,
maybe it was that person who murdered the

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:56.970
other person. Now, that's subjective, that's
how, that can become a hypothesis for a journalist

00:41:56.970 --> 00:42:05.330
or a detective. It could be right or it could
be wrong, but it's a kind of unconscious instantaneous

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:15.650
design that we do. I'll give you a couple
of examples of design in memories and one

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:26.460
example is from Gen, President Woodrow Wilson.
He always felt that his first memory was of

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:35.100
a man riding up to his house in the Southeast,
jumping off his horse, and telling his dad

00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:44.360
that the Civil War had begun. This would've
been 1861; Wilson would've been just beyond

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:52.080
a toddler, maybe five years, seven years old.
Now, that might have been his earliest retained

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:58.960
memory, but I doubt it. And the reason I doubt
it is because Woodrow Wilson, who brought

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:06.930
us into the next Great War so many years later,
so his mind was unconsciously choosing the

00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:16.150
memory that most accorded with a great act
of his life. There's another one I can't help

00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:24.360
telling you and with that I'm, I'm going to
conclude. And that is that I knew a guy once,

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:33.600
very briefly, whose name was Cornelius Bull.
B-U-L-L. And Cornelius Bull was a very well

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:40.260
known Middle Eastern han, so to speak. He
was one of those Americans who went forth

00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:47.000
into a foreign country for his career and
did major things. And what it, the major things

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:57.310
that Neil Bull did included founding English
speaking schools in the Middle East. Now,

00:43:57.310 --> 00:44:04.270
Neil Bull had control of the invitations to
a fairly prestigious speaking engagement that

00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:11.360
went on every year, was founded by some big
construction, construction firm in Istanbul.

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:19.230
So I was brought out to Istanbul by Neil,
who was a character if you have ever met one.

00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:26.660
And I gave a talk about the origins of creativity.
I had just written a book about creativity,

00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:34.450
"The Origins of Creativity," sometimes having
to do with childhood experience. And my talk

00:44:34.450 --> 00:44:39.840
was simultaneously translated to a couple
of hundred people who couldn't speak English.

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:44.630
It was translated almost simultaneously into
Turkish. It was a great, big, long room and

00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:52.090
the room was so poorly designed that I couldn't
keep my, my attention on my speech almost.

00:44:52.090 --> 00:45:00.910
I was thinking about how a room could be a
public room could be that badly designed.

00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:07.010
But anyway, as soon as I could, I asked for
Q&amp;A and what I asked for was for people to

00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:13.830
share their ex-, their first memories with
me. So, Neil Bull's hand went up first and

00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:22.170
that, at that time he was a man in his middle
60s. He said, "Oh, sixty years ago my father

00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:29.540
took me to the zoo and we walked around looking
at animals. I had a wonderful view. And he,

00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:36.800
because I was sitting on my father's shoulders.
He was holding me by the legs and he took

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:46.090
me to the elephant pen. There was this great
elephant there. It came up to see us; it stuck

00:45:46.090 --> 00:45:51.720
up its trunk to get a peanut." So, there's
this huge trunk coming up at this little kid.

00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:59.440
"My father handed me up a peanut to give to
the elephant and I reached out my little arm,

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:05.750
but just at the moment, when I was about to
put it in the elephants snout just as my father

00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:14.010
told me to do, there was this snout right
in front of me. I froze. I pulled my arm back

00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:21.700
and the moment I did that the elephant raised
its snout and batted me on the head." That

00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:30.430
was his earliest memory. Well, Neil Bull was
one of the braver guys I've met and for him

00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:39.650
to tell this early memory about his own early
trauma at the hands, or snout, of an elephant,

00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:45.750
it was just too much like Neil Bull. I'm sure
that wasn't his earliest memory, but it's

00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:54.990
the most amusing earliest memory I've ever
heard. In any case, the mind builds. When

00:46:54.990 --> 00:47:01.150
the mind goes back to memories, it does some
designing. It does some building because what

00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:08.300
it has to put together again is little dots
of data that it retains. Same thing happens

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:14.440
when you wake up from a dream. Generally,
you have little dots of data that, you're

00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:20.780
lying in bed and you're thinking, "I've gotta
remember this dream." And so your mind is

00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:29.080
unconsciously putting it together into a story.
I'm afraid that's all the time I have to talk

00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:32.022
and I'd love to field a couple of questions
from you. Steve.

00:47:32.022 --> 00:47:34.050
&gt;&gt;Steve: Yeah, I'm sorry, the, the central
or the thesis of the book is that the [inaudible]

00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:35.050
on YouTube.

00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:36.050
[Robert laughs]

00:47:36.050 --> 00:47:37.050
The book is design is truth and that good
design tells the truth, bad design tell a

00:47:37.050 --> 00:47:59.420
lie and that actually usually has to do with
the abuse of power, and I wonder if, can you

00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:13.620
give us an example of maybe from a book or
elsewhere, design that told a lie and how

00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:14.620
that reflected the abuse of power in one way
or another?

00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:20.760
&gt;&gt;Robert: I, I believe I can think of one
and that brings me back to my other 9/11 story.

00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:27.910
You see, when they were building the World
Trade Center it was a huge project, as you

00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:36.670
all know. And it was originally, it was originally
conceived because of money and it was also

00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:44.530
built, in a sense, that it would earn enormous
amounts of money. It was conceived because

00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:53.730
David Rockefeller, who was a big deal banker,
got the idea that he could revivify commerce

00:48:53.730 --> 00:49:01.830
in Lower Manhattan by building a trade center;
something that would simply draw in a lot

00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:11.100
of traffic. It wasn't for 20 years that they
started the competition in which the architects

00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:21.530
were chosen. Yamasaki was a good and very
successful architect. He was also Japanese-American.

00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:30.550
And to my mind, he was never fully sure of
his American identity and one of the things

00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:42.950
he did, or designed for himself in his own
mind to affirm his own identity, was to become

00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:51.060
a kind of citizen of the world; an Internationalist.
Anyway, he had his firm do at least a hundred

00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:59.150
models of the World Trade Center and they
were some pretty good stuff. He ended up with

00:49:59.150 --> 00:50:08.470
a complex that would fill the available acreage
with an 80-story skyscraper and a number of

00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:17.240
other large buildings around it. Now, if you
look south at Lower Manhattan, you'll see

00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:24.590
three or four buildings, some of them from
the early 30s, that go up 70, 60, 70, 80 stories.

00:50:24.590 --> 00:50:33.100
An 80-story skyscraper might have added very
nicely to the profile of lower New York. But

00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:38.600
the Port Authority, even though they had already
chosen Yamasaki, weren't satisfied with 80

00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:48.610
stories. What they wanted was something like
ten million square feet of office space in

00:50:48.610 --> 00:50:56.250
two buildings. And I, I don't know how many
of you remember the World Trade Center; its

00:50:56.250 --> 00:51:07.760
1350 feet tall, 110 stories. Every story in
each of those two buildings was an acre; two

00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:15.370
hundred by two hundred. That's why the buildings
looked so, in a sense, nightmarish because

00:51:15.370 --> 00:51:22.090
they were not only very tall, but they were
very, very thick. They were very wide on every

00:51:22.090 --> 00:51:31.780
side. Now, what that means is that the majority
of people, who are working on any given floor,

00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:41.020
are on average of what would it be? Seventy-five
feet, sixty feet away from the nearest window.

00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:47.360
On top of that, Yamasaki, who himself had
acrophobia, made the windows so small that

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:52.903
you couldn't even notice the windows from
a distance. As I say in the book, "The World

00:51:52.903 --> 00:52:05.030
Trade Center, which had the world's best view,
was legally blind itself." Yamasaki did, had,

00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:13.380
what he had to do was make an uncomfortable
compromise with his clients and he created

00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:21.070
a set of buildings, which in the end, told
a lie. And here is the lie: If you look at

00:52:21.070 --> 00:52:32.390
a building like the Chrysler Building or the
old RCA building or the Liebert Building,

00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:41.650
you're looking at a concept that was humanistically
designed. It was designed to give the individual

00:52:41.650 --> 00:52:47.990
a sense that even though he was working in
a very large building, there was something

00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:54.740
about that building that justified the work.
There something beautiful, there was something

00:52:54.740 --> 00:53:05.050
human, there was something that gave vent
to the individual's aspirations. With the

00:53:05.050 --> 00:53:12.730
World Trade Center, Yamasaki was forced to
go too far. The World Trade Center was not,

00:53:12.730 --> 00:53:18.860
in a sense, justifying. It didn't justify
the individual. It belittled the individual

00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:26.500
in the same sense that it belittled the other
skyscrapers. As I put it in the book, "It

00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:36.560
stood out in the vernacular of Lower Manhattan
like a pair of hurled expletives." Expletives

00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:45.621
not deleted until the end, of course. Yamasaki's
story goes on because there were, there were

00:53:45.621 --> 00:53:57.280
other lies in the course of the development
of the building. New York code required six

00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:04.950
escape routes for buildings of that size.
The Port Authority cut them to three. The

00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:09.440
three escape routes were intertwined all the
way up to the top of the building; these were

00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:16.230
the staircases. Had there been six escape
routes, you would've probably had, now, I

00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:21.890
want each of you to become an architect, you
probably would've had one at each of the four

00:54:21.890 --> 00:54:27.110
corners of each building and then two intertwined
down the middle. That's the logical approach.

00:54:27.110 --> 00:54:33.650
If that had happened, there would've been
at least a couple of escape routes available

00:54:33.650 --> 00:54:41.590
to the people above the crash zones, when
the crash zones, crash occurred. But instead,

00:54:41.590 --> 00:54:48.740
the Port Authority limited them to three and
they were wound down the middle of the building.

00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:54.190
As it turned out, after the crashes, there
was only one open escape route, it was only

00:54:54.190 --> 00:55:05.580
partly open and only 17 people escaped down
it. Everyone else above the crash zone died.

00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:12.940
There's another lie attached to it and this
is really amazing; most people feel chills

00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:22.630
up their spines when they hear this one. Yamasaki
had done major work with the bin Laden family,

00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:31.820
so that when Osama bin Laden was a little
boy in the 1960s, he clearly, we have no evidence

00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:40.250
on this because the Yamasaki family and his
firm have shut up tight about it, but the

00:55:40.250 --> 00:55:50.190
probability is that he, as a child, got to
know that Yamasaki was rebuilding Saudi America

00:55:50.190 --> 00:55:59.260
along western lines. And what Yamasaki loved
to do, was he loved to take Islamic patterns

00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:11.580
and mix them with modern architectural design.
So, it, from my perspective, and it must share

00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:19.410
with you, that I'm designing this story myself;
Yamasaki became a kind of Darth Vader for

00:56:19.410 --> 00:56:27.820
young bin Laden. bin Laden studied architecture
and engineering in Jeddah and it was during

00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:38.480
his own restoration of some sacred Islamic
sites that he underwent his conversion to

00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:46.740
Fundamental Islam. So just imagine the complex
relationship between Osama bin Laden and the

00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:55.390
World Trade Center, and you're imagining a
lot. And one more point, and this is how I

00:56:55.390 --> 00:57:03.820
started writing the entire article, I saw,
I saw photographs, those unforgettable photographs

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:10.770
of the fallen buildings with a metal trace
work still going up four stories, and it suddenly

00:57:10.770 --> 00:57:18.520
occurred to me: those were Islamic arches.
Some people call them Persian arches because

00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:29.080
Persia influenced early Islamic art. And it
turned out that again, I was lucky. My conception

00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:37.660
was justified by the architectural experts
and also by Yamasaki's own bio-, autobiography.

00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:46.360
He had deliberately built Islamic sacred language
into the formation of the square, the shape

00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:54.370
of the buildings, and the Islamic trace work
going down it. Now, I'll tell you from the

00:57:54.370 --> 00:58:04.580
research I've done into Islam that is a no-no.
You don't quote Islamic sacred imagery in

00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:11.760
any way that would demean it, whether you're
putting it in a song or in a novel the way

00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:21.600
Salman Rushdie did, or in architecture. It's
blasphemy. I don't think Yamasaki knew that,

00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:31.480
but what he was trying to do, because he was
Yamasaki, is he was trying to again, in my

00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:38.120
opinion; he was trying to justify his own
originality as an architect and as a human

00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:44.920
being in the face of an embarrassing compromise
that he had had to make with the World Trade

00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:54.140
Center. So there is design and as, it turned
into another lie when he, in his autobiography,

00:58:54.140 --> 00:59:02.310
said, "The World Trade Center is a testament
to the common man." It, it justifies his existence,

00:59:02.310 --> 00:59:10.791
etc. Lie, lie, lie, so far as I was concerned
and that's how I wrote it down. Thank you

00:59:10.791 --> 00:59:17.660
very much, we ended a bit late. Thank you.

00:59:17.660 --> 00:59:18.560
