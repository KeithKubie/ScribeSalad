00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.270
The Blood-Brain Barrier is pretty much what
its name sounds like; a barrier that separates

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.160
your blood from your brain.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.260
But what’s the point?

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.219
Doesn’t our brain want the sweet sweet nutrients
in our blood?

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.990
I like to think of your brain as a nightclub,
let's call it Club Head.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.710
Inside it’s popping, there’s lights and
electronic music and the mood is good.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.779
The circulatory system is like the street
outside the nightclub, and just anybody can

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:25.630
walk up to the club’s door via your bloodstream.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.329
Conditions in your blood change dramatically
all the time, like after you eat or exercise,

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.430
but things need to be stable in your brain
to keep the party going.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.230
So Club Head has a bouncer to keep the riff
raff out -- the blood-brain barrier.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.780
The bouncer, in this case, are endothelial
cells.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.730
These cells line the walls throughout your
whole vascular system, but in your brain the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.470
gaps between them are extremely small, forming
what are called tight junctions.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.530
These small gaps, along with a lack of pathways
through the endothelial cells, keeps your

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.450
blood and your brain separate.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.120
Obviously, the brain is not totally isolated,
there has to be some interaction.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.660
Your brain is connected to the circulatory
system because it needs the things floating

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.410
around in your blood to function, just like
any other cells in your body.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.890
So the bouncer has to let some things into
the club…

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.230
Like the life of the party: Glucose!

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.240
Your brain uses glucose for energy, but glucose
can’t get through the endothelial cells

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.240
on its own…

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.110
It needs a friend to get past the bouncer.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.120
So, special glucose transporters in endothelial
cells shuttle the valuable molecule through

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.940
the blood-brain barrier as quickly as possible
like it’s a VIP.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.660
Some other molecules can sneak by the bouncer
when he’s not looking by using diffusion.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.229
Water and gasses like CO2 and oxygen diffuse
through the endothelial cell’s membrane

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.460
and out the other side to reach the brain.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.330
But some less desirables can also sneak into
Club Head, like drunks and smokers.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.330
By that I mean ethanol and nicotine, which
can also find their way into your brain because

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.430
they’re fat soluble.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.200
They’re actually so good at getting into
your brain that they’re totally extracted

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.220
from your blood on their first pass through.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.780
So the bouncer isn’t perfect, but he usually
does a good job of keeping the really nasty

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.850
stuff out that would cause diseases and infections.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.579
But if harmful things do find their way in,
that’s when the blood-brain barrier becomes

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:09.920
a problem.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.400
In order to treat some diseases of the brain,
doctors need to get medication past the blood-brain

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.400
barrier.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.939
But the BBB will have none of it, and the
medication can’t get into the brain to do

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:20.040
its job.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.019
To torture the night club metaphor one last
time, it’s like Club Head is burning down

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.599
but the bouncer won’t let the fire department
in because they don’t meet the dress code.

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.599
Scientists have been building models of the
blood-brain barrier, to figure out how to

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.439
sneak the firefighters in.

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:38.239
Until recently, they’ve been using animal
cells but in September of 2017, after a decade

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.760
of research, scientists have unveiled a model
that uses human cells to accurately mimic

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.779
how our actual blood-brain barrier works.

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:50.040
Understanding how to bypass the barrier can
help us treat brain cancer and other neurological

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.560
diseases like Parkinson’s and dementia.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.200
This new model is hugely significant and will
help speed up the development of drugs that

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.930
will save and improve lives.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.720
You’re doing a great job up there, blood-brain
barrier bouncer.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.129
We just need you to lighten up a little bit
sometimes, ok?

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.439

Curious about your brain and how it works?

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:46.749
Trace fires off on neurons here.One last thing:
the BBB was first discovered when researchers

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:50.980
injected dye into the circulatory system and
noticed the brain and spinal cord didn’t

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:51.980
color-up.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.169
And the reverse happened too, tipping them
off that something was stopping the dye.

00:03:54.169 --> 00:04:00.840
Thanks for watching and I’ll see you next
time on Seeker!
