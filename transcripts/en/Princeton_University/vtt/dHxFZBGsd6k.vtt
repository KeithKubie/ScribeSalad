[SPEAKING IN HINDI]

00:00:11.062 --> 00:00:14.006
KASTURI SHAH: Hello, Seekho 
provides free English

00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:18.089
audio education through the 
basic mobile phones, which

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:20.080
has a vast reach 
across all of India

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.002
to children and 
learners of all ages

00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:26.077
in underprivileged 
circumstances in India.

00:00:30.042 --> 00:00:31.084
VAASVI GOYAL: 
Kasturi and I really

00:00:31.084 --> 00:00:34.005
didn't know each other 
before we came to Princeton

00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:38.078
and we met at a reception before 
we got to Princeton in Delhi.

00:00:38.078 --> 00:00:42.063
And we both instantly really 
connected with each other,

00:00:42.063 --> 00:00:43.063
really liked each other,

00:00:43.063 --> 00:00:46.041
and also soon realized 
that we were both really

00:00:46.041 --> 00:00:48.090
interested in education 
and other development work

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.040
in India.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.089
We sat down and we kind of 
listed all of the problems

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:55.058
that we wanted to 
tackle in India,

00:00:55.058 --> 00:00:58.044
or more just in urban areas like 
where we're from, like Delhi

00:00:58.044 --> 00:00:59.012
and Bombay,

00:00:59.012 --> 00:01:03.010
and realized education, and 
specifically girls' education,

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.039
was something we were both 
really passionate about.

STEPHANIE LANDERS: Princeton 
University's Keller Center

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.083
offers entrepreneurship 
courses for students,

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:27.051
both in the high-tech sector, 
social entrepreneurship.

00:01:27.051 --> 00:01:31.044
And we also provide 
students with a variety

00:01:31.044 --> 00:01:34.058
of seminars and workshops 
at the Entrepreneurial Hub.

00:01:34.058 --> 00:01:39.022
Kasturi and Vaasvi first 
came to me in fall of 2014

00:01:39.022 --> 00:01:43.036
because they were interested 
in using the eLab Incubator.

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:45.047
The incubator is a 
program where students

00:01:45.047 --> 00:01:48.067
can come to work on 
their startup ventures

00:01:48.067 --> 00:01:53.013
and we provide advising and 
mentorship to the students.

00:01:53.013 --> 00:01:54.080
I was really excited 
because I wanted

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.083
to help them really 
foster that idea

00:01:59.083 --> 00:02:03.021
and expand and turn 
it into a nonprofit.

00:02:03.021 --> 00:02:05.051
And they've been doing 
an amazing job with it.

00:02:11.057 --> 00:02:15.007
KASTURI SHAH: In order to test 
our ad-based revenue model

00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:18.040
we need to get to a call -- 
a critical call volume, which

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.062
we think is 1,000 calls a day.

00:02:20.062 --> 00:02:23.048
Now in order to -- Hello, Seekho 
is the kind of enterprise

00:02:23.048 --> 00:02:25.036
that exists currently.

00:02:25.036 --> 00:02:28.004
The only thing that stops 
people calling into it

00:02:28.004 --> 00:02:30.023
is the fact that 
they're not aware of it.

00:02:30.023 --> 00:02:32.064
So our funding therefore 
goes towards marketing

00:02:32.064 --> 00:02:35.059
and making that awareness known.

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:37.095
And so that's why 
funding is so crucial

00:02:37.095 --> 00:02:40.093
because we need to market it 
to get it to that call volume

00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:42.083
to be able to stop 
pitching to companies.

00:02:42.083 --> 00:02:45.078
KASTURI SHAH: So I'm here in New York 
on my own about to give a pitch

00:02:45.078 --> 00:02:50.094
to apparently 250-plus investors 
and we've got to pitch twice,

00:02:50.094 --> 00:02:52.002
four minutes each.

00:02:55.027 --> 00:02:56.095
Yeah.

00:02:56.095 --> 00:03:00.072
I wouldn't say I'm freaking 
out but I'm scared.

00:03:00.072 --> 00:03:03.019
So one of Hello, Seekho's 
greatest strengths

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.098
is its curriculum, 
which builds upon itself

00:03:04.098 --> 00:03:06.089
and uses positive reinforcement.

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:09.020
The content contains 
stories, songs, and poems,

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.044
which makes learning fun.

00:03:11.044 --> 00:03:18.001
KASTURI SHAH: I realized how much 
I actually love pitching the idea

00:03:18.001 --> 00:03:22.007
and I think that's partly 
because every time we do pitch,

00:03:22.007 --> 00:03:25.038
I think we realize how 
much we believe in it

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:28.020
and how much we've invested in 
it and the impact that it has.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.037
And I think I kind of went onto 
the stage with that mindset.

00:03:31.037 --> 00:03:33.060
People really appreciated 
what I was saying.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.043
A lot of people came 
up to me and said, hey,

00:03:35.043 --> 00:03:38.061
that was a very good, 
clear presentation.

00:03:38.061 --> 00:03:41.023
And we've put a lot of 
work into the slides.

00:03:41.023 --> 00:03:46.013
KASTURI SHAH: We made pretty 
big leaps and bounds

00:03:46.013 --> 00:03:47.077
in terms of data analysis.

00:03:47.077 --> 00:03:52.060
So we have at this point 
40,000 phone calls.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.036
So what that means is we 
have a huge volume of data

00:03:57.036 --> 00:04:00.047
to analyze to further direct 
not only our curriculum

00:04:00.047 --> 00:04:02.005
but also our marketing efforts.

00:04:02.005 --> 00:04:04.018
VAASVI GOYAL: Some of the 
really interesting things

00:04:04.018 --> 00:04:06.022
from the data 
analysis were that we

00:04:06.022 --> 00:04:08.063
found that people who 
call back to the service

00:04:08.063 --> 00:04:11.006
call back an 
average of 50 times,

00:04:11.006 --> 00:04:15.024
which is a really -- which 
is a really good statistic

00:04:15.024 --> 00:04:16.092
to know because we 
have been around

00:04:16.092 --> 00:04:19.007
67 lessons on the server.

00:04:19.007 --> 00:04:20.074
So, once we look at 
those trajectories,

00:04:20.074 --> 00:04:22.057
we'll be able to see 
if people are listening

00:04:22.057 --> 00:04:23.091
to different lessons each time.

00:04:23.091 --> 00:04:26.037
But, like, 50 is just 
like kind of the number

00:04:26.037 --> 00:04:30.049
we were hoping for in terms of 
seeing that kids are learning

00:04:30.049 --> 00:04:32.036
from it and it's not 
this one off thing

00:04:32.036 --> 00:04:37.034
where you call like five or six 
times and you forget about it.

00:04:37.034 --> 00:04:41.075
VAASVI GOYAL: This has been 
one of the most exciting weeks

00:04:41.075 --> 00:04:43.026
we have ever had.

00:04:43.026 --> 00:04:45.074
The crowdfunding 
platform that we're

00:04:45.074 --> 00:04:49.016
using to run our crowdfunding 
campaign in India

00:04:49.016 --> 00:04:50.074
reached out to us 
saying that they

00:04:50.074 --> 00:04:55.051
wanted to send out a story about 
us to the Press Club of India.

00:04:55.051 --> 00:04:59.064
And then Kasturi and I 
wake up like two days later

00:04:59.064 --> 00:05:03.068
and have an email from the 
BitGiving person with links

00:05:03.068 --> 00:05:06.087
to like 12 different 
stories about us

00:05:06.087 --> 00:05:09.081
in the biggest 
newspapers in India

00:05:09.081 --> 00:05:11.054
that we've both 
grown up reading.

00:05:11.054 --> 00:05:14.056
It was amazing.

00:05:14.056 --> 00:05:18.024
KASTURI SHAH: I am about to 
post news about the article that

00:05:18.024 --> 00:05:21.058
was in the Times of India, 
which is India's biggest

00:05:21.058 --> 00:05:24.012
national newspaper and link 
it onto our Facebook page

00:05:24.012 --> 00:05:24.083
for Hello, Seeko.

00:05:24.083 --> 00:05:28.001
Then the next day I get -- 
so we get daily blasts

00:05:28.001 --> 00:05:30.037
from the server about the 
number of calls per day.

00:05:30.037 --> 00:05:33.015
Normally they're 
around the 100 mark.

00:05:33.015 --> 00:05:35.006
Maybe a little lower, 
maybe a little higher.

00:05:35.006 --> 00:05:36.079
So I get an email 
that says, you know,

00:05:36.079 --> 00:05:38.058
they're 26 something thousand--

00:05:38.058 --> 00:05:39.050
VAASVI GOYAL: 24,000--

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.027
KASTURI SHAH: --24,000 calls.

00:05:41.027 --> 00:05:43.027
So I said, I think the 
server is malfunctioning.

00:05:43.027 --> 00:05:44.047
So I forwarded it to Vaasvi.

00:05:44.047 --> 00:05:46.095
I said, you know, 
somethingâ€™s wrong.

00:05:46.095 --> 00:05:49.099
And then we check 
and we've nearly

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:52.007
run through our 
entire coin balance.

00:05:52.007 --> 00:05:54.074
It wasn't 24,000 calls.

00:05:54.074 --> 00:05:58.022
We had like 70,000 
calls in 24 hours.

00:05:58.022 --> 00:06:01.047
Just because so many 
newspapers covered it.

00:06:01.047 --> 00:06:02.083
We now have how many total?

00:06:02.083 --> 00:06:04.029
VAASVI GOYAL: Like 
around 130,000,

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:07.086
140,000 calls on the server.

00:06:07.086 --> 00:06:11.041
It's so gratifying to see kids 
from now all over the country,

00:06:11.041 --> 00:06:12.091
and not just like 
pockets and areas

00:06:12.091 --> 00:06:15.072
where we've marketed this 
calling into the service

00:06:15.072 --> 00:06:19.093
and to see that we can actually 
approach advertisers now.

00:06:19.093 --> 00:06:22.044
Because we're receiving way 
more than 1,000 calls per day,

00:06:22.044 --> 00:06:24.052
which was our goal at 
the start of the year.

00:06:24.052 --> 00:06:27.046
It gives us such a 
clear path forward.

00:06:27.046 --> 00:06:31.015
It's so clear to us 
now what we need to do next

00:06:31.015 --> 00:06:35.041
and where we can take 
it once we graduate

00:06:35.041 --> 00:06:36.081
in the next couple of months.

00:06:36.081 --> 00:06:38.028
And so it's been really amazing.

00:06:38.028 --> 00:06:40.032
KASTURI SHAH: We were 
talking about this earlier,

00:06:40.032 --> 00:06:44.043
but we -- to be able to think 
that the goal that we set

00:06:44.043 --> 00:06:48.012
at the start of the year of getting 
to a thousand calls per day, now

00:06:48.012 --> 00:06:49.042
is basically achieved.

00:06:49.042 --> 00:06:52.053
It isn't really a goal 
anymore -- it's kind of part

00:06:52.053 --> 00:06:55.094
of the venture's history 
is absolutely amazing.

00:06:55.094 --> 00:06:59.015
VAASVI GOYAL: Seeing the sort 
of success only reaffirms

00:06:59.015 --> 00:07:03.027
our commitment to Hello, 
Seekho and our desire

00:07:03.027 --> 00:07:05.067
to keep on working on it 
because it's so exciting

00:07:05.067 --> 00:07:09.012
and it's something that 
we care about so much.

00:07:09.012 --> 00:07:12.027
But, yeah, so that's the plan, 
is to go back after graduation

00:07:12.027 --> 00:07:15.066
and work on it full time 
for a couple of months.

00:07:15.066 --> 00:07:18.051
And then, at the same 
time, set up the framework

00:07:18.051 --> 00:07:21.066
so that other people can 
take over the day to day

00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:24.031
when we leave.
