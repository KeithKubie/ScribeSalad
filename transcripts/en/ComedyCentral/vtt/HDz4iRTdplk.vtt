00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:01.635
AS WE GO

00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:08.108
TO OUR NEXT GAME, OTHER
BRITISH GRIEVANCES.

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:12.079
ON JULY 4TH, 1776 HEROIC
AMERICANS RISKED THEIR LIVES

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:14.781
TO BREAK FREE FROM THE
BRITISH TYRANNY AND TODAY

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:16.583
WE COMMEMORATE THEIR
SACRIFICE BY BINGE DRINKING

00:00:16.617 --> 00:00:18.185
MICHELOB UNTIL SOMEONE
BLOWS OFF THEIR THUMB

00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:20.821
WITH A [BLEEP] ROMAN CANDLE.

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:22.956
OF COURSE, THE BRITISH ARE IN
OUR COOL BOOK NOW BECAUSE OF

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.593
WORLD WAR II AND THE BEATLES,
BUT

00:00:26.627 --> 00:00:28.295
LET'S NOT FORGET WHAT A
[BLEEP] KING GEORGE WAS BACK

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:33.767
IF THE DAY--THE THIRD ONE,
KING GEORGE THE THIRD.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:41.675
ALL RIGHT, FOR EXAMPLE, HE
PLUNDERED OUR SEAS, RAVAGED

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:45.279
OUR COAST, BURNED OUR TOWNS
AND DESTROYED THE LIVES OF

00:00:45.312 --> 00:00:46.613
OUR PEOPLE.

00:00:46.647 --> 00:00:50.951
WE ARE ABSOLVED FROM OUR
ALLEGIANCE TO THE BRITISH

00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:51.785
CROWN.

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:58.892
[BLEEP] YEAH, AMERICA.

00:00:58.926 --> 00:01:02.596
&gt;&gt; THAT IS-- THAT IS A
[BLEEP]TON OF GRIEVANCES, AND

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.832
IT WAS WRITTEN 239 YEARS AGO
SO, THERE MUST BE SOME MORE

00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:08.435
RECENT STUFF THE BRITISH DO
TO PISS US OFF.

00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:10.437
IN THE SPIRIT OF OUR
NATION'S INDEPENDENCE, GIVE

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.741
US UPDATED BRITISH-- OH MY
GOD, YOUR HAIR.

00:01:14.775 --> 00:01:20.380
PLEASE GIVE US SOME UPDATED
OTHER BRITISH GRIEVANCES

00:01:20.414 --> 00:01:23.183
IN 60 SECONDS AND BEGIN.

00:01:23.217 --> 00:01:24.151
&gt;&gt; ARDEN.

00:01:24.184 --> 00:01:26.386
&gt;&gt; THEY HAVE ALLOWED
"CUMBERBATCH" TO BE A LAST

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.421
NAME.

00:01:27.454 --> 00:01:28.422
&gt;&gt; POINTS.

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:30.390
&gt;&gt; IS THAT SHEERAN KID
BRITISH?

00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:32.192
&gt;&gt; I THINK SO.

00:01:32.226 --> 00:01:33.527
&gt;&gt; POINTS.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.163
&gt;&gt; CALLING A PRESIDENT
A PRIME MINISTER?

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:38.565
&gt;&gt; COME ON.

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:42.202
&gt;&gt; SIMON COWELL'S POINTY
NIPS.

00:01:42.236 --> 00:01:44.271
THEY'RE SO POINTY.

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:45.939
&gt;&gt; A TRAVESTY.

00:01:45.973 --> 00:01:46.807
&gt;&gt; POINTS.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.877
&gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT [BLEEP]
MUMFORD AND SONS?

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:50.744
&gt;&gt; POINTS.

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:53.247
&gt;&gt; I ALWAYS HATED "ABSOLUTELY
FABULOUS."

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.114
&gt;&gt; WHAT?

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:56.583
&gt;&gt; NO, THAT'S A GOOD SHOW.

00:01:56.617 --> 00:01:57.951
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE [BLEEP] WRONG.

00:01:57.985 --> 00:01:58.986
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE WRONG AGAIN.

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:04.825
JUST LIKE YOU WERE WRONG
ABOUT "NATIONAL TREASURE."

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:09.062
&gt;&gt; TOOTH ROT.

00:02:09.096 --> 00:02:11.098
&gt;&gt; POINTS.

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:15.669
&gt;&gt; THEY SMOKE FAGS AND EAT
DICKS.

00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:15.769
(LAUGHTER)
POINTS.
