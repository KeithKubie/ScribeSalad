00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.950
TAL SCULLY: My advice to women
in physics is to not be scared

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.960
and to be confident in yourself.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.530
It's very easy to be
intimidated by men

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.239
who seem to know everything
that they're doing.

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:18.280
The thing is, they don't.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.860
Because nobody knows what
they're doing in life.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.630
And once you realize
this, if you just

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.150
put on an outward
face of confidence,

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.880
I find that helps to
realize that there's

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.610
no difference
between being a woman

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.890
and a man besides how some
people might treat you.
