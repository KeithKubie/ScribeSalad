00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.723
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, linear perspective.

00:00:02.723 --> 00:00:06.035
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right, so, I think I understand what's going on here. Take a look at this

00:00:06.035 --> 00:00:11.971
drawing of a road. It looks flat, but if we make the lines converge, like this,

00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:17.353
the lines go off in the distance. Well, here we perceive depth and that's

00:00:17.353 --> 00:00:21.495
linear perspective. And, since we can close one eye and still see this depth

00:00:21.495 --> 00:00:24.609
que, we call this a monocular depth que.

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:27.851
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's really interesting. So, speaking of monocular que's, now I think it's a

00:00:27.851 --> 00:00:30.190
great time to go for a word from our sponsors.
