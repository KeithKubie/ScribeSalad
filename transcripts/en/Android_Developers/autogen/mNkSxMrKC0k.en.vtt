on the inside I don't know the details
 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.359
on the inside I don't know the details
on the outside so I was gonna go over

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369
on the outside so I was gonna go over
 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.980
on the outside so I was gonna go over
quickly some of the some of the specs

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990
quickly some of the some of the specs
 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.090
quickly some of the some of the specs
here some of the more interesting stuff

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100
here some of the more interesting stuff
 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.399
here some of the more interesting stuff
quality camera will see some pictures

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409
quality camera will see some pictures
 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.219
quality camera will see some pictures
later I was I am NOT a good photographer

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229
later I was I am NOT a good photographer
 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.020
later I was I am NOT a good photographer
but I was surprised I took a picture of

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030
but I was surprised I took a picture of
 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.669
but I was surprised I took a picture of
a sunrise I thought there was sort of

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679
a sunrise I thought there was sort of
 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.020
a sunrise I thought there was sort of
some interesting Reds and it actually

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030
some interesting Reds and it actually
 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.980
some interesting Reds and it actually
came out with a really crisp detail and

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990
came out with a really crisp detail and
 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.800
came out with a really crisp detail and
fairly dark point in the morning so that

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810
fairly dark point in the morning so that
 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.510
fairly dark point in the morning so that
that was sort of my first alert that

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520
that was sort of my first alert that
 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.980
that was sort of my first alert that
like the sensors a lot bigger you can

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990
like the sensors a lot bigger you can
 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.780
like the sensors a lot bigger you can
get a lot more light in there and do a

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790
get a lot more light in there and do a
 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.790
get a lot more light in there and do a
lot more with it we'll talk a little bit

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800
lot more with it we'll talk a little bit
 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.830
lot more with it we'll talk a little bit
about fingerprint stuff that's enabled

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840
about fingerprint stuff that's enabled
 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.880
about fingerprint stuff that's enabled
on these devices USB type-c will mention

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890
on these devices USB type-c will mention
 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.610
on these devices USB type-c will mention
some of the specs here so I actually

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620
some of the specs here so I actually
 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.350
some of the specs here so I actually
prefer the 5x just because I like the

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360
prefer the 5x just because I like the
 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.120
prefer the 5x just because I like the
smaller form factor it's a little bit

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130
smaller form factor it's a little bit
 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.970
smaller form factor it's a little bit
taller than the Nexus 5 but in the

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980
taller than the Nexus 5 but in the
 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.560
taller than the Nexus 5 but in the
meantime it's got faster hardware so

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570
meantime it's got faster hardware so
 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.090
meantime it's got faster hardware so
it's got the wonder they call with the

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100
it's got the wonder they call with the
 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.200
it's got the wonder they call with the
hexa core hexa being some language for

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210
hexa core hexa being some language for
 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.940
hexa core hexa being some language for
six so we have four little cores and

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950
six so we have four little cores and
 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.490
six so we have four little cores and
then two mega cores so fairly good

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500
then two mega cores so fairly good
 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.430
then two mega cores so fairly good
performance on the CPU side upgraded GPU

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440
performance on the CPU side upgraded GPU
 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.350
performance on the CPU side upgraded GPU
from the Nexus 5 fairly substantial

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360
from the Nexus 5 fairly substantial
 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.440
from the Nexus 5 fairly substantial
battery in there on the 6p side much

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450
battery in there on the 6p side much
 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.030
battery in there on the 6p side much
larger display a little bit smaller than

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040
larger display a little bit smaller than
 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.960
larger display a little bit smaller than
the Nexus 6 which was too big for me

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970
the Nexus 6 which was too big for me
 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.670
the Nexus 6 which was too big for me
this is a little bit a little bit

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680
this is a little bit a little bit
 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.700
this is a little bit a little bit
smaller easier to handle with one hand

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710
smaller easier to handle with one hand
 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.210
smaller easier to handle with one hand
again upgraded GPU and CPU from what we

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220
again upgraded GPU and CPU from what we
 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.280
again upgraded GPU and CPU from what we
saw before including the octa-core so

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290
saw before including the octa-core so
 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.080
saw before including the octa-core so
we've got four little cores and then

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090
we've got four little cores and then
 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.150
we've got four little cores and then
four big cores when we need to run

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160
four big cores when we need to run
 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.090
four big cores when we need to run
something really substantial on there so

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100
something really substantial on there so
 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.640
something really substantial on there so
on the camera Watson numbers not all of

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650
on the camera Watson numbers not all of
 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.020
on the camera Watson numbers not all of
which makes sense to me

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030
which makes sense to me
 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.750

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.700
make perfect sense in the context of the
application but it's hard to gauge that

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:43.710
application but it's hard to gauge that
 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.740
application but it's hard to gauge that
when you're just faced with this huge

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:45.750
when you're just faced with this huge
 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.080
when you're just faced with this huge
list of permissions when you want to

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.090
list of permissions when you want to
 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.490
list of permissions when you want to
download and install the application so

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:49.500
download and install the application so
 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.950
download and install the application so
it's much more granular and explanatory

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960
it's much more granular and explanatory
 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.050
it's much more granular and explanatory
now so this is the traditional model and

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.060
now so this is the traditional model and
 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.340
now so this is the traditional model and
this is still the model that people will

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:55.350
this is still the model that people will
 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:00.320
this is still the model that people will
see on pre M releases so I need the

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:00.330
see on pre M releases so I need the
 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.300
see on pre M releases so I need the
following things and then you have no

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:02.310
following things and then you have no
 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:03.560
following things and then you have no
choice you're like well either I'm going

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:03.570
choice you're like well either I'm going
 

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.360
choice you're like well either I'm going
to give you all these permissions or I'm

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:05.370
to give you all these permissions or I'm
 

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:06.230
to give you all these permissions or I'm
not going to install your application

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240
not going to install your application
 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.510
not going to install your application
and if you want the application you kind

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:08.520
and if you want the application you kind
 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.240
and if you want the application you kind
of got to do it in the new world instead

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.250
of got to do it in the new world instead
 

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.120
of got to do it in the new world instead
you ask for permission when you need it

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.130
you ask for permission when you need it
 

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.430
you ask for permission when you need it
when a particular permission needs to be

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:16.440
when a particular permission needs to be
 

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.290
when a particular permission needs to be
granted in order to you for you to

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:18.300
granted in order to you for you to
 

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.650
granted in order to you for you to
perform some some function like you know

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:21.660
perform some some function like you know
 

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.840
perform some some function like you know
actually using the camera or using the

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:23.850
actually using the camera or using the
 

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:25.700
actually using the camera or using the
location then you ask the user for that

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:25.710
location then you ask the user for that
 

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:27.410
location then you ask the user for that
once they've granted the permission you

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:27.420
once they've granted the permission you
 

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.210
once they've granted the permission you
have it you do not have to ask for it

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:29.220
have it you do not have to ask for it
 

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:32.180
have it you do not have to ask for it
again on the other hand the user can

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:32.190
again on the other hand the user can
 

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:34.190
again on the other hand the user can
deny things at any point you can go into

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:34.200
deny things at any point you can go into
 

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.230
deny things at any point you can go into
settings and look at all the permissions

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240
settings and look at all the permissions
 

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.970
settings and look at all the permissions
that are used by all the applications

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:37.980
that are used by all the applications
 

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.040
that are used by all the applications
and disable these selectively

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.050
and disable these selectively
 

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:41.500
and disable these selectively
which means that your application

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:41.510
which means that your application
 

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.450
which means that your application
especially if you wrote it priam and you

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:44.460
especially if you wrote it priam and you
 

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.100
especially if you wrote it priam and you
haven't touched the code since may be

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:46.110
haven't touched the code since may be
 

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:47.810
haven't touched the code since may be
denied a permission that you thought was

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:47.820
denied a permission that you thought was
 

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.060
denied a permission that you thought was
there because when it was installed that

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:50.070
there because when it was installed that
 

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:51.350
there because when it was installed that
permission was there so we have a

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.360
permission was there so we have a
 

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.330
permission was there so we have a
mechanism internally to you know throw

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:53.340
mechanism internally to you know throw
 

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.610
mechanism internally to you know throw
an exception or an error when you don't

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:55.620
an exception or an error when you don't
 

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.290
an exception or an error when you don't
get that exception and hopefully your

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:57.300
get that exception and hopefully your
 

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.480
get that exception and hopefully your
code is robust enough to handle that but

00:07:59.480 --> 00:07:59.490
code is robust enough to handle that but
 

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:02.120
code is robust enough to handle that but
if you're reattaching this with the M

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:02.130
if you're reattaching this with the M
 

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:04.130
if you're reattaching this with the M
runtime permissions then you want to be

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:04.140
runtime permissions then you want to be
 

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:05.720
runtime permissions then you want to be
able to handle that intelligently and

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:05.730
able to handle that intelligently and
 

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:08.870
able to handle that intelligently and
you want to also be able to give the

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:08.880
you want to also be able to give the
 

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.760
you want to also be able to give the
user a little bit more information when

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:10.770
user a little bit more information when
 

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:12.320
user a little bit more information when
it's necessary I'm not sure if I show

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:12.330
it's necessary I'm not sure if I show
 

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.410
it's necessary I'm not sure if I show
the flow there let's see no let me go

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:15.420
the flow there let's see no let me go
 

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:19.750
the flow there let's see no let me go
back so one of the things that helps is

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:19.760
back so one of the things that helps is
 

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.730
back so one of the things that helps is
there's there's sort of a to ask policy

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:22.740
there's there's sort of a to ask policy
 

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.320
there's there's sort of a to ask policy
so we'll ask the user and if you think

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:24.330
so we'll ask the user and if you think
 

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.000
so we'll ask the user and if you think
well this permission will be granted

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.010
well this permission will be granted
 

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:28.480
well this permission will be granted
there's no reason why they wouldn't let

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:28.490
there's no reason why they wouldn't let
 

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:30.860
there's no reason why they wouldn't let
let me have access to the camera because

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:30.870
let me have access to the camera because
 

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.779
let me have access to the camera because
obviously it's a photobooth application

00:08:32.779 --> 00:08:32.789
obviously it's a photobooth application
 

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:34.580
obviously it's a photobooth application
right so you pop up the permission and

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:34.590
right so you pop up the permission and
 

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.490
right so you pop up the permission and
the user says no I don't want this okay

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:37.500
the user says no I don't want this okay
 

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.589
the user says no I don't want this okay
well we allow you to ask again as the

00:08:39.589 --> 00:08:39.599
well we allow you to ask again as the
 

00:08:39.599 --> 00:08:41.779
well we allow you to ask again as the
application but that second time we ask

00:08:41.779 --> 00:08:41.789
application but that second time we ask
 

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:43.310
application but that second time we ask
we're gonna also include a checkbox that

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:43.320
we're gonna also include a checkbox that
 

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.690
we're gonna also include a checkbox that
says never ask me again because

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:44.700
says never ask me again because
 

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.370
says never ask me again because
otherwise it's like you're spamming the

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:46.380
otherwise it's like you're spamming the
 

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:47.450
otherwise it's like you're spamming the
user every time you

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:47.460
user every time you
 

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.550
user every time you
for this thing but maybe before you pop

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:49.560
for this thing but maybe before you pop
 

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.070
for this thing but maybe before you pop
up that permission again you can say

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.080
up that permission again you can say
 

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.080
up that permission again you can say
okay we need access to the following

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:54.090
okay we need access to the following
 

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:55.760
okay we need access to the following
thing because we have this feature

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:55.770
thing because we have this feature
 

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:56.450
thing because we have this feature
called

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:56.460
called
 

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.310
called
a camera and this is an application

00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.320
a camera and this is an application
 

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.160
a camera and this is an application
called a photobooth so maybe you

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:01.170
called a photobooth so maybe you
 

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:02.600
called a photobooth so maybe you
actually want to enable this permission

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:02.610
actually want to enable this permission
 

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:04.100
actually want to enable this permission
and once you think the user actually

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:04.110
and once you think the user actually
 

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.080
and once you think the user actually
understands why you're asking for the

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:06.090
understands why you're asking for the
 

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:08.090
understands why you're asking for the
permission then go ahead and tell us to

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:08.100
permission then go ahead and tell us to
 

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.970
permission then go ahead and tell us to
expose that dialog again we'll pop it up

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:10.980
expose that dialog again we'll pop it up
 

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.380
expose that dialog again we'll pop it up
hopefully they do the right thing and

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:12.390
hopefully they do the right thing and
 

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.260
hopefully they do the right thing and
you can go on about your business

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:14.270
you can go on about your business
 

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:16.670
you can go on about your business
so these permissions everything you're

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:16.680
so these permissions everything you're
 

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.980
so these permissions everything you're
asked for but to the user the app

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:18.990
asked for but to the user the app
 

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.440
asked for but to the user the app
actually has to deal with it I went over

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:21.450
actually has to deal with it I went over
 

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:22.820
actually has to deal with it I went over
a lot of that stuff we'll keep going

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:22.830
a lot of that stuff we'll keep going

many people know about the Android

many people know about the Android

to email somebody externally and
 

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:15.890
to email somebody externally and
organize that so we talked to a lot of

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:15.900
organize that so we talked to a lot of
 

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.750
organize that so we talked to a lot of
Android developers basically about how

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760
Android developers basically about how
 

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.910
Android developers basically about how
stuff works either internally or

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:19.920
stuff works either internally or
 

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.800
stuff works either internally or
externally so we had been on to talk

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:21.810
externally so we had been on to talk
 

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:24.440
externally so we had been on to talk
more in depth about permissions so you

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:24.450
more in depth about permissions so you
 

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:25.700
more in depth about permissions so you
can check out that episode if you want

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:25.710
can check out that episode if you want
 

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:27.950
can check out that episode if you want
to know more of the internals and how to

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:27.960
to know more of the internals and how to
 

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.380
to know more of the internals and how to
actually interact with permissions voice

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:30.390
actually interact with permissions voice
 

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:31.730
actually interact with permissions voice
interactions so we had the capability

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:31.740
interactions so we had the capability
 

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:34.610
interactions so we had the capability
already to have an intent launched with

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:34.620
already to have an intent launched with
 

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.820
already to have an intent launched with
a voice action now there's interactions

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:37.830
a voice action now there's interactions
 

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:39.380
a voice action now there's interactions
so you can actually interact with the

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:39.390
so you can actually interact with the
 

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.840
so you can actually interact with the
user after they launch your intent so

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:41.850
user after they launch your intent so
 

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:45.980
user after they launch your intent so
you specify this intent and you say I am

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:45.990
you specify this intent and you say I am
 

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:48.680
you specify this intent and you say I am
going to be launched on voice actions

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:48.690
going to be launched on voice actions
 

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.600
going to be launched on voice actions
and you could already say well if it's a

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:50.610
and you could already say well if it's a
 

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:52.100
and you could already say well if it's a
voice interaction do the following thing

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:52.110
voice interaction do the following thing
 

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:53.540
voice interaction do the following thing
but now you can actually go back to the

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:53.550
but now you can actually go back to the
 

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.280
but now you can actually go back to the
user and get some clarifying information

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:55.290
user and get some clarifying information
 

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:57.410
user and get some clarifying information
so you can say okay given the following

00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:57.420
so you can say okay given the following
 

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.300
so you can say okay given the following
string go ahead and do a text-to-speech

00:10:59.300 --> 00:10:59.310
string go ahead and do a text-to-speech
 

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:00.920
string go ahead and do a text-to-speech
thing and

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:00.930
thing and
 

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.870
thing and
say this to the user to get some more

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:02.880
say this to the user to get some more
 

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.340
say this to the user to get some more
information and then when you've got

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:04.350
information and then when you've got
 

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:06.560
information and then when you've got
that information launch my confirm

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:06.570
that information launch my confirm
 

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:09.530
that information launch my confirm
implementation and once I've got that

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:09.540
implementation and once I've got that
 

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.840
implementation and once I've got that
and I have the the following clarifying

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:11.850
and I have the the following clarifying
 

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:13.370
and I have the the following clarifying
information so basically they said

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:13.380
information so basically they said
 

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.050
information so basically they said
something that launch your app you

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:15.060
something that launch your app you
 

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.870
something that launch your app you
respond asking some clarifying question

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:17.880
respond asking some clarifying question
 

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.250
respond asking some clarifying question
they respond to that then you get that

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:19.260
they respond to that then you get that
 

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:20.660
they respond to that then you get that
additional information you can go on

feature of the new devices with that

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:26.340
feature of the new devices with that
 

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.490
feature of the new devices with that
capability you have the ability to pop

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:28.500
capability you have the ability to pop
 

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.010
capability you have the ability to pop
up your own user interface for

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:31.020
up your own user interface for
 

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.630
up your own user interface for
fingerprint authentication so there's a

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:32.640
fingerprint authentication so there's a
 

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.570
fingerprint authentication so there's a
api's where you can get the information

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:35.580
api's where you can get the information
 

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:38.540
api's where you can get the information
from the sensor and say okay have they

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:38.550
from the sensor and say okay have they
 

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:40.910
from the sensor and say okay have they
authenticated that they are the correct

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:40.920
authenticated that they are the correct
 

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.140
authenticated that they are the correct
user with the fingerprints that are

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:42.150
user with the fingerprints that are
 

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:44.990
user with the fingerprints that are
stored on the device and you can have

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.000
stored on the device and you can have
 

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.840
stored on the device and you can have
your own UI - to help the user

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:47.850
your own UI - to help the user
 

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:49.220
your own UI - to help the user
understand what they're doing and and

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:49.230
understand what they're doing and and
 

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.020
understand what they're doing and and
what the result of that was or you can

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:51.030
what the result of that was or you can
 

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:53.210
what the result of that was or you can
use the standard UI by calling create

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:53.220
use the standard UI by calling create
 

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:56.450
use the standard UI by calling create
confirmed device potential intent that's

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:56.460
confirmed device potential intent that's
 

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.460
confirmed device potential intent that's
a that's a mouthful right there that's a

00:11:58.460 --> 00:11:58.470
a that's a mouthful right there that's a
 

00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:59.930
a that's a mouthful right there that's a
lot of characters I think you're gonna

00:11:59.930 --> 00:11:59.940
lot of characters I think you're gonna
 

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:01.520
lot of characters I think you're gonna
wrap the line just with a method name

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:01.530
wrap the line just with a method name
 

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:03.680
wrap the line just with a method name
there so you can have us pop up the

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:03.690
there so you can have us pop up the
 

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:06.770
there so you can have us pop up the
normal lockscreen UI to ask the user to

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:06.780
normal lockscreen UI to ask the user to
 

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.170
normal lockscreen UI to ask the user to
authenticate that way as well there's a

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:09.180
authenticate that way as well there's a
 

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:11.390

couple of samples that are good to check

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:11.400
couple of samples that are good to check
 

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.030
couple of samples that are good to check
out there on the D Android comm site the

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:14.040
out there on the D Android comm site the
 

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.260
out there on the D Android comm site the
fingerprint dialog as well as a

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:15.270
fingerprint dialog as well as a
 

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:17.570
fingerprint dialog as well as a
confirmed credential and there's an i/o

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:17.580
confirmed credential and there's an i/o
 

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.280

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:21.830
by the fingerprint and payments api's
this was a sandbox talk at i/o and then

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:21.840
this was a sandbox talk at i/o and then
 

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.570
this was a sandbox talk at i/o and then
they recorded it as an i/o byte so you

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:23.580
they recorded it as an i/o byte so you
 

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.310
they recorded it as an i/o byte so you
can search for that title name and

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:25.320
can search for that title name and
 

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.590
can search for that title name and
you'll find Maya talking about this

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600
you'll find Maya talking about this
 

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.110
you'll find Maya talking about this

that we've we've had a conversation with
 

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:38.120
that we've we've had a conversation with
some of the fingerprint people on the

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:38.130
some of the fingerprint people on the
 

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:39.830
some of the fingerprint people on the
podcast as well so hopefully that'll

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:39.840
podcast as well so hopefully that'll
 

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.800
podcast as well so hopefully that'll
come out sometime soon we'll see Android

the more capabilities that a device has
the more apps want to take advantage of

the more apps want to take advantage of
 

00:15:49.709 --> 00:15:51.170
the more apps want to take advantage of
that you know they want their data all

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:51.180
that you know they want their data all
 

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:54.079

the time then we have a problem on the

the time then we have a problem on the
 

00:15:54.089 --> 00:15:55.850
the time then we have a problem on the
device because if all the applications

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:55.860
device because if all the applications
 

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:57.500

then pretty soon you're gonna drain the
 

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:01.400
then pretty soon you're gonna drain the
battery so we work really hard at the

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:01.410
battery so we work really hard at the
 

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:03.980
battery so we work really hard at the
platform level and we encourage apps to

platform level and we encourage apps to
 

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:06.319
platform level and we encourage apps to
work hard at the application level as

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.440
thing called doze mode so if it detects
if it's basically sitting on a counter

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:27.450
if it's basically sitting on a counter
 

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:29.240
if it's basically sitting on a counter
somewhere not moving we're using the

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:29.250
somewhere not moving we're using the
 

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:31.430
somewhere not moving we're using the
sensors to detect whether the device is

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440
sensors to detect whether the device is
 

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.680
sensors to detect whether the device is
actually being used and if it's not then

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:33.690
actually being used and if it's not then
 

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:35.240
actually being used and if it's not then
why are we doing anything so we'll go

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:35.250
why are we doing anything so we'll go
 

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:36.920
why are we doing anything so we'll go
into a deep sleep mode where we're not

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:36.930
into a deep sleep mode where we're not
 

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:39.889
into a deep sleep mode where we're not
sinking anything we will still wake up

00:16:39.889 --> 00:16:39.899
sinking anything we will still wake up
 

00:16:39.899 --> 00:16:41.600
sinking anything we will still wake up
for the important things if you have an

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:41.610
for the important things if you have an
 

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:44.389
for the important things if you have an
alarm scheduled or whatever but we're

00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399
alarm scheduled or whatever but we're
 

00:16:44.399 --> 00:16:46.100
alarm scheduled or whatever but we're
not really you know where the background

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:46.110
not really you know where the background
 

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:47.630
not really you know where the background
apps aren't going out and getting a

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:47.640
apps aren't going out and getting a
 

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.100
apps aren't going out and getting a
bunch of data which is frankly not going

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:49.110
bunch of data which is frankly not going
 

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:50.689
bunch of data which is frankly not going
to be used if the user is not actually

00:16:50.689 --> 00:16:50.699
to be used if the user is not actually
 

00:16:50.699 --> 00:16:52.910
to be used if the user is not actually
using their device at the time so we've

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:52.920
using their device at the time so we've
 

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.680
using their device at the time so we've
got doze mode we've also got app standby

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:54.690
got doze mode we've also got app standby
 

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:57.050
got doze mode we've also got app standby
mode which is more at the application

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:57.060
mode which is more at the application
 

00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:00.050
mode which is more at the application
level where we will notice that an

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:00.060
level where we will notice that an
 

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.240
level where we will notice that an
application has not been used for some

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:02.250
application has not been used for some
 

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:04.069
application has not been used for some
amount of time several days or whatever

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079
amount of time several days or whatever
 

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:06.710
amount of time several days or whatever
then why is that app continuing to sync

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720
then why is that app continuing to sync
 

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.600
then why is that app continuing to sync
right if I haven't actually used my

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:08.610
right if I haven't actually used my
 

00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:11.090
right if I haven't actually used my
reader app in four weeks why is it going

00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:11.100
reader app in four weeks why is it going
 

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:13.579
reader app in four weeks why is it going
out and retrieving you know sync points

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:13.589
out and retrieving you know sync points
 

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:14.720
out and retrieving you know sync points
and the books that I'm reading on a

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:14.730
and the books that I'm reading on a
 

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:16.640
and the books that I'm reading on a
different device there's no reason for

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:16.650
different device there's no reason for
 

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:18.199
different device there's no reason for
that so we'll notice that and then we'll

00:17:18.199 --> 00:17:18.209
that so we'll notice that and then we'll
 

00:17:18.209 --> 00:17:20.270
that so we'll notice that and then we'll
restrict the data usage of that

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:20.280
restrict the data usage of that
 

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.439
restrict the data usage of that
particular app so that it's not

00:17:21.439 --> 00:17:21.449
particular app so that it's not
 

00:17:21.449 --> 00:17:22.880
particular app so that it's not
constantly running and syncing in the

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:22.890
constantly running and syncing in the
 

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:24.559
constantly running and syncing in the
background draining your battery for

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:27.500
background draining your battery for
absolutely no reason whatsoever we have

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:27.510
absolutely no reason whatsoever we have
 

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:30.590
absolutely no reason whatsoever we have
a system support this is the now on tap

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:30.600
a system support this is the now on tap
 

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.470
a system support this is the now on tap
stuff that you may have seen at Google

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:33.480

application to provide more information
 

00:17:37.559 --> 00:17:39.620
application to provide more information
more contextual information so there's

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:39.630
more contextual information so there's
 

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:40.500
more contextual information so there's
some API

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:40.510
some API
 

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:42.930
some API
that you can opt-in to here override on

content and provide more information

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:47.050
content and provide more information
 

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:49.260
content and provide more information
back to the system so that we can give

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:49.270
back to the system so that we can give
 

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:52.440
back to the system so that we can give
the user even more context for how to

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:52.450
the user even more context for how to
 

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:54.720
the user even more context for how to
use your application given the

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:54.730
use your application given the
 

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:55.830
use your application given the
information that was on the screen at

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:55.840
information that was on the screen at
 

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:59.160
information that was on the screen at
the time data binding so this is a big

00:17:59.160 --> 00:17:59.170
the time data binding so this is a big
 

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:01.620
the time data binding so this is a big
thing that we did in the UI area it's

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:01.630
thing that we did in the UI area it's
 

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:05.340
thing that we did in the UI area it's
basically a way to save the developer

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:05.350
basically a way to save the developer
 

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:07.110
basically a way to save the developer
from writing a lot of boilerplate code

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:07.120
from writing a lot of boilerplate code
 

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.600
from writing a lot of boilerplate code
so it's not doing anything fundamentally

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:09.610
so it's not doing anything fundamentally
 

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:11.580
so it's not doing anything fundamentally
new it's just doing it in a way where we

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:11.590
new it's just doing it in a way where we
 

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:14.040
new it's just doing it in a way where we
do the work instead of you so if you

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:14.050
do the work instead of you so if you
 

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:16.580
do the work instead of you so if you
imagine in a UI there's usually a lot of

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:16.590
imagine in a UI there's usually a lot of
 

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:18.720
imagine in a UI there's usually a lot of
listeners in the system you're setting

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:18.730
listeners in the system you're setting
 

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:20.250
listeners in the system you're setting
up your you're creating these setters

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:20.260
up your you're creating these setters
 

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.260
up your you're creating these setters
and getters and listeners and sending

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:22.270
and getters and listeners and sending
 

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:24.750
and getters and listeners and sending
messages all around and a lot of that is

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:24.760
messages all around and a lot of that is
 

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.600
messages all around and a lot of that is
done because basically the user did an

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:27.610
done because basically the user did an
 

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:29.370
done because basically the user did an
action over here which needs to

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:29.380
action over here which needs to
 

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:30.960
action over here which needs to
propagate to another item over there

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:30.970
propagate to another item over there
 

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:32.820
propagate to another item over there
you're dragging a progress bar and you

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:32.830
you're dragging a progress bar and you
 

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:34.440
you're dragging a progress bar and you
want to update a textview somewhere a

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:34.450
want to update a textview somewhere a
 

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:36.690
want to update a textview somewhere a
label with the value of that progress

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:36.700
label with the value of that progress
 

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.720
label with the value of that progress
bar or the data itself changed and you

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:39.730
bar or the data itself changed and you
 

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:41.700
bar or the data itself changed and you
want that information to be displayed in

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:41.710
want that information to be displayed in
 

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:43.800
want that information to be displayed in
the UI somehow well now you can actually

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:43.810
the UI somehow well now you can actually
 

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:45.720
the UI somehow well now you can actually
connect those dots through data binding

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:45.730
connect those dots through data binding
 

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:47.190
connect those dots through data binding
and will automatically propagate that

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:47.200
and will automatically propagate that
 

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:51.390
and will automatically propagate that
for you so let's take a look at a tiny

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:51.400
for you so let's take a look at a tiny
 

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:55.560
for you so let's take a look at a tiny
little example so you may have a simple

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:55.570
little example so you may have a simple
 

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:58.110
little example so you may have a simple
app you have some image views and text

00:18:58.110 --> 00:18:58.120
app you have some image views and text
 

00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.790
app you have some image views and text
views that are based on information from

00:18:59.790 --> 00:18:59.800
views that are based on information from
 

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.500
views that are based on information from
some data that you're getting you know

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:01.510
some data that you're getting you know
 

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:03.930
some data that you're getting you know
over the network or off disk or whatever

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:03.940
over the network or off disk or whatever
 

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:08.280
over the network or off disk or whatever
so we have a new kind of layout tag

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:08.290
so we have a new kind of layout tag
 

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:13.380
so we have a new kind of layout tag
called layout and inside the layouts tag

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:13.390
called layout and inside the layouts tag
 

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:15.360
called layout and inside the layouts tag
goes all the information you used to put

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:15.370
goes all the information you used to put
 

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:18.210
goes all the information you used to put
for your view hierarchy so the old you

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:18.220
for your view hierarchy so the old you
 

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.580
for your view hierarchy so the old you
know the layout XML file or that goes in

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:20.590
know the layout XML file or that goes in
 

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:22.440
know the layout XML file or that goes in
the layout resource directory that stuff

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:22.450
the layout resource directory that stuff
 

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:23.910
the layout resource directory that stuff
still goes in there and you can see this

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:23.920
still goes in there and you can see this
 

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.550
still goes in there and you can see this
in the slide and the frame layout tag

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:25.560
in the slide and the frame layout tag
 

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.590
in the slide and the frame layout tag
normal view hierarchy stuff but in

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:28.600
normal view hierarchy stuff but in
 

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.240
normal view hierarchy stuff but in
addition to that we also have a data

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:30.250
addition to that we also have a data
 

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:32.400
addition to that we also have a data
area of the layout where you declare the

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:32.410
area of the layout where you declare the
 

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:34.170
area of the layout where you declare the
variables that are going to be used by

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:34.180
variables that are going to be used by
 

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:36.090
variables that are going to be used by
data binding in the rest of the file so

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:36.100
data binding in the rest of the file so
 

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.470
data binding in the rest of the file so
we say well we've got a variable named

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:37.480
we say well we've got a variable named
 

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:38.910
we say well we've got a variable named
item and here is the class that it

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:38.920
item and here is the class that it
 

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:43.560
item and here is the class that it
refers to and then we have the items

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:43.570
refers to and then we have the items
 

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:47.610
refers to and then we have the items
below that refer to it and say well we

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:47.620
below that refer to it and say well we
 

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.530
below that refer to it and say well we
want the source to be we want the source

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:49.540
want the source to be we want the source
 

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:51.690
want the source to be we want the source
of the image to be the value of this

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:51.700
of the image to be the value of this
 

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.300
of the image to be the value of this
image field in this item

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:54.310
image field in this item
 

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:58.560
image field in this item
and it'll go in and creates or use the

00:19:58.560 --> 00:19:58.570
and it'll go in and creates or use the
 

00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:00.360
and it'll go in and creates or use the
the getters and setters as necessary in

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:00.370
the getters and setters as necessary in
 

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:02.280
the getters and setters as necessary in
their and then for the textview what we

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:02.290
their and then for the textview what we
 

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:04.320
their and then for the textview what we
want the information in there to come

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:04.330
want the information in there to come
 

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:06.450
want the information in there to come
from the item itself but notice it's not

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:06.460
from the item itself but notice it's not
 

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:08.640
from the item itself but notice it's not
just simply grabbing a field we also

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:08.650
just simply grabbing a field we also
 

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:11.640
just simply grabbing a field we also
have some basic syntax in there that you

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:11.650
have some basic syntax in there that you
 

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:14.100
have some basic syntax in there that you
can use to make an expression in there

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:14.110
can use to make an expression in there
 

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:15.900
can use to make an expression in there
so here we're actually formatting it and

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:15.910
so here we're actually formatting it and
 

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:17.220
so here we're actually formatting it and
saying make a string out of the

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:17.230
saying make a string out of the
 

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:20.010
saying make a string out of the
following values and then display that

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:20.020
following values and then display that
 

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:21.360
following values and then display that
and the textview instead so then we get

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:21.370
and the textview instead so then we get
 

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:23.610
and the textview instead so then we get
the dollar sign in dollars and cents in

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:23.620
the dollar sign in dollars and cents in
 

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:27.360
the dollar sign in dollars and cents in
there so again fairly straightforward in

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:27.370
there so again fairly straightforward in
 

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:29.310
there so again fairly straightforward in
what it's doing but there's a lot of

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:29.320
what it's doing but there's a lot of
 

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:31.350
what it's doing but there's a lot of
stuff going on under the hood in

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:31.360
stuff going on under the hood in
 

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.810
stuff going on under the hood in
particular a lot of systems like this

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:33.820
particular a lot of systems like this
 

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.850
particular a lot of systems like this
could be written using reflection okay

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:35.860
could be written using reflection okay
 

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.140
could be written using reflection okay
well they told us to go look for this

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:37.150
well they told us to go look for this
 

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:39.000
well they told us to go look for this
thing so then at runtime you're going in

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:39.010
thing so then at runtime you're going in
 

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:40.230
thing so then at runtime you're going in
in the class and you're looking for a

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:40.240
in the class and you're looking for a
 

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.000
in the class and you're looking for a
field with this name or a getter and

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.010
field with this name or a getter and
 

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:44.430
field with this name or a getter and
setter with this name but instead we do

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:44.440
setter with this name but instead we do
 

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.350
setter with this name but instead we do
pre-processing so we take this layout

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:46.360
pre-processing so we take this layout
 

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:49.830
pre-processing so we take this layout
file and we create the the glue code all

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:49.840
file and we create the the glue code all
 

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.930
file and we create the the glue code all
the classes that are going to be doing

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:51.940
the classes that are going to be doing
 

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:54.360
the classes that are going to be doing
the monitoring for the the changes in

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:54.370
the monitoring for the the changes in
 

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:55.800
the monitoring for the the changes in
data and you know the getters and

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:55.810
data and you know the getters and
 

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:57.090
data and you know the getters and
setters that are necessary and the

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:57.100
setters that are necessary and the
 

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.310
setters that are necessary and the
listeners we create that for you so that

00:20:59.310 --> 00:20:59.320
listeners we create that for you so that
 

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.080
listeners we create that for you so that
at runtime we actually just send the

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:01.090
at runtime we actually just send the
 

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:02.790
at runtime we actually just send the
information through the normal mechanism

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:02.800
information through the normal mechanism
 

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.710
information through the normal mechanism
that you would do if you wrote optimal

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:04.720
that you would do if you wrote optimal
 

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.750
that you would do if you wrote optimal
code to do this so it's it's very

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:06.760
code to do this so it's it's very
 

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:07.950
code to do this so it's it's very
straightforward there's no reflection

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:07.960
straightforward there's no reflection
 

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.540
straightforward there's no reflection
used in the system it's all done at

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:09.550
used in the system it's all done at

and then there's a little bit of support

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:15.310
and then there's a little bit of support
 

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:18.600
and then there's a little bit of support
in the support library with the classes

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:18.610
in the support library with the classes

on data binding and I think we're gonna

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:30.280
on data binding and I think we're gonna
 

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:32.130
on data binding and I think we're gonna
have a talk in an upcoming conference as

well so there should be some recording

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:33.550
well so there should be some recording

trying to think of the resources that we

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:40.270
trying to think of the resources that we
 

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:42.150
trying to think of the resources that we
have for this stuff we had geet and

so some of the UI features that we had

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:49.270
so some of the UI features that we had
 

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:51.180
so some of the UI features that we had
in addition to data binding we had a

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:51.190
in addition to data binding we had a
 

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:52.920
in addition to data binding we had a
whole bunch of stuff around what we call

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:52.930
whole bunch of stuff around what we call
 

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:55.410

the design library design library was

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:55.420
the design library design library was
 

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:58.680
the design library design library was
basically us saying well there was there

00:21:58.680 --> 00:21:58.690
basically us saying well there was there
 

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:00.300
basically us saying well there was there
was a whole lot of stuff in the material

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:00.310
was a whole lot of stuff in the material
 

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:01.530
was a whole lot of stuff in the material
spec that we asked developers to

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:01.540
spec that we asked developers to
 

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:03.180
spec that we asked developers to
implement so that they could have you

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:03.190
implement so that they could have you
 

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:04.590
implement so that they could have you
know applications that look consistent

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:04.600
know applications that look consistent

know applications that look consistent
on the platform and we thought they were

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:06.150
on the platform and we thought they were
 

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:08.250
on the platform and we thought they were
good UI practice

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:08.260
good UI practice
 

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.260
good UI practice
and good UI experiences for people to

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:10.270
and good UI experiences for people to
 

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:12.000
and good UI experiences for people to
have and in the meantime you're on your

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:12.010
have and in the meantime you're on your
 

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:14.280
have and in the meantime you're on your
own so we took a step back and said okay

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:14.290
own so we took a step back and said okay
 

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:15.480
own so we took a step back and said okay
what are some of the common patterns

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:15.490
what are some of the common patterns
 

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:16.470
what are some of the common patterns
that we're telling developers to

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:16.480
that we're telling developers to
 

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.600
that we're telling developers to
implement which we could help them out

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:18.610
implement which we could help them out
 

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:22.830
implement which we could help them out
with so we created a bunch of smaller

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:22.840
with so we created a bunch of smaller
 

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.920
with so we created a bunch of smaller
classes and UI widgets that developers

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:25.930
classes and UI widgets that developers
 

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:28.500
classes and UI widgets that developers
can now just use to get a consistent

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:28.510
can now just use to get a consistent
 

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:30.510
can now just use to get a consistent
look and feel with everybody else using

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:30.520
look and feel with everybody else using
 

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.280
look and feel with everybody else using
those same widgets at the top of that

is you wouldn't use directly but it's
 

00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:38.220
is you wouldn't use directly but it's
basically the Chrome that everybody

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:38.230
basically the Chrome that everybody
 

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:41.130
basically the Chrome that everybody
plugs into for these other pieces it's

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:41.140
plugs into for these other pieces it's
 

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:43.200
plugs into for these other pieces it's
it's sort of the thing sitting at the

bar you need to sort of plug it in at
 

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:51.030
bar you need to sort of plug it in at
the top of a hierarchy not just have it

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:51.040
the top of a hierarchy not just have it
 

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.530
the top of a hierarchy not just have it
hanging out in space or if you want the

00:22:58.560 --> 00:22:58.570
coordinator layout kind of the architect
 

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:00.510
coordinator layout kind of the architect
of the rest of these things we have the

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:00.520
of the rest of these things we have the
 

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:03.360
of the rest of these things we have the
snack bar we have tab layouts we've got

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:03.370
snack bar we have tab layouts we've got

the navigation view just standards UI

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:06.490
the navigation view just standards UI
 

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:07.920
the navigation view just standards UI
patterns that we've been talking about

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:07.930
patterns that we've been talking about
 

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:09.600
patterns that we've been talking about
for a while but we encapsulated them

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:09.610
for a while but we encapsulated them
 

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:11.340
for a while but we encapsulated them
into these standard widgets in the

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:11.350
into these standard widgets in the
 

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:13.020
into these standard widgets in the
support library so that everybody can

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:13.030
support library so that everybody can
 

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:15.060
support library so that everybody can
use these and because it's in the sport

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:15.070
use these and because it's in the sport
 

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:16.650
use these and because it's in the sport
library you can use those on releases

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:16.660
library you can use those on releases
 

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:20.010
library you can use those on releases
prior to em as well text input layout so

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:20.020
prior to em as well text input layout so
 

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:21.300
prior to em as well text input layout so
it gives you more information about the

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:21.310
it gives you more information about the
 

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:23.250
it gives you more information about the
text that's being expected in that field

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:23.260
text that's being expected in that field
 

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:26.580
text that's being expected in that field
and then the fab and we always thought

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:26.590
and then the fab and we always thought
 

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:28.200
and then the fab and we always thought
the question came up while we were in

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:28.210
the question came up while we were in
 

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:30.870
the question came up while we were in
development in the L release about well

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:30.880
development in the L release about well
 

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.300
development in the L release about well
should we release a fab widget and we

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:33.310
should we release a fab widget and we
 

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:37.230
should we release a fab widget and we
decided not to because a it's it's it's

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:37.240
decided not to because a it's it's it's
 

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.520

like you're gonna have a fab widget and

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:40.990
like you're gonna have a fab widget and
 

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:42.390
like you're gonna have a fab widget and
it's gonna do everything you want well

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:42.400
it's gonna do everything you want well
 

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.220
it's gonna do everything you want well
where do you want that fab widget to

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:44.230
where do you want that fab widget to
 

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:46.680
where do you want that fab widget to
live like what is what is the container

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:46.690
live like what is what is the container
 

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:48.240
live like what is what is the container
that it actually lives in since it's

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:48.250
that it actually lives in since it's
 

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:50.940
that it actually lives in since it's
sort of overriding several of them so

00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:50.950
sort of overriding several of them so
 

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:52.530
sort of overriding several of them so
that was a little more complicated now

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:52.540
that was a little more complicated now
 

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:54.930
that was a little more complicated now
solved by the coordinator layout thing

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:54.940
solved by the coordinator layout thing
 

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:56.790
solved by the coordinator layout thing
but also it was like well it's it's a

00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:56.800
but also it was like well it's it's a
 

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.650
but also it was like well it's it's a
circle it's a circle with a drop shadow

00:23:58.650 --> 00:23:58.660
circle it's a circle with a drop shadow
 

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:00.990
circle it's a circle with a drop shadow
you know how hard is this thing turns

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:01.000
you know how hard is this thing turns
 

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.270
you know how hard is this thing turns
out it was trickier for some people and

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:03.280
out it was trickier for some people and
 

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:04.890
out it was trickier for some people and
in particular it was also inconsistent

00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:04.900
in particular it was also inconsistent
 

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.020
in particular it was also inconsistent
people would pick different elevations

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:07.030
people would pick different elevations
 

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:08.430
people would pick different elevations
or different ways of displaying the

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:08.440
or different ways of displaying the
 

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.350
or different ways of displaying the
shadows or they would have circles that

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:10.360
shadows or they would have circles that
 

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:11.700
shadows or they would have circles that
were of different sizes so we thought

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:11.710
were of different sizes so we thought
 

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:13.050
were of different sizes so we thought
maybe it's better if we actually just

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:13.060
maybe it's better if we actually just
 

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:14.670
maybe it's better if we actually just
come out with the standard widget so

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:14.680
come out with the standard widget so
 

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.410
come out with the standard widget so
that everybody has the same notion of of

it was difficult to do a richer

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:49.450
it was difficult to do a richer

animation when the content was changing
there was a built-in animation where you

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:53.170
there was a built-in animation where you
 

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:54.360
there was a built-in animation where you
could say okay the following item

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:54.370
could say okay the following item
 

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:56.190
could say okay the following item
changed and then we would replace the

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:56.200
changed and then we would replace the
 

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.720
changed and then we would replace the
old view with a new one and we would do

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:57.730
old view with a new one and we would do
 

00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:59.160
old view with a new one and we would do
a crossfade between them that's

00:25:59.160 --> 00:25:59.170
a crossfade between them that's
 

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:01.640
a crossfade between them that's
reasonable but if your views are very

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:01.650
reasonable but if your views are very
 

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:03.990
reasonable but if your views are very
rich and expensive you didn't

rich and expensive you didn't
 

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.390
rich and expensive you didn't
necessarily want to create a new view

for that thing additionally you might

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:08.260
for that thing additionally you might
 

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:10.290
for that thing additionally you might
want a richer animation to animate you

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:10.300
want a richer animation to animate you

know the text into its new location or a
 

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:15.180
know the text into its new location or a
color change or whatever so with the new

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:15.190
color change or whatever so with the new
 

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:19.050
color change or whatever so with the new
content animations you have the ability

00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:19.060
content animations you have the ability
 

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:21.390
content animations you have the ability
to override and do something custom all

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:21.400
to override and do something custom all
 

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:23.790
to override and do something custom all
on your own and in addition to that you

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:23.800
on your own and in addition to that you
 

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.190
on your own and in addition to that you
can actually use the same view so we're

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:26.200
can actually use the same view so we're
 

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.720
can actually use the same view so we're
not necessarily going to replace the

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:27.730
not necessarily going to replace the
 

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:30.990
not necessarily going to replace the
holder if you don't want us to we we can

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:31.000
holder if you don't want us to we we can
 

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.190
holder if you don't want us to we we can
have you reuse that holder and you

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:33.200
have you reuse that holder and you
 

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.470
have you reuse that holder and you
animate the the stuff around however you

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:35.480
animate the the stuff around however you
 

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:39.100
animate the the stuff around however you
want in webview they have the ability to

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:39.110
want in webview they have the ability to
 

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:41.049
want in webview they have the ability to
now render off-screen which is helpful

00:26:41.049 --> 00:26:41.059
now render off-screen which is helpful
 

00:26:41.059 --> 00:26:43.600
now render off-screen which is helpful
in the particular situation of you want

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:43.610
in the particular situation of you want
 

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:45.009
in the particular situation of you want
to animate something on screen and you

00:26:45.009 --> 00:26:45.019
to animate something on screen and you
 

00:26:45.019 --> 00:26:46.690
to animate something on screen and you
don't want it to be drawing at the same

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:46.700
don't want it to be drawing at the same
 

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:48.129
don't want it to be drawing at the same
time as it's doing that so you can pre

00:26:48.129 --> 00:26:48.139
time as it's doing that so you can pre
 

00:26:48.139 --> 00:26:50.470
time as it's doing that so you can pre
draw it using more memory to do that

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:50.480
draw it using more memory to do that
 

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.919
draw it using more memory to do that
off-screen and then animate it in

00:26:52.919 --> 00:26:52.929
off-screen and then animate it in
 

00:26:52.929 --> 00:26:54.850
off-screen and then animate it in
notifications so there was a new class

00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:54.860
notifications so there was a new class
 

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:57.340
notifications so there was a new class
added called icon which is basically a

00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:57.350
added called icon which is basically a
 

00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:59.560
added called icon which is basically a
holder for several different kinds of

00:26:59.560 --> 00:26:59.570
holder for several different kinds of
 

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:01.659
holder for several different kinds of
information it can be a resource ID or a

00:27:01.659 --> 00:27:01.669
information it can be a resource ID or a
 

00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:04.750
information it can be a resource ID or a
bitmap or a byte array this is basically

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:04.760
bitmap or a byte array this is basically
 

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.840
bitmap or a byte array this is basically
about having a more optimal way to hold

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:07.850
about having a more optimal way to hold
 

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:09.090
about having a more optimal way to hold
the information so that we're not

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:09.100
the information so that we're not
 

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:13.299
the information so that we're not
constantly you know recreating it along

00:27:13.299 --> 00:27:13.309
constantly you know recreating it along
 

00:27:13.309 --> 00:27:15.129
constantly you know recreating it along
the fly if you're if you're passing

00:27:15.129 --> 00:27:15.139
the fly if you're if you're passing
 

00:27:15.139 --> 00:27:16.570
the fly if you're if you're passing
around in notifications if you're

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:16.580
around in notifications if you're
 

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:18.039
around in notifications if you're
passing around a resource ID and then it

00:27:18.039 --> 00:27:18.049
passing around a resource ID and then it
 

00:27:18.049 --> 00:27:19.539
passing around a resource ID and then it
needs to get inflated by this part of

00:27:19.539 --> 00:27:19.549
needs to get inflated by this part of
 

00:27:19.549 --> 00:27:21.100
needs to get inflated by this part of
the system and then passed over to this

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:21.110
the system and then passed over to this
 

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:22.629
the system and then passed over to this
other process it then inflates that

00:27:22.629 --> 00:27:22.639
other process it then inflates that
 

00:27:22.639 --> 00:27:24.430
other process it then inflates that
resource ID like everybody's going

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:24.440
resource ID like everybody's going
 

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:25.690
resource ID like everybody's going
through the same work over and over

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:25.700
through the same work over and over
 

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:27.810
through the same work over and over
again so instead we just we have this

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:27.820
again so instead we just we have this
 

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:30.519
again so instead we just we have this
holder structure that holds whatever

00:27:30.519 --> 00:27:30.529
holder structure that holds whatever
 

00:27:30.529 --> 00:27:33.970
holder structure that holds whatever
representations are most optimal so you

00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:33.980
representations are most optimal so you
 

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:35.649
representations are most optimal so you
can create it with a resource that's one

00:27:35.649 --> 00:27:35.659
can create it with a resource that's one
 

00:27:35.659 --> 00:27:36.759
can create it with a resource that's one
of the ways that you can use this thing

00:27:36.759 --> 00:27:36.769
of the ways that you can use this thing
 

00:27:36.769 --> 00:27:38.470
of the ways that you can use this thing
but you can also create it with a bitmap

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:38.480
but you can also create it with a bitmap
 

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:40.799
but you can also create it with a bitmap
so this could be handy if you have

00:27:40.799 --> 00:27:40.809
so this could be handy if you have
 

00:27:40.809 --> 00:27:43.659
so this could be handy if you have
resources that indicates information

00:27:43.659 --> 00:27:43.669
resources that indicates information
 

00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:46.240
resources that indicates information
that can be variable over time so Dan's

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:46.250
that can be variable over time so Dan's
 

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:48.909
that can be variable over time so Dan's
example when we talked about this at a

00:27:48.909 --> 00:27:48.919
example when we talked about this at a
 

00:27:48.919 --> 00:27:50.769
example when we talked about this at a
Oh was a weather application may have

00:27:50.769 --> 00:27:50.779
Oh was a weather application may have
 

00:27:50.779 --> 00:27:51.820
Oh was a weather application may have
different icons for different

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:51.830
different icons for different
 

00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:54.070
different icons for different
temperatures well since we only allowed

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.080
temperatures well since we only allowed
 

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.360
temperatures well since we only allowed
you to create notifications from

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:55.370
you to create notifications from
 

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:57.700
you to create notifications from
resources before then you would actually

00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:57.710
resources before then you would actually
 

00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:59.830
resources before then you would actually
have to have assets representing all the

00:27:59.830 --> 00:27:59.840
have to have assets representing all the
 

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.419
have to have assets representing all the
different possible combinations of

00:28:01.419 --> 00:28:01.429
different possible combinations of
 

00:28:01.429 --> 00:28:04.480
different possible combinations of
temperatures which could be a lot if you

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:04.490
temperatures which could be a lot if you
 

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:07.090
temperatures which could be a lot if you
don't live in California or Hawaii and

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:07.100
don't live in California or Hawaii and
 

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:08.710
don't live in California or Hawaii and
so instead you can actually create those

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:08.720
so instead you can actually create those
 

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.269
so instead you can actually create those
dynamically now and then you can create

00:28:10.269 --> 00:28:10.279
dynamically now and then you can create
 

00:28:10.279 --> 00:28:12.580
dynamically now and then you can create
this icon class with the bitmap instead

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:12.590
this icon class with the bitmap instead
 

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:14.289
this icon class with the bitmap instead
of the resource ID so you don't need to

00:28:14.289 --> 00:28:14.299
of the resource ID so you don't need to
 

00:28:14.299 --> 00:28:17.110
of the resource ID so you don't need to
have any of these available at Build

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.120
have any of these available at Build
 

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.730
have any of these available at Build
time instead they can be generated at

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:18.740
time instead they can be generated at
 

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:22.120
time instead they can be generated at
runtime whenever you need them we had

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:22.130
runtime whenever you need them we had
 

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:23.980
runtime whenever you need them we had
some changes in text mostly in the UI

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:23.990
some changes in text mostly in the UI
 

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:26.500
some changes in text mostly in the UI
area so the way that you select text is

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:26.510
area so the way that you select text is
 

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:29.019
area so the way that you select text is
much more natural and powerful now so

00:28:29.019 --> 00:28:29.029
much more natural and powerful now so
 

00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:31.000
much more natural and powerful now so
you've got the text handles as before

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:31.010
you've got the text handles as before
 

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:33.909
you've got the text handles as before
but now you as you drag them out they

00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919
but now you as you drag them out they
 

00:28:33.919 --> 00:28:36.039
but now you as you drag them out they
expands by word instead of you know

00:28:36.039 --> 00:28:36.049
expands by word instead of you know
 

00:28:36.049 --> 00:28:37.570
expands by word instead of you know
always by character and then as you

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:37.580
always by character and then as you
 

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:39.820
always by character and then as you
contract it contracts by characters so

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:39.830
contract it contracts by characters so
 

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:42.940
contract it contracts by characters so
you can still select the same amount the

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:42.950
you can still select the same amount the
 

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:45.310
you can still select the same amount the
same granularity as you could before but

00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:45.320
same granularity as you could before but
 

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:47.020
same granularity as you could before but
common selection

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:47.030
common selection
 

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:49.390
common selection
operations should be much easier and

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:49.400
operations should be much easier and
 

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.340
operations should be much easier and
more fluid to the user in addition to

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:51.350
more fluid to the user in addition to
 

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:52.990
more fluid to the user in addition to
that you'll notice the floating palette

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:53.000
that you'll notice the floating palette
 

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.250
that you'll notice the floating palette
there prior to this change when you

00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:57.260
there prior to this change when you
 

00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:59.140
there prior to this change when you
selected text we would indicate what you

00:28:59.140 --> 00:28:59.150
selected text we would indicate what you
 

00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:00.520
selected text we would indicate what you
could do the actions that you could do

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:00.530
could do the actions that you could do
 

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:02.290
could do the actions that you could do
with that text up in the action bar

00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:02.300
with that text up in the action bar
 

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:05.590
with that text up in the action bar
which on a phone is not a big deal on a

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:05.600
which on a phone is not a big deal on a
 

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.540
which on a phone is not a big deal on a
tablet is a much bigger deal right

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:07.550
tablet is a much bigger deal right
 

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:09.040
tablet is a much bigger deal right
because you may be selecting text way

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:09.050
because you may be selecting text way
 

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:11.200
because you may be selecting text way
down here and the actions pop up in a

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:11.210
down here and the actions pop up in a
 

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:12.520
down here and the actions pop up in a
place that's not even necessarily in

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:12.530
place that's not even necessarily in
 

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:14.410
place that's not even necessarily in
your view so now we have this floating

00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:14.420
your view so now we have this floating
 

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:16.720
your view so now we have this floating
action palette instead that pops up next

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:16.730
action palette instead that pops up next
 

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:18.070
action palette instead that pops up next
to the area that you've just indicated

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:18.080
to the area that you've just indicated
 

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.920
to the area that you've just indicated
you want to work with we also have the

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:20.930
you want to work with we also have the
 

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:22.480
you want to work with we also have the
ability to process that text so you can

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:22.490
ability to process that text so you can
 

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:25.120
ability to process that text so you can
have an intent launched when the user

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:25.130
have an intent launched when the user
 

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:26.470
have an intent launched when the user
indicates that they want to do something

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:26.480
indicates that they want to do something
 

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.060
indicates that they want to do something
with that text so you could have say a

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:28.070
with that text so you could have say a
 

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:29.920
with that text so you could have say a
translation service that can take the

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:29.930
translation service that can take the

we also have higher text higher quality

00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:43.220
we also have higher text higher quality
 

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:44.950
we also have higher text higher quality
text formatting is sort of an ongoing

text formatting is sort of an ongoing
concern how can we make our text higher

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:47.420
concern how can we make our text higher

quality in general one of those ways is

00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:49.220
quality in general one of those ways is
 

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:51.730
quality in general one of those ways is
by providing better braking so this

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:51.740
by providing better braking so this
 

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:53.650
by providing better braking so this
means you know figuring out how long all

00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:53.660
means you know figuring out how long all
 

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:54.850
means you know figuring out how long all
the words are and then braking

00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:54.860
the words are and then braking
 

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:56.590
the words are and then braking
appropriately so we don't have you know

00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:56.600

as part of that we also have the ability
in static layout to set indents so you

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:47.270
in static layout to set indents so you
 

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:50.770
in static layout to set indents so you
can set it to a shaped path so you can

00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:50.780
can set it to a shaped path so you can
 

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:52.870
can set it to a shaped path so you can

so if you are interacting with a

00:32:19.379 --> 00:32:19.389
so if you are interacting with a
 

00:32:19.389 --> 00:32:23.359
so if you are interacting with a
particular user in a chat application

00:32:23.359 --> 00:32:23.369
particular user in a chat application
 

00:32:23.369 --> 00:32:26.999
particular user in a chat application
maybe it would make sense to to share

00:32:26.999 --> 00:32:27.009
maybe it would make sense to to share
 

00:32:27.009 --> 00:32:28.859
maybe it would make sense to to share
information about a chat with that

00:32:28.859 --> 00:32:28.869
information about a chat with that
 

00:32:28.869 --> 00:32:30.359

here's here's a chooser service that I'm
going to implement so when it needs to

going to implement so when it needs to
 

00:32:37.179 --> 00:32:39.090
going to implement so when it needs to
it'll launch that chooser service that

00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:39.100
it'll launch that chooser service that
 

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:40.830
it'll launch that chooser service that
you implemented and it'll ask you are

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:40.840
you implemented and it'll ask you are
 

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:42.570
you implemented and it'll ask you are
there other targets that I should choose

00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:42.580
there other targets that I should choose
 

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:46.049
there other targets that I should choose
for you when they want to to go into you

00:32:46.049 --> 00:32:46.059
for you when they want to to go into you
 

00:32:46.059 --> 00:32:48.930
for you when they want to to go into you
know some let's say the the chat target

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:48.940
know some let's say the the chat target
 

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:50.820
know some let's say the the chat target
and then you can expose different

frequently we have stylus support we

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:01.570
frequently we have stylus support we
 

00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:04.669
frequently we have stylus support we
always had stylus support to some extent

00:33:04.669 --> 00:33:04.679
always had stylus support to some extent
 

00:33:04.679 --> 00:33:07.769
always had stylus support to some extent
but it was particular styles devices it

00:33:07.769 --> 00:33:07.779
but it was particular styles devices it
 

00:33:07.779 --> 00:33:09.119
but it was particular styles devices it
was something that was plugged in there

00:33:09.119 --> 00:33:09.129
was something that was plugged in there
 

00:33:09.129 --> 00:33:11.580

now we have Bluetooth stylus support and

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:11.590
now we have Bluetooth stylus support and
 

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:12.869
now we have Bluetooth stylus support and
we have some new events that go along

00:33:12.869 --> 00:33:12.879
we have some new events that go along
 

00:33:12.879 --> 00:33:13.920
we have some new events that go along
with

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:13.930

in particular we have the button stylus

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:17.050
in particular we have the button stylus
 

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:18.750
in particular we have the button stylus
primary and button stylus secondary

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:18.760
primary and button stylus secondary
 

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:22.290
primary and button stylus secondary
button stylus primary equates to the

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:22.300
button stylus primary equates to the
 

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:25.890
button stylus primary equates to the
button buttons secondary in earlier

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:25.900
button buttons secondary in earlier
 

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:27.210
button buttons secondary in earlier
releases so if you want to track the

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:27.220
releases so if you want to track the
 

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:29.550
releases so if you want to track the
same event prior to M you can certainly

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:29.560
same event prior to M you can certainly
 

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:30.870
same event prior to M you can certainly
do that but if you want to track the

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:30.880
do that but if you want to track the
 

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:33.270
do that but if you want to track the
stylus event directly in M then use the

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:33.280
stylus event directly in M then use the
 

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.610
stylus event directly in M then use the
stylus primary this is because the the

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:35.620
stylus primary this is because the the
 

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:37.380
stylus primary this is because the the
button press we still want to track you

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:37.390
button press we still want to track you
 

00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:38.640
button press we still want to track you
know when you when the user clicks

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:38.650
know when you when the user clicks
 

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:41.340
know when you when the user clicks
presses on the screen we want to know

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:41.350
presses on the screen we want to know
 

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:42.810
presses on the screen we want to know
that that's actually a touch event as

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:42.820
that that's actually a touch event as
 

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:44.670
that that's actually a touch event as
opposed to a stylus event so that's the

00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:44.680
opposed to a stylus event so that's the
 

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:46.470
opposed to a stylus event so that's the
primary event is button press primary

00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:46.480
primary event is button press primary
 

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:49.830
primary event is button press primary
and then button press secondary is an

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:49.840
and then button press secondary is an
 

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:52.770
and then button press secondary is an
alias to the button stylus primary and

00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:52.780
alias to the button stylus primary and
 

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:54.300
alias to the button stylus primary and
then you can have things like the click

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:54.310
then you can have things like the click
 

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:56.370
then you can have things like the click
drag gestures so they can select that

00:33:56.370 --> 00:33:56.380
drag gestures so they can select that
 

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:57.840
drag gestures so they can select that
thing and drag it on the screen with the

00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:57.850
thing and drag it on the screen with the
 

00:33:57.850 --> 00:34:01.980

camera so it used to be that if you want

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:06.850
camera so it used to be that if you want
 

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:08.310
camera so it used to be that if you want
to turn on the flashlight you would grab

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:08.320
to turn on the flashlight you would grab
 

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:10.620
to turn on the flashlight you would grab
the camera just to enable the flashlight

00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:10.630
the camera just to enable the flashlight
 

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:13.560
the camera just to enable the flashlight
which seems like a lot of work to go

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:13.570
which seems like a lot of work to go
 

00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:16.770
which seems like a lot of work to go
through just to light up the closet when

through just to light up the closet when
 

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:18.480
through just to light up the closet when
you're in there at night so instead we

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:18.490
you're in there at night so instead we
 

00:34:18.490 --> 00:34:20.130
you're in there at night so instead we
no longer require that you can actually

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:20.140
no longer require that you can actually
 

00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:21.390
no longer require that you can actually
turn on the flashlight without grabbing

00:34:21.390 --> 00:34:21.400
turn on the flashlight without grabbing
 

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.940
turn on the flashlight without grabbing
the mutex of the camera and wasting a

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:23.950
the mutex of the camera and wasting a
 

00:34:23.950 --> 00:34:26.160
the mutex of the camera and wasting a
lot of battery in the meantime and then

00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:26.170
lot of battery in the meantime and then
 

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:27.840
lot of battery in the meantime and then
there's a simple API that you can use

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:27.850
there's a simple API that you can use
 

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:33.240
there's a simple API that you can use
there alpha optimization so this is this

00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:33.250
there alpha optimization so this is this
 

00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:35.160

the cult likes to talk about when you
are fading out of view or setting alpha

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:40.630
are fading out of view or setting alpha
 

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:43.320
are fading out of view or setting alpha
on a view if that view is complicated it

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:43.330
on a view if that view is complicated it
 

00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:46.770
on a view if that view is complicated it
it's usually optimal for you to create a

00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:46.780
it's usually optimal for you to create a
 

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:48.600
it's usually optimal for you to create a
layer for that view so that we draw it

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:48.610
layer for that view so that we draw it
 

00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:50.640
layer for that view so that we draw it
once to that layer and then we simply

00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:50.650
once to that layer and then we simply
 

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:53.070
once to that layer and then we simply
fade that layer so for instance if

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:53.080
fade that layer so for instance if
 

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:54.540
fade that layer so for instance if
you're running a fading animation if

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:54.550
you're running a fading animation if
 

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:56.130
you're running a fading animation if
you're fading in a view or fading it out

00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:56.140
you're fading in a view or fading it out
 

00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:58.980
you're fading in a view or fading it out
it would be typical to use the animate

00:34:58.980 --> 00:34:58.990
it would be typical to use the animate
 

00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:02.340
it would be typical to use the animate
API see it's a beaut animate dot with

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:02.350
API see it's a beaut animate dot with
 

00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:05.700
API see it's a beaut animate dot with
layer and that tells us to build a layer

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:05.710
layer and that tells us to build a layer
 

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:08.880
layer and that tells us to build a layer
and then you animate alpha to fade it in

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:08.890
and then you animate alpha to fade it in
 

00:35:08.890 --> 00:35:11.100
and then you animate alpha to fade it in
and then you the layer gets torn down

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:11.110
and then you the layer gets torn down
 

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:13.260
and then you the layer gets torn down
when we're done we basically do that for

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:13.270
when we're done we basically do that for
 

00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:15.210
when we're done we basically do that for
you automatically now so when we notice

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:15.220
you automatically now so when we notice
 

00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:17.130
you automatically now so when we notice
that you're setting alpha on a layer we

00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:17.140
that you're setting alpha on a layer we
 

00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:19.290
that you're setting alpha on a layer we
will create our alpha on a view we'll

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:19.300
will create our alpha on a view we'll
 

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:21.990
will create our alpha on a view we'll
create a layer for you and this saves us

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:22.000
create a layer for you and this saves us
 

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.450
create a layer for you and this saves us
from if you imagine what the the Alpha

00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:24.460
from if you imagine what the the Alpha
 

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:26.190
from if you imagine what the the Alpha
operation is

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:26.200
operation is
 

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:28.260
operation is
the way alpha has to work is that we

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:28.270
the way alpha has to work is that we
 

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:29.849
the way alpha has to work is that we
have to draw that view the way we

00:35:29.849 --> 00:35:29.859
have to draw that view the way we
 

00:35:29.859 --> 00:35:31.319
have to draw that view the way we
normally do so opaquely

00:35:31.319 --> 00:35:31.329
normally do so opaquely

normally do so opaquely
to an external buffer and then when

00:35:33.359 --> 00:35:33.369
to an external buffer and then when
 

00:35:33.369 --> 00:35:35.190
to an external buffer and then when
we're done with that thing we copy it in

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:35.200
we're done with that thing we copy it in
 

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:37.650
we're done with that thing we copy it in
translucently it's not good enough for

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:37.660
translucently it's not good enough for
 

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:39.150
translucently it's not good enough for
us to draw all of the individual

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:39.160
us to draw all of the individual
 

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.640
us to draw all of the individual
operations translucently it's a little

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:41.650
operations translucently it's a little
 

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:42.510
operations translucently it's a little
hard to explain

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:42.520
hard to explain
 

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:43.920
hard to explain
I could I could use a whiteboard and

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:43.930
I could I could use a whiteboard and
 

00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:46.170
I could I could use a whiteboard and
show you but we can't do that which

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:46.180
show you but we can't do that which
 

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:47.940
show you but we can't do that which
means that's the cheap way to do it and

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:47.950
means that's the cheap way to do it and
 

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:49.319
means that's the cheap way to do it and
we can't use it instead we create a

00:35:49.319 --> 00:35:49.329
we can't use it instead we create a
 

00:35:49.329 --> 00:35:51.569
we can't use it instead we create a
buffer draw everything copy it in

00:35:51.569 --> 00:35:51.579
buffer draw everything copy it in
 

00:35:51.579 --> 00:35:53.700
buffer draw everything copy it in
destroy the buffer huge wasted effort on

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:53.710
destroy the buffer huge wasted effort on
 

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:55.410
destroy the buffer huge wasted effort on
every single frame it's much better to

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:55.420
every single frame it's much better to
 

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:58.049
every single frame it's much better to
create the buffer once use it for all

00:35:58.049 --> 00:35:58.059
create the buffer once use it for all
 

00:35:58.059 --> 00:35:59.370
create the buffer once use it for all
the frames that you want it and then

00:35:59.370 --> 00:35:59.380
the frames that you want it and then
 

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:01.230
the frames that you want it and then
teardown the buffer so that's what we do

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:01.240
teardown the buffer so that's what we do
 

00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:03.210
teardown the buffer so that's what we do
when we set alpha we automatically

00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:03.220
when we set alpha we automatically
 

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:05.250
when we set alpha we automatically
create a layer for you and then we use

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:05.260
create a layer for you and then we use
 

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:07.410
create a layer for you and then we use
that from then on it's still better for

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:07.420
that from then on it's still better for
 

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:09.450
that from then on it's still better for
you to do it because you know more about

00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:09.460
you to do it because you know more about
 

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:11.670
you to do it because you know more about

that you want when we first notice that

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:16.510
that you want when we first notice that
 

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:19.230
that you want when we first notice that
alpha is non opaque that's when we

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:19.240
alpha is non opaque that's when we
 

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:20.490
alpha is non opaque that's when we
create the layer which means that you

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:20.500
create the layer which means that you
 

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.230
create the layer which means that you
may take a hit on that first frame as

00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:22.240
may take a hit on that first frame as
 

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.059
may take a hit on that first frame as
we're going to the effort of creating

we're going to the effort of creating
 

00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:26.160
we're going to the effort of creating
the buffer so you may rather take that

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:26.170
the buffer so you may rather take that
 

00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:27.870
the buffer so you may rather take that
hit at a different time when the users

00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:27.880
hit at a different time when the users
 

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:30.839
hit at a different time when the users
not going to notice so still use the set

00:36:30.839 --> 00:36:30.849
not going to notice so still use the set
 

00:36:30.849 --> 00:36:32.940
not going to notice so still use the set

platform in the audio area the big
 

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:41.579
platform in the audio area the big
change was MIDI so you could already do

00:36:41.579 --> 00:36:41.589
change was MIDI so you could already do
 

00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:43.319
change was MIDI so you could already do
MIDI if you wanted but you were kind of

00:36:43.319 --> 00:36:43.329
MIDI if you wanted but you were kind of
 

00:36:43.329 --> 00:36:45.630
MIDI if you wanted but you were kind of
on your own right you could receive all

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:45.640
on your own right you could receive all
 

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:47.849
on your own right you could receive all
the information through USB and you

00:36:47.849 --> 00:36:47.859
the information through USB and you
 

00:36:47.859 --> 00:36:49.530
the information through USB and you
could do whatever you wanted with it but

00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:49.540
could do whatever you wanted with it but
 

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:51.030
could do whatever you wanted with it but
now we have classes and capabilities

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:51.040
now we have classes and capabilities
 

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:53.549
now we have classes and capabilities
that we built for you to make this a lot

00:36:53.549 --> 00:36:53.559
that we built for you to make this a lot
 

00:36:53.559 --> 00:36:55.770
that we built for you to make this a lot
easier and we also made it to

00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:55.780
easier and we also made it to
 

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:58.380
easier and we also made it to
directional so not only do they have the

00:36:58.380 --> 00:36:58.390
directional so not only do they have the
 

00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:00.510
directional so not only do they have the
ability for someone to play a device

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:00.520
ability for someone to play a device
 

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:05.670
ability for someone to play a device
into the Android device and send Ian the

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:05.680
into the Android device and send Ian the
 

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.829
into the Android device and send Ian the
note information and you know philosophy

00:37:07.829 --> 00:37:07.839
note information and you know philosophy
 

00:37:07.839 --> 00:37:09.839
note information and you know philosophy
and which channel they're playing and

00:37:09.839 --> 00:37:09.849
and which channel they're playing and
 

00:37:09.849 --> 00:37:11.099
and which channel they're playing and
then you could play it from your

00:37:11.099 --> 00:37:11.109
then you could play it from your
 

00:37:11.109 --> 00:37:13.140
then you could play it from your
application if you have you know some

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:13.150
application if you have you know some
 

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:16.620
application if you have you know some
samples some sounds database then you

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:16.630
samples some sounds database then you
 

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:17.940
samples some sounds database then you
could actually play those samples based

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:17.950
could actually play those samples based
 

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:19.140
could actually play those samples based
on the note information that was coming

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:19.150
on the note information that was coming
 

00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:21.930
on the note information that was coming
into the Android device but now you also

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:21.940
into the Android device but now you also
 

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:23.640
into the Android device but now you also
have the ability to send the information

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:23.650
have the ability to send the information
 

00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:25.109
have the ability to send the information
now so you could have a keyboard on the

00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:25.119
now so you could have a keyboard on the
 

00:37:25.119 --> 00:37:26.700
now so you could have a keyboard on the
Android device sending the note

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:26.710
Android device sending the note
 

00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:28.470
Android device sending the note
information out playing those samples

00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:28.480
information out playing those samples
 

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:31.710
information out playing those samples
from the external sample device so both

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:31.720
from the external sample device so both
 

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:33.240
from the external sample device so both
sides of that so check out MIDI device

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:33.250
sides of that so check out MIDI device
 

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:35.940
sides of that so check out MIDI device
manager and MIDI device service to know

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:35.950
manager and MIDI device service to know
 

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:38.549
manager and MIDI device service to know
how to interact with those in Tools

00:37:38.549 --> 00:37:38.559
how to interact with those in Tools
 

00:37:38.559 --> 00:37:39.540
how to interact with those in Tools
there's been a bunch

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:39.550
there's been a bunch
 

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:41.940
there's been a bunch
stuff coming up to IO but also since

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:41.950
stuff coming up to IO but also since
 

00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:44.490
stuff coming up to IO but also since
then so the 1.4 release came out

00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:44.500
then so the 1.4 release came out
 

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:46.770
then so the 1.4 release came out
recently and we have the ability to

00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:46.780
recently and we have the ability to
 

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:48.810
recently and we have the ability to
actually do stuff with vector drawables

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:48.820
actually do stuff with vector drawables
 

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:50.550
actually do stuff with vector drawables
so you can visualize vector drawables in

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:50.560
so you can visualize vector drawables in
 

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:53.220
so you can visualize vector drawables in
the tool now and you can also take a

00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:53.230
the tool now and you can also take a
 

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:56.520
the tool now and you can also take a
look at a lot of standard SVG files and

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:56.530
look at a lot of standard SVG files and
 

00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:59.430
look at a lot of standard SVG files and
import those or export those as vector

00:37:59.430 --> 00:37:59.440
import those or export those as vector
 

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:02.640
import those or export those as vector
drawables and I think save those as

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:02.650
drawables and I think save those as
 

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:04.800
drawables and I think save those as
image files as well so a lot more

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:04.810
image files as well so a lot more
 

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:06.410
image files as well so a lot more
flexibility in how you can deal with

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:06.420
flexibility in how you can deal with
 

00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:09.990
flexibility in how you can deal with
vector art in your application and also

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:10.000
vector art in your application and also
 

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.690
vector art in your application and also
design library templates so there's a

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:12.700
design library templates so there's a
 

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:14.310
design library templates so there's a
lot more templates in there that you can

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:14.320
lot more templates in there that you can
 

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.140
lot more templates in there that you can
use for standard design patterns that

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:16.150
use for standard design patterns that
 

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:17.270
use for standard design patterns that
use some of the design library

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280
use some of the design library
 

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.870
use some of the design library
components that I was talking about

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:18.880
components that I was talking about
 

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:21.390
components that I was talking about
earlier there's a theme editor right now

00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:21.400
earlier there's a theme editor right now
 

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:23.400
earlier there's a theme editor right now
it currently only handles colors but it

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:23.410
it currently only handles colors but it
 

00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:25.890
it currently only handles colors but it
allows you to see the color palette

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:25.900
allows you to see the color palette
 

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:27.300
allows you to see the color palette
that's being used and interact with that

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:27.310
that's being used and interact with that
 

00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:30.450
that's being used and interact with that
and change that GPU and network monitors

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:30.460
and change that GPU and network monitors
 

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:32.040
and change that GPU and network monitors
these are these are cool there's a lot

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:32.050
these are these are cool there's a lot
 

00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:33.900

this is cool heap dump analysis there's
been a couple of cool things about this

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:29.830
been a couple of cool things about this
 

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:33.930
been a couple of cool things about this
recently it used to be if you wanted to

00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:33.940
recently it used to be if you wanted to
 

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:36.570
recently it used to be if you wanted to
find leaks important things like

00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:36.580
find leaks important things like
 

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:38.820
find leaks important things like
activity leaks which I may or may not

00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:38.830
activity leaks which I may or may not
 

00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:42.360
activity leaks which I may or may not
admit to having introduced at some

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:42.370
admit to having introduced at some
 

00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:44.820
admit to having introduced at some
points in my past asked me some time

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:44.830
points in my past asked me some time
 

00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:48.719
points in my past asked me some time
about leak hashmap so

00:39:48.719 --> 00:39:48.729
about leak hashmap so
 

00:39:48.729 --> 00:39:51.130
about leak hashmap so
what you would do is you would take a

00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:51.140
what you would do is you would take a
 

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:52.989
what you would do is you would take a
heap dump so there's something in

00:39:52.989 --> 00:39:52.999
heap dump so there's something in
 

00:39:52.999 --> 00:39:54.969
heap dump so there's something in
Android monitor or DD a mass where you

00:39:54.969 --> 00:39:54.979
Android monitor or DD a mass where you
 

00:39:54.979 --> 00:39:56.799
Android monitor or DD a mass where you
could say take a heap dump you typically

00:39:56.799 --> 00:39:56.809
could say take a heap dump you typically
 

00:39:56.809 --> 00:39:59.529
could say take a heap dump you typically
like GC GC and then take a heap dump and

00:39:59.529 --> 00:39:59.539
like GC GC and then take a heap dump and
 

00:39:59.539 --> 00:40:01.120
like GC GC and then take a heap dump and
then you would convert that heap dump

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:01.130
then you would convert that heap dump
 

00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:03.160
then you would convert that heap dump
and then you would run a tool like mat

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:03.170
and then you would run a tool like mat
 

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:06.309
and then you would run a tool like mat
which is a Clips standalone or plug in

00:40:06.309 --> 00:40:06.319
which is a Clips standalone or plug in
 

00:40:06.319 --> 00:40:07.479
which is a Clips standalone or plug in
thing that you can run and then you

00:40:07.479 --> 00:40:07.489
thing that you can run and then you
 

00:40:07.489 --> 00:40:10.239
thing that you can run and then you
would get ton of information that you

00:40:10.239 --> 00:40:10.249
would get ton of information that you
 

00:40:10.249 --> 00:40:12.309
would get ton of information that you
would then try to sort of wade through

00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:12.319
would then try to sort of wade through
 

00:40:12.319 --> 00:40:14.829
would then try to sort of wade through
it's like systrace for memory right yeah

00:40:14.829 --> 00:40:14.839
it's like systrace for memory right yeah
 

00:40:14.839 --> 00:40:15.849
it's like systrace for memory right yeah
you would wade through this information

00:40:15.849 --> 00:40:15.859
you would wade through this information
 

00:40:15.859 --> 00:40:18.069
you would wade through this information
to figure out like what existed that I

00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:18.079
to figure out like what existed that I
 

00:40:18.079 --> 00:40:20.920
to figure out like what existed that I
did not expect like seven instances of

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:20.930
did not expect like seven instances of
 

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:22.989
did not expect like seven instances of
my activity and then you trace it back

00:40:22.989 --> 00:40:22.999
my activity and then you trace it back
 

00:40:22.999 --> 00:40:24.759
my activity and then you trace it back
to the root set and say okay why did it

00:40:24.759 --> 00:40:24.769
to the root set and say okay why did it
 

00:40:24.769 --> 00:40:26.259
to the root set and say okay why did it
exist who is referring to this thing

00:40:26.259 --> 00:40:26.269

on the tips a lot of the tips are the
 

00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:12.730
on the tips a lot of the tips are the
same because you probably have the same

same because you probably have the same
 

00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:14.460
same because you probably have the same
problem occurring over and over again

00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:14.470
problem occurring over and over again
 

00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:16.390

moreover once you fix some of these

00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400
moreover once you fix some of these
 

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:18.490

fundamental problems you'll find a lot

00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:18.500
fundamental problems you'll find a lot

of the overall performance goes up
 

00:43:20.089 --> 00:43:22.030
of the overall performance goes up
because usually there's just a couple of

when you should have so there's some
 

00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:33.730
when you should have so there's some

internally so I would encourage you to

00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:35.480
internally so I would encourage you to
 

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:37.390
internally so I would encourage you to
go back to systrace if you gave up

00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:37.400
go back to systrace if you gave up
 

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:39.730

because it was just too hairy go back to
 

00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:41.140
because it was just too hairy go back to
it now and see whether it can help you

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:41.150
it now and see whether it can help you
 

00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:42.190

00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:44.720
performance and then there's also a
 

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:46.120

about memory concerns there and we go

00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:21.600
about memory concerns there and we go
 

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:23.660
about memory concerns there and we go
into a fair amount of detail about how

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:23.670
into a fair amount of detail about how
 

00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:25.220

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:40.940
pain for developers and we don't want to
crash apps out there and and let's be

00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:40.950
crash apps out there and and let's be
 

00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:42.980
crash apps out there and and let's be
clear we still didn't actually remove it

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:42.990
clear we still didn't actually remove it
 

00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:44.810
clear we still didn't actually remove it
from the runtime so if you're an old app

00:45:44.810 --> 00:45:44.820
from the runtime so if you're an old app
 

00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:48.260
from the runtime so if you're an old app
still using apache HTTP it will still

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:48.270
still using apache HTTP it will still
 

00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:50.270
still using apache HTTP it will still

00:45:55.530 --> 00:45:57.440
think we said back in 2011 that people
should stop using this and then we

00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:57.450
should stop using this and then we
 

00:45:57.450 --> 00:45:59.600
should stop using this and then we
finally hit the API this year so it

00:45:59.600 --> 00:45:59.610
finally hit the API this year so it
 

00:45:59.610 --> 00:46:01.730

mean it so you should use HTTP URL

00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:04.650

00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:16.340
three four okay all right
I shouldn't have raised my hand actually

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:16.350
I shouldn't have raised my hand actually
 

00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:19.550
I shouldn't have raised my hand actually
I don't really use these api's and

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:19.560
I don't really use these api's and
 

00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:22.820
I don't really use these api's and
finally I would encourage you to check

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:22.830
finally I would encourage you to check
 

00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:24.680
finally I would encourage you to check
out a series of articles that we

00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:24.690
out a series of articles that we
 

00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:25.470
out a series of articles that we
published on me

00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:25.480
published on me
 

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:28.590
published on me
I'm calm this actually came from an

00:46:28.590 --> 00:46:28.600
I'm calm this actually came from an
 

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:30.540
I'm calm this actually came from an
internal effort that we had we talked to

00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:30.550
internal effort that we had we talked to
 

00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:32.670
internal effort that we had we talked to
internal app developers who said you

00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:32.680
internal app developers who said you
 

00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:35.220
internal app developers who said you
know we keep talking to you know the

00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:35.230
know we keep talking to you know the
 

00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:36.510
know we keep talking to you know the
framework team and finding out that

00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:36.520
framework team and finding out that
 

00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:38.520
framework team and finding out that
we're doing things wrong like or you

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:38.530
we're doing things wrong like or you
 

00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:39.840
we're doing things wrong like or you
know we'll ask a question about how to

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:39.850
know we'll ask a question about how to
 

00:46:39.850 --> 00:46:41.700
know we'll ask a question about how to
do something an answer will be no don't

00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:41.710
do something an answer will be no don't
 

00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:43.770
do something an answer will be no don't
do it that way or obviously you should

00:46:43.770 --> 00:46:43.780
do it that way or obviously you should
 

00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:45.599
do it that way or obviously you should
have used a layer there or you know

00:46:45.599 --> 00:46:45.609
have used a layer there or you know
 

00:46:45.609 --> 00:46:47.910
have used a layer there or you know
don't do that on the UI thread or why

00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:47.920
don't do that on the UI thread or why
 

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:50.160
don't do that on the UI thread or why
are you turning garbage so we have all

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:50.170
are you turning garbage so we have all
 

00:46:50.170 --> 00:46:52.140
are you turning garbage so we have all
these things in our minds and the apps

00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:52.150
these things in our minds and the apps
 

00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:54.480

teams didn't and it turns out one of the

probably like the rest of the world came
 

00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:03.660
probably like the rest of the world came
from a world of developing Java that was

00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:03.670
from a world of developing Java that was
 

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:05.340
from a world of developing Java that was
quite different it is the same

00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:05.350
quite different it is the same
 

00:47:05.350 --> 00:47:07.109
quite different it is the same
programming language but it is not

00:47:07.109 --> 00:47:07.119
programming language but it is not
 

00:47:07.119 --> 00:47:08.820
programming language but it is not
necessarily the same environment if you

00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:08.830
necessarily the same environment if you
 

00:47:08.830 --> 00:47:12.180
necessarily the same environment if you
write Java programs for a server and

00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:12.190
write Java programs for a server and
 

00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:14.400
write Java programs for a server and
then you try to use those same patterns

00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:14.410
then you try to use those same patterns
 

00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:15.960
then you try to use those same patterns
and approaches to write a mobile

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:15.970
and approaches to write a mobile
 

00:47:15.970 --> 00:47:18.810
and approaches to write a mobile
application you will suffer for it right

00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:18.820
application you will suffer for it right
 

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:20.820
application you will suffer for it right
because we do not have the same kind of

00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:20.830
because we do not have the same kind of
 

00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:23.580
because we do not have the same kind of
constraints on mobile devices we don't

00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:23.590
constraints on mobile devices we don't
 

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:25.109
constraints on mobile devices we don't
have the same resources we don't have

00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:25.119
have the same resources we don't have
 

00:47:25.119 --> 00:47:26.640
have the same resources we don't have
the same memory it's not the same

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:26.650
the same memory it's not the same
 

00:47:26.650 --> 00:47:28.410
the same memory it's not the same
runtime there's a lot of things that are

00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:28.420
runtime there's a lot of things that are
 

00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:30.720
runtime there's a lot of things that are
very very different apart from the

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:30.730
very very different apart from the
 

00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:32.940
very very different apart from the
programming language itself so we wrote

00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:32.950
programming language itself so we wrote
 

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:35.040
programming language itself so we wrote
this extremely long article that we

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:35.050
this extremely long article that we
 

00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:37.080
this extremely long article that we
posted internally and said okay here's

00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:37.090
posted internally and said okay here's
 

00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:38.520

up over the years you know the things

00:47:42.330 --> 00:47:42.340
up over the years you know the things
 

00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:44.070
up over the years you know the things
that you should avoid the patterns that

00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:44.080
that you should avoid the patterns that
 

00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:46.200
that you should avoid the patterns that
you should use on Android and then we

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:46.210
you should use on Android and then we
 

00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:48.540
you should use on Android and then we
went to publish it externally and it

00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:48.550
went to publish it externally and it
 

00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:49.890

little bit hard to write rules for

little bit hard to write rules for
 

00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:19.560
little bit hard to write rules for
Android like it is you know patterns for

Android like it is you know patterns for

Android like it is you know patterns for
software development like always do this

they don't not all of the rules apply to

they don't not all of the rules apply to

they don't not all of the rules apply to
all developers but it's kind of good to

all developers but it's kind of good to
 

00:49:05.530 --> 00:49:07.770
all developers but it's kind of good to
get a sense for what the problems are as

get a sense for what the problems are as
 

00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:10.200
get a sense for what the problems are as
well as why and then also come to the

basically going over some of those rules

00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:20.110
basically going over some of those rules

basically going over some of those rules
specifically in memory I only have an

specifically in memory I only have an
 

00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:24.150

hour so it's about a three hour talk
