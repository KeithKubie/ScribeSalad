00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.320
From now on,
I will use a few shortcuts here and

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.190
there to jump around the editor and
get different things done.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.820
I'm doing this on a Mac, thus I'm
going to use the CMD key a lot, but

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.610
most shortcuts work just as well on
Windows by substituting CMD with CTRL.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.700
Searching and
finding matters a lot to me.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.440
Hitting CMD+T will bring
up the fuzzy file finder.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.150
The search box forgives many
spelling mistakes or omissions so

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.570
jumping from file to
file gets lightning fast.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.850
Most developers prefer this method over
manually searching for a previously open

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.680
tab as this involves zero mouse input
and no thinking about the tab position.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.862
It's a perfect example of an action
that looks more complex than clicking

00:00:45.862 --> 00:00:48.503
on a tab, but
is actually faster and simpler.

00:00:48.503 --> 00:00:52.624
Typing an @ symbol into that box,
or directly typing CMD+R,

00:00:52.624 --> 00:00:56.010
will bring up the symbol search menu.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.220
This allows you to quickly locate
stuff in the current file, and

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.569
it works extremely well for
CSS or JavaScript functions.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.610
Now I know I use this color
somewhere else in this CSS file and

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.400
I want to quickly locate it.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.875
So I have it already selected and
on my keyboard I'm going to hit

00:01:13.875 --> 00:01:19.020
CMD+ALT+G and
it finds the next instance of it.

00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:24.340
Sublime Text has a very powerful
tab completion feature.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.430
In a nutshell, tab completion allows
you to type a whole lot less.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.360
And typing less usually results
in your finishing faster.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.980
So if I go into my HTML file and
type in img and

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.250
hit Tab,
it expands it out to the full image tag.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.060
Notice how not only it created an image
tag with the most important attributes

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.730
for us, it also place the cursor
in the right position for

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:48.990
us to enter information in.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.420
Many editors support multiple
selection these days.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.985
That's the ability to have multiple
selections in the same document

00:01:56.985 --> 00:01:58.715
that aren't next to each other.

00:01:58.715 --> 00:02:02.000
But most of the time, folks show
that off with column selection,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.290
which can be done by holding the ALT
key and dragging your cursor around.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.320
It sure looks cool but
the use cases for it are so

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.420
rare that I almost never use it.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.200
So let's see how we can
do this the Sublime way.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.890
So I have this word color right here
selected and have pressed CMD+D.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.010
And it shows us the next
instance of that word,

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.100
without clearing
the selection of the first.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.035
And it doesn't stop there.

00:02:29.035 --> 00:02:35.400
CMD+CTRL+G selects all instances of
the word throughout the whole file.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.280
You can think of it as
a global selection.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.890
So, this makes it very easy for
us to quickly refactor.
