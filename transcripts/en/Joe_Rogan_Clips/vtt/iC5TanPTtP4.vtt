1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.110
And you look back now with what you know now and all the athletes you've worked

2
00:00:04.111 --> 00:00:05.190
with at the UFC pie,

3
00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:08.120
do you think you would've done anything different in terms of [inaudible]?

4
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.030
Even think about it.
I knew it was fake about it.
All right.
Yeah.
Yeah.

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.060
<v 1>Sorry,
sorry.
Dot.
Oh,
just bought eight rounds.
Why would just sparring rounds,</v>

6
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.800
there's no eight route for,
oh,

7
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.840
you literally just get it.
The slower forced,
the already slow.
I don't know.

8
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.810
<v 0>It's again,
being a pioneer like you were,</v>

9
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.610
there wasn't really a whole lot of guys before you that we're operating.

10
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.030
<v 1>I had the other pioneers like the Randy's and the chunks and that's what they</v>

11
00:00:36.031 --> 00:00:39.420
were doing.
So,
oh,
better be tough of it or do what they do.

12
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.870
<v 0>That's the craziest thing about Ellie Mae is I'm not going to question them.</v>

13
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.340
Boxing it already figured out.

14
00:00:44.341 --> 00:00:46.320
You shouldn't beat the fuck out of each other every day.

15
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.320
They had already kind of figured that out.
The other thing they figured out is,

16
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.350
<v 1>uh,
we would work with people.
I can spar with Vandelay chuck,
uh,</v>

17
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.780
Randy in boxing,
they don't spar with people.

18
00:00:56.781 --> 00:01:00.860
They're equals past a certain point in camp.
Well,
think about it.

19
00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:04.790
You know a lot about,
they start like is Floyd Mayweather sparring with,

20
00:01:04.791 --> 00:01:09.620
I don't know,
really good people his level.
No,
no,
definitely not.
He's,
he's funny.

21
00:01:09.621 --> 00:01:13.980
People would boxers and he's tooling them.
Yes,
yes.
Yeah.

22
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.610
Have you heard of them though?
They're not famous and rich,

23
00:01:16.611 --> 00:01:19.070
so they're not the best in the world.
They're not elite.

24
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.400
Whereas you think about like a gym,
like our gym.

25
00:01:22.401 --> 00:01:25.120
Like I'll just use Randy's cause I don't want to talk bad about anybody.

26
00:01:25.121 --> 00:01:28.730
Like you're fighting other champions every day.
Right.
Maybe.

27
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.970
Maybe dangerous as fuck.
Yeah.
Maybe drilled together.
Sure.

28
00:01:31.971 --> 00:01:35.420
Learn from each other or role wrestle,
like control your training.

29
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.940
<v 0>[inaudible] especially guys that are in the same way.</v>

30
00:01:37.941 --> 00:01:41.170
Classes you that may someday fight you.
It's awkward.
Yeah.
Yeah.

31
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.540
And there was no guidebook.
Yeah.
You,
you know,

32
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.970
guys like Keith Jardeen and Rashad Evans figured out,
they're like,
all right,

33
00:01:48.971 --> 00:01:51.220
we already had to fight each other.
We'll try together.

34
00:01:51.221 --> 00:01:55.780
Now we won't have to do it again.
Right.
That's good.
Move.
If it works out.

35
00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.600
Um,
the,
the level of guys now is,
it's so extraordinary to see,

36
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.640
like when you see the elite champions of today,

37
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.420
you just have this insane level of,
of,
of fighter.

38
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.660
It's really as a person who's been involved in the sport,
as long as I have,

39
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.060
I still never cease to be amazed at the level of talent of these guys coming up

40
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.830
because some of these guys coming up,

41
00:02:17.831 --> 00:02:20.140
they just could do everything and they can do everything.

42
00:02:20.141 --> 00:02:21.550
It's such a high level and you realizing you're,

43
00:02:21.551 --> 00:02:25.510
you're seeing the results of kids that started out learning MMA when they,

44
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.710
in five,
six years old,

45
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.460
<v 1>man,
you know,
I had a purse,
I have a personal gym and I remember Rhonda Rousey.</v>

46
00:02:31.461 --> 00:02:33.460
They're like,
man,
she's going to change my bottom line.

47
00:02:33.461 --> 00:02:35.260
All of a sudden I got a mat full of,
uh,

48
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.850
young women just trading one to be a jab at it.
I was like,

49
00:02:39.851 --> 00:02:41.740
this is crazy.
Thank you,
Rodney.

50
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.150
<v 0>Yeah,
chief for short changed it.
Gina Carano changed a little bit before her,</v>

51
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.560
you know,
people have this idea like,
oh,
you could be pretty and fuck people up.

52
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.740
Like,
oh,
that's a totally different kind of girl.
That's like a superhero,

53
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.570
like a real life superhero.
Now she plays and movies,
right?
Yeah.
