00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:38.500
[ Applause ]

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.190
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Pugh: The quality
of mercy is not strained.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.830
It droppeth as the gentle rain
from heaven upon the place beneath.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.720
It is twice blessed.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.360
It blessed him that
gives and him that takes.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.810
From Portia from The
Merchant of Venice.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.510
Good evening, Justice Ginsburg,

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.070
esteemed guests, ladies
and gentlemen.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.260
I welcome you to the
Coolidge Auditorium

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.160
for tonight's very
special performance.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.250
My name is Elizabeth Pugh
and I am honored to serve

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.530
as the General Counsel for
the Library of Congress.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.440
Our Law Librarian, Jane Sanchez,
could not be with us this evening,

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.150
so I'm thrilled to be able to
open tonight's event on behalf

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.560
of the Law Library of Congress.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.650
The Law Library is the custodian
of the world's largest collection

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.380
of legal materials, with nearly
three million items and counting,

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.160
in numerous languages and formats.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.360
The Law Library serves
all three branches

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.470
of the United States
government, the practicing bar,

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.080
state and local governments,
American businesses, scholars

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.890
and the world legal community.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.530
Throughout the year the Law Library
presents many public programs

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.280
focused on current legal topics.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.110 position:56%
Coming this fall look out for
events celebrating Constitution Day,

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.800
Human Rights Day, as well

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.180
as the Kellogg Biennial
Lecture on Jurisprudence.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.040
Tonight's performance
is the last of a series

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.790
of three events commemorating
the 500th anniversary

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.020
of the establishment of the
Jewish Ghetto in Venice, Italy.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.280
The Law Library previously
held two lectures.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.830
The first one in 2016 entitled The
City of the Jews: Segregated Space

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.850
and the Admission of Strangers
in the Jewish Ghetto of Venice,

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.020
and another this past February
Understanding Seclusion:

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.760
the Legal Dimensions of the Ghetto.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.690
You can find videos of
both of these events

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.790
on the Law Library's
YouTube channel.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.780
This event tonight was made
possible by a generous donation

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.030
to the Library of Congress from
the American's Sephardi Federation.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.850
The Library also gratefully
recognizes a contribution received

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.810
through the Friends
of the Law Library

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.880
of Congress from Thomas Reuters.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.590
An additional support was
provided by Mr. Robert S. Roth,

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.960
Jr. This mock trial was
staged last year in Venice,

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.820
Italy as part of the city's
500th anniversary commemorations.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.780
We are fortunate that
the coordinator

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.140
for last year's event
agreed to reprise his role

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.210
for us in the United States.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.920
For his efforts to produce
tonight's performance I would

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.360
like to recognize Dick
Schneider, Associate Dean

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.150
for International Affairs
and Professor of Law

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.510
at Wake Forest University
School of Law.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:51.300
[ Applause ]

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:59.790
And the only male judge
on our bench tonight.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.090
&gt;&gt; Richard Schneider: Yes.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.390
[inaudible].

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.820
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Pugh: And let me
introduce the distinguished cast.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.530
Arguing on behalf of
Portia, Teresa Miguel-Stearns

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.510
of the Lillian Goldman Law
Library of Yale Law School.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.040
[ Applause ]

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.490 position:56%
Arguing on behalf of Antonio and the
Republic of Venice, Eugene Gulland

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.510
of Covington and Burling.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.520
[ Applause ]

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.510
And arguing on behalf of Shylock,
Michael Klotz of Jones Day.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.190
[ Applause ]

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.800
And now our distinguished
panel of judges.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.510
Micaela del Monte of the European
Parliament Research Service.

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.160
[ Applause ]

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:57.510
Suzanne Reynolds, Dean of Wake
Forest University School of Law.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.050
[ Applause ]

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.510
Dick Schneider also of Wake
Forest University School of Law

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.590
[ Applause ]

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.510
Ambassador Connie Morella.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.040
[ Applause ]

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.810
And the judge who needs
no introduction,

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.110
but I'm going to say it.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.180
The judge who will deliver the
final verdict, Associate Justice

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.510
of the Supreme Court of the United
States, Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:41.290
[ Applause ]

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.600
And, finally, the man
playing, finally,

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:49.510
playing the man whose fate hangs in
the balance is Ed Gero as Shylock.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:54.500
[ Applause ]

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.080
I think he'll appear later.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.370
Before we get to the trial you
will hear from two speakers.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.140
David Dangoor of the American
Sephardi Federation will help us

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.480
understand the history of the
Sephardic Jews, their connection

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.160
to Venice and the Diaspora.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.530
Michael Kahn of the Shakespeare
Theatre Company will refresh our

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.010
memories on the plot of The
Merchant in Venice in order

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.660
to help frame the scene that
you will see on tonight's stage.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.610
And then, after the judges
take recess for deliberations,

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.500
you will hear from Professor Jim
Shapiro of Columbia University,

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.590
who will go into more
depth about The Merchant

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.290 position:56%
of Venice during Shakespeare's time.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.200
So before the performance
begins I'd like to remind you

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.130
to kindly switch your mobile phones

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.570
and other devices to
the silent mode.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:48.110
And please note that tonight's
program is being recorded

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.960
as a Facebook live stream,
and for later presentation

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.980
on the Law Library's
YouTube channel.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:07:00.510
And now I would like to invite
David Dangoor to the stage.

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:08.750
[ Applause ]

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.240
&gt;&gt; David Dangoor: Thank
you, ladies and gentlemen.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.430
On behalf of the American Sephardi
Federation I'm very pleased

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:19.750
to be able to stand in front
of you, and be a sponsor

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.950
of today's interesting event.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:26.540
And obviously it's a great
honor for us to be associated

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:35.390
with this distinguished panel
of judges and judge Ginsburg.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:39.090
I will very briefly just
tell you something in context

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:43.140
about this play, and the
importance to Jewish history.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.350
The American Sephardi
Federation is an organization

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.920
that is strictly cultural
and historic.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:53.110
And we study the history, and we
preserve and promote the history,

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:56.740
of what I'll call the Unknown Jews.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:00.800 position:56%
There's a very large contingent of
Jews that come from the Middle East,

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.510
the Far East, North
Africa, and originally some

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:07.600
of them from Spain and Portugal.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.120
They are largely forgotten
in history today.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:15.230
And you will see why we want to
be associated with this event.

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:18.350
We represent the Jewish
history of all these Jews

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.860
from the Iberian Peninsula,
the Balkans, the Middle East,

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:27.510
North Africa, the Far East, and
importantly early American history.

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:32.030
The Jews came here very early
via mainly the Caribbean.

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:35.400
So it's, therefore, a special
pleasure today on behalf

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.590
of the American Sephardi
Federation to convey that we have

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:41.770
since long adopted
Shylock of The Merchant

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:43.710
of Venice as a Sephardic Jew.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:47.110
I.e., a Jew originating
from the mass exodus of Jews

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:51.240
from the Iberian Peninsula, and
in his case likely from Spain.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.710
A specific history that
we at the Federation guard

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:59.500
and study among several
other Jewish histories.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.950
There are hints in
the Shakespeare play

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:07.020
that this very well probably
is a Sephardic Jew from Spain.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.550
Before I explain, allow
me first to outline why

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:13.210
in some way the play The Merchant
of Venice is to be viewed as a gift

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:15.630 position:56%
to the Jewish people by Shakespeare.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.760
This is the perspective.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.160
Because of the understandable
enormous historical

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.530
and social attention to the
horrors of the Holocaust,

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:26.890
there's little focus and
interest to remind us today

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:29.680
of the terrible plight in
Europe for the Jewish people

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.060
from the latter half of the Middle
Ages throughout the early modern

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:36.020
period, culminating
in the Holocaust,

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:39.010
and the failed mass attack
in attempt to drive the Jews

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:42.050
into the Mediterranean in 1948.

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:45.280
Because of the brilliance and fame
of Shakespeare, and the brilliance

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.620
of his play, The Merchant of
Venice functions as a reminder

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:53.190
of the long-standing and violent
justice toward the Jewish people.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:56.970
This will continue to help to
revisit earlier Jewish history.

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:58.270
Including, for example,

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:01.530
the slaughter of the innocent large
Jewish communities along the Rhine

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:06.040
River in Europe, Southern France,
of the detestable Inquisition

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.480
with burnings at the stake,
[inaudible] and mass [inaudible]

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:14.190
in Spain, Portugal and it's
sideshows in Sicily and Venice,

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.970
and many other parts
of the Mediterranean.

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:20.360
At the time of Shakespeare
writing the play,

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.510
there still were many
show tribes of Jews

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:26.540
and so-called converses,
including in Venice.

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:31.800
And in England at the
time, to use a later term,

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:37.420
England was [inaudible]
following their expulsion in 1290

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:42.440
in the Elizabethan era
which was very anti-Jewish.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:46.240
Jews were only allowed back
in 1656 under Cromwell,

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.640
some 60 years after
The Merchant of Venice.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.650
In summary, wearing a historical
hat, it's noteworthy that the play

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:57.090
at the time only deals with
basically financial matters,

00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:01.930
and not something much worse, which
would have been typical of the day.

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:07.270
In other words, for this reason and
the famous monologue in the play,

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:10.470
optimistically viewed, maybe
this is one of the early European

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.830
and English attempts
to humanize Jews.

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:15.910
The next attempt in
England really only came

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:20.430
with Sir Walter Scott's widely
popular novel Ivanhoe in 1820

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:23.740
with Rebecca and her father
being among the lead characters,

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:27.580
perhaps even paving the way
for the Israeli's ascendance

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:30.620
as Prime Minister in
England in 1868,

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:34.390
200 years after The
Merchant of Venice.

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:38.430
The Venetian Ghetto, where Jews had
to live, was constituted in 1516

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:43.710
as you heard, only 14 years after
the Spanish Inquisition in 1492.

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:47.290
Several very wealthy Sephardic
Jewish trading families fled

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:50.880
to Venice, where Jews had been
allowed to live more freely

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.920
in the Venetian Republic.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.090
There's little doubt that the
ghetto, with its strict boundaries,

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:59.450
was a result of the Inquisition
fever sweeping the rounds

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:01.540
of the Catholic Church.

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:04.220
The Ghetto was divided
into two areas--

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.570
the Ghetto Nuovo, the New Ghetto,

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:10.260
and the adjacent Ghetto
Vecchio, the Old Ghetto.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.150
These names of the Ghetto
sections are misleading

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:17.120
as actually the Ghetto
Nuovo is the older one.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.450
A large number of Jews

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:21.660
from different backgrounds
came to live in the Ghetto.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:26.000
But over time they never developed
a distinct Venetian identity.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.120
Instead they continued strongly
to identify with their origins.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:35.400
Therefore, four of the five
synagogues were clearly divided

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:40.320
according to ethnic identity in
the Ghetto-- the German Synagogue,

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:44.540
the Italian Synagogue, the
Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue,

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.900
and the Levantine Synagogue.

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.830
There was a fifth synagogue,
the so-called Canton Synagogue,

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:56.150
but that was built specifically
for private use by four families.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:13:01.950
The languages spoken at the time
in the Ghetto included Venetian,

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:07.780
Italian, Judeo Spanish, Judeo
Arabic, Spanish, French and German,

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:11.260
while Hebrew was traditionally
used on signage, inscriptions

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.910
and for official purposes, as
well as wedding contracts and,

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:17.330
of course, in religious services.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:21.400
Allow me, finally, a quick
background on the word "ghetto."

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.310
Like with so much about the play
there are different explanations

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:27.860
and theories about the
origins of the word.

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:32.900
Some say the word originates
from the foundries in Venice,

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:38.160
where the Italian word "getto"
is very similar to "ghetto."

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.170
But it's most likely that
the word "ghetto" derives

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:45.620
from the Gothic word
"gatto," which means street.

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:51.140
And the reasoning for that is the
Jews throughout the Middle Ages

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:56.480 position:56%
usually congregated along one street
where they would have all their Jew,

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:00.230
all their shops and
places of commerce.

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:04.110
So it was very easy to decide
to enclose a street like that,

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:07.170
and put up boundaries,
and make it into a ghetto.

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:11.200
The strict confinement of the
Jews and Venetian Ghetto ended

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.000
with an edict by the
28-year-old Napoleon

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:22.060 position:56%
in 1797 following his conquest and
dissolving of the Venetian Republic.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.090
That's what you need to know.

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:25.890
Thank you.

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:34.500
[ Applause ]

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:49.680
&gt;&gt; Michael Kahn: Good evening.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.340
I've been given the task
of explaining to you a play

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.520
that I think you've
all seen and read.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:00.060
But I've been told to maybe
refresh your minds about the story.

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:05.050
Just let me tell you that it
was first published in 1600.

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:09.740
And that Shakespeare, as much
of the time, took the stories

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:13.040
that he had read, that
were written earlier.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.180
One was the story of
the bond of flesh,

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:19.380
and the other was the
story of the caskets.

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:25.390
Now The Merchant of Venice, we very
often confuse the fact we think

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.880
because Shylock is such
a vibrant character,

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:29.950
we think that The Merchant
of Venice is Shylock.

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:31.770
But indeed he's not.

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:35.720
He is the real Merchant of
Venice, Antonio, a trader.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:41.250 position:56%
In the beginning of the play we find
Antonio with several of his friends,

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:46.240
young men among whom are
Bassanio and Lorenzo.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:51.330
Bassanio has come to Antonio
admitting that he has spent a lot

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:56.320
of Antonio's money trying to better
himself, and also buying a lot

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.640
of very good items and clothes

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:02.410
that have made him a
great man about town.

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:07.060
But he tells Antonio that he has
the possibility of repaying all

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:12.030
of that money again, because he has
found a beautiful heiress living

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:16.600
on an island outside of
Venice who is named Portia,

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:21.600
and he wishes to vie
for her in marriage.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.670
Antonio, who says he doesn't have
very much money at the moment,

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:28.200
but says, "For you
I want to do this."

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:31.940
And he goes to the only place
that he can get this money,

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:39.480
and that is to Shylock,
who lends money.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:43.930
Shylock tells him first,
of course, of how badly he

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:47.830 position:56%
and his fellow Jews have been
treated by the Christians of Venice,

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:49.480
and yet they come to him for money.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:53.000
But he says, "I will do this."

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.960
And in the process of this
negotiation he says, "You know,

00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.990
I am not going to charge
you anything.

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:04.040
I just want if you do not repay me

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:10.060 position:56%
in a merry jest let me say I will
take a pound of your flesh to be cut

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:13.250
from wherever in your body I wish."

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:16.000
Antonio, who has been
a successful merchant,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.670
finds this actually
a charitable request,

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:23.050
because it's basically impossible.

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:24.960
And he comes home with the money.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:32.080
And Bassanio goes off
to Belmont to Portia.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:38.050
There is another friend of
Shylock that we should mention.

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.490
And that is young Lorenzo.

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:46.280
Lorenzo has seen and become
attracted to, and perhaps fallen

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:51.410
in love with, a young Jewess who
lives in the Ghetto, Jessica.

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:55.270
Jessica is Shylock's daughter.

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:58.760
At one point in the
play, rather early on,

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:04.640
Lorenzo abducts Jessica quite
willingly, who leaves the Ghetto

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:10.860
and her father with a
great deal of his money.

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:19.030
Shylock is deeply, deeply,
deeply distressed by this.

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:24.190
Antonio's ventures at sea
proved to be disastrous.

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:26.070
The ships are wrecked.

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:29.890 position:56%
And Antonio cannot pay Shylock back.

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:36.510
This comes very soon after Shylock
has, his daughter has been stolen.

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:41.870
And Shylock demands that the
bond be paid, and that the pound

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:45.320
of flesh be taken from
Antonio's body.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:51.580
There is a great trial, which
will be discussed tonight.

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:58.690
And in that trial Portia
arrives dressed as a man,

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:11.940
and pretends to be a lawyer, and
eventually wins Antonio's suit.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:17.600
And Shylock is not only
asked to give up his money,

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:24.140
but he's also asked and told he
must be baptized as a Christian

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:26.130
at the end of this trial.

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:29.580
There is one more act of this
play where everybody goes back

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:34.160
to Belmont, and seems to get along
very well in some productions.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.080
In other productions not so well.

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:39.720
But it is why Shylock,
who ends the fourth act,

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:45.130
the fifth act is Belmont, and that
is why this play is always put

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:47.670
as one of Shakespeare's comedies,

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:50.300
because it seems to
have a happy ending.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:54.810
But there is no question that
the resonant issue of this play,

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:59.240
and the largest character
display, is Shylock and his fate.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.510
And that's what we're going
to talk about tonight.

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:12.500

&gt;&gt; Edward Gero: Good evening.

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:33.180
In his first speech Shylock
expresses his surprise

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:35.850
at Antonio's request for a loan.

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:44.890
Senor Antonio, many a time and oft
in the Rialto you have rated me

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:50.000
about my moneys and my usances.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.020
Still have I borne it
with a patient shrug,

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:59.000
for suffering is the
badge of all our tribe.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.900
You call me misbeliever,
cut-throat dog,

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:08.460
and spit upon my Jewish gabardine.

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:14.870
And all for use of
that which is mine own.

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:22.840
Well then, it now appears
you need my help.

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.770
Go to, then.

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:33.290
You come to me, and you say,
"Shylock, we would have moneys."

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:35.480
You say so.

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:42.010
You, did void your rheum
upon my beard and foot me

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:46.750
as you spurn a stranger
cur over your threshold.

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:50.410
Moneys is your suit.

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:53.210
What should I say to you?

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:59.580 position:56%
Should I not say, "Hath a dog money?

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:06.650
Is it possible a cur
can lend 3,000 ducats?"

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:11.170
Or shall I bend low and in a
bondman's key, with bated breath

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:14.910
and whispering humbleness
say this, "Fair sir,

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:18.040
you spit on me on Wednesday last.

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.090
You spurned me such a day.

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:22.300
Another time you called me dog.

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:31.000
And for these courtesies I'll
lend you thus much moneys?"

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:40.650
In the next speech, Shylock
is discussing the terms

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:45.060
of the forfeiture of his
loan should Antonio default.

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:49.750
And he reveals what he
values in a pound of flesh.

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:55.600
To bait fish withal.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:01.510
If it will feed nothing else
it will feed my revenge.

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:07.130
He hath disgraced me, and
hindered me half a million,

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:12.570
laughed at my losses, mocked
at my gains, scorned my nation,

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:20.250
thwarted my bargains, cooled my
friends, heated mine enemies.

00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:22.550
And what's his reason?

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:27.580
I am a Jew.

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:32.280
Hath not the Jew eyes?

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:37.210
Hath not the Jew hands
organs, dimensions,

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:40.200
senses, affections, passions?

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:45.830
Fed with the same food,
hurt with the same weapons,

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:51.120 position:56%
subject to the same diseases, healed
by the same means, warmed and cooled

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:54.630
by the same winter and
summer as a Christian is?

00:23:54.630 --> 00:24:00.270
If you prick us, do we not bleed?

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:04.650
If you tickle us, do we not laugh?

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:07.870
If you poison us, do we not die?

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:13.590
And if you wrong us,
shall we not revenge?

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:21.610
If we are like you in the rest,
we will resemble you in that.

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:28.950
If a Jew wrong a Christian,
what is his humility?

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:34.140 position:56%
Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew,

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:39.090
what should his sufferance
be by Christian example?

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:42.000
Why, revenge.

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:47.290
The villainy you teach
me, I will execute.

00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:50.380
And it shall go hard.

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:54.310
But I will better the instruction.

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:04.360
And lastly, Shylock argues
in court against using mercy

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.850
to temper justice, in the hopes

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:11.940
of receiving the same kindness
in God's final judgment.

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.760
What judgment shall I
dread, doing no wrong?

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:23.490
You have among you many a purchased
slave, which like your asses

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:26.820
and your dogs and mules,
you use in abject

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:31.740
and in slavish parts,
because you bought them.

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:35.450
Shall I say to you,
"Let them be free.

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:38.590
Marry them to your heirs.

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:40.710
Why sweat they under burdens?

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:43.710
Let their beds be made
as soft as yours.

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:46.860
And let their palates be
seasoned with such viands."

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:51.190
You will answer, "The
slaves are ours."

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:52.790
So do I answer you.

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:59.550
The pound of flesh, which I
demand of him, is dearly bought.

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:05.880
Tis mine. And I will have it.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:10.330
If you deny me, fie upon your law.

00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:14.160
There is no force in
the decrees of Venice.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.300
I stand for judgment.

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:24.000
Answer. Shall I have it?

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:41.150
[ Applause ]

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:47.420
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg: We will
now proceed with Shylock's appeal.

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:53.240
And before we do so,
let me caution Counsel

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:57.720
that the bench is having
great difficulty hearing,

00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:05.510 position:56%
so if you might tip the podium
slightly, and speak very distinctly.

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:12.000
We will hear first
from Shylock's Counsel.

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.340
&gt;&gt; Michael Klotz: Good
afternoon, your honors.

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:23.690
I'm Michael Klotz, Counsel
for the Appellant, Shylock.

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:26.810
Before I begin I'd like to
reserve two minutes for rebuttal.

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:28.390
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg: You may.

00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:34.480
&gt;&gt; Michael Klotz: There are two
central issues in this appeal.

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:38.810
The first issue is whether a party
that's entered into agreement,

00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:41.470
and hasn't fulfilled
its obligations,

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:44.590
is able to keep the
fruits of the agreement.

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:49.070
My client, Shylock, entered into
a loan agreement for 3,000 ducats.

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:52.570
And the ducats were
lent to Bassanio.

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:55.690
And Antonio was the
guarantor for that loan.

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:57.640
And it was for a term
of three months.

00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:58.940
And the loan came due.

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:01.290
And the money was not repaid.

00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:05.430
And to this day Antonio
continues to hold the money.

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:07.070
And no interest has been paid.

00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:10.590
And my client has been out of luck.

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:16.590
The second issue in this appeal
is whether a non-citizen who goes

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:22.140
to a court and requests a
legal judgment can in doing

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:24.210
so commit a criminal act.

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:28.750
And that's what my client
has been convicted of.

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:34.390 position:56%
Shylock went to the court, and
asked to have the contract enforced.

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:38.390
And he asked specifically to have
the penalty provision enforced.

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:43.470
And unbeknownst to him, Portia
was disguised as a judge.

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:46.310
And she's not a judge.

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:51.370
And she issued a judgment.

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:52.980
She issued a judgment against him.

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:57.400
And she found that he violated
the Alien Act, which protects

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:01.990
against any non-citizen attempting
to take the life of a citizen.

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:05.870
And, so, in making this
appeal to the court saying,

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:10.280 position:56%
"Please give me the money that's due
under this agreement," Portia said

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.560
that this was attempted murder.

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:17.640
And our argument on that
issue is that can't be.

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:20.370
It can't be the case that when
somebody goes to a court and asks

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:22.160
for justice that that's a crime.

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:28.230
So we ask that the judgment
be reversed without retrial.

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:30.260
We ask for the money to come back.

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:33.860
We're asking for interest,
and any other relief

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:35.460
that the court deems fit.

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:39.740
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg: I'd like
clarification on two points.

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:49.570
One, are you demanding
the pound of flesh,

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:53.620
or have you relinquished
that request?

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:59.670
&gt;&gt; Michael Klotz: Your Honor,
we're relinquishing that request,

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:04.050
but we believe that that aspect of
the contract was valid and legal.

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:07.700
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg: So you are
not demanding a pound of flesh.

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:11.690
You're demanding your
return of your money.

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:14.190
You said interest.

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:18.920
But I think the record shows

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:26.040
that at the time this loan was
negotiated you said not a doit

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.850
of usance for money.

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:32.670
You were giving the money and
you were not demanding interest.

00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:36.400
You were demanding only
the pound of flesh.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:43.090
Is it not true that you
relinquished any claim to interest?

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:44.390
&gt;&gt; Michael Klotz: Your Honor,

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:48.740
in that same negotiation
my client referenced

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:53.730
that when the loan came due that
he would be given such sum or sums

00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:55.640
as are due under the agreement.

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:58.850
So I think it would be up to the
court to examine the contract,

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:01.360
and determine whether
there's prejudgment interest.

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:04.730
The prejudgment interest is for
the three-month period of the loan.

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:06.140
And the post-judgment interest is

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:10.510
from when the loan
came due until today.

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:14.010
[ Laughter ]

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:15.310
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg:

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:19.570
There's another unusual
feature of this proceeding.

00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:22.910
Antonio is surety.

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:26.840
The beneficiary of
the loan is Bassanio.

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:29.310
But you are not suing Bassanio.

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:32.670
You brought a suit against Antonio.

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:36.700
&gt;&gt; Michael Klotz: That's
correct, Your Honor.

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:41.410
He was the guarantor on the
loan, and he was the recipient

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:44.250
with the Republic of
Venice of the money,

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:47.040
the underlying money
for this agreement.

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.630
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Even
though you knew full well

00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:55.060
that Bassanio had the
wherewithal to pay back the loan.

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:59.290
And then there would be
no claim against Shylock.

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:02.220
&gt;&gt; Michael Klotz: You're
correct, Your Honor.

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.520
We chose the Defendants to sue.

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:08.800
And we didn't sue Bassanio.

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:10.910
&gt;&gt; Richard Schneider: Counsel,
why is it that you're asking

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:13.990
for the money now when
you were offered the money

00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:17.000
at trial and refused it?

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:26.510
&gt;&gt; Michael Klotz: Well, our
position has changed, Your Honor.

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:31.050
[ Laughter ]

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:34.770
At trial we were requesting
specific performance.

00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:36.120
And it wasn't given to us.

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.950
And then we then asked
for the money.

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:41.690
And we were we were told
that that was impossible.

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:45.080
Portia interpreted the
contract in a way that,

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:50.520
as I believe the court will
realize, is totally improper.

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:54.160
She interpreted the agreement
to allow a pound of flesh,

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:57.810
but to allow no blood
and absolutely no more

00:32:57.810 --> 00:32:59.280
or less than a pound of flesh.

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:05.160 position:56%
So she interpreted the agreement in
a way that it couldn't be performed.

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.600
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Reynolds: Mr. Klotz,

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:13.780
what role do you think Portia's
deception plays in this proceeding?

00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:18.010
&gt;&gt; Michael Klotz: Portia's
deception is egregious.

00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:19.310
She's not an attorney.

00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:22.470
She was not a judge.

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:25.540
She was not a part of any court.

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:27.880
She obviously misrepresented
who she was.

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:33.230
And I think, perhaps most
significantly, she was married

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:36.070
to Bassanio, who Justice
Ginsburg has pointed

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:38.690
out was the obligor on the loan.

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:42.030
So she had a direct financial
interest in the outcome.

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:44.050
[ Laughter ]

00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:46.920
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Reynolds: And
what specific defense does

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:51.420
that give your client?

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:52.720
&gt;&gt; Michael Klotz: Well, I mean

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:55.860
if she was actually a judge she
should have recused herself.

00:33:55.860 --> 00:34:02.760
And because she was not a judge
the judgment is completely void

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:04.780
and invalid.

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:06.250
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg:
Should you need a defense.

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:08.100
You're the plaintiff in this suit.

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:09.990
&gt;&gt; Michael Klotz: Excuse me?

00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:12.480
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Shylock
was the plaintiff suing --

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.780
&gt;&gt; Michael Klotz: Correct.

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:15.080
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Antonio.

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:16.380
&gt;&gt; Michael Klotz: Correct.

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:18.160
&gt;&gt; Connie Morella: What
about the role of revenge?

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:22.830
We hear Shylock repeating
that in many different ways,

00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:28.360
so that he was revenge and
is connected to his intent.

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:31.350
So his intent was for
a very fatalistic,

00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:35.560
you know, ending for Antonio.

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:45.250 position:56%
How do you fit that into saying that
you are trying to defend Shylock?

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:46.880
&gt;&gt; Michael Klotz: Shylock
has been misunderstood.

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:51.000
And the point of revenge,
it's true that my client

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.860
and Antonio were not
the best of friends.

00:34:55.860 --> 00:35:00.790
But he had two other motives in
pursuing the penalty provision.

00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:04.920
And he made that very clear
during the proceeding.

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:09.150
And one of those points
that he was seeking is

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:12.520
to finally have the chance to
have some rights under the law.

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:15.140
So the Alien Act as
an example of a law

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:19.190
that punishes non-citizens
in a disparate manner.

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:22.250
As we've heard a little bit
already Jewish citizens were forced

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:23.680
to live in the Ghetto.

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.090
They had a curfew.

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:27.520
They could only take
certain occupations.

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:31.480
They actually had to pay to
have the Ghetto patrolled.

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:35.170
But, as the court is aware,
freedom of contract is one

00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:36.900
of these great things where,

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:40.450
whatever the generally applicable
law is, two people can sit down

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:44.310
and agree-- this is what you
will do, this is what I will do,

00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:46.790
and they make their
own law essentially.

00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:50.950
And, so, my client was
very angry and very upset,

00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:55.790
when in this one aspect of his
life that he could control,

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:58.510
his rights were not
being recognized.

00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:02.340
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg:
We heard that Shylock was

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:07.570
in a state of extreme distress.

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:15.800
Are you making any plea
that he would be incompetent

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:26.620 position:56%
to have been accused of a criminal
action, because he was so distraught

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:31.770
at his daughter's elopement, and
her theft of his worldly goods?

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:34.480
&gt;&gt; Michael Klotz: Your
Honor, we're not arguing

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.110
that Shylock was incompetent.

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:38.560
We're arguing that, first of all,

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:41.770
he didn't have an intent
to murder Antonio.

00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:45.900
His intent was to rebel, to
protest against this circumstance

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:47.660
that he found himself in.

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:51.200
And on the second point, that even
if the court were somehow to find

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:54.690
that he had an intent to
murder, there's no act.

00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:59.200
There's no act of actually
doing anything.

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:02.430
He can't be convicted for
murderous words any more

00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:05.620
than anyone else could
saying, "I want to do this."

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:09.550
I mean his situation, Your
Honor, would be comparable

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:14.460
to a murder trial where a parent
comes in, and says to the court,

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:16.450
"This man should be executed."

00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:18.710
And then that person
was arrested for murder.

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:21.540
I mean that would be a
relatively similar situation.

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:23.120
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg: I thought
you started out with the point

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:26.240 position:56%
that he couldn't be tried for murder

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:32.770
when all he did was bring a
civil suit to enforce a contract?

00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:36.510
&gt;&gt; Michael Klotz: Yes, Your Honor.

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:40.690
[ Laughter ]

00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:43.190
No, I think both things are true.

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:47.360
I think that it's totally
inappropriate, and it makes,

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:51.210
you know, it's totally
inappropriate that any request

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:54.280
of a court could be a criminal act.

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:57.610
And, so, for that reason I
don't think it's possible

00:37:57.610 --> 00:37:59.670
to convict him under the Alien Act.

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:02.640
I don't think there's any way
that this can be attempted murder.

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:06.440
And, separately, in a
not inconsistent point,

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:07.780
he didn't do anything.

00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:12.460
I mean during this scene he
had a knife, and he, you know,

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:15.260
he said some words
that he may regret.

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.790
[ Laughter ]

00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:22.360
But nothing else happened.

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:23.660
&gt;&gt; Richard Schneider:
But the question

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:25.730
of motive is important to us.

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:29.560
It's important in terms of
thinking of what Shylock did,

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:31.360
and how we should rule here.

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:34.770
I mean one motive is revenge.

00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:37.360
You know, which obviously would
be caught up with the murder.

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:39.280
But you make an argument
in your brief,

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:44.120 position:56%
and that you just mentioned a
minute ago, that Shylock was in fact

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:48.430
in a sense rebelling
through this contract.

00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:50.600
I'm not sure I really
understand what you mean by that.

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:53.100
Maybe could you elaborate a
little bit on that for us?

00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:54.990
What do you mean?

00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:59.350
What was Shylock doing
here if it wasn't revenge?

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:00.650
&gt;&gt; Michael Klotz: Yes, Your Honor.

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:04.740 position:56%
So I mean the attempt to enforce the
penalty provision was a rebellion

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:09.670
against the Venetian laws that
treated him so differently.

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:14.450
And then this is the one area
where he was able to do something.

00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:18.000
You know, he was able to sort
of set the terms of his life.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.670
And the other part of it is during
the proceeding what Shylock points

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:25.170
out about Antonio and the
other Venetian merchants is the

00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:27.230
incredible hypocrisy.

00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:32.010
You know, Venetian capitalism, you
know, there's trade in many things,

00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:36.040
but one of the main aspects
of trade was slavery.

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:43.320
And, so, it seems very hypocritical
and improper that merchants

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:44.830
like Antonio should be able

00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:48.670
to grow wealthy selling
people against their will.

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:50.630
And my client should not be able

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:56.310
to recover the penalty provision
even though there's a, you know,

00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:58.510
there's a physical component to it.

&gt;&gt; Connie Morella: You know,
I'm trying to understand

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:07.440
that there was a contract.

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:13.490
They actually made a legal contract
even though Shylock said something

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:15.910
about it being a merry
joke or something,

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:21.000 position:56%
which meant that they fully expected
the money would be returned on time.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.880
But then he perseveres
for the pound of flesh.

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:29.330
But then when he finds out
about the blood, you know,

00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:31.750
and he says he wants it by a heart.

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:34.670
Did he think it could be
done in some other way

00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:38.980
so that Antonio would not die?

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:44.670
I mean what did you find
out in your investigation

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:50.040
of this case what he had in mind?

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:52.060
&gt;&gt; Michael Klotz: Shylock
didn't intend to murder,

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:54.280
and did not intend
to murder Antonio.

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:55.580
It was a pound of flesh.

00:40:55.580 --> 00:41:01.410
It was not a dagger in the
heart or anything like that.

00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:03.660

wanted it near the heart.

00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:04.960

wanted it near the heart.

than I do if he'd been granted that,

if Portia had granted him
that right, and she'd enforce

that right of specific performance.

He might have dropped the knife,
and asked for the money instead.

for the law did not permit.

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:33.050
&gt;&gt; Michael Klotz: Well,
what I think, Your Honor,

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:37.540
is I mean the proceeding
obviously was totally improper

00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:39.660
with Portia acting as the judge.

00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:42.290
But the other main point that
we haven't discussed yet,

00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:45.600
but is discussed in the brief,
is the incredible duress

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:48.370 position:56%
for my client during the proceeding.

00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:51.440
First Portia says, you know,
"You can get the pound of flesh.

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:52.740
You don't get blood.

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:55.280
You don't get any more
or less than that."

00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:59.610
Shylock then asked for the
money, and was told no.

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:04.170
Portia then said that he
violated the Alien Act supposedly

00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:06.450
for making this request
of the court.

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:11.730
And then Shylock was forced
to convert to Christianity.

00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:14.210
And the Duke said very
clearly if he didn't do

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:17.130
that then he was going
to be executed.

00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:20.140
So to the extent that
there's a waiver argument,

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:23.010
I think that maybe we
can let that slide.

a comment about the Alien Act.

the Alien Act in itself,

and maybe you could explain exactly
what that is, but the Alien Act,

00:44:05.830 --> 00:44:09.480
are you arguing that that
is somehow illegitimate,

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:14.530
or are you just simply saying it
was wrongly applied to Shylock?

00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:19.510

Act is totally illegitimate.

00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:23.170

completely disparate treatment

00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:27.180

citizens in a way

00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:30.900
that non-citizens would
not be protected.

If somebody were to have made
an attempt to murder my client,

have been a violation.

And nothing would have
happened whatsoever.

our case, you know, the Duke saying

00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:48.500
to Shylock, "If you don't
convert to Christianity I'm going

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:52.230
to execute you," you know,
that seems very similar.

you consider that the only chance

that Shylock had for salvation,
so far from being a penalty,

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:10.850

to Shylock to be converted

doesn't have his rights

under the contract what
rights does he have?

totally unfair and disparate way.

audacity of Antonio to act

as though this penalty
provision that he'd agreed upon,

and they'd negotiated, and they'd,

was somehow an outrage.

beyond the pale in trying

to enforce the terms
that they had agreed on.

by rejecting the transparently
false narrative

00:48:03.970 --> 00:48:06.140 position:56%
that we've been presented with here.

00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:13.490
The notion that Shylock was
engaged simply in a noble

00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:18.160
and honorable protest of what he
thought to be the deficiencies

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:23.870
and unfairness of Venetian
law, that is simply not true.

00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:27.290
Never until this appeal
have we heard that argument.

00:48:27.290 --> 00:48:31.700
And indeed if we look at the
record of the case, again and again

00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:38.720
and again it shows that Shylock
entered into a premeditated

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:44.040
and deceitful course of action
in order to lure Antonio

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:49.640
into sealing a bond that would be
the means of his own destruction.

00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:52.920
And there are four critical
elements in this scheme.

00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:56.090
They're undisputed in
the record of the case.

00:48:56.090 --> 00:49:01.230
First, throughout Shylock
admitted to his motives.

00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:05.560
Even before he negotiated the
penalty bond, he was overheard

00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:11.970
to say quote, speaking of Antonio,
I hate him for he is a Christian.

00:49:11.970 --> 00:49:14.890
If I can catch him once on the hip,

00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:19.670
I will feed fat the
ancient grudge I bear him.

00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:26.580
In fact we heard Shylock himself a
few minutes ago say that the pound

00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:30.590
of flesh would be used
to bait fish withal.

00:49:30.590 --> 00:49:37.210
And that further he would use that
pound of flesh to feed his revenge.

00:49:37.210 --> 00:49:41.970
Other evidence of the
motive of revenge

00:49:41.970 --> 00:49:45.620
and hatred abounds throughout
the record of this case.

00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:49.510
But if there were any doubt
it would have been satisfied

when at his trial, in response
to questions by the Duke,

00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:58.020
he explained that his motive
was a, quote, lodged hate

00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:02.040
and a certain loathing,
end quote, for Antonio.

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:05.160
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Counsel,
before we get into your discussion

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:09.620
of the merits of a criminal
prosecution, I think you conceded

00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:16.830
at the outset that that turn of
the proceedings from a civil suit

00:50:16.830 --> 00:50:18.600
to enforce a contract

00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:25.160
into a criminal case was
highly inappropriate.

00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:27.630
Did you not make that
concession in your brief?

00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:29.240
&gt;&gt; Eugene Gulland: Well, I
think we have two responses

00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:30.540
to that, Your Honor.

00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:36.260
The first is that Antonio
was permitted to use

00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:40.080
as a counterclaim [inaudible]
a defense any law

00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:41.380
that would be available--

00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:42.680
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg:
Can you bring--

00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:43.980
&gt;&gt; Eugene Gulland: To him.

00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:45.280
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg:

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:46.580
Can you bring in a civil
case a criminal prosecution

00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:47.880
as a counterclaim?

00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:49.240 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Eugene Gulland: Yeah, absolutely.

00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:51.010
Under the--

00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:52.400
[ Laughter ]

00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:54.990
Under the law of Venice
at that time this kind

00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:57.010
of pleading was recognized.

00:50:57.010 --> 00:51:01.120 position:56%
But, as we argued in our brief, Your
Honor, we have an additional point.

00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:05.940
And that is we do agree
on one point with Shylock.

00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:10.060
And that is that the
procedures were flawed by reason

00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:13.480
of Portia's misrepresentations
in masquerade.

00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:19.720 position:56%
And for that reason we've asked this
court to consider the case de novo.

00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:21.020
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Well,

00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:26.870
we have as Judge [inaudible]
reminded us, that this is a court

00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:30.700
of review, not of first view.

00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:37.170
De novo, we would be looking at the
case as a court of first instance.

00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:41.380
But we are an appellate forum.

00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:45.530
So we have no authority
to hear witnesses.

00:51:45.530 --> 00:51:49.800
We judge the case according
to the law.

00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:55.580
So I don't understand how you
could ask this court to serve

00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:59.810
as a first instance, de novo court.

00:51:59.810 --> 00:52:02.620
&gt;&gt; Eugene Gulland: Well, even
if this court should decline

00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:08.190
to consider the case
entirely anew, the opportunity

00:52:08.190 --> 00:52:11.980
through representation by very
able counsel, and the opportunity

00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:17.520 position:56%
to make all of his arguments ensures
that Shylock now has the right

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:22.310
to argue against the application
of the alien law to him.

00:52:22.310 --> 00:52:28.560
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg: And
with the proceeding is improper,

00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:34.730
then I suppose an appellate
court should just dismiss it.

00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:40.760
And if it dismisses the
case and then where are we?

00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:45.110
&gt;&gt; Eugene Gulland: Well, if this
court simply dismissed the case,

00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:48.230
then I think it would put
Antonio and the Duke of Venice

00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:53.590 position:56%
in the position that they would want
to be in, because it would deny any

00:52:53.590 --> 00:52:55.720
and all relief to Shylock.

00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:59.370
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg: But you
are not urging us to do that,

00:52:59.370 --> 00:53:02.470
because you recognize that
he did not get a fair trial.

00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:03.770
Is that it?

00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:05.080
&gt;&gt; Eugene Gulland: We regret

00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:07.710
that the procedures were
not fair procedures.

00:53:07.710 --> 00:53:09.010
Yes.

00:53:09.010 --> 00:53:10.310
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg:
Let me go to what seems

00:53:10.310 --> 00:53:15.070
to be your principle
argument that this was an act

00:53:15.070 --> 00:53:20.500
of vengeance on Shylock's part.

00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:24.460
But Shylock, when the
transaction took place,

00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:30.630
called it a merry sport,
a merry bond.

00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:37.790 position:56%
And a really puzzling aspect of your
position that it's all vengeance,

00:53:37.790 --> 00:53:44.510
at the time this bargain was made
Shylock had every reason to think

00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:47.700
that Antonio, rich
merchant Defendant,

00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:50.130
would be able to repay him.

00:53:50.130 --> 00:53:55.840
He had no idea of the
supposed tragedy at sea.

00:53:55.840 --> 00:54:01.070
He expected, as Antonio
did, that Antonio would be,

00:54:01.070 --> 00:54:06.860
his wealth would be increased
well within the time of the loan.

00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:09.970
&gt;&gt; Eugene Gulland: I
think the record shows

00:54:09.970 --> 00:54:16.180 position:56%
that from the very beginning Shylock
was scheming to trap Antonio.

00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:17.670
He deceived Antonio.

00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:22.720
He said to Antonio, at the time
that they were discussing the bond,

00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:30.750
that he was offering the loan for
reconciliation and friendship.

00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:34.800
He said, quote, I would
be friends with you

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:37.820
and have your love, to Antonio.

00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:40.990
As you point out, he
jovially referred

00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:44.000
to the penalty bond
as a merry sport.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:48.740
And he quickly added
that it was worthless.

00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:52.330
Nobody could expect him to ever
claim the bond, because a pound

00:54:52.330 --> 00:54:58.270 position:56%
of a man's flesh taken from a man
is not estimable, profitable neither

00:54:58.270 --> 00:55:02.360
as flesh from muttons,
beefs and goats.

00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:07.950
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg: But
what basis did Shylock have

00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:13.820
to even suspect that this
question would arise,

00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:18.400
to suspect that Antonio would
not be able to repay him?

00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:21.340
Antonio is a rich merchant.

00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:26.390
There was no premonition
of storms at sea.

00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:33.080
Why would you attribute to
Shylock such a motive of vengeance

00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:36.570
when Shylock had every
reason in the world to expect

00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:40.720
that within the three-months'
time he would be repaid?

00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:43.070
&gt;&gt; Eugene Gulland:
He was laying a trap.

00:55:43.070 --> 00:55:46.920
He understood that he
would probably be repaid.

00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:49.810
But he also understood
that if he were not,

00:55:49.810 --> 00:55:54.350
this would be his opportunity
finally to have the revenge

00:55:54.350 --> 00:55:55.780
that he sought so dearly.

00:55:55.780 --> 00:56:00.090
And there's a little noticed fact

00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:03.060
that is very interesting
in this case.

00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:07.270
And that is when he first
heard about the opportunity

00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:14.070
to have a penalty bond from
Antonio, he didn't have the money.

00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:15.870
Shylock didn't have the money.

00:56:15.870 --> 00:56:17.470
And, so, what did he do?

00:56:17.470 --> 00:56:24.210
He went to his moneylender friend,
Tubal, and borrowed the money

00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:27.660
to lend in order to
get the penalty bond.

00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:32.500
In other words, he was willing
to pay interest to Tubal,

00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:35.810
and make a loan free of charge.

00:56:35.810 --> 00:56:37.110
Free of charge.

00:56:37.110 --> 00:56:41.700
And that was to set up the trap.

00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:46.490
And it shows that throughout, from
the very beginning to the very end,

00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:49.030
that even though he recognized

00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:52.010
that he would probably be
repaid, the trap could be set.

00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:56.820
And he would have his
revenge if he was not repaid.

00:56:56.820 --> 00:56:58.120
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg:
One other thing

00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:01.810
that Shylock was very clear
about, he said it a few times,

00:57:01.810 --> 00:57:04.360
he said, "I crave the law."

00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:07.760
But no one told him
what the law was.

00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:10.530 position:56%
Nobody told him about the Alien Act.

00:57:10.530 --> 00:57:16.990
So it's an obvious case of
no notice or opportunity

00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:20.480
to rethink the case
in light of the law.

00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:22.980
But Shylock craved the law.

00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:28.470 position:56%
Once he's told what the law is, then
the pound of flesh is off the table.

00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:30.820
&gt;&gt; Eugene Gulland: The pound

00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:37.550
of flesh is not a valid
penalty bond under Venetian law.

00:57:37.550 --> 00:57:44.210
Venetian law, it's true,
enforced commercial terms.

00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:48.200
The penalty bond here is
not a commercial term.

00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:51.300
In fact Shylock himself
admitted many times

00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:54.420
that it was not a commercial
term when he said

00:57:54.420 --> 00:58:02.600
that he would gladly give up
repayment of 20 times the loan

00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:05.550
in order to enforce
the penalty bond.

00:58:05.550 --> 00:58:08.130
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg:
But what about the state

00:58:08.130 --> 00:58:12.090
of mind of your client, Antonio?

00:58:12.090 --> 00:58:15.460 position:56%
Why did he agree to this so swiftly?

00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:16.940
&gt;&gt; Richard Schneider: And
just to follow up on that,

00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:18.270
I have a problem with that as well.

00:58:18.270 --> 00:58:20.590
I mean it's not hard for me

00:58:20.590 --> 00:58:23.980
to understand why Shylock
would want this bond,

00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:27.470
whether we think it was revenge or
whether we think it was, you know,

00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:30.400
political expression of some sort.

00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:34.480
But why would Antonio agree
to be bound by this bond?

00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:39.160
Why would he agree to give up
a pound of his own flesh just

00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:41.710
to get money for Bassanio?

00:58:41.710 --> 00:58:44.880
And what I'm thinking here
is really is it possible

00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:48.970
that Antonio was the one
laying the trap for Shylock,

00:58:48.970 --> 00:58:54.720
because Antonio knew that Shylock
would be hit with the Alien Act?

00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:56.400
&gt;&gt; Eugene Gulland: Well,
there's no evidence

00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:57.860
in the record to suggest
[inaudible]--

00:58:57.860 --> 00:58:59.160
&gt;&gt; Richard Schneider:
Well, there may not be--

00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:01.070
[ Laughter ]

00:59:01.070 --> 00:59:03.000
There may not be reference
to the record to that.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.780
But I'm just speculating.

00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:06.080
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Well, may--

00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:07.380
&gt;&gt; Eugene Gulland: The fact--

00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:08.680
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg:
May I interject

00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:13.780
that there are multiple
clues in the record.

00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:19.890
When we first meet
Antonio he said, "In sooth,

00:59:19.890 --> 00:59:23.820
I know not why I am so sad."

00:59:23.820 --> 00:59:30.010
He later says, "I am tainted wether
of the flock, meetest for death."

00:59:30.010 --> 00:59:32.560
Meetest for death.

00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:38.510
So this is a very sad man
who is longing for death.

00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:45.140
[ Laughter ]

00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:48.510
&gt;&gt; Eugene Gulland: I think he
snapped out of that depression.

00:59:48.510 --> 00:59:52.280
[ Laughter ]

00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:56.330
To answer the question,
Antonio was fooled.

00:59:56.330 --> 01:00:01.050
He was taken in by the
reconciliation and friendship

01:00:01.050 --> 01:00:03.880
that he thought were
being offered by Shylock.

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:10.010
And in fact Antonio, just as he was
going and sealing the bond, said,

01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:16.350
quote, there is much kindness
in the Jew, end quote.

01:00:16.350 --> 01:00:19.660
And I have to say,
although he's my client,

01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:25.310
that Antonio was easy
prey in another sense.

01:00:25.310 --> 01:00:32.930
He was a profoundly, extravagantly
proud man with an extravagant

01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:35.510
and exaggerated sense of honor.

01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:39.640
And Shylock, cunning as he was,

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:43.440
preyed on this character
defect of Antonio.

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:45.950
And he did so in the following way.

01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:51.150
He recognized that if it ever came
time to enforce the penalty bond,

01:00:51.150 --> 01:00:56.190
that Antonio would be too
proud to dishonor it, that,

01:00:56.190 --> 01:00:58.350
in other words, he would admit it.

01:00:58.350 --> 01:00:59.730
And that's exactly what happened.

01:00:59.730 --> 01:01:02.420
Antonio didn't hire a lawyer.

01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:05.090
Antonio offered no defense.

01:01:05.090 --> 01:01:10.430
Antonio confessed the bond, and
offered himself up to be killed.

01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:13.540
And that's exactly what
Shylock's scheme was.

01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:15.950
He knew that Antonio
would not resist,

01:01:15.950 --> 01:01:20.250
and that there would be no
genuine court proceeding standing

01:01:20.250 --> 01:01:26.150
between himself and his
opportunity to kill Antonio.

01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:29.990
And that's why the argument
that there was an intercession

01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:35.850
of a court proceeding as a defense
doesn't work, because Shylock,

01:01:35.850 --> 01:01:39.500
taking advantage of
this character flaw,

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:43.330
knew that there would be no
meaningful judicial protection

01:01:43.330 --> 01:01:44.630
of Antonio.

01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:46.010
&gt;&gt; Connie Morella: Speaking
of being taken advantage of,

01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:51.030 position:56%
don't you think Shylock was in a way
in that he never got due process?

01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:57.960
He never had anybody to advise him
of what the consequences would be,

01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:01.820
or what the journey through
the law would mean for him.

01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:05.610
Is it not amazing to you that
you take a civil case and it ends

01:02:05.610 --> 01:02:07.740
up being a criminal case?

01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:12.330
And, so, should he not have been
given due process along the way?

01:02:12.330 --> 01:02:16.340
&gt;&gt; Eugene Gulland: Well,
let's take it in steps.

01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:21.110
In the negotiation
of the penalty bond,

01:02:21.110 --> 01:02:27.200
I think that Shylock is a
very experienced moneylender,

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:35.170
was very knowledgeable
about the applicable law.

01:02:35.170 --> 01:02:44.020
And it shows that regardless
of the criticisms,

01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:49.310
we have the Venetian law, court
proceedings were open to Jews

01:02:49.310 --> 01:02:53.780
in Venice, and the protection of
the laws were applicable to them.

01:02:53.780 --> 01:03:01.880
You are right that when his
case got to court, the charade,

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:06.270
Portia's masquerade, did
deny him due process.

01:03:06.270 --> 01:03:08.860
And we entirely agree with that.

01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:11.410
We think, however, though
on the basis of the record

01:03:11.410 --> 01:03:17.510
and the devastating admissions
repeatedly made by Shylock,

01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:22.670
that he properly stands
convicted of the offense

01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:24.350
of which he was found guilty.

01:03:24.350 --> 01:03:29.470 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg: But how does
the Alien Act come into the picture?

01:03:29.470 --> 01:03:34.590
You just said that Antonio
wasn't putting up any defense.

01:03:34.590 --> 01:03:38.380
He certainly didn't
raise the Alien Act.

01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:44.820
It was this sham lawyer/judge,
Portia, who brought that.

01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:50.480
&gt;&gt; Eugene Gulland: Well, our brief
points out that the intervention

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:54.780
of Portia indeed saved
the life of Antonio.

01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:57.420
It also saved the life of Shylock.

01:03:57.420 --> 01:04:02.880
And it saved Shylock because
Shylock was ready, willing

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:06.550
and able to kill Antonio.

01:04:06.550 --> 01:04:12.610
The notion that Antonio
would have been spared

01:04:12.610 --> 01:04:15.790
by Shylock is absolutely crazy.

01:04:15.790 --> 01:04:22.090
The record shows Shylock was
earnestly sharpening his knife

01:04:22.090 --> 01:04:27.840
in the court, that Shylock
had a balance scale in order

01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:31.460
to measure the pound of flesh.

01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:33.680
He was ready to do it.

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:37.450
And it was only Portia
that saved Antonio,

01:04:37.450 --> 01:04:40.100 position:56%
and also saved Shylock from himself.

01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:43.040
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Reynolds: Counselor,
I'd like to ask a question here.

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:47.510
I think we'd all agree that the
record is beautifully written.

01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:50.040
[ Laughter ]

01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:54.510
But that it's rather thin, at
least of the court proceeding.

01:04:54.510 --> 01:04:58.260
And I believe that you are
asking us to draw a lot

01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:00.880
of inferences from the record.

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:05.040
What about this inference
that Shylock never believed

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:09.890
that the court would allow him
to exact his pound of flesh?

01:05:09.890 --> 01:05:13.370
He does seem surprised
in the court proceeding

01:05:13.370 --> 01:05:15.750
when Portia says, "You're right.

01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:19.100
You may enforce the penalty bond."

01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:23.210
And he praises her, and
sounds very surprised.

01:05:23.210 --> 01:05:28.140 position:56%
Why isn't it, as reasonable
inference as you would have us draw,

01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:32.700
that he was willing to put
the knife to Antonio's heart?

01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:37.530
Why isn't it equally a valid
inference that he never thought

01:05:37.530 --> 01:05:41.890
that the court would allow
him to exact this measure?

01:05:41.890 --> 01:05:46.270 position:56%
Enforced the penalty bond literally?

01:05:46.270 --> 01:05:48.270
&gt;&gt; Eugene Gulland:
Well, with all respect,

01:05:48.270 --> 01:05:51.830
we don't think there's
any question of inference,

01:05:51.830 --> 01:05:54.420
because we have the man's words.

01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:59.240
Again and again and
again, those words, events,

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:06.440
nothing other than an intent to
execute Antonio, to have revenge,

01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:11.210
and to realize the
longstanding object of his hatred,

01:06:11.210 --> 01:06:13.800
that is the killing of Antonio.

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:15.520
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Reynolds: But
that's another inference.

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:18.970
I mean as Justice Ginsburg
pointed out, he did say,

01:06:18.970 --> 01:06:23.020
Shylock said on several
occasions, "This is a merry bond.

01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:26.390
This is nothing to
be worried about."

01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:32.100
And he does appear surprised
when Portia says, "You're right.

01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:38.950
You win." Why is it not a
proper inference for us to draw

01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:42.210
that he might have, since you
want us to draw some inferences

01:06:42.210 --> 01:06:45.290
from the record, why
isn't it appropriate

01:06:45.290 --> 01:06:47.310
to draw that inference as well?

01:06:47.310 --> 01:06:51.440
&gt;&gt; Eugene Gulland: As I read
the record, beautifully written

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:59.070
as it is, I'd characterize
Shylock's reaction not

01:06:59.070 --> 01:07:04.510
as surprised, but as
exultant delight.

01:07:04.510 --> 01:07:07.040
[ Laughter ]

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:09.210
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Counselor,
your time is about to run out,

01:07:09.210 --> 01:07:11.260
so if you would like to--

01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:12.670
&gt;&gt; Eugene Gulland: Thank you.

01:07:12.670 --> 01:07:18.010
We, for the reasons argued in
our brief and the arguments

01:07:18.010 --> 01:07:22.060
that I would have made if I not
had so many good questions,--

01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:24.110
[ Laughter ]

01:07:24.110 --> 01:07:30.810
We believe that the
judgment below was correct,

01:07:30.810 --> 01:07:32.580
and that this court should arrive

01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:36.240
at the same judgment
on its own initiative.

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:37.540
Thank you.

01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:38.840
&gt;&gt; Richard Schneider:
Including conversion.

01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:40.270
&gt;&gt; Eugene Gulland: Absolutely
including conversion.

01:07:40.270 --> 01:07:45.010
That's to save the
eternal soul of Shylock.

01:07:45.010 --> 01:07:47.510
[ Laughter ]

01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:55.040
[ Applause ]

01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:59.390
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg: We will
now hear from Portia's Counsel.

01:08:00.890 --> 01:08:02.190
&gt;&gt; Teresa Miguel-Stearns:
Justice Ginsburg,

01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:06.220
and may it please the court,
I am Teresa Miguel-Stearns,

01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:08.440
Counsel for Appellee, Portia.

01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:16.300
Some 400 years ago Portia provided
legal advice to the Duke of Venice

01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:18.680
in a commercial contract dispute

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:24.070
between Appellant Shylock
and Co-Appellee Antonio.

01:08:24.070 --> 01:08:28.620
This commercial contract
dispute almost turned deadly.

01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:36.480 position:56%
Portia's skillful navigation of
Venetian law saved both men's lives.

01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:42.410
As a direct result in her role
in this Shylock/Antonio dispute,

01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:47.830
Portia has suffered unjustified
targeted attacks to her reputation

01:08:47.830 --> 01:08:51.510
over the course of
the last 400 years.

01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:54.040
[ Laughter ]

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:58.750
Today, Portia asks that she
be discharged from this case,

01:08:58.750 --> 01:09:02.270
and from any future
related proceedings.

01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:04.530
[ Laughter ]

01:09:04.530 --> 01:09:07.500
Your Honor, we have five
points to our brief.

01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:11.610
However, the heart of our
argument is first and foremost

01:09:11.610 --> 01:09:16.510
that Portia is the wrong
Defendant Appellee in this case.

01:09:16.510 --> 01:09:21.440
And, secondarily, that Portia's
alleged misrepresentations

01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:26.790
to the court, and alleged interest
in the outcome of this matter,

01:09:26.790 --> 01:09:31.090
are without merit, or
at most harmless error.

01:09:31.090 --> 01:09:33.170
[ Laughter ]

01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:35.820
And I will turn to
those matters now.

01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:40.870
First, Portia is the wrong
Defendant Appellee in this case.

01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:44.200
Counsel for Shylock is
well aware that the Duke

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:48.110
of Venice ruled the city
in the 16th century.

01:09:48.110 --> 01:09:53.380
Portia's role was merely to provide
legal advice to the Duke of Venice,

01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:56.410
who was the ultimate
arbiter in this case.

01:09:56.410 --> 01:10:01.250
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg: But Portia,
although she was not a lawyer,

01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:05.910
we can recognize that she
knew something about the law.

01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:11.410 position:56%
And surely she would have known that
for her, for Portia, to give counsel

01:10:11.410 --> 01:10:18.240
to the Duke, and to Shylock
to stand there unrepresented,

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:19.540
which he was willing to do

01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:26.730
when he was a Civil Plaintiff
being prosecuted, and no counsel,

01:10:26.730 --> 01:10:30.930
apart from your conflict
of interest being married

01:10:30.930 --> 01:10:39.360
to the principle debtor,
isn't that just overwhelming?

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.250
&gt;&gt; Teresa Miguel-Stearns: Your
Honor raises three points.

01:10:41.250 --> 01:10:45.180
And I would like to
address them all.

01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:49.280
First, that Portia was
not learned in the law.

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:54.100
The record demonstrates that Portia
was indeed learned in the law.

01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:56.650
And in 16th century Venice,

01:10:56.650 --> 01:11:00.560
one did not need a university
diploma, or any time--

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:01.860
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg:
[inaudible] conceding

01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:03.160
that she was learned in the law.

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:06.540
Maybe I misspoke or
you misunderstood.

01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:08.090
Portia is learned in the law.

01:11:08.090 --> 01:11:11.510
She had to be to be
such a trickster.

01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:15.340
[ Laughter ]

01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:20.730
But she is displaying her
learning for the benefit

01:11:20.730 --> 01:11:23.710
of Republic of Venice and Antonio.

01:11:23.710 --> 01:11:29.220
And Shylock is standing there
with no one to represent him.

01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:33.130
He is the target of a
criminal prosecution.

01:11:33.130 --> 01:11:37.540
Doesn't he have a right to Counsel?

01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:39.340
&gt;&gt; Teresa Miguel-Stearns: Your
Honor, on the issue of notice,

01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:43.180
it was Shylock who dragged
everyone into court.

01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:47.940
Bassanio, the Duke of Venice and
others tried to convince Shylock

01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:50.350
to settle this case amicably

01:11:50.350 --> 01:11:53.340
and financially prior
to coming to court.

01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:55.520
But Shylock craved his bond.

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:58.020
Shylock wanted his pound of flesh.

01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:02.690
So he brought everyone into
court on a civil proceeding.

01:12:02.690 --> 01:12:06.640
This case never turned
in to a prosecution.

01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:09.310
Portia was never a Prosecutor.

01:12:09.310 --> 01:12:13.190
And the Alien Act remained
a civil forfeiture case.

01:12:13.190 --> 01:12:20.110
As soon as Portia explained to the
Duke of Venice what was involved

01:12:20.110 --> 01:12:25.480
in the Alien Statute, before
Shylock had to utter a word,

01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:30.310
the Duke of Venice immediately
said, "No, we are not going

01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:33.450
to consider this capital
punishment case.

01:12:33.450 --> 01:12:36.250
We will keep it as a
civil forfeiture case."

01:12:36.250 --> 01:12:39.370
And Shylock's estate was
the only thing in jeopardy.

01:12:39.370 --> 01:12:42.330 position:56%
Shylock's life or freedom were never

01:12:42.330 --> 01:12:45.430
in jeopardy throughout the
course of these proceedings.

01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:49.390
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg:
But Shylock never knew

01:12:49.390 --> 01:12:52.320
that the law put him
in that position.

01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:57.050
He said repeatedly,
"I crave the law."

01:12:57.050 --> 01:13:00.990
Had he been counseled, he would
have known what the law was

01:13:00.990 --> 01:13:03.120
and escaped the forfeiture.

01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:04.420
&gt;&gt; Teresa Miguel-Stearns:
Respectfully, Your Honor,

01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:07.050
ignorance of the law is no defense.

01:13:07.050 --> 01:13:09.090
[ Laughter ]

01:13:09.090 --> 01:13:10.390
And in this matter--

01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:11.930
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg:
But having no Counsel

01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:14.360
to tell him what the law was.

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:15.660
&gt;&gt; Teresa Miguel-Stearns:
Your Honor, respectfully,

01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:24.810
many people tried to convince
Shylock to settle this case prior

01:13:24.810 --> 01:13:30.180
to it becoming the civil forfeiture
case required by the Alien Act.

01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:37.810
In fact when Portia first
encountered Shylock,

01:13:37.810 --> 01:13:40.930
when she entered the courtroom,
she said, "Who is the Jew

01:13:40.930 --> 01:13:42.360
and who is the merchant?"

01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:46.830
She placed both people, both
participants in this trial,

01:13:46.830 --> 01:13:49.690
at the same level in
the eyes of the law.

01:13:49.690 --> 01:13:50.990
She treated--

01:13:50.990 --> 01:13:52.290
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg:
Who was the Jew,

01:13:52.290 --> 01:13:55.620
not who is the lender
and who is the borrower.

01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:56.920
&gt;&gt; Teresa Miguel-Stearns: Right.

01:13:56.920 --> 01:13:58.220
That's correct, Your Honor.

01:13:58.220 --> 01:13:59.520
This is--

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:00.820
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg: And that--

01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:02.120
&gt;&gt; Teresa Miguel-Stearns: This
is what the transcript shows.

01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:03.670
[ Laughter and Applause ]

01:14:03.670 --> 01:14:10.420
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg: We have
another clue to Portia's character.

01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:15.660
So she calls Shylock a Jew.

01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:20.720
Back in Belmont when
Morocco appears, she said,

01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:24.880
"We don't need people of
that dark complexion."

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:30.280
So we know that this is a woman
who entertains certain biases.

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:35.460
&gt;&gt; Teresa Miguel-Stearns:
Your Honor,

01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:39.990
Portia had a very distinct
idea in Belmont

01:14:39.990 --> 01:14:42.990
that she wanted to marry Bassanio.

01:14:42.990 --> 01:14:45.680
They had laid eyes on
each other in the past.

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:50.100
And she was hoping that
Bassanio would be the suitor

01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:55.620
who would correctly guess
the box, the casket,

01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:57.300
that her father laid out.

01:14:57.300 --> 01:15:00.250 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Richard Schneider: Was Portia
free to marry anybody she wanted to?

01:15:00.250 --> 01:15:03.060
&gt;&gt; Teresa Miguel-Stearns:
No, she was not, Your Honor.

01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:06.760
Portia was a wealthy orphan
whose life was dictated

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:08.460
by her late father.

01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:13.390
Her late father had
provided for her education,

01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:19.690 position:56%
but had also provided the method for
dictating who her husband would be.

01:15:19.690 --> 01:15:20.990
And--

01:15:20.990 --> 01:15:26.770
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg: That
may have been very patriarchal.

01:15:26.770 --> 01:15:33.600
But she spoke about
Morocco's burnished skin.

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:40.370
Her love for Bassanio
surely did not require her

01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:45.430 position:56%
to so disparage people from Morocco.

01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:50.510
&gt;&gt; Teresa Miguel-Stearns:
That's correct, Your Honor.

01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:53.040
[ Laughter ]

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:54.340
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg:
So we recognize

01:15:54.340 --> 01:15:57.480
that she has certain
biases based on race

01:15:58.510 --> 01:16:01.890
against Morocco, against Shylock.

01:16:03.010 --> 01:16:04.470
&gt;&gt; Connie Morella: I
would pick up on that.

01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:08.050
I see that clearly as
a conflict of interest.

[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:11.650

The unclean hand, because
of, you know, Bassanio,

from the situation.

&gt;&gt; Teresa Miguel-Stearns: Yes.

01:16:21.290 --> 01:16:23.950
Regarding the conflict of
interest, Portia is alleged

01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:26.930
to have had both a financial
and a personal conflict of--

01:16:26.930 --> 01:16:28.230
&gt;&gt; Connie Morella: Right.

01:16:28.230 --> 01:16:29.530
&gt;&gt; Teresa Miguel-Stearns:
Interest in this case.

01:16:29.530 --> 01:16:30.830
I will address both.

01:16:30.830 --> 01:16:32.490
First, the financial
conflict of interest.

01:16:32.490 --> 01:16:36.180
From the very beginning
Portia offered her own ducats

01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:39.180
to settle this case with Shylock.

01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:43.710
Even before she and Bassanio were
married, she offered her ducats

01:16:43.710 --> 01:16:47.660
to Bassanio to help
settle this case amicably.

01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:53.180
When Portia first walked into
court, she pleaded with Shylock

01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:56.390
to settle the case financially.

01:16:56.390 --> 01:17:00.680
Two times the amount, three times
the amount, ten times the amount

01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:03.170
of ducats, of her ducats,

01:17:03.170 --> 01:17:06.280
were offered to Shylock
to settle this case.

01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:07.910
He refused.

01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:11.860
She brought in the Quality of
Mercy speech where she says,

01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:15.680
"The quality of mercy," excuse me,

01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:19.330
"The quality of mercy
is not strained.

01:17:19.330 --> 01:17:23.710
It droppeth as the gentle rain from
heaven upon the place beneath."

01:17:23.710 --> 01:17:25.890
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg:
And where was her mercy?

01:17:25.890 --> 01:17:27.190
&gt;&gt; Teresa Miguel-Stearns:
Your Honor,--

01:17:27.190 --> 01:17:28.490
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg:
That's a little bit later.

01:17:28.490 --> 01:17:31.340
She is urging Shylock,
"Be merciful."

01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:36.140
And then she turns on him and
said, "I have no mercy for you."

01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:38.820
&gt;&gt; Teresa Miguel-Stearns: I
believe Your Honor is referring

01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:40.120
to the Alien Act.

01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:46.330
And it is actually Portia's mercy
which saves both of their lives.

01:17:46.330 --> 01:17:50.870
Portia is merely providing legal
advice to the Duke of Venice.

01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:58.880 position:56%
When Portia realizes that she is not
able to convince Shylock to amicably

01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:01.310
and financially settle this case,

01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:04.650
she grants him specific
performance on the contract.

01:18:04.650 --> 01:18:07.410
And that is to take
the pound of flesh.

01:18:07.410 --> 01:18:13.050
But at the moment that Shylock is
ready to carve out a pound of flesh

01:18:13.050 --> 01:18:19.080
from Antonio's chest,
Portia stops the proceeding,

01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:24.250
strictly interprets the
contract, which the reference

01:18:24.250 --> 01:18:28.700
that was made earlier, in
that a strict interpretation,

01:18:28.700 --> 01:18:32.700
the contract would require no more,
no less than a pound of flesh,

01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:34.320
and not any other matter.

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:37.940
No blood, no other
matter, no bone, no organ.

01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:44.820
At that point, she also advises
the Duke that Shylock's actions,

01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:51.800 position:56%
Shylock's attempt to murder Antonio,
which is not in doubt at this point,

01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:54.870 position:56%
is punishable by the Alien Statutes.

01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:56.170
The Alien--

01:18:56.170 --> 01:18:58.910
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg: You're
telling us then that the contract,

01:18:58.910 --> 01:19:02.600
it was impossible to
enforce the contract.

01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:07.960
So the pound of flesh has
to go by impossibility.

01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:12.870
Everyone knows you can't take
flesh without blood as well.

01:19:12.870 --> 01:19:18.100 position:56%
So then what would happen if he
can't get the remedy he's demanding,

01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:20.660
he would get a substitutional
remedy.

01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:24.620
He would get the ordinary
remedy for breach of contract.

01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:28.490 position:56%
That is in this case his money back.

01:19:28.490 --> 01:19:30.760
&gt;&gt; Teresa Miguel-Stearns:
Your Honor, respectfully,

01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:34.260
this contract was enforceable
under the laws of Venice.

01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:35.920
This is a commercial contract.

01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:40.880
And Venice, as the international
commercial hegemony that it was,

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:44.990
required strict enforcement
of all commercial contracts.

The Duke knew this.

Antonio knew this.

take flesh without taking blood.

01:20:00.230 --> 01:20:02.830
It's an impossibility.

&gt;&gt; Teresa Miguel-Stearns: Your
Honor, it is my understanding

01:20:07.070 --> 01:20:10.510
that with a very hot knife one--

[ Laughter ]

01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:19.510

[ Laughter ]

01:20:24.410 --> 01:20:30.350
Your Honor, Portia's interest
in this case was to make sure

01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:34.530
that both men walked out
of the courtroom alive,

01:20:34.530 --> 01:20:39.050
not one on a stretcher having his
chest carved out and bled to death,

01:20:39.050 --> 01:20:41.540
and not the other being dragged off

01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:44.960
to the hangman's gallows
to meet his own demise.

01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:50.000
This is the sign of a merciful
judge, not a conflicted one.

&gt;&gt; Suzanne Reynolds:
Miss Miguel-Stearns,

01:20:51.300 --> 01:20:57.270
I believe it's your position
that Portia did not engage

01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:59.490
in any misrepresentation.

01:20:59.490 --> 01:21:01.100
Is that right?

01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:05.320
You've certainly pointed
to facts in the record

01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:11.080
that do support the conclusion that
she was very learned in the law.

01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:15.360
But didn't she engage
in misrepresentation?

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:19.340
And, if so, doesn't that
taint the proceeding

01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:22.120
so that the judgment
should be set aside,

01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:24.640
and there should be a retrial?

01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:27.770
&gt;&gt; Teresa Miguel-Stearns: Your
Honor, the only misrepresentation

01:21:27.770 --> 01:21:31.800
that Portia made was
disguising herself as a man.

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:35.830
That she was a woman had
absolutely no bearing

01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:38.240
on the outcome of the case.

01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:41.720
She was legitimately in the
court having been sent there

01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:47.210
by Dr. Bellario to provide legal
advice to the Duke of Venice.

01:21:47.210 --> 01:21:50.440
The Duke of Venice did not
want to enforce the contract,

01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:54.690
even though he felt he needed to,
because the laws of Venice need

01:21:54.690 --> 01:21:58.600
to be strictly enforced in order
to retain it's, as I mentioned,--

01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:00.740

But did Bellario know

01:22:00.740 --> 01:22:05.150
that Portia was married to the
principle debtor in this case?

01:22:05.150 --> 01:22:06.450
&gt;&gt; Teresa Miguel-Stearns:
Your Honor,

01:22:06.450 --> 01:22:08.030
the record is not clear
on that point.

01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:10.050
[ Laughter ]

01:22:10.050 --> 01:22:15.690
However, Dr. Bellario did know
that Portia was learned in the law

01:22:15.690 --> 01:22:19.400
and very capable of providing
appropriate legal advice

01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:20.700
to the Duke.

01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:23.780
Dr. Bellario wrote a letter
personally to the Duke,

01:22:23.780 --> 01:22:28.320
and attested to the Duke that he
and Portia had reviewed the facts

01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:31.590
of the case, had turned
over many books together.

01:22:31.590 --> 01:22:35.030
They had reviewed the
appropriate law in this matter.

01:22:35.030 --> 01:22:38.550
And that Dr. Bellario furnished
Portia with his opinion,

01:22:38.550 --> 01:22:42.470
which on top of Portia's
own legal acumen,

01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:46.330
would provide superb advice
to the Duke of Venice.

01:22:46.330 --> 01:22:50.430
Dr. Bellario knew that she was
going to disguise herself as a man.

01:22:50.430 --> 01:22:53.610
And actually gave her
the robes to do so.

01:22:53.610 --> 01:22:59.470
Dr. Bellario was a trusted legal
adviser of the Duke of Venice,

01:22:59.470 --> 01:23:05.050
and he was ill that day, so
he sent Portia in his stead.

01:23:05.050 --> 01:23:09.790
Portia had no conflict of
interest in this matter,

01:23:09.790 --> 01:23:14.770
other than to see the
dispute resolved amicably,

01:23:14.770 --> 01:23:17.040
and see both men alive.

01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:19.420
&gt;&gt; Connie Morella: Did
she not at some point

01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:24.490
at the end reject Shylock's
request for repayment?

01:23:24.490 --> 01:23:26.000
&gt;&gt; Teresa Miguel-Stearns:
Yes, Your Honor, she did.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:31.100
And that is because multiple
times throughout the course

01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:33.900
of the proceedings
Shylock had been offered

01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:36.910
to settle the case financially.

01:23:36.910 --> 01:23:44.830
At some point when he finally
said, "No, I demand my bond,"

01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:48.440
and Portia advised that specific
performance would be the only

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:52.090
remedy, at that point any
negotiations are off the table.

01:23:52.090 --> 01:23:54.520
Venice is a place of no take-backs.

01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:57.560 position:56%
You don't get two chances in Venice.

01:23:57.560 --> 01:24:01.470
Once they passed the point
of settling the case amicably

01:24:01.470 --> 01:24:05.400
and financially, that
door was closed.

01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:09.940
There is no right to say, "Oh,
well, I guess I can't take my pound

01:24:09.940 --> 01:24:12.820
of flesh, so, okay,
let's go back in time.

01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:15.780
I'll take the money and leave."

01:24:15.780 --> 01:24:20.980
That is just not, that is
just not the law in Venice.

01:24:23.140 --> 01:24:26.210
&gt;&gt; Richard Schneider: Portia's
motivation to get involved in this,

01:24:26.210 --> 01:24:29.820
I don't quite understand the
way you're characterizing it.

01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:32.210
She decides to get
involved after she's heard

01:24:32.210 --> 01:24:35.670
that Antonio has lost his ships.

01:24:35.670 --> 01:24:40.790
She says that she decides
that she must help Antonio,

01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:43.570
because Antonio must
be a wonderful person

01:24:43.570 --> 01:24:47.770
since he's the best
friend of her husband.

01:24:47.770 --> 01:24:53.690
And at that point she decides that
she's going to play this trick.

01:24:53.690 --> 01:24:57.790
Doesn't that motivation
in and of itself show

01:24:57.790 --> 01:25:00.630
that she is deeply
conflicted here in terms

01:25:00.630 --> 01:25:07.600
of her interests in the matter?

01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:11.180
&gt;&gt; Teresa Miguel-Stearns:
Your Honor, as I've mentioned,

01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:14.770
Portia is not conflicted
in this case.

01:25:14.770 --> 01:25:20.420
It's true that Bassanio
and Antonio were friends.

01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:23.240
But Portia had never met Antonio.

01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:25.090
Portia had never met Shylock.

01:25:25.090 --> 01:25:31.990
Portia was only concerned about
providing proper legal advice,

01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:36.500
and ensuring that both men
walk out of this case alive.

01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:37.800
&gt;&gt; Ruth Bader Ginsburg:
How can you say

01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:39.670
that when the only reason
she went to Bellario,

01:25:39.670 --> 01:25:43.470
and the only reason she
then went to Venice,

01:25:43.470 --> 01:25:49.510
was in the interest of her husband?

01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:50.810
&gt;&gt; Teresa Miguel-Stearns:
Your Honor, Portia,

01:25:50.810 --> 01:25:54.070
as a woman in 16th century Venice,

01:25:54.070 --> 01:25:58.510
had very limited opportunities
to pursue a career.

01:25:58.510 --> 01:26:01.060
[ Laughter ]

01:26:01.060 --> 01:26:06.850
This was an opportunity, not
only to save the life of a friend

01:26:06.850 --> 01:26:13.010
of her husband's, but also to
put her legal education to use.

01:26:13.010 --> 01:26:14.500
[ Laughter ]

01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:16.830
She knew that Dr. Bellario,
her cousin,

01:26:16.830 --> 01:26:19.090
would properly recommend her.

01:26:19.090 --> 01:26:23.830
And Dr. Bellario would not
have recommend a cousin,

01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:28.250
someone who wouldn't be able
to provide legal advice,

01:26:28.250 --> 01:26:32.620
much less a female
cousin, to send into court,

01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:34.990
putting his own reputation
on the line,

01:26:34.990 --> 01:26:38.170
providing advice to
the Duke of Venice.

01:26:38.170 --> 01:26:42.630
Dr. Bellario was a trusted
advisor of the Duke of Venice.

01:26:42.630 --> 01:26:46.420
He was a career member
of the legal community.

01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:52.320 position:56%
And he would not have put his entire
career on the line for Portia.

01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:57.510
Your Honor, I see my time is up.

01:26:57.510 --> 01:27:00.040
[ Laughter ]

01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:05.600
If I may just close by saying
that Portia requests, once again,

01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:08.080
that she be discharged
from this case,

01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:10.800
and relieved of any
liability in this matter.

01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:14.120
Portia did not have a
conflict of interest.

01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:18.530
Her appearance as a man did not
affect the outcome of this case.

01:27:18.530 --> 01:27:21.640
She was qualified to
provide legal advice.

01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:26.530 position:56%
And, but for Portia's legal acumen,
Shylock would have murdered Antonio.

01:27:26.530 --> 01:27:29.590
And Shylock himself
would have been executed.

01:27:29.590 --> 01:27:33.520
Rather, Portia, despite
attempts over and over again

01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:38.140
to convince Shylock to show
mercy, she saved both Shylock's

01:27:38.140 --> 01:27:43.280 position:56%
and Antonio's lives with her
skillful navigation of Venetian law.

01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:47.840
But even if this court does not
agree that Portia acted sincerely,

01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:51.920
Portia is the wrong Defendant
Appellee in this case.

01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:56.340
The Appellee should be the
city state of Venice alone.

01:27:56.340 --> 01:27:58.960
Portia was merciful.

01:28:00.070 --> 01:28:04.160
And in that spirit
would be wholly in favor

01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:08.280
of this court's reversing
the Duke of Venice's order

01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:12.840
that Shylock convert to Judaism.

01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:15.540
Just as Portia would
have liked to of freely

01:28:15.540 --> 01:28:19.500
and openly practiced law
in 16th century Venice.

01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:22.510
And, so, she persisted.

01:28:22.510 --> 01:28:33.160
[ Laughter and Applause ]

01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:38.510
Thank you for your generous time
and your merciful attention.

01:28:38.510 --> 01:28:42.260
[ Applause ]

01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:45.900
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
