00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.410
- [Instructor] A sociologist suspects

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.900
that men are more likely to have received

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.070
a ticket for speeding than women are.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.080
The sociologist wants to sample people

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.490
and create a two-sample Z interval,

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.330
in other videos we
introduced what that idea is,

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:14.810
to estimate the difference

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.530
between the proportion of men

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.210
who have received a speeding ticket

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.900
and the proportion of women

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.990
who have received a speeding ticket.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.650
Which of the following are conditions

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.560
for this type of interval?

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.650
Choose all answers that apply.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.510
So, like always pause this video

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.194
and see if you can answer it on your own.

00:00:32.194 --> 00:00:37.170
All righty, let's review our
conditions for inference.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.910
So, you have your random condition

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.350
and these are the same ones

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.210
that we have talked about

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.570
when we were dealing with one sample

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.630
but now we just have to make sure

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.320
that it applies to both samples,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.690
that both samples we feel
good are randomly selected.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.150
The second one is the normal condition

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.590
and this is to feel good

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.730
that the sampling distribution
of the sample proportion

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.950
for each of the samples is roughly normal

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:00.910
and so, what you have to do

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.170
is you take the sample size

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.670
of the first sample times
the sample proportion

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.810
of the first sample

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.210
and that needs to be
greater than or equal to 10.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.370
You take the sample
size of the first sample

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.300
times one minus the sample
proportion of the first sample,

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.550
that should also be greater
than or equal to 10.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:17.560
Another way to think about it

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.870
is your best sense of the
expected number of successes

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.630
and failures should be
greater than or equal to 10

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.650
and then you do this
with the second sample.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.340
So, the sample size of the second sample,

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.090
these don't have to be the same,
times the sample proportion

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.220
of the second sample

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.350
should be greater than
or equal to 10 as well

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.280
and the sample size of the
second sample times one

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.710
minus the sample proportion
of the second sample,

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.160
that needs to be greater
than or equal to 10.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.698
This is has to and,

00:01:41.698 --> 00:01:43.790
all of this needs to be true

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.740
and then the final one is
the independence condition.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.170
And we meet that if
individual observations

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.240
in these samples are done with replacement

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.140
or if even they're not
done with replacement

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.070
but if the samples are no more
that 10% of the population

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.470
then we meet the independence condition

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.140
and once again, you've seen this before,

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.440
we're now just doing it with two samples.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.520
So, let's see.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.240
Which of the following are conditions

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.630
for this type of interval?

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.940
So, the samples both
include at least 10 people

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.600
who have received a speeding ticket

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.050
and at least 10 people who haven't.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.330
Yeah, that's right.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.880
This is, you could view
this as the expected number

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.770
of people who have
received a speeding ticket

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.200
and this is the expected number of people

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.720
who haven't received a speeding ticket

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.230
or an estimate of the expected number

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.690
because we're using the sample proportion

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.100
instead of the true proportion.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.900
So, these need to be
greater than or equal to 10

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.217
in both samples.

00:02:34.217 --> 00:02:37.095
So, this is absolutely true.

00:02:37.095 --> 00:02:39.200
The people in each sample

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.580
can be considered independent.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.010
Yeah, we have that independence condition.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.170
Either they're sampled with replacement

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.250
or we are sampling no more
than 10% of the population,

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.963
so this is important.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.730
And then last but not least

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.770
they take separate random samples

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:54.760
of men and women.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.300
Yeah, that's the random
condition right over here.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.700
So, they have all three
of them right over here.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.570
We have our normal condition,

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:02.840
our independent condition

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.510
and our random condition.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.580
Let's do another example.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.250
A biologist is studying a certain disease

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.600
affecting oak tress in a forest.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.610
They are curious if there's a difference

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.930
in the proportion of trees

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.640
that are infected in the
North and South sections

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.210
of the forest.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.130
They want to take a sample of trees

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.520
from each section

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.430
and do a two-sample Z test

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.750
to test their hypotheses.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.750
Which of the following are conditions

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.350
for this type of test?

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.820
So, pause the video again

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.423
and see if you can answer this.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.160
Okay, so we've already
reviewed our conditions

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.790
for inference, so let's see which of these

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.450
are the actual conditions for inference.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.020
So, both samples include at 30 trees.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.470
So, this might have been tempting

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.180
because this 30 number shows up

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.500
when we're thinking about conditions

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.290
for inference when
we're dealing with means

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.300
but this does not come up

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.100
when we're dealing with proportions.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.370
Both samples do not need
to include at 30 trees,

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.280
so this would not be one of our choices.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.240
They sample an equal number of tress

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.360
from each region of the forest.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.490
This is a very common misconception

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.660
that when you're doing a two-sample Z test

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.500
or when you're doing a
two-sample Z interval

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.670
or confidence interval

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.690
that both samples have to
have the same sample size

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.760
but that is actually not the case.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.260
So, we can rule that one out.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.010
They observe at least 10 trees

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.843
with the disease

00:04:24.843 --> 00:04:26.700
and at least 10 trees without the disease

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.900
in each sample.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.280
Yes, this is the normal condition

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.650
that we just looked at,

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.823
so this would be our only
choice and we're done.
