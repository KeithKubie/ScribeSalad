00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now we're going to analyze the forward Euler method with the help of Dahlquist test equation.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
In which range should the step size h lie to maintain stability.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Should that step size be smaller than kÂ²/2, k being our constant.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Should the step size be smaller than the inverse of that constant.

00:00:18.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Should it be smaller than twice that constant, or should it be smaller than 2 over that constant.
