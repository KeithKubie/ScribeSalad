00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.170
How many ounces are
in 6 pounds?

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.670
So we have 6 pounds
and we need to

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.130
convert them to ounces.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.110
And if you don't know it
already, you'll know it now,

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.530
that there are 16 ounces
per pound.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.280
So what we want to do is we
want to have pounds in the

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.680
denominator.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.250
It's in the numerator
right now.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:29.980
So we want to divide by pounds
and multiply by ounces.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.600
Maybe I'll write it out.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.990
And I just told you
that there are 16

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:43.170
ounces for every 1 pound.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.420
So if we multiplied these two
expressions, this pounds will

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.120
cancel with that pounds, and
we'll just be left with the

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.040
unit of ounces, which is what we
want, and we just multiply

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.410
6 times 16.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.120
So it works out unit-wise, and
it makes sense as well.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.880
If we have 16 ounces per pound,
and we have 6 pounds,

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.960
we just have to multiply
6 times 16.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.840
That'll be the total number of
ounces we have. So this is

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.270
going to be equal to--
what's 6 times 16?

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.310
So if you take 16 times
6, 6 times 6 is 36.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.100
Carry the 3.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.400
6 times 1 is 6, plus 3 is 9.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.550
So 6 times 16 is 96.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.640
You have this divided by 1 here,
but that's not going to

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.650
change anything.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.820
And then all we're
left with in the

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.700
dimensions are the ounces.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.190
So 6 pounds are 96 ounces.
