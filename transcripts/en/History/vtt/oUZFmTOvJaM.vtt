<i>- I'm back
in sunny Southern California</i>

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.750
in Simi Valley
at my home forge,

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.290
and, um, this is
where the magic happens.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.040
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.750
<i>Most of this is armor shop,
but I have all the tools</i>

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.750
for making blades
and weapons.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.830
When I make a knife, I use
maybe two or three hammers,

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.500
not very many.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.460
When I make armor, I could use
30 or 40 different hammers,

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.960
and many different shapes
for stakes.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.380
Uh, all of my armor work
is done hot

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.960
using a rosebud torch.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.380
These are my two proudest
prized possessions,

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.420
and they don't really have
any real value,

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.040
but both of these were used in
making the Statue of Liberty.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.540
And that holds
a pretty special part,

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.500
um, for me, being American.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.210
<i>♪ ♪</i>

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.540
<i>- Hi, I'm Ryan Weaver,
and this is my shop.</i>

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.420
Uh, this is kind of
my heating/forging center.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.120
Uh, this is actually
a propane...

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.540
<i>uh, forge.</i>

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.920
This is my major,
uh, armor-working station.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.880
<i>and this is just
a selection of the stakes.</i>

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.960
As an armorer,
I use a lot of different stakes

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.420
to make
a lot of different shapes

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.000
to do all sorts
of different stuff.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.540
This is my gas saver,

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.710
which these things
are lifesavers.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.040
<i>If you're going
to get into doing armor</i>

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.210
or anything like that,

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.080
ah, man, it's just--
total game changer.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.920
<i>- I have a background
in medieval martial arts.</i>

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.460
<i>Armored combat,</i>

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.420
<i>it's my favorite thing
in the world to do.</i>

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.170
I'm Nicholas.
- I'm Dave.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.460
- And we're gonna hit each
other in the head with sticks.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.080
- For fun.
[laughs]

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.750
<i>[rock music]</i>

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.670
<i>- And we do tournaments
and melees...</i>

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.960
<i>from one-on-one
to 1,000 guys on each side.</i>

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.460
<i>It's fun and you get</i>

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.170
<i>to hit your friends
as hard as you can,</i>

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.790
<i>and then go have a beer
with them afterwards.</i>

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.290
[both exhale, armor clanging]

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.880
- That's all you get.
- That was awesome, Dave.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.290
- I'm tired.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.500
<i>- 2012,</i>

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.500
I was part of
the first U.S. team

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.460
to fight internationally

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.500
<i>in full-contact
steel fighting.</i>

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.170
In order to make sure I had

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.750
a steady flow
of sparring partners,

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.120
<i>I ended up making
a lot of armor.</i>

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.670
The problem with doing
full-contact steel combat,

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.960
<i>is that, first, it--</i>

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.460
it's hard on armor,

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.120
and so there's a constant need
to repair and replenish.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.500
<i>And it's also hard
on sparring partners.</i>

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.580
<i>So there's, again, a constant
need to repair and replenish.</i>

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.250
