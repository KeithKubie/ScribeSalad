&gt;&gt;D.C. office.
My primary responsibility is working on issues

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:30.730
of free expression,
which is one of the reasons I'm out on campus

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.300
today.
We have gathered together a group of the world's

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.530
leading experts on
circumvention technology,

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.649
and helping people to express themselves and
access information around the world.

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.930
And that's what we're going to be talking
about today.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.079
I'll skip the long and boring lecture about
why free expression is

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.250
important to our company.
It's something that I think everybody here

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.180
shares as a principle and as
a goal.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.070
And despite its complexity, it's something
that we work for every day.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.830
Instead, I'm going to get right to our guest
who knows more about this

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.060
world than so many people out there and is
a real star of the field.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.330
Professor Ron Deibert is Associate Professor
of Political Science and

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.220
Director of the Citizen Lab at the Munk Center
for International

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.810
Studies at the University of Toronto.
There are other people from the Citizen Lab

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.000
with us today as well.
It's an interdisciplinary -- I can say that

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.580
three times quickly --
research and development hothouse that works

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.490
at the intersection of the
Internet global security and human rights.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.260
The initiative is really known for combining
the discipline of

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:48.420
technology with the goals and the principles
of trying to help people

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.970
not only undertake research and engage in
advanced development of

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.850
tools,
but also in helping people who otherwise would

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:03.190
have their voices stilled around the world.
Ron is also co-founder and Principal Investigator

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.990
of what's called the
OpenNet Initiative,

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.420
which is a research and advocacy project that
examines Internet censorship and surveillance

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.129
worldwide.
I recommend them very highly if you're interested

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.470
in what is being
censored where in the world.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.520
They do a brilliant map that shows the difference
between political and

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.541
cultural, and the overlapping areas of censorship
around the world.

00:02:25.541 --> 00:02:30.900
In 2002, he was awarded the University of
Toronto's Outstanding

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.349
Teaching Award,
and the Northrop Frye Distinguished Teaching

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.159
and Research Award,
and was a Ford Foundation Research Scholar

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:43.689
of Information Communication Technologies
from 2002 to 2004.

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:49.109
In the amusing category, he was named to the
Maclean's magazine honor

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:52.799
roll as one of 39 Canadians to have helped
make the world a better

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:58.459
place in 2006.
And, get this, to Esquire magazine's Best

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.099
and Brightest list in the
year 2007.

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.810
Without further ado, Ron Deibert, thank you
very much for being with

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:06.810
us.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:07.810
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.480
RON DEIBERT: Thank you very much.
Thank you very much, Bob, and to Google for

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.930
hosting us here.
It's really a great opportunity to bring together

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.081
a lot of people who
have been working on this over the years.

00:03:19.081 --> 00:03:23.590
And it's also great to see Citizen Lab alumnus
Michelle LaVeck in the

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.579
back of the room here at Google.
So a great time all-around.

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:31.519
As we gather here, I just want to begin my
presentation several

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.129
thousands of miles away.
Events are unfolding in Iran that really have

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:36.959
relevance to our
workshop.

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.780
An election is occurring and a social movement
is again mobilizing on

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.779
the streets of Iranian cities,
and connecting through networks of support

00:03:45.779 --> 00:03:51.809
to cities across Europe and North America.
In Toronto, a very dynamic group of Iranians

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:56.219
have banded together in
support of activists on the ground.

00:03:56.219 --> 00:04:00.949
And this is probably happening in cities here
in California as well.

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:04.249
Now the role of technology in affairs such
as these is often

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:07.639
overstated.
The battle is about much more than the latest

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:12.079
social networking tool.
No matter what label is assigned to the latest

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:15.569
revolution, but it
should not be underestimated, either.

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.979
Cyberspace is the domain through which the
contests of ideas takes

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:23.700
place today.
And is heavily contested domain by parties

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.320
on all sides of this
conflict.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.920
It is widely known that demonstrators can
achieve wider support and

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.080
publicity through the use of cyberspace and
mobile technologies.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.830
But the Iranian authorities are taking active
countermeasures aimed at

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.510
controlling the spaces for online resistance
and dissent.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:46.620
And not just by censoring access to web sites.
They're employing more offensive actions as

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.800
well.
The Internet has slowed down in many cities

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.890
across Iran.
And there have been periods where it's not

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.670
accessible at all.
It has essentially ground to a halt similar

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.370
to what happened in
previous periods and places like Burma.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.640
The AFP is quoting technicians as saying that
they have been ordered to

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.760
restrict Internet service in this way rather
than being some kind of

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.480
technical problem.
SMS messaging and mobile phone communications

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.950
have also been suspended
and jammed.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:24.170
And cyber-organizers, dissidents, and activists
have been targeted and

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:28.180
arrested, not just inside the country but
outside as well.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.600
And this is interesting that there are reports
of Iranian authorities

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.830
monitoring social networking platforms, identifying
people in Canada,

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:42.770
United States, and Europe and harassing them,
threatening their family members who still

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.230
live in Iran.
And of course circumvention technology, the

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:51.420
topic of the discussion
here today, are actively being deployed in

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.740
this, in this conflict.
In our case, with Psiphon's right-to-know

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.130
nodes are being mobilized.
And we have lots of interesting stories to

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.600
tell about our experiences
there.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.370
And we're eager to hear about other projects
as well.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.770
Many of these projects have funding from U.S.
Government sources which

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:16.030
adds an interesting geopolitical twist to
not only the cyber-conflict but to the role

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:21.030
of circumvention technologies.
More broadly, what is happening now in Iran

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.450
offers a clear example of
the new generation of controls that are being

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:30.330
exercised in cyberspace.
As the domain becomes more heavily contested

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.780
and is seen as a critical
vector for the exercise of power, rather than

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:40.150
first generation controls as exemplified by
China's Great Firewall,

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.010
we're seeing instead the emergence of what
we call second and

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:48.460
third generation methods that are more subtle,
flexible.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:54.050
Sometimes offensive in nature, designed to
go beyond mere denial to

00:06:54.050 --> 00:07:00.900
shape and limit the room for expression online.
So in my talk today, I'm going to offer on

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.300
overview of these trends in
cyberspace controls.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.780
And I'm going to be doing it through the lens
of the OpenNet

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:15.220
Initiative, which is one of the projects that
I helped found and still help to oversee and

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:19.220
run.
I do this not because the ONI is a world leader

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.630
in documenting these
methods, but because the new forms of control

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:27.620
I describe present a
challenge to the ONI's own methods.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.930
And the challenges to the ONI's methods that
these new controls present

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:36.240
are analogous to the challenges that I think
are -- present themselves

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:42.530
to the circumvention technology community.
And so I talk a bit the end of my presentation

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:46.200
about those challenges
for circumvention that I hope we'll pick up

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:51.770
today in this workshop.
Let me begin with description of the ONI.

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:58.930
When it was formed it was a three-university
collaboration with four

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:05.310
principle investigators and founders.
My colleague Rafal Rohozinski, who is the

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:08.840
host of this event here, at
the time was at the University of Cambridge.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.400
He started something called the Advanced Network
Research Group.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:17.460
And it was one of the original founding partners.
Also, involved are my colleagues from the

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:22.030
Berkman Center at Harvard
University, John Paul Free and Jonathan Zittrain.

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:27.290
And at one time, there was a kind of functional
division of labor here.

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:31.760
The Citizen Lab was the primary base for a
lot of the technical

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.269
development and the technical analysis and
the development of tools.

00:08:36.269 --> 00:08:39.330
Harvard was the place where a lot of the organization
takes place and a

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:44.089
lot of the open source information gathering
was implemented.

00:08:44.089 --> 00:08:48.770
And Cambridge, under Rafal's direction, was
responsible for a lot of the deep field research

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:52.829
and managing our network of field researchers
that I'll talk about.

00:08:52.829 --> 00:08:57.269
In fact, the project has its beginnings even
earlier with some student

00:08:57.269 --> 00:09:00.249
projects.
And one of the -- at that time, a student

00:09:00.249 --> 00:09:05.259
Nart Villeneuve, who is here
joining us today, along with Ben Edelman at

00:09:05.259 --> 00:09:09.790
Harvard University were
both working in similar areas.

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:13.420
Trying to undertake technical interrogation
of the Internet to find out

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:16.839
what content was being blocked by countries
around the world.

00:09:16.839 --> 00:09:19.850
That was the problem that we were attempting
to address.

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:23.139
Now this functional division of labor has
changed over time.

00:09:23.139 --> 00:09:28.269
Partners have come and go.
As it stands right now, Cambridge -- Rafal

00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:33.200
has moved from Cambridge,
really rests on the two universities at Toronto

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.279
and Harvard.
But we have a variety of partners and projects

00:09:37.279 --> 00:09:43.759
that have in one way or another either spun
out or have some connection or network relationship

00:09:43.759 --> 00:09:46.910
to the OpenNet Initiative.
And that includes our sister project, the

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:53.610
Information Warfare Monitor,
the SecDev group, SecDev Cyber, which Rafal

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.269
runs and Greg Walton and
Nart worked for.

00:09:56.269 --> 00:10:01.610
Psiphon is a circumvention tool.
Again it has its origins with Michelle La

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:09.240
Veck and Nart, is now a private company.
And I'd also point out OpenNet Asia which

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:14.620
is a regional network of about 16 organizations
across Asia.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:20.470
As well as E-PIN, the Eurasian i-Policy Information
Network, which involves networks throughout

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:24.040
Central Asia.
So the OpenNet Initiative, although it rests

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.139
with these two
universities, is really a broad umbrella of

00:10:28.139 --> 00:10:35.759
projects and organizations
that span really all regions of the globe.

00:10:35.759 --> 00:10:39.290
Now the mission of the ONI is to document
patterns of Internet

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:42.620
censorship worldwide.
And when we started the project, the problem

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.819
we were confronting was
this issue of --

00:10:45.819 --> 00:10:49.640
There'd be reports of web sites being inaccessible
or filtered or

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.410
blocked or censored.
And there was no way to confirm or verify

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:54.819
whether this was the case or
not.

00:10:54.819 --> 00:10:58.300
And we wanted to bring some, some rigor to
this project.

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:04.990
To bring some empirical methodology to it
so that we could provide a independent authoritative

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:09.339
basis from which, say, advocacy groups who
are interested in this area could point to.

00:11:09.339 --> 00:11:13.910
And I think we've done a fairly good job of
that.

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:18.959
And at the core of the OpenNet Initiative
is a methodology, that I

00:11:18.959 --> 00:11:23.959
think is quite unique for the social sciences.
And it informs, I think, all of the projects

00:11:23.959 --> 00:11:25.301
that we do at the Citizen
Lab.

00:11:25.301 --> 00:11:30.809
We call it a fusion methodology, which is
a combination of technical

00:11:30.809 --> 00:11:34.309
interrogation methods, which I'll talk about
a bit more in some detail.

00:11:34.309 --> 00:11:38.220
And these often get the most attention when
people are looking at the

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:41.589
OpenNet Initiative.
The combination of technical interrogation

00:11:41.589 --> 00:11:46.800
and field research that is
undertaken by actual human beings who live

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.319
in the countries that we're
interested in.

00:11:49.319 --> 00:11:52.639
And although the technical side gets a lot
of the glory, I think the

00:11:52.639 --> 00:11:57.050
most valuable component of the methodology
of the OpenNet Initiative is

00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:02.759
the fact that we have this capacity of people
who live within the

00:12:02.759 --> 00:12:08.879
countries that we're investigating,
who target our technical tests, help us understand

00:12:08.879 --> 00:12:15.369
the context, the social, the political context
within which our investigations are undertaken.

00:12:15.369 --> 00:12:19.089
Help us understand what is happening in their
countries, so that we can

00:12:19.089 --> 00:12:22.810
get a better idea of what's going on.
As I mentioned with OpenNet Asia, we have

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:27.550
15 partner organizations
that are part of our wide umbrella.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:31.569
And the data from both of these sources is
combined using

00:12:31.569 --> 00:12:35.759
multi-disciplinary analysis.
We're not primarily technical people.

00:12:35.759 --> 00:12:39.519
Although there are some very bright technical
people who are part of

00:12:39.519 --> 00:12:42.119
the OpenNet Initiative.
We're social scientists.

00:12:42.119 --> 00:12:47.790
We're lawyers.
We're sociologists, political scientists.

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:51.579
People who understand the context of the countries
that we're

00:12:51.579 --> 00:12:53.470
investigating.
And I think that's really a critical dimension

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:59.839
of what we do.
In terms of the technical side, on one level

00:12:59.839 --> 00:13:05.610
it's really quite simple.
What we've done is we've created a -- a set

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:11.050
of software tools that are
deployed in countries that are under investigation

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:15.470
that give us a
snapshot of what's being filtered, not comprehensively.

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:19.519
We don't have access to large data sets like
what was described by the

00:13:19.519 --> 00:13:22.819
Google engineers.
So instead we have to be much more targeted

00:13:22.819 --> 00:13:26.019
and selective.
And what we've done is we've created a database

00:13:26.019 --> 00:13:29.589
that we've maintained
over the years now, where we have baskets

00:13:29.589 --> 00:13:34.639
of content.
And there're two large baskets, meta baskets

00:13:34.639 --> 00:13:39.019
you might say, of content.
We call globalist and localist.

00:13:39.019 --> 00:13:43.499
And when -- within each of these baskets are
thousands of categorized

00:13:43.499 --> 00:13:49.780
URLs, keywords, and domains.
In the global list are domains that we test

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:54.660
in all countries.
This is a -- provides us with a basis of comparison

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:56.970
of content that is
being targeted for filtering.

00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:00.509
And it's, you know, human rights organizations,
news sites,

00:14:00.509 --> 00:14:04.059
pornography.
There's probably about 20 different categories

00:14:04.059 --> 00:14:11.889
of content in the global basket.
In the local baskets are content URLs and

00:14:11.889 --> 00:14:14.220
domains and keywords that are
unique to each country.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:20.649
And these are usually in local languages.
They're either based on reports that we get

00:14:20.649 --> 00:14:23.300
about filtering that might
be taking place in a country,

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:29.199
we want to confirm whether that's happening.
Or they're put together by our in-field researchers

00:14:29.199 --> 00:14:31.920
who understand
that, you know, this website of this particular

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.939
opposition group might
be targeted at any one time.

00:14:35.939 --> 00:14:39.499
So, the -- what happens is people who are
in the country are travel or

00:14:39.499 --> 00:14:46.470
travelling to the country take our software.
It connects back to databases in Toronto.

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:50.519
And it essentially automates the process of
checking for accessibility

00:14:50.519 --> 00:14:53.600
to this content.
It does so both locally and then with the

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:58.079
control server in Toronto.
And we do a basic comparison.

00:14:58.079 --> 00:15:02.759
We run some further tests to try to identify
at what level the content

00:15:02.759 --> 00:15:05.110
is being filtered, what methods are being
used.

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:07.720
Is it a IP block?
Keyword block?

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:11.639
URL path?
A domain that's being filtered?

00:15:11.639 --> 00:15:15.019
Is there some commercial filtering product
being employed?

00:15:15.019 --> 00:15:18.879
So we run a variety of metrics that allows
us to get some sense of the

00:15:18.879 --> 00:15:22.190
techniques that are employed in filtering
around the world.

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:28.829
Now, I think we have a pretty impressive list.
I'm very proud of what we've been able to

00:15:28.829 --> 00:15:31.090
accomplish over the last
several years.

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:37.629
We started out by doing country reports.
So focussing on individual countries one at

00:15:37.629 --> 00:15:41.339
a time.
China, Saudi Arabia, and Iran and so on.

00:15:41.339 --> 00:15:44.199
We've issued several Internet watch reports
and bulletins and

00:15:44.199 --> 00:15:48.110
advisories.
Around 2006, we were fortunate to receive

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:52.069
funding from the MacArthur
Foundation, which allowed us to ramp up a

00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:57.509
global comparative survey.
Beginning first with the around 56 countries,

00:15:57.509 --> 00:16:01.139
all simultaneously done.
And in the last round, we tested in close

00:16:01.139 --> 00:16:05.749
to 70 countries.
We've produced two books now on the topic

00:16:05.749 --> 00:16:10.310
that report on these findings
and provide some theoretical overviews and

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:14.410
analytical overviews of what
we found beginning with Access Denied.

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:18.779
And then more recently Access Controlled,
which some of you may have

00:16:18.779 --> 00:16:21.540
heard of.
That was the subject of controversy at the

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:24.769
recent Internet Governance Forum.
I can talk more about that.

00:16:24.769 --> 00:16:29.489
The Chinese delegation did not like that image
appearing outside of the

00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:32.820
room in which we were announcing the book,
because it contained a

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:39.879
reference to the Great Firewall of China.
Now what about the broad findings here?

00:16:39.879 --> 00:16:42.399
I'm just going to quickly summarize some of
the main trends without

00:16:42.399 --> 00:16:46.639
getting into details before getting into these
new generation of

00:16:46.639 --> 00:16:49.170
controls.
So based on what the ONI has been looking

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:53.689
at, based on what our
methodology is oriented to find here is what

00:16:53.689 --> 00:16:57.399
I can tell you.
First of all, I would say that even though

00:16:57.399 --> 00:17:01.350
we haven't been testing the
same number of countries over time,

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:04.720
and we haven't been using exactly the same
data -- we're not looking for the same thing

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.550
each time.
I can say confidently that Internet censorship

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:11.380
is growing worldwide.
When we started out there were really only

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:15.750
a handful of countries
engaged in Internet censorship.

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:19.490
Now there're in the latest round, there are
close to 40 that have some

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:27.820
content filtering going on within their borders.
The vast majority of content that is targeted

00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:30.520
for filtering is local
language content.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:35.790
So that may be contrary to conventional wisdom.
You'd think that within a country they're

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:40.790
more concerned about people
accessing foreign news and foreign information.

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:44.960
Although that happens, disproportionately
most countries target the

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:49.370
content that matters closest to home.
So they focus on local language content.

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:53.230
In China, it's Chinese content.
In Iran, it's Farsi content.

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:56.920
And that makes sense.
You want to limit and contain what citizens

00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:01.440
in your borders have access
to that matters most to your local political

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:06.860
situation.
Most of the countries that engage in Internet

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:09.550
censorship do so with
very little transparency and accountability.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:16.260
And we heard some of -- some about some of
that this morning with respect to China.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:20.750
But it's, I would say the majority of the
countries to don't do with a large degree

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:24.790
of accountability.
Some countries yield block pages that say

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:29.990
the content is forbidden.
That's the most transparency you'll get.

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:33.880
Most of them do not talk openly about it.
They don't discuss what type of content they

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:37.180
target for filtering.
So we're doing a lot of unearthing of what

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:42.190
goes on beneath the surface.
I would say also that this lack of transparency

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:45.170
and accountability is
multiplied by the fact

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:50.320
that many countries use commercial filtering
products to do the job of censorship.

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:54.460
And the reason that I say this multiplies
the lack of accountability

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:57.860
and transparency is because the block lists
that are used to do the

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:02.390
filtering are considered trade secret.
They're considered proprietary.

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:06.220
So researchers like us at the ONI, we can't
examine those block lists

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:11.160
to see whether there's any filtering errors
or category errors that may

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:17.370
prejudice the filtering that's going on.
And in our research, we've been able to identify

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:21.120
the use of products
like Fortinet, Websense, SmartFilter.

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:24.720
Most of these are California-based companies
that are used to

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:29.630
essentially violate basic human rights in
places like Burma, Yemen,

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:33.330
Iran, and Tunisia.
Of course, this has now become a subject of

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:37.970
considerable public policy
debate in the United States about whether

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:42.150
these companies should be
permitted to provide services to countries

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:46.720
that do that sort of thing.
And we're of course following that closely.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:51.420
Some other basic findings.
You know, there're about 7 or 8 countries

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:54.800
that we would categorize as
pervasive filters of Internet content.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:59.460
By that we mean they filter in every category
of content that we

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:03.701
measure for.
So it's political content, conflict, Internet

00:20:03.701 --> 00:20:07.070
tools, cultural content.
There are about seven of them.

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:11.440
And then there are a lot more countries that
selectively filter one content category, say

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:15.400
pornography for example.
Or maybe it's a country like South Korea that

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:20.720
blocks a lot of content
related to North Korea.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:24.540
Some other things we found.
Mission creep, we call it.

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:27.750
This is where countries once they've put in
place Internet filtering

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:31.560
for whatever reason, even if it's to deal
with something that seems

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:36.260
maybe plausible and legitimate.
Maybe some form of hate speech or extremism

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:41.750
or whatever or pornography,
once the tools are in place, it's very tempting

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:46.270
to use them to deal
with other troubling public policy issues.

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:51.440
So for example, in Pakistan where Shasad here
will be speaking about

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:56.140
the Pakistan situation later today, filtering
that started off by

00:20:56.140 --> 00:21:01.380
ostensibly blocking imagery containing cartoons
that was offensive, has

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:05.510
now broadened to include independence and
insurgency movements like the

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:10.920
Balochistan liberation movement.
A lot of countries target, instead of content,

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:15.650
the services and
platforms that are used by people, especially

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:20.100
web 2.0-type platforms.
And there's a lot of collateral and upstream

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:23.370
filtering.
Rafal is actually the one who coined the term

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:26.380
upstream filtering.
And for many years was prodding people at

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:30.000
the ONI.
This is an issue we need to look at more closely.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.800
And now, of course, we realize that he was
very farsighted about that

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:37.500
because there have been several incidents
where countries are getting

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:41.970
their service from other countries upstream
where filtering affects

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:44.590
them.
A good example is the blocking of YouTube

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:48.220
in Turkey that was described
earlier today, affect users in Georgia.

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:54.710
Because the Georgian ISPs got their service
from a telecom company in Turkey.

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:58.640
And that's common in a number of other countries
as well.

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:03.160
As Bob said you with go to our site.
You can get these maps that are clickable,

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.051
and take you into deep dives
for each of the countries.

00:22:06.051 --> 00:22:11.380
And we categorized them in different ways
to give you kind of slices of

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:18.360
which countries block what content.
You'll see that the number of countries increases

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.970
quite substantially
when you look at social content.

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:25.740
And that's because there really is now a driving
force coming from the

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:29.850
advanced liberal industrialized countries,
Western countries, whatever

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:34.810
you want to call them,
who are now implementing filtering for pornography

00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:39.820
or hate speech in Europe, Canada, North America,
Australia and so on.

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:45.340
And this is, I believe, kind of creating a
normative terrain here that

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:48.680
is making it acceptable to implement content
filtering or impose

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:54.460
requirements on Internet service providers
which gives legitimacy to other countries

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:58.830
who are doing it for quite different reasons,
which needs to be discussed.

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:03.620
Now I mentioned that the next generation controls
that we see emerging,

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:07.341
that I'm going to talk about, have presented
a challenge to the ONI.

00:23:07.341 --> 00:23:11.130
And I believe really the ONI is in the middle
of a kind of --

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:17.310
for those of who follow philosophy of science,
Thomas Kuhn has this notion of anomalies and

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:21.790
how these anomalies can create challenges
to accepted paradigms.

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:25.230
And you have paradigmatic revolutions take
place in the time of

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:28.230
anomalies.
And I feel we're very much in the ONI in one

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:32.701
of these stages.
And over the last several years, and again,

00:23:32.701 --> 00:23:36.710
I would single out Rafal
actually, has been really critical in pointing

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:39.880
out those areas where
there are gaps in how we go about doing what

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:43.810
we do.
For example, blocking events that were occurring

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:47.420
outside of the ONI
testing window that we were missing.

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:51.600
When we test with the ONI, we aim to test
on every major ISP in a

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:58.540
country, at least two rounds, for every phase
of testing but it's really only a snapshot.

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:01.200
It's like going in a taking a picture and
then leaving, right?

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:06.340
Meanwhile, a major demonstration or election
would occur, the ONI

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:09.190
testing is not going on.
We don't know what's happening during that

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:12.010
period.
We're also, of course, missing a lot of contextual

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:17.480
factors that may
reflect our concentration on technical interrogation.

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:20.760
This is the something I advise the engineers
at Google, who are looking

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:23.621
into reasons why blocking is occurring and
so on.

00:24:23.621 --> 00:24:27.440
Just reiterating what was said earlier that
contextual factors are very

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:31.560
important to understand that -- that can inculcate
a climate of

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:38.820
self-censorship,
where intimidation factors, and threats, and

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:44.200
informal requests, and those sorts of things
that happen that aren't always picked up.

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:49.080
And a number of other things as well.
The big event for me personally, and for many

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:53.060
of us, was in -- when we
were monitoring for Internet censorship in

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:59.080
Kyrgyzstan in 2005.
And Kyrgyzstan a country at that time, very

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:01.980
little if any, Internet
filtering to speak of.

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:04.920
But we happened to be testing in that country
during the time of

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:09.871
elections.
And opposition newspapers, their web sites

00:25:09.871 --> 00:25:12.060
came under denial of service
attacks.

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:16.130
And the owners of those -- the operators of
those web sites came to us,

00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:18.120
because they knew we were testing in the country,
and they said can you

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.390
help us?
You know, we're being blasted.

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:25.730
And can you analyze what's going on?
So we actually had their content hosted in

00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:28.340
Toronto and analyzed the
traffic.

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:33.480
And in fact engaged in some conversation with
the people responsible

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:37.020
for the attack.
And it turned out that the Kyrgyese authorities

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:43.090
had contracted out to a
Ukrainian hacker to blast these opposition

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:46.810
newspaper web sites offline
during the time of demonstrations.

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:50.950
And this is something that Rafal actually
coined the term "just in

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:54.240
time" filtering, which is a great way of getting
at this idea that

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:57.870
information only has value at certain periods
of time.

00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:02.040
And that's -- when it has its highest value,
when it's most critical,

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:06.170
that's when you need to bring it down.
Not necessarily all the time making it inaccessible

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:08.480
to everyone, just
at certain periods of time.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:12.361
And I think this is really what happened in
Kyrgyzstan was kind of a

00:26:12.361 --> 00:26:17.020
window into what is becoming now the norm
worldwide.

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:20.600
Where we're seeing these next generation controls
 -- and I'll just run

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:23.360
through a bunch of these, and these are the
type of things that we're

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:28.660
seeing as now defining what you might call
the Internet censorship

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:33.930
situation globally.
So we have, for example, legal and normative

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:41.270
measures where slander and
libel laws are being used to intimidate producers

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:45.480
of content.
Threaten them with some kind of sanction or

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:52.120
point to such laws to have
bloggers or posters remove information, or

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:57.570
the hosting platforms
undertake that action on behalf of the authorities.

00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:01.600
So it's not uncommon in some countries for
authorities to either go

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:06.210
directly or maybe informally through visits
by security services to

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:11.530
ISPs, to social networking platforms, and
say if you don't remove this,

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:13.440
there're going to be certain consequences
for you.

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:16.801
Very similar to what we discussed earlier
today.

00:27:16.801 --> 00:27:24.100
We see the Kyrgyzstan case being multiplied
and duplicated in other

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:31.380
parts of the world, where it's not uncommon
for web sites to at critical times to be taken

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:37.800
down by criminal organizations or DDoS attacks
that are contracted out by somebody.

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:40.120
And this is the interesting thing, and I think
why it makes it so

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:45.750
attractive as a tool of shaping cyberspace,
is that there's plausible

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:49.930
deniability for those involved.
If you contract out to a criminal organization

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:52.980
to undertake a DDoS
attack you can say, hey, it's not us.

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:56.680
There's no paper trail.
It's not something we're going to admit.

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:59.860
The Internet's always a problem in this country.
It's down.

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:03.960
It's got some technical issue.
And of course we see this same thing going

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:07.860
on in all these cases right
now as we speak in Iran.

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:13.460
And that's where I think things like "just
in time" blocking is going

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:18.180
to become more common, in fact.
Where around elections public demonstrations,

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:21.770
we'll see critical
sources of information being removed.

00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:26.700
Computer network attacks now are becoming
standard parts of many

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:33.110
states' information warfare doctrines.
And, of course, we saw real instances of that

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:38.070
being deployed Estonia
and Georgia.

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:41.360
And even more nefarious, I would say, is the
example -- patriotic

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:47.400
hacking, where citizens either acting on their
own or maybe encouraged

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:51.210
by governments undertake acts, undertake information
attacks.

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:56.950
Again allow for the state to have some kind
of plausible deniability.

00:28:56.950 --> 00:29:00.460
And then lastly, and this is really I think,
the front where at the

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:03.580
Citizen Lab and with our various projects
and partners we're spending

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:07.710
most of our time right now, is with targeted
malware attacks and

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:12.070
targeted surveillance.
Of course, many of you will heard of the GhostNet

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:17.990
Report.
Prior to that we had been examining many other

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:21.351
cases where this sort of
thing is going on, where human rights organizations

00:29:21.351 --> 00:29:24.160
are being targeted
with malware.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.900
That's more than just, you know, viruses floating
in the ether.

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:30.610
These are deliberate attacks that are meant
to pry inside the

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:36.340
information of organizations who are adversarial.
And again this is becoming something that

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:39.330
is part of many states'
apparatus now.

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:43.410
And I think this is where we really need to
change the kind of context

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:47.450
for this conversation.
Whereas in the past it was about Internet

00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:49.980
censorship on the one hand,
freedom of expression on the other.

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:55.330
I think we live now in a completely different
context where there is a

00:29:55.330 --> 00:30:00.470
active cyber arms race going on.
And I think that can't be underestimated.

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:02.680
Many countries around the world have now come
out.

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:08.830
Whether in the last year like the Obama administration,
or years before that, saying yes this is what

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:12.790
we want to now have as part of our arsenal,
the ability to

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:16.920
undertake computer networks attacks, targeted
malware attacks.

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:21.660
And these are affecting all spheres of cyberspace.
You know, you have attacks on the physical

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:25.550
infrastructure, critical
infrastructure, like say what happened Estonia

00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:29.950
or Georgia.
Attacks that target the code sphere like malware

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:34.880
and spam and so on.
This context is creating pressures in the

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:38.350
regulatory sphere.
New laws are being introduced that download

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:41.950
a lot of policing and
monitoring to Internet service providers that

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:45.960
are really changing their
relationship to the network that we think

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:49.100
of as cyberspace.
And lastly, the idea sphere.

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:53.000
And by that I mean the way in which now psychological
operations are

00:30:53.000 --> 00:31:01.770
playing into standard cyber warfare doctrine.
And what that will entail for not just cyberspace

00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:05.310
but I would say for
what we're discussing here today.

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:09.270
I think you can look at all spheres here in
the context of cyber

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:13.690
warfare and talk about what the impact will
be on the circumvention

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:17.870
technology projects that are discussed here.
I'll just give one example.

00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:21.770
There is, under the regulatory sphere now,
a very real concern with

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:25.809
attribution and anonymity.
And you hear calls for the end of anonymity

00:31:25.809 --> 00:31:29.059
online.
And that sort of pressure is I think one example

00:31:29.059 --> 00:31:31.430
of what we'll see more
of.

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:34.120
And again, I just reiterate this is not just
the developing world

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:37.090
phenomenon.
It's something that we may have first confronted

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:39.300
with the ONI in
Kyrgyzstan,

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:44.430
but it's something now that's happening among
the great powers at the highest level that

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:48.550
is really creating a kind of culture shift
internationally.

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:53.370
Now what are the wider implications of these
next generation controls?

00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:56.820
Well, first I think, you know, speaking kind
of selfishly here.

00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:59.970
I think there is a real challenge for the
OpenNet Initiative.

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:04.490
We designed that project with first generation
controls in mind.

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:09.140
We built a whole methodological apparatus
around the idea of monitoring

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:12.880
and documenting and analyzing what you might
call "Chinese-style

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:16.000
filtering."
You know, passive blocks that are programmed

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.580
into routers that we can
come in with our tools and identify and verify.

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:24.130
Whereas the new controls that are emerging
are much more subtle and

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:30.270
flexible and operating "just in time."
And that really, I think, creates a challenge

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:34.930
for us as a monitoring
organization that we're going to have to confront.

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:43.670
I think that there is a very real sense in
which the -- the adversaries

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:47.530
-- the way in which we used to think of those
who were responsible for

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:50.371
Internet censorship, you know, it's the Chinese.
It's the Iranians.

00:32:50.371 --> 00:32:54.960
It's the Saudi Arabians -- are now being replaced
by a much more

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:58.450
complex, diffuse environment.
And a lot of the controls are being downloaded

00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:02.300
to private actors.
And that makes again this whole area much

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:07.680
more complex.
When Facebook or Twitter or one of these platforms

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:12.710
engages in acts that
are essentially censorship acts,

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:17.351
it's much more challenging to monitor, to
confront and deal with than it is when it

00:33:17.351 --> 00:33:22.790
is a government where it's a clearly identifiable
adversary, even if they're not transparent

00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:25.330
about it.
It's much more murky.

00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:29.690
I think that as I said circumvention technologies
are going to be drawn

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:34.960
into this battle.
That there's a new geopolitical contest taking

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:38.630
place within cyberspace
that's going to affect all of the projects

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:42.480
that are assembled here.
And I think that's one challenge that I would

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:46.730
put before everyone.
Lastly, I think one of the things I've been

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:50.170
advocating for --
for better or for worse lately --

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:54.940
is arms control in cyberspace.
And without getting into the nuances of the

00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:59.120
debate there, I've always
thought that it's important as part of an

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.620
agenda to promote arms
control in cyberspace.

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:07.250
To think about promoting, also, a broad social
movement around the idea

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:11.970
of protecting the Internet,
protecting cyberspace as a form for free expression

00:34:11.970 --> 00:34:16.000
and access to information.
To me that is one of the pillars of an arms

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.820
control agenda for
cyberspace.

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:22.010
And it's in that light, that I see the value
of the projects that are

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:24.490
being put forward here.
So I'll end it there.

00:34:24.490 --> 00:34:27.240
And thank you very much for the opportunity,
and I look forward to the

00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:32.450
next couple of days.
Thank you.

00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:36.639
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:45.020
&gt;&gt;[INAUDIBLE SPEAKER]

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:53.399
&gt;&gt;[INAUDIBLE QUESTION]

00:34:53.399 --> 00:35:09.310
DR. RON DEIBERT: Yep, sure. The question was
about Australia, and the

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:14.720
proposals there for a national filtering system.
And we've been engaging in monitoring in Australia

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:16.451
just like in a lot
of other countries.

00:35:16.451 --> 00:35:21.510
This is a proposal is being discussed as far
as I know, anyway.

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:24.881
But it's emblematic of the type of discussion
that's happening in a lot

00:35:24.881 --> 00:35:29.900
of other advanced, industrialized countries.
I think the difference with Australia was

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:34.550
a bit more extreme of a
proposal than what's happening say in Canada.

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:38.830
In Canada, the model is for private companies
have entered into a

00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:42.630
voluntary arrangement.
It's not that a law has been imposed upon

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:46.050
them.
Where they're blocking access to a list of

00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:50.500
sites containing images and
texts and so on of child abuse.

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:56.810
Child pornography.
The list of information is provided by a kind

00:35:56.810 --> 00:36:01.100
of civic organization, a
monitoring organization, Cybertip.

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:05.950
And I guess, you know, first of all, let me
say about this discussion

00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:08.930
as a whole, it's always a very difficult one
to enter into.

00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:13.300
Because right away it's -- it's one of those
areas of conversation

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:17.610
where you hesitate to sound like a defender
of the content in question.

00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:20.190
Because I think, you know, this is one case
where certainly I believe

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:26.511
this content is objectionable.
It's already illegal to circulate and produce

00:36:26.511 --> 00:36:28.140
in many countries.
And I think that's great.

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:31.040
So the question is not about whether this
content should be circulating

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:34.580
or not, at least in my mind.
It's about how to deal with it.

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:38.060
And I think in the case of Canada, you have
a very bad solution.

00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:40.420
And the case of Australia is probably even
worse.

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:45.770
In the case of Canada, private companies are
undertaking this mission

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:50.220
with the help of this Cybertip.
Researchers can't examine the block list.

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:52.880
We're not allowed to check whether there are
any errors.

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:57.480
There's no government oversight.
There's no way for citizens who are concerned

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:01.480
about whether their
content is included mistakenly in this category,

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:05.020
is a problem.
So to me there are a lot of issues with this.

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:08.369
Actually, Nart Villeneuve in the back of the
room here, did a chapter

00:37:08.369 --> 00:37:13.700
for Access Control on this topic.
And Nart, if you -- do you want to add anything

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:14.700
to that?

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:16.470
[PAUSE]

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:24.610
&gt;&gt;Is this working?
Well, I think the main problem is the tension

00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:27.270
between filtering which
is sort of easy.

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:34.000
And take down which is much more difficult.
So, what happens is there are organizations

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:51.930
all over the world that act
in this same way that Cybertip does, like

00:37:51.930 --> 00:38:01.720
the Internet Watch Foundation
in the UK.

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:14.850
They accept tips from the public, and then
they check to make sure that

00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:18.240
those URLs --
at least I think they're URLs, and hopefully

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:19.420
not domain names or IP addresses --
contain illegal content, give them to the

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:20.420
ISPs.
The ISPs block them with whatever method they

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:21.420
choose.
Then what happens is they don't circulate

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:22.420
that information amongst
other tip agencies.

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:26.820
So when Canadian authorities find bad sites
in the UK, we just block

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:30.020
them.
We don't phone them up and say, "Hey, you

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:31.020
have these bad sites over
there.

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:33.200
Maybe you should do something about it."
So Canada actually blocks content that's hosted

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:34.200
in the U.S., despite
the fact that we have two law enforcement

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:35.200
 --
like joint law enforcement agencies that are

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.200
targeting -- that are supposed to work on
the issue of images of child abuse online.

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:37.200
And a network of operators like Cybertip,
they're supposed to exchange

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:38.200
information.
So someone's dropping the ball somewhere.

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.130
The result is that people block a minute amount
of content to prevent

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:41.850
-- and they clearly state it's to prevent
 -- accidental access to

00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:43.780
images of child abuse.
So it has nothing to do with trying to get

00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:45.110
that content offline,
figuring out who's circulating that and posting

00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:53.010
that content.
It's just a very kind of -- we fill in the

00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:58.030
bullet point on the
presentation to say we're doing something

00:38:58.030 --> 00:39:00.530
about this issue kind of solution.

00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:01.980
DR. RON DEIBERT: Thanks, Nart.

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:09.420
&gt;&gt;[INAUDIBLE QUESTION]

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:30.241
DR. RON DEIBERT: Geez, that's a question for
all the Google engineers

00:39:30.241 --> 00:39:32.820
here.
I have no idea.

00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:39.360
Interesting, I suppose.
I mean to me the findings of the ONI's research

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:42.370
in that area --
For those who didn't hear the question is

00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:45.460
about the blocking disproportionately of local
language content --

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:50.110
could machine translation help?
And you know as I said I think it's a interesting

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:53.991
question.
But -- for me the what we've done there I

00:39:53.991 --> 00:39:56.750
think is interesting to a
certain extent.

00:39:56.750 --> 00:40:01.320
To me, it's -- it's all of the other ways
in which controls are being

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:04.420
exercised now that are becoming much more
important.

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:09.580
And our research doesn't really get at.
And that's troubling to me and a few others.

00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:14.810
And we need to really refine the way we think
about doing what we do.

00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:17.960
Although, it's still interesting as a snapshot
that a lot of countries

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:26.660
target local language content, sure.

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:34.630
&gt;&gt;[INAUDIBLE QUESTION]

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:49.080
DR. RON DEIBERT: Well, sure.
I mean, beginning in this country, there was

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:52.340
 -- one of the most
interesting things about the Cyber Security

00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:58.010
Review was that the world's
worse-kept secret about information operations

00:40:58.010 --> 00:41:01.890
and computer network
attacks was being openly discussed for the

00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:04.730
first time.
So it's not that it wasn't going on before.

00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:08.760
It's now being legitimized.
I think that was a very important threshold

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:11.760
that had been crossed.
Actually, I was among a group of people that

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:15.980
commented on the cyber
security announcement that Obama made.

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:19.500
And that was the one thing that struck -- one
of the things that struck

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:24.619
me was this fact.
And once that happens, of course, it creates

00:41:24.619 --> 00:41:29.001
a typical spiral in
international relations where other countries

00:41:29.001 --> 00:41:31.171
feel compelled to follow
suit and so on.

00:41:31.171 --> 00:41:35.190
I think right now, you know, the reason that
the idea of cyber arms

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:40.030
control is dismissed as so naive --
for one reason anyway, is because the momentum

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:46.040
is so much in the other direction right now.
So many countries are seeing this as an area

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.030
where they need to catch
up, first of all.

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:51.130
And also an area that yields very valuable
information.

00:41:51.130 --> 00:41:54.460
As I said, most of our research now is in
this domain of targeted

00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:57.600
surveillance, targeted espionage, malware
and so on.

00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:01.470
And looking at the type of research that's
done by Greg Walton and Nart

00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:04.460
and the people who are working at the Citizen
Lab on this topic.

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:08.500
It's remarkable to me how much you can gain
access to because there is

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:13.240
such a insecure underbelly to the Internet.
All of these devices that are connected to

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:18.020
it that are highly insecure
yet contain sensitive information that can

00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:21.590
be collected and used for
whatever purposes.

00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:25.900
I think is now such an attractive thing for
intelligence, for military

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:28.790
that it's creating this dynamic of an arms
race.

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:31.470
And I think it's affecting what we used to
call in the past Internet

00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:35.080
censorship, which we thought of at least I
did, well, this is something

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:38.220
that governments do.
They program content into routers somewhere,

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:39.540
and you're not able to
access it.

00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:43.850
Where this is -- there's a whole bigger fish
floating out there.

00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:48.450
A much bigger set of problems that we need
to put this in the context

00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:58.290
of -- including circumvention technologies,
I would say.

00:42:58.290 --> 00:43:02.520
&gt;&gt;[INAUDIBLE QUESTION]

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:10.690
DR. RON DEIBERT: Well, well, the first thing
I'd do is I'd direct them

00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:14.800
to my very capable people who I work with
who know more about what

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:18.530
they'd like to get access to.
So people like Nart and Greg and Rafal.

00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:22.109
But for me I -- you know, listening to that
conversation this morning

00:43:22.109 --> 00:43:26.880
about the data that Google has latent access
to,

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:31.180
let's say, that tells us a lot about some
of these outages and blockages.

00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:35.050
To me, that would be interesting to make that
data, of course, open to

00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:39.030
researchers and research organizations like
the OpenNet Initiative.

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:43.110
Would be very valuable for us.
And likewise, you know, in turn we could do

00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:45.590
that with the OpenNet
Initiative.

00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:49.560
Find ways to make our data more accessible
to organizations like

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:53.500
Google, that would be one.
I think there are areas that many people today

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:57.070
here, again, very
capable people on the circumvention side would

00:43:57.070 --> 00:44:00.030
suggest things.
I'd be interested to hear more about what

00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:01.770
that is.
Thanks a lot.
