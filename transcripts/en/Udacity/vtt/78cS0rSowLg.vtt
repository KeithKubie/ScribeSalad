00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.367
Let's talk a bit more generally then about all these different problems we've

00:00:04.367 --> 00:00:08.590
discussed and their roots. So reflecting on the huge number of quadratic

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.214
equations we've worked with, how many solutions are there to any given quadratic

00:00:13.214 --> 00:00:17.659
equation? Please count repeated roots twice, and also remember that complex

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:22.308
numbers and imaginary numbers, are in fact numbers. So answers that contain them

00:00:22.308 --> 00:00:23.963
do still count as solutions.
