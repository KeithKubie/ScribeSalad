00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:02.402
A team of engineering students

00:00:02.402 --> 00:00:03.770
at the University of California

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:04.471
San Diego have entered

00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:05.572
themselves into the Google Lunar

00:00:05.572 --> 00:00:07.107
X privately funded space program

00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:08.408
with a proposal that's, uh,

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:10.043
considered unusual for science,

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:11.512
but typical for San Diego

00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:12.613
college students.

00:00:12.613 --> 00:00:13.747
Uh, they want to make beer in

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:14.548
space, and from a scientific--

00:00:14.548 --> 00:00:15.916
(laughter)

00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:16.884
I know.

00:00:16.884 --> 00:00:18.051
From a scientific standpoint,

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:19.086
their goal is to study the

00:00:19.086 --> 00:00:20.220
effects on the yeast, which

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.488
could lead to a better

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:22.556
understanding of how to make

00:00:22.556 --> 00:00:23.624
other foods in space.

00:00:23.624 --> 00:00:25.092
However, it's possible that this

00:00:25.092 --> 00:00:26.393
plan to binge drink on the moon

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:27.594
could just be the latest attempt

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:28.962
by the Russians to undermine us

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:30.197
with a space contest they could

00:00:30.197 --> 00:00:31.899
actually win for once.

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:33.066
Yeah, that's right!

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.835
Sweet burn, Russia!

00:00:34.835 --> 00:00:36.036
That was for Laika the space

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:37.037
dog!

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:38.639
(laughter, cheering)

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:40.340
Uh, so...

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.842
Comedians...

00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:43.977
if this idea becomes a reality,

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:45.479
what's a transmission NASA might

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:46.647
receive from a team of space

00:00:46.647 --> 00:00:47.648
drunks?

00:00:47.648 --> 00:00:48.715
Jeff Ross.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:51.652
&gt;&gt; One small step for sobriety,

00:00:51.652 --> 00:00:52.953
11 more steps to go.

00:00:52.953 --> 00:00:53.954
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: All right, points.

00:00:53.954 --> 00:00:55.088
Very good. Very, very good.

00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:56.156
(laughter, applause &amp; cheering)

00:00:56.156 --> 00:00:57.858
Mike Lawrence.

00:00:57.858 --> 00:00:59.426
&gt;&gt; This is ground control.

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:01.161
I'm major bombed.

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:02.229
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: All right, points.

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:03.230
Very good.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.331
(laughter, applause)

00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:05.432
Jamar.

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:07.234
&gt;&gt; Houston, we have a drinking

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:08.235
problem.

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:09.236
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Yes. Points.

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:10.404
(laughter, applause &amp; cheering)

00:01:10.404 --> 00:01:11.038
&gt;&gt; That's good.
