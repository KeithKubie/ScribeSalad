00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.836
I realize

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.172
we're all a salad-spinner
of emotions right now, you know.

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:07.307
And, yeah, and feel
what you've got to feel.

00:00:07.341 --> 00:00:09.176
You know, feel what
you got to feel.

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:10.744
But the way I see it,

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:15.282
now is not the time
to abandon America, you guys.

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:17.851
You don't want to go off and cry
in some hockey player's mullet.

00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:20.320
You got to stay here.

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:23.423
-The most...
-(applause and cheering)

00:00:23.457 --> 00:00:27.294
And I love Canada, but the most
American thing you can do

00:00:27.327 --> 00:00:29.863
is stay here, be the best you
you can be,

00:00:29.897 --> 00:00:31.732
make your community better.

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:33.967
Work, love your family,
be good to people.

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:35.536
(applause and cheering)

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:37.271
Because I want
to tell you something.

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:38.939
I want to tell you something,

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:40.874
now that I'm having
my (bleep) Oprah moment.

00:00:40.908 --> 00:00:42.509
Now I want
to tell you something.

00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:44.344
At the end of the day,
it is people,

00:00:44.378 --> 00:00:45.746
it is each and every one
of you,

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:47.481
it is you watching
that make a country great.

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:49.550
Not some clown
sitting in the White House

00:00:49.583 --> 00:00:52.653
-who thinks they can...
-(cheers and applause)

00:00:52.686 --> 00:00:55.455
Like, we are too...

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.625
We put too much power
on that person,

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.062
whoever that person was gonna
be, to make our lives better.

00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:04.097
We have to make our (bleep)
lives better, so don't...

00:01:04.131 --> 00:01:07.434
-(applause and cheering)
-You guys make America great.

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:07.534
You (bleep) make America great.
