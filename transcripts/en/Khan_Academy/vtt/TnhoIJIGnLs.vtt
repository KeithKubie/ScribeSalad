00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.230
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.260
is diagram out how a
bill can become a law.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.850
And I make a distinction
between a non-tax bill

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.327
and a tax bill because a non-tax bill

00:00:09.327 --> 00:00:13.560
can be introduced into either
chamber of Congress initially.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.720
It can be introduced into the Senate

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.730
or it can be introduced into the

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.190
House of Representatives.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.760
While something that deals with taxation

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.920
can only be introduced initially

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.070
into the House of Representatives.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.330
And as we've talked about in other videos,

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.140
anyone can be involved
in the drafting of a bill

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.880
but it actually needs
to be introduced into

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.850
the appropriate chamber by
a member of that chamber.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.040
But let's say that it gets
introduced into the Senate,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.540
what happens then?

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.820
Well it will be referred to
the appropriate committee

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.300
and what is the appropriate committee?

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.780
Well if it deals with foreign relations

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.410
it would go to the Foreign
Relations Committee.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.620
If it deals with the Armed Services,

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.460
well it would go to the
Armed Services Committee.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.270
You get the general idea.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.290
Now in the committee
they might have hearings,

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.580
they might debate it

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.210
and if they decide to debate it

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.310
and have a vote on it,

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:04.640
it could pass.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.880
So lets say it passes
through the committee,

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.440
and then the majority leader,

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.710
and the majority leader is the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.040
leader of the majority
party in the Senate.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.290
They have a lot of influence on how

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.620
and when that bills gets
debated on the Senate floor.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.630
But lets say they schedule it for debate

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.110
on the Senate floor.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.450
Once things get to a
vote on the Senate floor

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.570
they need a simple majority to pass.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.090
So lets say that this bill passes

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.150
and I know what you're thinking.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.280
You might have heard numbers like

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.170
60 out of 100 votes or 2/3 majority.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.540
Where the 2/3 is necessary
to ratify a treaty,

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.710
the 60 votes that's necessary for cloture,

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.480
to end most filibusters.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.990
And so functionally it often does require

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.610
more than a simple majority support

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.580
in order to get even to a vote.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.810
But lets say that this bill,

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.430
that was initially
introduced into the Senate

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.710
makes it all the way through.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.630
What happens then?

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.450
Well if there isn't a similar bill

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.710
that was introduced into
the House of Representatives

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.730
and got through the
House of Representatives

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:08.990
this bill would then go through

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.240
a similar process in the House.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.910
So then this bill would go all the way,

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.790
it would be introduced into
the House of Representatives.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.060
It would be referred to
the appropriate committee

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.790
and then once it passes through
the appropriate committee

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.830
it would go through the Rules Committee.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.380
And the Rules Committee
is one of these major

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.750
distinctions between the
House and the Senate.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.730
The Senate does have a Rules Committee

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.770
but it is nowhere near as powerful.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.780
In the House the Rules
Committee can control a lot.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.670
It can decide when and how

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.900
or even whether a bill
even gets to the floor.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.000
But lets say that it does get to the floor

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.380
and then it gets a simple majority

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.910
of the House members to vote for it.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.400
Well then this bill would
then go to the President.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.130
Now some interesting things happen

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.870
once it gets to the President.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.270
The President can of course
decide sign the bill.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.330
So then sign the bill,

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.160
in which case that bill will become law.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.470
The President could also
decide to veto the bill.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.560
Now if the President vetoes the bill,

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.600
it would go back to the
chamber in which it originated.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.010
In this first example
that we're talking about

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.369
that vetoed bill would
go back to the Senate.

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:28.530
And in order to override the veto

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.110
they would need a 2/3 majority.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.920
And even if they where able to
get the 2/3 right over here,

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.580
it's still wouldn't become a law.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.950
Then it would have to
get the 2/3 in the House.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.600
But if it was able to get
the 2/3 there as well,

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.700
well then they have overwritten
the President's veto

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.780
and it will become a law.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.700
Now there's other edge cases
that involve the President.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.850
If a President does nothing for 10 days,

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.000
and if Congress is in
session for those 10 days,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.520
well then it can become a law.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.687
So nothing for 10 days,

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.000
well then you can also make it a law.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.800
And there's also called a pocket veto,

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.690
where the President does nothing

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.940
but the Congress goes out of session

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.670
within that 10 days.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:18.810
And so let me do this.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.977
This would be a pocket
veto right over here

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.540
and I'll just put that in quotes

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.760
because that's also the
President doing nothing

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.130
but Congress goes out of
session within those 10 days.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.830
Now one thing to be clear,

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.620
even what I've drawn
here is a simplification.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.360
There many steps in this process

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.880
where bill could change,

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.010
where a bill could die

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.630
or a bill could just go into
some sort of a limbo state.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.080
For example, a committee
can decide to add to a bill

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.670
that would be called amending a bill.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.530
So that could happen over there.

00:04:56.867 --> 00:04:58.340
That can actually happen other places.

00:04:59.234 --> 00:05:01.670
Maybe a bill does not
pass through committee.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:02.770
Not pass.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.950
Maybe it does not pass
through the floor action.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.970
Maybe it doesn't pass the House Committee.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.440
Maybe it doesn't pass through the House.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.220
All of these places are
where a bill could die.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.130
There's also situations where a committee

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.660
could decide to table a bill.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.230
Which is not saying that
we have voted against it

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:26.930
but they're saying hey we're
not even going to vote on it

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.740
and it just goes into
a little bit of limbo

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.680
but essentially the bill will die there.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.571
So it could get tabled in
committee in either chamber.

00:05:34.571 --> 00:05:38.100
Even the Rules Committee
could decide to table it.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.850
So it'd never really makes its
way to a vote on the floor.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.230
Now it's also important to note

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:44.590
that in the example we gave,

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:45.880
a bill started in the Senate.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.050
Made it's way through the Senate

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.820
and then had to make it's
way through the House

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.060
and eventually got to
the President's desk.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.560
It could have gone the other way.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.890
It could have started in the
House of Representatives.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.290
In fact if it's a tax bill
it would have had to start

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.510
in the House of Representatives

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.380
and if it got all the
way through the House

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.790
then it would have gone into the Senate.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.730
It would have to go all
the way through the Senate

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.000
and then it would end up
on the President's desk.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.260
And often times you have a situation

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.090
where two parallel bills
are making their way

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.440
through each chamber.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.590
So there could be a bill
that's making it's way

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.400
through the Senate on say immigration

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.820
and there could be a
parallel bill on immigration

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.160
making it's way through the
House of Representatives.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.750
Now if each of those bills

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.010
get through their respective chambers,

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.177
then they go to something
called a conference committee.

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.370
Which is a place where
both Representatives

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.010
and Senators of the appropriate committees

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:41.310
will get together and make
their bills gel together.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.000
Now even if they're able to agree

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.700
to a unified bill so to speak,

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.560
one that syncs the two bills
that went through both chambers

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.650
then that synced bill would
once again have to go through

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.340
both chambers again.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.050
So its' not like the conference
committee can just decide.

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.690
And even what I've drawn
here is a simplification.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:01.840
There's all of this,

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.840
whether you consider
it interesting or not,

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.600
parliamentary procedure and nuances

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.330
that allow different players

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.670
especially the leadership
in each of the houses

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:12.250
to have a lot of levers to either

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.140
accelerate the passage of a bill

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.310
or to kill it in different ways.
