have a separate activity don't have a
 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.920
have a separate activity don't have a
dialogue theme yeah basically the

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930
dialogue theme yeah basically the
 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.930
dialogue theme yeah basically the
activity underneath it would be in the

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940
activity underneath it would be in the
 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.640
activity underneath it would be in the
started but pause state so just and I

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650
started but pause state so just and I
 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.140
started but pause state so just and I
don't answer the question straight on

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150
don't answer the question straight on
 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.449
don't answer the question straight on
here because I think it may depend on a

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459
here because I think it may depend on a
 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.340
here because I think it may depend on a
couple of things but what I would do is

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350
couple of things but what I would do is
 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.840
couple of things but what I would do is
instead of using a dialogue all together

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850
instead of using a dialogue all together
 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.600
instead of using a dialogue all together
I'd have a kind of a first step there

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610
I'd have a kind of a first step there
 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.730
I'd have a kind of a first step there
will be a full screen activity or full

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740
will be a full screen activity or full
 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.860
will be a full screen activity or full
screen fragment in that activity that

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870
screen fragment in that activity that
 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.570
screen fragment in that activity that
will let you select that account once

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580
will let you select that account once
 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.879
will let you select that account once
you select an account he goes on to the

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889
you select an account he goes on to the
 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.610
you select an account he goes on to the
next activity or just you know pops the

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620
next activity or just you know pops the
 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.950
next activity or just you know pops the
account selection fragment from the core

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960
account selection fragment from the core
 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.939
account selection fragment from the core
layout and shows the next ride so it

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949
layout and shows the next ride so it
 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:42.890
layout and shows the next ride so it
basically my short answer to this would

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900
basically my short answer to this would
 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.020
basically my short answer to this would
be don't use a dialog fragment just use

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030
be don't use a dialog fragment just use
 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.590
be don't use a dialog fragment just use
a an inline account selection private

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600
a an inline account selection private
 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:56.150
a an inline account selection private
and you guys have any other stuff okay

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160
and you guys have any other stuff okay
 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.379
and you guys have any other stuff okay
is there like a is there a reason you

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389
is there like a is there a reason you
 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:01.939
is there like a is there a reason you
aren't doing that is early kind of just

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:01.949
aren't doing that is early kind of just
 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:05.930
aren't doing that is early kind of just
a what I'm trying to do is make a more

a what I'm trying to do is make a more
 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.870
a what I'm trying to do is make a more
generic approach because I want to make

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880
generic approach because I want to make
 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.980

on the dialogue sometimes it just

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780
on the dialogue sometimes it just
 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.310
on the dialogue sometimes it just
doesn't wait to kill the user select and

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320
doesn't wait to kill the user select and
 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.120
doesn't wait to kill the user select and
just moves on to the next selector to

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130
just moves on to the next selector to
 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.960
just moves on to the next selector to
the freshman and what I did was divided

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970
the freshman and what I did was divided
 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.770
the freshman and what I did was divided
the dialogue to two options and then

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780
the dialogue to two options and then
 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.800
the dialogue to two options and then
popped up the window with

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810
popped up the window with
 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.890
popped up the window with
Donald fragment and just waited until

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900
Donald fragment and just waited until
 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.480
Donald fragment and just waited until
the return from the OAuth and then I

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490
the return from the OAuth and then I
 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.060
the return from the OAuth and then I
moved on but it's not so good because

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.070
moved on but it's not so good because
 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.659
moved on but it's not so good because
sometimes you need you see the the UI

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:10.669
sometimes you need you see the the UI

sometimes you need you see the the UI
thread Hanks for a bit and that's why I

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:12.889
thread Hanks for a bit and that's why I
 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:15.550
thread Hanks for a bit and that's why I
wanted to know if there's any other

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560
wanted to know if there's any other
 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.090
wanted to know if there's any other
options to do it yeah I mean just in

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.100
options to do it yeah I mean just in
 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.440
options to do it yeah I mean just in
case i don't know if i follow this

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:20.450
case i don't know if i follow this
 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.690

entirely but just in case you're kind of

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:22.700
entirely but just in case you're kind of
 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.730

but when you pop of the dialogue

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:25.760
but when you pop of the dialogue
 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.420
but when you pop of the dialogue
fragment but kind of that's that's going

so what I was doing instead is I mean

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:36.290
so what I was doing instead is I mean
 

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.840
so what I was doing instead is I mean

fragment like I said earlier probably

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:39.320
fragment like I said earlier probably
 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.070
fragment like I said earlier probably
shouldn't is a dialogue in this case but

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080
shouldn't is a dialogue in this case but
 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.480
shouldn't is a dialogue in this case but
assuming you had to do it you you

assuming you had to do it you you
 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.040
assuming you had to do it you you
shouldn't wait on you shouldn't have

kind of or assume any sort of blocking
operations just use a series of

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:48.740
operations just use a series of
 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.969
operations just use a series of
callbacks so when the don't actually add

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:51.979
callbacks so when the don't actually add
 

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:55.270

the next fragment until you get the

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280
the next fragment until you get the
 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.400
the next fragment until you get the
callback that these are yeah that's what

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:57.410
callback that these are yeah that's what
 

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.070
callback that these are yeah that's what
I did eventually but I wanted to know

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080
I did eventually but I wanted to know
 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.200
I did eventually but I wanted to know
there is a better option than that

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:02.210
there is a better option than that
 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.350
there is a better option than that
because like sometimes when you get to

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360
because like sometimes when you get to
 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.440

hangs about a half a second until you

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120
hangs about a half a second until you
 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.600
hangs about a half a second until you
get to the new fragment and so on so

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:13.610
get to the new fragment and so on so
 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.330
get to the new fragment and so on so
that's why I wanted to be a bit more

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:16.340
that's why I wanted to be a bit more
 

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.900
that's why I wanted to be a bit more
precise on the UI and not be lit so much

for thanking yeah I mean if it's hanging

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:22.370

off the top of my head I can't ago yeah
I'd probably instrument that and try and

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:31.610
I'd probably instrument that and try and
 

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.190
I'd probably instrument that and try and
find out what's going on during that so

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:33.200
find out what's going on during that so
 

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.900
find out what's going on during that so

a bug somewhere and are you want to make

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:50.270
a bug somewhere and are you want to make
 

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.240

nostalgic that happens also the cliq
 

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.879
nostalgic that happens also the cliq
happens like in the callback so if you

00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:00.889
happens like in the callback so if you
 

00:08:00.889 --> 00:08:02.620
happens like in the callback so if you
know there's nothing nothing stopping

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:02.630
know there's nothing nothing stopping
 

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:04.719

input applications and input methods may
 

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:12.139
input applications and input methods may
add words into the dictionary so it

00:15:12.139 --> 00:15:12.149
add words into the dictionary so it
 

00:15:12.149 --> 00:15:14.120
add words into the dictionary so it
seems like this will just add something

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:14.130
seems like this will just add something
 

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:16.999
seems like this will just add something
to your existing dictionary so you can

00:15:16.999 --> 00:15:17.009
to your existing dictionary so you can
 

00:15:17.009 --> 00:15:19.069
to your existing dictionary so you can
create an app that's basically just if

00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:19.079
create an app that's basically just if
 

00:15:19.079 --> 00:15:21.110

I'd agree to the bug so much is the
 

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:59.660
I'd agree to the bug so much is the
importance of the bug and the number of

app from a widget you shouldn't be
 

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:26.870
app from a widget you shouldn't be
creating a new task every time I you

00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:26.880
creating a new task every time I you

shouldn't like in your recent when you
 

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:31.160
shouldn't like in your recent when you
touch on reasons you shouldn't see four

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:31.170
touch on reasons you shouldn't see four
 

00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:33.530
touch on reasons you shouldn't see four
or five different instances of your app

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:33.540
or five different instances of your app
 

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:35.840
or five different instances of your app
no you won't see you you'll see only one

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:35.850
no you won't see you you'll see only one
 

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:38.990
no you won't see you you'll see only one
again you will see only one instance on

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.000
again you will see only one instance on
 

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.020
again you will see only one instance on
reasons but each time you create a

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:42.030
reasons but each time you create a
 

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:44.030
reasons but each time you create a
pending intent because you're not going
