00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.344
The center of this
circle is O. And I

00:00:03.344 --> 00:00:05.010
apologize if I'm a
little out of breath,

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:06.550
I actually just
did some pull-ups.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.720
Anyway, the center
of this circle

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:19.430
is O. Find the exact
length of OA, CD, and OF.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.380
So let's look at each of these.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.780
So CD, it's part of
a right triangle.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.290
It's one of the two shorter
sides of a right triangle.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:28.990
But we don't know
the hypotenuse,

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.906
so we're not going to
be able to figure out CD

00:00:30.906 --> 00:00:32.090
out right, just yet.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.282
Same thing with OF.

00:00:33.282 --> 00:00:37.160
OF is one of the two shorter
sides of a right triangle.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.650
But we don't know its
hypotenuse either.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.094
Now let's look at OA.

00:00:41.094 --> 00:00:44.530
OA is the hypotenuse
of a right triangle,

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.270
and they've given us
the two other sides.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.190
So we can use the
Pythagorean theorem

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.250
to figure out the hypotenuse.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.680
So we know that 7 squared,
let's call this x.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:03.790
We know that 7 squared
plus 24 squared

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.580
is going to be equal to
the length of OA squared.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.260
It's going to be
equal to x squared.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.532
7 squared is 49,
and 24 squared, well

00:01:13.532 --> 00:01:15.240
let's do a multiplication
right over here

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.560
to figure out 24 times 24.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.660
4 times 4 is 16.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.570
4 times 2 is 8
plus-- so that's 96.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.970
And then two times 24 is 48.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.380
Add them together, we get 6.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.590
9 plus 8 is 17, 576.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.160
So 49 plus 576 is
equal to x squared.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.660
And so let's think about
what this is going to be.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:51.680
And this is going to be the
same thing as 50 plus 575.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.120
I just took one away from
this and added one here.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.220
So 50 plus 575 is 625.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.560
So 625 is equal to x squared.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.610
And you might recognize
that 25 times 25 is 625.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.890
So x is equal to 25.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.110
And if you don't believe me
you could multiply that out

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.750
on your own.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.260
So x is equal to 25.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.810
Or another way of thinking
about it, the exact length of OA

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.570
is equal to 25.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.480
Now, how can we somehow
use that information

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.460
to figure out this other stuff?

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.900
Well all of these
other right triangles,

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.310
all of their hypotenuses
are a radius of the circle,

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.085
and so is OA.

00:02:46.085 --> 00:02:47.790
OA is a radius of the circle.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.520
OG is a radius of the circle.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.760
OC is a radius of the circle.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.600
Well, we just figured out the
radius of the circle is 25.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:01.560
So OG is going to be 25, and
OC is going to be 25 as well.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.820
So now we just have to apply the
Pythagorean theorem a few more

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.340
times.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.780
So right over
here, if I call OF,

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.280
let's just call that, I don't
know for the sake of argument,

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.150
let's call that
length equal to a.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.040
So here, for this
triangle, we see

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.510
that a squared plus
the square root of 141

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:28.270
squared-- I'll just write that
as 141-- so plus 141 is going

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:35.950
to be equal to 25 squared,
which we already know to be 625.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.590
If we subtract 141
from both sides

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.840
let's see where do we get.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:48.600
So let's do 625 minus 141
we get 5 minus 1 is 4.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.610
And then 12 here, and
we can put a 5 there.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.744
12 minus 4 is 8.

00:03:54.744 --> 00:03:57.120
5 minus 1 is 4.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.770
So we get 484.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:07.810
So we get a squared
is equal to 484.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.127
So what squared is equal to 484?

00:04:13.127 --> 00:04:15.460
Actually, I'll just try to
do a prime factorization here

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.251
to figure this out.

00:04:16.251 --> 00:04:30.260
So 484 is 2 times 242,
which is 2 times 121, which

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.579
is the same thing
as 11 times 11.

00:04:34.579 --> 00:04:36.370
So another way of
thinking about it is this

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.860
is 2 squared-- so 484,
I'll write it over here.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.960
484 is equal to 2
squared times 11 squared.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.120
Or it's the same
thing as 2 times 11

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.190
squared, which is 22 squared.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.620
So in this case a is equal to--
let me just clean all that up

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.260
so I have some space to work
with-- a is equal to 22.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.910
Let me write that down.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.360
a is equal to 22, so that's
equal to 22 right here.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.880
And that's the
length of segment OF.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.630
So this is 22.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.830
And then finally CD,
once again we just

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.810
apply the Pythagorean theorem.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.190
Let's just call this, I don't
know, I've already used a.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.160
I've already used x.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.055
I don't know, I'll call this b.

00:05:20.055 --> 00:05:24.760
So we see that b squared
plus 15 squared, which

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.760
is the same thing as
225-- 15 squared is 225--

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.930
is going to be
equal to 25 squared,

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.450
is going to be equal to 625.

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:38.970
Subtract 225 from both sides you
get b squared is equal to 400,

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.620
and the square root of 400
is pretty easy to calculate.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.200
B is equal to 20.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:51.861
So segment OA is 25,
CD is 20, and OF is 22.
