- First of all, I'm from
Chicago, and, you know,

00:01:06.832 --> 00:01:08.601
and Chicago's known for a lot
of things,

00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:10.570
you know, hot dogs and pizza.

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:12.405
The Cubs won the World Series.

00:01:12.438 --> 00:01:15.908
And violence, a lot of fucking
violence.

00:01:15.941 --> 00:01:20.313
And my father is one of those
dudes who's from an old era.

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:22.215
Like, he wasn't a Black
Panther,

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:25.284
but he, like, in a gang that I
guess didn't really exist for--

00:01:25.317 --> 00:01:27.320
I don't know; I don't
necessarily believe in the shit

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:28.821
that he was in a real gang,

00:01:28.854 --> 00:01:30.723
but he was in one of those
earlier gangs,

00:01:30.756 --> 00:01:32.425
where they, like, made
breakfast for the community

00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:35.161
and walked people across the
street, that type of shit.

00:01:35.194 --> 00:01:36.762
[laughs]

00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:38.965
So...but true story, right?

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:41.100
So we grew up--I lived in a bad
neighborhood growing up,

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:42.835
you know, and most of the
neighborhoods--

00:01:42.868 --> 00:01:44.504
you decide you know a
neighborhood is bad

00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:46.939
when people will sit on
anybody's car.

00:01:46.972 --> 00:01:50.109
They don't give a fuck whose
car it is.

00:01:50.142 --> 00:01:52.178
You've got to humbly ask them,
"Excuse me.

00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:54.013
"I know y'all are just having a
good time drinking on my car,

00:01:54.046 --> 00:01:58.584
"but I need to go to work this
evening, so..."

00:01:58.617 --> 00:02:01.521
[laughter]

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:03.789
So I'm getting off the bus
one day,

00:02:03.822 --> 00:02:05.458
and I'm walking down the
street,

00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:07.093
and I see a bunch of dudes on
the car,

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:09.295
and I'm like, "Oh, fuck.
They're on my father's car."

00:02:09.328 --> 00:02:11.697
And I go upstairs, and I'm
going back and forth,

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.599
'cause he still thinks he can
take these young people.

00:02:13.632 --> 00:02:15.201
I don't fuckin' know why.

00:02:15.234 --> 00:02:17.203
See, I--and let me tell you,
I've got a '70s dad.

00:02:17.236 --> 00:02:19.105
I don't know if anybody ever
had a '70s father growing up.

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:21.174
Like, one of them cool
motherfuckers.

00:02:21.207 --> 00:02:23.476
Right, this is how my daddy
used to walk.

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:25.444
Just like this.
This is...

00:02:25.477 --> 00:02:27.013
[laughter]

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:28.648
Every time he talk, it was like
he had to pee.

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:30.216
"Hey, man, which one of you
suckers

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:31.617
takin' out the garbage?"
That's how he talked.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.821
So...
[laughs]

00:02:35.854 --> 00:02:37.690
For some reason, he still think
he's tough as shit,

00:02:37.723 --> 00:02:40.026
so I get in the house, and I'm
like, "All right,

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:41.694
"I'ma tell him they on his car,

00:02:41.727 --> 00:02:44.130
but I hope he don't do no extra
shit."

00:02:44.163 --> 00:02:46.732
So I'm like, "Hey, Dad, look,
now, before I tell you this,

00:02:46.765 --> 00:02:48.467
tell me you gonna chill out."

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.169
"You don't tell me what to do."
"Okay, never mind."

00:02:50.202 --> 00:02:53.573
[laughter]

00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:57.910
I'm like, "Look, it's a bunch
of dudes sitting on your car,

00:02:57.943 --> 00:03:01.180
right," so...
He's like, "Say what?"

00:03:01.213 --> 00:03:04.183
Right?

00:03:04.216 --> 00:03:06.552
I'm laughing, 'cause I ain't
told this story in a long time.

00:03:06.585 --> 00:03:08.554
And it's a true story.

00:03:08.587 --> 00:03:10.056
"Say what? Hold on.
Let me see."

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:12.892
So he walked
to the window cool as shit.

00:03:12.925 --> 00:03:14.527
Because he had
on some dress shoes,

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.429
so he slid over there
a little bit.

00:03:16.462 --> 00:03:21.234
[laughter]

00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:24.704
Oh, those suckers about to pay!
I'm like whoa, wait a minute.

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:28.874
So...
[laughs]

00:03:28.907 --> 00:03:30.610
So I'm like, look, man.

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:31.911
Dad, now,
I got to tell you this.

00:03:31.944 --> 00:03:35.047
These are
gangster disciples, okay?

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.551
They had a documentary on them
a few weeks ago

00:03:38.584 --> 00:03:40.052
on the Biography channel.

00:03:40.085 --> 00:03:41.287
I don't think you want to do
this shit.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.055
They will murder you.

00:03:43.088 --> 00:03:44.924
He's like, look here,
I ain't scared of no disciple!

00:03:44.957 --> 00:03:46.692
Okay, I was a Dragon.

00:03:46.725 --> 00:03:48.728
I'm like, what the fuck is a
Dragon? What?

00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:50.229
[laughter]

00:03:50.262 --> 00:03:52.298
You know how old your gang got
to be to--

00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:54.200
about some shit that's not even
real; you know what I mean?

00:03:54.233 --> 00:03:56.936
"I was a motherfucking
Dragon."

00:03:56.969 --> 00:04:01.107
I said, "Look, I heard you that
you was a Dragon and all."

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.942
He said, "Look here, man.
We was a gang and a band."

00:04:02.975 --> 00:04:07.113
"Wait, I don't give a fuck
if y'all was both things.

00:04:07.146 --> 00:04:09.782
This young dudes will murder
you out there."

00:04:09.815 --> 00:04:10.983
He said, "Let me tell you
something, okay?

00:04:11.016 --> 00:04:12.918
You don't believe me, do you?"

00:04:12.951 --> 00:04:14.086
I said, "It ain't that I don't
believe you a Dragon.

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:15.821
I just--it just...I mean, I

00:04:15.854 --> 00:04:17.056
just don't believe in
dragons."

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.659
That's what...
[laughs]

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:21.794
He said, "Look here, I got
something to prove it, okay?"

00:04:21.827 --> 00:04:24.263
So my mom was
in the kitchen cooking, right?

00:04:24.296 --> 00:04:28.901
He's like, "Hey baby, could you
get my Dragon jacket," right?

00:04:28.934 --> 00:04:30.936
And my mama smoked cigarettes,
so she was like,

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:32.438
[inhales] Which one,
the blue jean or the leather?

00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:34.507
Right, she in the
kitchen cooking.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.245
[laughter]

00:04:39.278 --> 00:04:42.281
So she goes and gets his,
she gets this dragon jacket,

00:04:42.314 --> 00:04:44.250
and it's not even
a jacket, right? It's a vest.

00:04:44.283 --> 00:04:46.452
It's really a dragon vest, but
he called it a jacket.

00:04:46.485 --> 00:04:47.853
I don't know why.

00:04:47.886 --> 00:04:49.121
The sleeves was
cut off the jacket,

00:04:49.154 --> 00:04:50.856
it was shingling
at the shoulders.

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:52.591
He had a big,
colorful dragon on the back,

00:04:52.624 --> 00:04:54.627
but kinda faded because
he washed it a couple times.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.796
And he had his real name, he
didn't even have a gang name.

00:04:56.829 --> 00:05:00.132
It said Milton on the front.
I'm like, you ain't got no...

00:05:00.165 --> 00:05:03.336
You ain't got
no damn gang name, Daddy?

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:06.339
"I didn't need one.
I was Milton on the bongos."

00:05:06.372 --> 00:05:07.807
Okay, whatever.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.843
So he put
on this Dragon jacket, right?

00:05:10.876 --> 00:05:12.345
Now, he done took
his whole shirt off.

00:05:12.378 --> 00:05:13.713
Because I guess they didn't
wear shirts

00:05:13.746 --> 00:05:15.381
with the vests at that time.

00:05:15.414 --> 00:05:16.649
So he took his shit off.

00:05:16.682 --> 00:05:18.317
Now he has all chest hair
showing.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.186
And he had this little chain in
the chest hair.

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:21.854
It was like a little cross.
I couldn't tell if it was

00:05:21.887 --> 00:05:23.556
a cross or--I don't know what
it was,

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:25.791
but he had--the chest hair was
all around a little charm

00:05:25.824 --> 00:05:27.293
he had on his chain.

00:05:27.326 --> 00:05:29.028
So he's got this Dragon jacket
on.

00:05:29.061 --> 00:05:30.529
And he started
getting ready, right?

00:05:30.562 --> 00:05:32.131
Which is weird because

00:05:32.164 --> 00:05:33.833
I ain't never seen nobody
get ready for a fight

00:05:33.866 --> 00:05:35.368
He said, go get the Old Spice.

00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:37.336
So he got some Old Spice,
put it on before a fight.

00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:39.538
I've never seen somebody put on
cologne before a fight.

00:05:39.571 --> 00:05:42.842
He just...

00:05:46.178 --> 00:05:48.347
[laughs]

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.683
So he's got this little-ass
fuckin' baby fat vest.

00:05:50.716 --> 00:05:52.852
That's really what it was.

00:05:52.885 --> 00:05:55.421
And he go down the stairs.

00:05:55.454 --> 00:05:57.523
So these little dudes
look at him come outside.

00:05:57.556 --> 00:06:00.025
He comes outside cool as shit.

00:06:00.058 --> 00:06:01.560
They looking at him like,

00:06:01.593 --> 00:06:03.162
Hey, man, who the fuck
is this old ass dude

00:06:03.195 --> 00:06:05.765
with this 'Warriors' outfit
on?"

00:06:05.798 --> 00:06:09.735
[laughter]

00:06:09.768 --> 00:06:11.370
He was like, "Look here
suckers,

00:06:11.403 --> 00:06:12.705
"I'm going to tell you who
I am right now.

00:06:12.738 --> 00:06:16.876
"My name is Milton.

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:19.044
"Milton Howery.

00:06:19.077 --> 00:06:21.680
"And that Cadillac
you're sitting on is mine.

00:06:21.713 --> 00:06:23.916
"I pay the payments," right,
and he going through

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:25.951
all this shit.

00:06:25.984 --> 00:06:27.453
They're like, "Man,
look here old man,

00:06:27.486 --> 00:06:29.388
"we don't want to beat
your ass and shit.

00:06:29.421 --> 00:06:31.624
You all by yourself."
He said, "Oh, I'm by myself?

00:06:31.657 --> 00:06:33.559
Jimmy on his way."

00:06:33.592 --> 00:06:36.896
Now, what I forgot
to tell y'all, he called Jimmy.

00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:40.933
Who's the only other
living Dragon left, right?

00:06:40.966 --> 00:06:43.803
[laughter]

00:06:43.836 --> 00:06:46.906
And Jimmy don't know what's
going on, right?

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:48.441
Jimmy didn't graduate from the
gangs.

00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:49.909
He's just a businessman that
drive a van

00:06:49.942 --> 00:06:53.112
with a Bluetooth on; that's it.

00:06:53.145 --> 00:06:56.916
So Jimmy pulls up
with this van, right?

00:06:56.949 --> 00:06:58.250
You could tell
it was an old ass van

00:06:58.283 --> 00:06:59.919
because it had
curtains on it.

00:06:59.952 --> 00:07:01.921
And he pull up,
and when he pull up,

00:07:01.954 --> 00:07:04.757
you can hear Billy Ocean
playing when he pull up.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.225
When he pull up,

00:07:06.258 --> 00:07:08.894
you hear "Caribbean Queen"
when he pull up.

00:07:08.927 --> 00:07:10.930
[laughter]

00:07:10.963 --> 00:07:14.133
My daddy walked to the car
like...

00:07:14.166 --> 00:07:16.402
So I'm looking at all this out
the window like...

00:07:16.435 --> 00:07:18.170
So I'm like, oh, God,
what's going on with my dad?

00:07:18.203 --> 00:07:19.772
He like, "Jimmy, look here.

00:07:19.805 --> 00:07:21.607
Okay, we about
to have a rumble."

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.576
And Jimmy old, like,
you ever see somebody so old

00:07:23.609 --> 00:07:25.611
they got to take off their
glasses just to hear you?

00:07:25.644 --> 00:07:29.014
[laughter]

00:07:29.047 --> 00:07:30.816
So my daddy's trying
to talk to Jimmy,

00:07:30.849 --> 00:07:32.785
"Look here, Jimmy, I'm trying
to tell you what's going on.

00:07:32.818 --> 00:07:34.820
He like "What?

00:07:34.853 --> 00:07:36.455
Say it again,
wait hold on, what?"

00:07:36.488 --> 00:07:38.257
[laughter]

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:41.494
"Wait a minute, you ain't say
nothing about no damn fight.

00:07:41.527 --> 00:07:43.128
"I thought it
was Spades Tuesday,

00:07:43.161 --> 00:07:45.164
"I thought we was
playing cards today.

00:07:45.197 --> 00:07:46.866
You on your own,
I'm done with the Dragons."

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:49.301
And he drove off.

00:07:49.334 --> 00:07:52.371
[laughs]

00:07:55.007 --> 00:07:56.675
I mean,
there ain't no punch line,

00:07:56.708 --> 00:07:59.845
so like, they beat the shit out
my daddy, all right?

00:07:59.878 --> 00:08:01.814
They beat him up and shit.

00:08:01.847 --> 00:08:03.148
And I was
like a little kid, you know?

00:08:03.181 --> 00:08:04.550
I don't know if anybody ever

00:08:04.583 --> 00:08:05.985
seen their daddy
get their ass whupped,

00:08:06.018 --> 00:08:07.353
but you ain't going to help it.

00:08:07.386 --> 00:08:09.555
You just yell out,
leave him alone!

00:08:09.588 --> 00:08:11.357
That's my father, yo!

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.993
You just mad because you ain't
got no daddy in your life.

00:08:14.026 --> 00:08:17.062
[laughter]

00:08:17.095 --> 00:08:21.066
Start crying. Leave him alone!

00:08:21.099 --> 00:08:22.968
All you saw was
my father's vest in the street,

00:08:23.001 --> 00:08:26.071
and cars driving over the vest.

00:08:26.104 --> 00:08:28.307
My mama, she walked
up to me like,

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:31.043
[inhales] Look here.
[clears throat]

00:08:31.076 --> 00:08:32.545
Go get your daddy's vest

00:08:32.578 --> 00:08:35.014
and bring it back upstairs,
I'll go wash it.

00:08:35.047 --> 00:08:37.516
And that's what happened,
y'all, that's it.

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:41.687
Thank y'all. Love y'all.
That's my time.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.155
<i> - Lil Rel Howery, y'all.</i>

00:08:43.188 --> 00:08:46.125
<i> [cheers and applause]</i>
