JASON CRANE: Good afternoon,
and welcome to Zagat Guest

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.270
Chefs at Google.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.380
My name is Jason Crane.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.410
And it's my pleasure to welcome
Laura Werlin here today.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.350
Laura Werlin is the James Beard
Foundation award-winning author

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.860
of six books on cheese.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.550
She is a sought after speaker
at food and wine events

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.090
across the country and is
a champion of all things

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.490
American cheese.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.410
Laura is a frequent
teacher at the Cheese

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.510
School of San Francisco, a
local and national television

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.520
and radio guest,
a freelance writer

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.520
for several publications,
including "Food &amp; Wine

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.470
Magazine," and a wildly
passionate educator

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.492
about the basics of
cheese and wine pairing.

00:00:35.492 --> 00:00:37.450
So thank you very much
for coming today, Laura.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.120
I appreciate having you.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.870
LAURA WERLIN: Oh, I
appreciate being here.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:40.600
Thank you.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.370
JASON CRANE: Do you want
to give us a little bit

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.279
of your background,
and then we'll--

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:44.070
LAURA WERLIN: Yeah.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.700
Well, so as you said, I've
written six books about cheese.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.400
And prior to that actually,
I wasn't in cheese at all.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.160
I was in TV news.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.000
I wasn't on camera.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I was behind the scenes.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.170
But I always, always,
always loved food.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.720
And I always wrote
about it on the side.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.920
So I would take trips,
and I would say,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.930
today we saw the Eiffel Tower.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.800
And that'd be like
one little paragraph,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.970
and 15 pages later
is what we ate.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.000
So I decided that I wanted
to go into food writing.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.510
And then, not long
after that, I wanted

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.450
to write about cheese
because it was something

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.830
that I loved, and
also specifically

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.030
American cheese because
what I noticed, living here

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.560
in northern
California, that there

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.942
were these amazing
cheeses being made here.

00:01:27.942 --> 00:01:29.650
And I wanted to bring
attention to those.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.220
But then what I realized is
that what was happening here

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.500
in northern California was
happening all over the country.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.490
And I thought, I'm going to
write about American cheese.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.620
I need to tell the story.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.090
And I felt like we were kind
on the cusp of an evolution,

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.970
or revolution really, with
cheesemaking in this country.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.860
And that book came
out 14 years ago.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.690
So in fact, that's kind
of what's happening

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.210
is American cheese
making has exploded.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.900
JASON CRANE: Yeah,
it really has.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.900
So that kind of leads me
into my first question.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.260
So six books on cheese.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.140
What about cheese keeps
drawing you back over and over

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.290
to write these cookbooks?

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.070
And as we were discussing
a little bit at lunch,

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.049
two of them are
on grilled cheese.

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:12.090
LAURA WERLIN: Yeah, yeah.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.490
Well, what keeps drawing me
back to cheese is cheese itself.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.550
I got into in the
first place really

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.030
because it got into me
because I love cheese.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.110
And I always have,
ever since I was just

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.810
the tiniest little kid.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.340
In fact, my first memory
is of a grilled cheese

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.780
sandwich, my first food memory.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.980
That and Cheerios, I think.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.815
But one of the neat
things about cheese

00:02:33.815 --> 00:02:36.900
is that it's not a
subject you can really

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.850
master because it's so complex.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:42.840
It's kind of like wine.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.880
If you love wine, you
don't really tire of it.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.370
You don't tire of
learning about it

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.110
because there's so much to know.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.410
And cheese is the same way.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.370
And what I've learned
over the years

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.030
is that there are so many
different kinds of cheeses.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.756
And now, in the US,
so many new kinds

00:02:58.756 --> 00:03:00.630
of cheeses because there
are new cheesemakers

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.920
popping up everywhere
and all the time.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.800
And so every time I take a
bite of cheese or every time

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.740
I see cheese being
made, I learn so much.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.610
And so it's never
boring, and it's

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.030
so fundamentally
satisfying to me

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.670
to eat a really great
piece of cheese.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.240
So I can't imagine
ever tiring of it.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.360
JASON CRANE: I
agree 100% with you.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.210
I haven't had a cheese
I haven't liked yet.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.043
LAURA WERLIN: Right.

00:03:28.043 --> 00:03:30.890
Well, I've met a couple
cheeses I haven't liked.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.455
But as a category,
I like cheese a lot.

00:03:34.455 --> 00:03:35.330
JASON CRANE: Awesome.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.480
So today we were working from
your "Mac &amp; Cheese, Please!"

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.080
book.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.170
And they were doing some
mac and cheeses here

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.209
in the cafe for the Googlers
to come through and eat.

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.500
And we started talking about
comfort food a little bit.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.208
And I kind of wanted
to get your thoughts

00:03:50.208 --> 00:03:52.380
on what you thought
comfort food was,

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.440
and what's
specifically about mac

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.120
and cheese and grilled
cheese that just really fits

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.160
that comfort food model.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.570
LAURA WERLIN: Well, I think that
comfort food is comfort food

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.320
because it evokes a memory
without even thinking about it.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.580
It's subconscious.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.590
So you have this just
visceral response

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.990
to a food that makes you think
of home, whatever that is,

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.310
or something really,
really positive.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.435
Comfort food does not
evoke a negative thought.

00:04:22.435 --> 00:04:22.935
Right?

00:04:22.935 --> 00:04:23.780
JASON CRANE: Right

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.738
LAURA WERLIN: Because
then it's not comforting.

00:04:25.738 --> 00:04:26.590
Right?

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.720
And a big bubbling
cauldron of mac and cheese,

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.540
it might not be
gourmet mac and cheese.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.400
It's probably, in fact, if
it evokes those memories,

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.910
it's probably not that.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.070
It's probably something
that was in a pot that

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.410
might have even
come out of a box.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.390
And grilled cheese
is the same way.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.475
In both cases, both mac and
cheese and grilled cheese--

00:04:49.475 --> 00:04:51.350
Actually, I really feel
this way particularly

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.780
about grilled cheese.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.420
--it hits all the senses.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.960
So you've got this aroma when
grilled cheese is being made.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.870
And then you have
texture because you've

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:06.230
got this crunchy bread, and
you've got this gooey cheese.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:13.010
Then you also have the
visual because something

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.790
is priming you.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.320
When you look at
that, when you see

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.820
that cheese oozing and the
crunchy bread and all that,

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.190
you just kind of know it's
going to be pretty fantastic.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.450
Right?

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.260
And then, of course, the aroma.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.090
Did I say that?

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.460
And then you've got,
of course, flavor.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.560
Right?

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.660
So it hits just all of
those parts of ourselves

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:40.010
that are fundamental
to being human beings.

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.700
And then, add to that the
component of memory, which

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.180
I think a lot of
people have memories

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.150
of both mac and cheese
and grilled cheese

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.774
as kids, mostly positive.

00:05:51.774 --> 00:05:54.190
Although I have to be honest,
I didn't like mac and cheese

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.480
as a kid.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.410
I didn't like
noodles of any kind.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.030
And that changed.

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.910
But it's a positive memory.

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.960
And I don't think
there's any way

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.880
to separate food from
memory, particularly when

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.730
it's positive.

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:11.820
And there really isn't.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.990
And so that's why some
people say they still

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.270
prefer mac and cheese out
of the box in some ways,

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.800
even though they're
grown ups now,

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.940
and they love great
cheese and all that.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.424
It's because you can't fight
with mom or at least whatever

00:06:25.424 --> 00:06:26.590
the memory is that you have.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.340
JASON CRANE: Exactly.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.860
Yeah.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.210
As far as texture goes, I
always put too much cheese

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.127
in my grilled cheeses.

00:06:33.127 --> 00:06:34.626
LAURA WERLIN: Is
there a such thing?

00:06:34.626 --> 00:06:37.580
JASON CRANE: That cheese that
spills out and then gets crispy

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.280
on the bottom of the pan
right next to the sandwich.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.330
LAURA WERLIN: Yeah, Yeah.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.270
JASON CRANE: That's one
of my favorite parts

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.080
of the grilled cheese.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.250
LAURA WERLIN: Well,
that's why I recommend

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.166
when you make a grilled
cheese sandwich to use

00:06:47.166 --> 00:06:50.080
a non-stick pan because
for just that reason.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.710
Because who wants to
have to wash it off?

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:53.980
You want to eat it off?

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:54.480
Right?

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.610
JASON CRANE: Before the
sandwich is even done.

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.360
LAURA WERLIN: Before
the sandwich is done.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.365
It's a snack.

00:06:58.365 --> 00:07:00.490
JASON CRANE: So while we're
talking about the book,

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.410
what recipe in the
book was your favorite

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.090
to eat and do the
research on and cook?

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.660
LAURA WERLIN: Oh gosh.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.744
That's kind of akin to
asking your favorite child.

00:07:09.744 --> 00:07:10.243
Right?

00:07:10.243 --> 00:07:12.420
Of course I don't have
children, so that parts easy.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.480
I don't have to choose.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.640
But yeah, with the mac and
cheese, one of my favorites,

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.670
I do really have a few in there.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:22.620
But one of my
favorites is one that I

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:28.350
call butternut squash and
Gruyere mac and cheese.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:30.860
So what you do is you
roast the butternut squash,

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.750
and then you kind of
mash it and add that

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.400
to the cream and cheese.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.840
And then you make a sage butter.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.660
So you take fresh sage leaves
and just fry them real quickly

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.760
in butter, and then all of that
goes into the mac and cheese

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.259
too.

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:45.995
So it's a really, really
wonderful fall dish.

00:07:45.995 --> 00:07:50.650
Plus you've got the orange
color from the butternut squash.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.580
And then there are
these bread crumbs

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.660
that are mixed with
Parmesan on top.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.680
So you got the crunch, and
you've got the cheesiness,

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.520
and you've got the visual.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.280
And it's great on a
Thanksgiving table.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.890
And even though,
of course, there

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:06.850
are a few other foods on
the Thanksgiving table.

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:11.570
But it kind of almost takes the
place of stuffing, not quite.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:14.422
But it works really
well side by side.

00:08:14.422 --> 00:08:16.630
JASON CRANE: So cheese has
come a long way in America

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.610
over the last 10,
15 years since you

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.260
wrote your first book on it.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.182
Can we talk a little bit
about some of the changes

00:08:24.182 --> 00:08:25.890
that have happened to
the cheese industry

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:29.479
and where Americans have come
in their taste for cheese?

00:08:29.479 --> 00:08:30.270
LAURA WERLIN: Yeah.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:31.555
Yeah.

00:08:31.555 --> 00:08:33.679
When I was saying before
about there being a cheese

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:38.240
revolution in America,
that kind of cuts

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.590
across all swaths of cheese.

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:43.820
And so what I mean by that is
that the American cheesemaker

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.890
has evolved.

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:48.560
Even what we call
cheese has evolved.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.990
So when I was first
writing about this,

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:53.540
or researching it
actually, 15 years ago,

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.940
I took myself to the
annual conference

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.711
of the American Cheese Society.

00:08:57.711 --> 00:08:59.210
And at the time,
they have something

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:00.510
called the Festival of Cheese.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.460
And I went around, and I tasted.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.640
They had maybe 300 cheeses out.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.810
And I got to about 299 of them.

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:12.720
That 300th jalapeno cheddar
I just couldn't get to.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.330
But the point is that there
were not that many cheeses.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.630
And those that were there were
a lot of the flavored ones, not

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:20.000
so fabulous cheeses.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.650
There were several
that were good though.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:27.140
And now, that same conference,
it's held annually,

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:32.640
has almost 1,800 cheeses
at that same festival.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.190
And it isn't just a
matter of quantity.

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:36.600
It's also quality.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.870
So the cheese
itself has evolved.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:43.880
The skill of the cheesemaker
has evolved tremendously.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.820
And there's been
attrition as well.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.280
So some of the
cheesemakers that were

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.330
doing things the same way
for a generation or two--

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.250
We don't have a long
tradition of cheesemaking

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:54.210
in this country.

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:57.070
--but for those who were,
either were phased out

00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:59.000
or they had to step
up to the plate

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.330
and revise their cheesemaking
methods that they've

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.850
been doing for 20 or
40 or 60 years, however

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:08.770
many generations, because the
American palate was evolving.

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:10.580
And that jalapeno cheddar--

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.330
Not that there's
anything wrong with that.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:16.450
I mean, there's certain
flavored cheeses I really like.

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:19.430
--it just didn't cut
the mustard as it were.

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:22.590
And then also what
we name cheeses.

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:26.010
So if you think about the
evolution of American wine,

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:29.630
wine drinkers in
America, for a long time,

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:32.370
looked down their
nose at American wine.

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:36.370
They thought, no, the real stuff
comes from France, maybe Italy.

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:38.490
And that's where they
looked to get their wine.

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:40.610
And little by
little, it was clear

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:43.720
that California wine
was pretty darn good.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.970
And of course, we now know
that that's well established.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:52.740
But in addition to looking
within our own borders

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:57.680
for wine, the winemakers here
started naming their wines--

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.070
Originally, they were
Burgundy and Chablis,

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:04.400
which those are
regions in France.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.250
And they mean nothing to us.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:10.230
--So the American winemakers
started calling their wines

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:12.610
Chardonnay and Pinot
Noir, after the grape

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:14.370
with which it was made.

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:19.240
So originally,
American cheesemakers

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.660
were naming their cheeses
after some sort of loose recipe

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.120
they were making, based
on an old world cheese,

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.750
like Gruyere or something.

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:29.150
The problem was that the
American consumer would

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:32.690
eat that so-called Gruyere,
and it tasted nothing

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:34.760
like the Swiss version.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:38.830
So little by little, American
cheesemakers realized

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:41.030
that they were doing
themselves no service

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:43.020
by naming their cheeses
after the old world

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:47.630
versions, to which there's
was not even similar.

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:51.484
So now, they name them
anything, like after the lane

00:11:51.484 --> 00:11:53.900
on which they live or the creek
nearby, or whatever it is,

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:57.790
which is slightly confusing
for the American consumer

00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:59.900
because it's hard to remember.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.610
By the same token,
it distinguishes

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:04.630
those cheesemakers,
as it should.

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:08.160
And it also changed the
consumer's expectation

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.510
of what that cheese is.

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:13.054
If they read that
it's My Farm's Cheese,

00:12:13.054 --> 00:12:14.470
they're not going
to try to fit it

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:17.290
in any box of the
cheese they've had

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:19.330
previously that
might be similar.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.670
They just accept it on its face.

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:27.114
And so that's been, I
think, a really big change

00:12:27.114 --> 00:12:28.530
in terms of American
cheesemaking.

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:31.720
And the other thing is that
American cheesemakers are not

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.230
bound by tradition.

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:34.400
Good news, bad news.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.530
So what that means is that
we have had to learn--

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:39.860
I mean, I'm not a
cheesemaker, but collectively.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:44.430
--have had to learn skills
that were not passed down

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.840
the way they had been
for hundreds of years

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.090
in the old world.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:50.590
And that's the good
news and the bad news.

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:55.390
So in a way, they're inventing
the wheel here, which is good.

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:57.450
But there's a big
learning curve.

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:00.640
But on the other hand, they
come up with these recipes

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.230
that no old world,
traditional cheesemaker,

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:07.330
who was bound by tradition,
would ever think to make.

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.750
So we're the really, those
of us that love cheese,

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:12.912
are the lucky
beneficiaries of that.

00:13:12.912 --> 00:13:14.370
JASON CRANE: So
while we're talking

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.027
about all these types
of cheese, there

00:13:16.027 --> 00:13:17.860
are so many that can
be really intimidating.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.901
And you were just talking
a little bit about this

00:13:19.901 --> 00:13:22.900
with a lot of it's not grounded.

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:23.870
We know our cheddar.

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:25.360
We know our swiss.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.260
But what is Redwood
Hill Camellia?

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.060
There's no connection to
anything real in that.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:34.500
And how do we, as
consumers and eaters,

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.300
get over some of
that Intimidation?

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:40.040
LAURA WERLIN: Well, part
of it is just to be brave.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.290
Be brave with your cheese.

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:42.540
It won't bite back.

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:44.124
Well, most of the time anyway.

00:13:44.124 --> 00:13:46.540
That stuff that's sitting in
the back of your refrigerator

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:48.480
that has green mold
on it, maybe not.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.010
But the rest of it.

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:53.200
So it really is about getting
it in your mouth, tasting it.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.300
And what that requires
is going to a store,

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:59.000
could be Whole Foods or it could
be a cheese shop, where they're

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.640
willing to give you samples.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.210
Beyond that though,
I did write a book

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:05.090
called Cheese Essentials.

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:08.660
And in that, what I talk about
are the styles of cheese.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:11.440
So familiarizing
yourself with styles.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.590
What does that mean?

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:13.590
A fresh cheese.

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:18.125
So that can be ricotta
product or fresh goat cheese

00:14:18.125 --> 00:14:19.240
or something like that.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.970
If you know the
basic characteristics

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:23.840
of a fresh cheese, then
you can look in the case

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.490
and say, OK, I think
I know that this

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:27.510
is going to be not too salty.

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:29.010
It's going to be a
little bit tangy.

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:31.100
It's going to be a
little milk-like,

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:33.470
the milk from which it came.

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:34.630
A soft, ripened cheese.

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:38.980
Another word, really a
fancy description for brie.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:41.260
So that's the kind that
has the white, bloomy rind.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.110
If you know you like brie,
next time you go to the store,

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:45.350
don't buy brie.

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:47.330
Buy a cheese that
looks like brie,

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:50.570
and expand your horizons,
because chances are it's

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:53.240
not going to be so very
different from that brie

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.247
that you like.

00:14:54.247 --> 00:14:55.830
And the worst case
scenario is that it

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:57.580
isn't as good as the
one that you like,

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:00.270
so then at least you've
branched out a little bit.

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:01.650
JASON CRANE: A
frame of reference

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:02.700
for the next cheese you try.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:03.650
LAURA WERLIN: Exactly.

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:06.980
I also recommend trying cheeses
side by side, the same style.

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.860
So buy three blue cheeses
if you like blue cheese.

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:11.360
Of course, don't
do it if you don't.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.270
Or three cheddars.

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:16.460
And you can recognize
the difference in flavor,

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:19.300
in texture, and see
what appeals to you.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:22.110
And the more you do
that, the more familiar

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:23.900
you're going to become
with those styles.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.400
And what that means is
that you can go to Paris

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.479
and go to a cheese shop there.

00:15:28.479 --> 00:15:31.020
And you can look and say, hey,
that's a soft, ripened cheese.

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:33.300
I know that because I can
just look at that white ,

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.720
so-called bloomy rind, and I
don't care that I don't read

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.230
French or that I don't
know that producer.

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.080
I'm going to try that.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:44.120
And it's important to
know the milk source,

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:47.330
to know that if you do or don't
like goats milk, for instance.

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:51.990
But beyond that, once you learn
those styles or conversely

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:54.850
a style that a
lot of people have

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:56.520
either an attraction
or an avoidance

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.010
to is called a
washed rind cheese.

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:01.215
So that has the
orangish kind of rind.

00:16:01.215 --> 00:16:03.510
They're kind of sticky,
and they're very creamy.

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:08.450
So a cheese like Taleggio or
Epoisse from France or Red

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:12.680
Hawk from Cowgirl Creamery
here in California.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.290
They will stink up
your refrigerator

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:16.270
almost instantaneously.

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:17.270
And they smell.

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:18.870
They kind of are
counterintuitive.

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:20.500
You think, why would
I eat something

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.710
that smells like old gym socks?

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:27.627
But in fact, if you like
that style of cheese,

00:16:27.627 --> 00:16:28.460
they're really good.

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:29.540
And I do too.

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:33.030
But if you don't, that's an
entire section of the cheese

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:36.490
store that you can just say,
mm-mm, don't want to go there.

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:39.460
And so once you know
that that's the style,

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:44.770
then you can go or not
go depending on that.

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.600
So it's really about
learning styles.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.160
I mean, yes, cheeses
vary within styles.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.890
So a semi-hard category of
cheeses, you've got cheddar

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:56.200
and you've got Gruyere,
and you've got Emmentaler,

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.750
like the quintessential
sort of Swiss cheese.

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:02.590
Those are very different
from each other.

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:05.470
But some of the
characteristics are similar.

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:08.060
They melt well.

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.193
And really the only way to
know though is to taste.

00:17:10.193 --> 00:17:10.859
JASON CRANE: OK.

00:17:10.859 --> 00:17:14.354
So just be adventurous, and
get out there and keep trying.

00:17:14.354 --> 00:17:15.145
LAURA WERLIN: Yeah.

00:17:15.145 --> 00:17:17.109
And like I said,
don't be intimidated.

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:20.780
Because I do understand
people's reluctance

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:26.250
because it could be a
strong smelling food.

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:30.570
But I just think that people
should be a little bit braver

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:32.410
because most cheeses
really aren't going

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:35.490
to be as strong as they
smell, no matter what.

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:39.350
And I think that people
are going to be pleasantly

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:40.600
surprised more times than not.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:43.141
JASON CRANE: What are some uses
for cheeses that we might not

00:17:43.141 --> 00:17:44.780
have thought about
that someone who's

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.990
done all this research can?

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:51.400
LAURA WERLIN: Well, one
of the things about cheese

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.422
is it is very versatile.

00:17:52.422 --> 00:17:54.880
Obviously, there are the things
that we have thought about,

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.380
those that we've
talked about today,

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:58.750
and we all know
on top of a pizza.

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:02.260
In fact, more cheese is sold
in this country than any other,

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.190
I mean more mozzarella, because
it lands on top of a pizza.

00:18:07.492 --> 00:18:09.450
And there's nothing wrong
with that by the way.

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:10.860
Although I like burrata.

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.060
Mix it up a little.

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:16.720
Anyway, you can make ice cream.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.970
I recently had brie ice cream.

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:19.880
I did not make it, but I had it.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.140
And did I love it?

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:21.810
No.

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:24.597
But it just goes to show
that cheese is versatile.

00:18:24.597 --> 00:18:26.180
And other people at
my table loved it,

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:27.221
and I thought, all right.

00:18:27.221 --> 00:18:28.580
Well, whatever.

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:31.500
But cheese and chocolate
are really, really,

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.190
really compatible.

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:36.070
And blue cheese in particular
and dark chocolate,

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:37.700
add a little candied
ginger, and you've

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.680
got this confection that
is just this dessert that's

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.840
like a cheese course,
but it's a dessert course

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.120
that's all in one.

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.200
And some people might
not think so much

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.780
of pairing cheese and chocolate.

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:50.080
I've met many people along
the way that love cheese,

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.288
and they love chocolate,
but they haven't necessarily

00:18:52.288 --> 00:18:53.830
thought of putting
them together.

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:55.750
But you should.

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:58.900
And part of it, if you
think about eating trends

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.600
right now, particularly
chocolate or desserts

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.940
in general, there's a lot
of salt now that we find.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:07.420
You know, salted caramel,
salted chocolate.

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:08.405
So why not cheese?

00:19:08.405 --> 00:19:12.130
Because that's got that
savory, salty component.

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:14.370
Or a smoked cheese
and chocolate.

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:17.690
Sometimes you'll see smoked
salt on chocolate, same idea.

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:20.010
But you've got texture
going on there too.

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:23.270
So beyond that, I don't know.

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:24.970
I suppose you could
use certain cheeses

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:27.900
to like plug a whole or
something in your sink.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.010
I don't know.

00:19:31.392 --> 00:19:33.100
I don't know what else
I would use cheese

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:35.299
for other than
mostly the obvious.

00:19:35.299 --> 00:19:35.840
I don't know.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:36.954
Can you think of anything?

00:19:36.954 --> 00:19:39.120
JASON CRANE: You nailed a
couple of good ones there.

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:43.810
But usually cheese doesn't
make it much past the knife

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:46.230
that I cut it off
the block with.

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:48.020
That's usually most of the time.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:51.260
If it makes it onto a
nice everything cracker,

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.590
I'm like that's
double bonus round.

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:55.180
LAURA WERLIN:
Right, right, right.

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.687
Or if it's a creamy
cheese, it doesn't even

00:19:57.687 --> 00:19:58.520
get on to a cracker.

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.396
It just stays on my spoon.

00:20:00.396 --> 00:20:01.770
And I do use a
spoon, not a knife

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:03.060
when it's a creamy cheese.

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:05.160
But that is another
thing though.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.720
I think sometimes we overthink
how cheese should be used here

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:11.600
because it is something
that we celebrate

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.750
and something that
we revere really.

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:16.900
I think sometimes
we overthink it,

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:19.950
and then that's part of
the intimidation factor.

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:25.040
So I actually taught
a class last night,

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.170
and somebody was asking
me when to serve cheese.

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:28.060
Before dinner?

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.835
After dinner?

00:20:29.835 --> 00:20:30.680
JASON CRANE: Both

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.070
LAURA WERLIN:
Well, yeah or both?

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.640
Right.

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:36.420
Well, there is a place for
it at both ends of the meal.

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:39.000
And what I found
is that you just

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.430
don't want to
overwhelm people with--

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:44.020
I mean, what happens is if
you serve it beforehand,

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:45.371
people go crazy with it.

00:20:45.371 --> 00:20:45.870
Right?

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.820
For one, that's when
they're hungriest.

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:53.850
But two, it's always exciting
to have a selection of cheeses.

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:57.390
And then you eat dinner, and
then you have cheese again,

00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:59.130
maybe, and then you're full.

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:01.340
And everybody blames the cheese.

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:02.659
Well, I'm sorry.

00:21:02.659 --> 00:21:04.700
What about those short
ribs and that caesar salad

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.050
and everything else you ate?

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:09.470
But so what I try
to do is I might

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:11.640
have one cheese after dinner.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:15.140
But it's a cheese that
I've really sought out,

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:16.650
I think is really special.

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:18.400
And then I'll put an
accompaniment with it

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.360
that I think is
really complementary.

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.360
And there might
be a dessert wine

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:25.350
or it might be the wine that was
with the main course at dinner

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:28.650
that we just carry over,
or whatever it might be.

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:30.750
So having one
cheese after dinner

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:33.590
is, I think, a
different use for cheese

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:34.990
than most people think of.

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:39.060
But I will tell you, having
done this more than once, when

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:41.730
people, if they call you
the next day to thank you

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:45.140
for the dinner party, which
hopefully they've done,

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:47.870
then they will always
say, oh my god.

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:49.780
What was that cheese?

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:52.750
Not wow, the whole
rest of the meal

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:55.470
that you made that you
spent hours or days making

00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:56.870
was so fabulous.

00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:59.510
I love the cheese you bought.

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:01.030
I'm like, thanks.

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:05.490
But so really that's a way
to make cheese special.

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:11.050
And you're not investing your
life savings in it either.

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:13.310
And that's also a
really great way to go.

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:15.340
JASON CRANE: Yeah,
that's a great idea.

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:16.410
My wife's a pastry chef.

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:17.910
There's always that
whenever there's

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:19.980
a cheese course
available, I'd rather

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:23.520
have cheese for dessert
than actual dessert most

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.250
of the time.

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:25.120
LAURA WERLIN: A lot
of people would.

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.180
And you know what, it's
also a helpful thing

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:31.310
as people go gluten
free more and more.

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:34.530
So many desserts have gluten
in some way, shape, or form.

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:37.000
And also for
diabetics too, cheese

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.670
is a wonderful alternative.

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:40.790
And I've found that
over the years,

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:46.260
that people that have health
reasons for not eating sweets

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:48.430
just love the fact that the
cheese course is finally

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:50.920
making its way onto
the American table.

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:51.510
JASON CRANE: So let's
talk a little bit

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:53.926
about actually getting in and
making these mac and cheeses

00:22:53.926 --> 00:22:56.860
a little bit here and some
of the technical details.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.600
There's a section in your book
where you go through and give

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.920
us the lowdown on some of the
ingredients and the correct way

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:03.420
to use them.

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.460
So my first question
about this is,

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:08.170
why does the fat content in the
milk you use matter so much?

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:12.350
And what do you find is the best
either milk or mixture of dairy

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:14.930
products that really
bring that sauce together?

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:18.240
LAURA WERLIN: Well,
you know, writing a mac

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.960
and cheese book was definitely
an exercise in indulgence.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.200
I will not kid you.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:26.470
But I did write a chapter
called, Lighten Up, Cool Down.

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:30.920
So the rest of the book
celebrates cream and whole milk

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:31.590
and all of that.

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:34.040
But that chapter,
I used skim milk

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:37.330
for the most part, a
little bit of low fat too.

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:40.160
The issue there is it's tricky.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:43.365
When you have a lower
fat or no fat milk,

00:23:43.365 --> 00:23:46.100
the cheese has a
tendency to curdle.

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:50.280
And you have to add
the milk really slowly.

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.530
And add the milk,
I mean to a flour--

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:53.936
JASON CRANE: To
your roux, right?

00:23:53.936 --> 00:23:56.310
LAURA WERLIN: Yeah, to the
roux, the butter/flour mixture

00:23:56.310 --> 00:24:00.850
or oil/flour, olive oil.

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:02.200
So you add the milk slowly.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.490
And you do it over a lower heat.

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:06.670
And hopefully the
cheese won't curdle.

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:09.290
The other component,
when I mentioned flour,

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:13.210
that's crucial when you're
using a lower fat or nonfat milk

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:17.340
because it basically keeps the
proteins from matting together

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:21.750
to curdle, which in the presence
of starch that's what happens.

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:24.470
JASON CRANE: There's not
enough fat to get in the way.

00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:25.445
LAURA WERLIN: Yeah.

00:24:25.445 --> 00:24:27.820
JASON CRANE: With whole milk
fats, you have all that fat.

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:28.990
And the cheese has fat.

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:30.600
And then you block that.

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.570
LAURA WERLIN: That's
exactly right.

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:33.510
So you can do it.

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:36.110
It's just trickier to cook with.

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:38.530
But in terms of just
the voluptuousness

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:41.710
I think that we think
of for mac and cheese,

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:44.610
I really do like to
have a full fat--

00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:45.910
You don't have to use cream.

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:47.332
Whole milk is great.

00:24:47.332 --> 00:24:49.290
I mean, this is one of
the things I've learned.

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:51.220
It's very forgiving.

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:54.540
You can use different
variety of milks or just one,

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:55.670
and you're going to be OK.

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:57.128
But I do think that
there should be

00:24:57.128 --> 00:24:59.540
just a little fat in there
somewhere for flavor,

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:04.760
but also just so that your
mac and cheese will work.

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:05.300
What else?

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:06.011
Oh, yeah.

00:25:06.011 --> 00:25:08.260
Also, of course you know you
want to grate the cheese.

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:10.259
Some people believe that
when you add the cheese

00:25:10.259 --> 00:25:14.220
to that bechamel, to that white
sauce, that you should do it

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:16.280
off the heat.

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.582
And there are reasons for that.

00:25:17.582 --> 00:25:19.540
Although, I found that
I didn't really have to.

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:24.200
I just put it in, stirred it
until it melted, and then you

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.240
add the cooked pasta
and go from there,

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.580
whatever other ingredients.

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.200
JASON CRANE: I think
that comes into if you're

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:36.830
bechamel is screaming hot,
you could break the cheese.

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:39.690
But if you're at a
mid-range temperature,

00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:41.530
it doesn't really have
to come off the heat.

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:43.640
It kind of just depends
on your cooking method.

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.098
LAURA WERLIN: That's
exactly right.

00:25:45.098 --> 00:25:45.760
Yeah.

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.980
And if it's the whole
thing does break,

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:53.429
meaning separates and curdles,
then it's so disappointing.

00:25:53.429 --> 00:25:54.720
JASON CRANE: It's a sad moment.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:55.030
LAURA WERLIN: Yeah.

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:56.230
It is a sad moment.

00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:57.660
Yeah.

00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:00.010
JASON CRANE: So talk
about the different kind

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:02.490
of cheeses and where
to use them in the mac.

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:04.700
LAURA WERLIN: Well, I
was going to say also

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:07.530
one of the things
about mac and cheese,

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:11.210
and grilled cheese too,
it's kind of a blank canvas.

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:13.150
You can paint it with
whatever ingredients

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:14.570
you might have on hand.

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:18.080
Or if you're at the farmer's
market, and you see broccoli,

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.480
you think how does broccoli
work in the mac and cheese?

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.360
But what I did, I
made a broccoli.

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:26.640
I did a rip on broccoli
cheddar casserole

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.930
with the mac and cheese.

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:30.650
So instead, you can use
the canned, fried onions

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:31.740
that are typically on top.

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:31.960
Right.

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:32.290
JASON CRANE: Delicious.

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:33.081
LAURA WERLIN: Yeah.

00:26:33.081 --> 00:26:36.080
But I happened to provide a
recipe for fried shallots.

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:38.720
They're super simple, but
you don't have to use them.

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.050
But they're great.

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:41.680
And then the broccoli
and the cheddar,

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:45.090
and a little cayenne,
a little spice, but all

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:48.350
with the macaroni,
it's a great way to go.

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:53.570
But in terms of the cheeses
that you use for mac and cheese,

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:55.720
as with grilled cheese,
essentially any cheese

00:26:55.720 --> 00:27:00.700
will work, but they
work in different ways.

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:03.040
So a very hard
cheese, like Parmesan,

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.790
that's not going
to be oozy, gooey.

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:05.470
Right?

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:06.760
So what you use that for--

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:07.869
Or pecorino.

00:27:07.869 --> 00:27:09.660
--you might mix that
with some bread crumbs

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:10.810
and put them right on top.

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:14.060
So you get that toasty,
nutty kind of cheesy flavor.

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:16.110
But again, you're
looking for that crunch.

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:20.310
You're not looking for the pull.

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:23.690
And then say you want to
use brie or blue cheese.

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:27.220
Those get creamy, but
they don't get stretchy.

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:30.040
So what I like to do is I'll
put a creamy cheese like that,

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:31.770
or goat cheese, in
a mac and cheese,

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:34.680
but then I also add
a pullable cheese,

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:38.080
like a mozzarella or something
or Gruyere or whatever,

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.780
something like
that because I like

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:41.280
to have a little
bit of that stretch

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:44.140
with mac and cheese, as well
as, again, grilled cheese.

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:48.845
So really any cheese will lend
itself to a mac and cheese.

00:27:48.845 --> 00:27:52.660
It just depends on the
results you're looking for

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:54.580
and, of course, the flavor.

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:56.680
And I mentioned brie
in this context.

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:59.880
That's one of those cheeses,
when it has a rind like that,

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.090
you want to cut that
off because that

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:03.640
doesn't melt in the same way.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:06.394
It becomes like little paper
pieces, which is not so great.

00:28:06.394 --> 00:28:08.310
JASON CRANE: Let me just
put that on a cracker

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:10.110
and just eat the rind while
you're making the cheese.

00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:11.310
LAURA WERLIN:
Well, I'm with you.

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:13.643
I'm glad to hear you say that
because so many people are

00:28:13.643 --> 00:28:15.000
so afraid of the rind.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.860
And I don't know about you,
but I've gone to many parties

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:19.270
where there's this
wheel of brie.

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:20.760
And everybody digs
out the center.

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.010
JASON CRANE: It's all dug out.

00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:23.660
LAURA WERLIN: Don't do that.

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:26.800
Just cut the whole
piece that you want.

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.030
Put it on your napkin.

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:30.050
You can dig it out yourself.

00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:32.107
And wrap the rest
up, and I don't

00:28:32.107 --> 00:28:33.690
care, put it under
your host's pillow.

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:35.064
Just don't leave
it on the table.

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:41.110
JASON CRANE: So the next
part, and it's not really

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:43.700
mac and cheese without the mac.

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.925
Talk a little bit about
pastas and the kind of pastas

00:28:45.925 --> 00:28:48.600
and sizes and shapes
that lend themselves

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.100
more to making a mac and cheese.

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.290
LAURA WERLIN: Well, what
I found when I made it--

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:54.780
So, first of all, let
me explain my definition

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:55.767
of mac and cheese.

00:28:55.767 --> 00:28:57.600
Even though it's mac
and cheese, in my world

00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:58.791
it's really cheese and mac.

00:28:58.791 --> 00:28:59.290
OK.

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:02.810
So I want the cheese
to really sing.

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:07.750
So if you have big, big pasta,
then it becomes a pasta dish

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:10.050
with cheese, which there's
nothing wrong with.

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:12.850
But to me, at that point, it
ceases to be mac and cheese.

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:18.170
So I decided to go for
smaller shapes and sizes.

00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:20.910
The largest I use
is penne, which

00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:24.180
is just the ridged, little
tubular cheese, which

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:26.570
is kind of the maximum.

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:29.430
And part of the reason I
use that in certain recipes

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:32.170
is because the ridges
on the outside of penne

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:34.760
are meant to absorb sauce.

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:37.540
And I like the
toothsomeness of pasta.

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:39.030
I want that to be there.

00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:42.430
I just don't want that to
be the overwhelming texture.

00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:45.330
It's not so much about
flavor, but texture.

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:50.600
And so the ratio of
sauce to pasta I felt

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:53.980
worked better with
slightly smaller pasta.

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:56.850
So that could be like the
tiny or the small elbow

00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:59.280
macaroni, the traditional.

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.670
In a couple recipes I do
call for the bigger one,

00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:03.450
but mostly I like the smaller.

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:05.920
Or it might be the
small shell pasta.

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:08.390
Just smaller shapes,
in general, I

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:10.760
found were the better
way to go to get

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:13.077
that cheesiness to dominate.

00:30:13.077 --> 00:30:14.660
JASON CRANE: So we
talked a little bit

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:16.201
about the healthy
chapter at the end.

00:30:16.201 --> 00:30:16.995
What do we call it?

00:30:16.995 --> 00:30:18.580
LAURA WERLIN: Oh,
Lighten Up, Cool Down.

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:19.850
JASON CRANE: Lighten
Up, Cool Down.

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:21.480
Did you have any
rhyme or reason to why

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.520
you named the chapters
the way you did?

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:26.060
Because they were kind of
fun as I was reading through,

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:29.500
and it kind of broke the book
down into some nice sections

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:32.690
for what you were maybe looking
for different uses for the mac.

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:35.595
LAURA WERLIN: Well,
with that chapter,

00:30:35.595 --> 00:30:39.370
I conceived of it initially
as a recipe for days

00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:42.110
like we're having today,
where it's nearly 100 degrees.

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:45.790
And I thought, can you have a
hot day and your mac and cheese

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:46.760
on the same day?

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:49.080
And I felt like the
easiest way to do

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:54.780
that was to make for a
lighter substance, so

00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:59.950
nonfat low fat milk, and, in a
couple cases, lower fat cheese,

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:03.760
which again is a little tricky
to work with because it doesn't

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:06.540
melt so well, or as
well I should say.

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:08.760
And so I don't know.

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.170
That chapter title
just came to me.

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:13.770
Eat Your Veggies.

00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:17.700
So here we have this sort
of inherently decadent book.

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:18.410
Right?

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:19.700
Mac and cheese.

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:22.090
But I still want you
to eat your veggies.

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:26.250
So that's the chapter that
has all vegetable related

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:27.530
macs and cheese.

00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:28.970
And Eat Your Protein.

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:33.560
That too, sure, go ahead
and get your sausage.

00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:36.290
I have one that's
meatballs, and it's actually

00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:38.430
a riff on meatballs
and spaghetti, which

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:39.230
is what I call it.

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:40.021
But it's in quotes.

00:31:40.021 --> 00:31:46.480
So it meatballs and
burrata and a tomato sauce

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.160
in macaroni, or
some sort of pasta.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.980
I can't remember which one.

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:54.290
It's very decadent, and
it's very delicious.

00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:56.620
So anyway, but that's
in the protein chapter.

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:59.370
And there's a classic.

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:01.580
And then there's
an almost classic,

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:03.490
because it was kind of
a riff on the classic.

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:04.420
So in that section--

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:07.360
I think it's in that
section or chapter.

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:11.170
--I have just a mac and cheese.

00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:13.500
I think it has a little
smoky paprika in it.

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:16.240
And then I also have a
grilled cheese recipe there.

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:20.250
And that's what you use to dip
to get the Mac and cheese out.

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:20.810
Decadent?

00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:21.680
Oh, yeah.

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:22.070
JASON CRANE: Absolutely.

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.986
LAURA WERLIN: Starchy?

00:32:22.986 --> 00:32:23.600
Oh, yeah.

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:24.900
Forget about the gluten thing.

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:26.460
If you're gluten
free, I'm sorry.

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:28.043
Well, actually that's
not really true.

00:32:28.043 --> 00:32:30.790
You can use gluten free
bread and gluten free pasta,

00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:32.060
and you can still enjoy it.

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:33.880
JASON CRANE: You just have to
be a little bit more careful.

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.796
And obviously, if you're
living that lifestyle

00:32:35.796 --> 00:32:38.080
you know to be a little
more careful with the rice

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:42.030
pastas or the quinoa pastas
that don't quite hold up as well

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:44.362
to cooking as regular pastas.

00:32:44.362 --> 00:32:46.362
LAURA WERLIN: Yeah, you
just have to be careful.

00:32:46.362 --> 00:32:48.020
JASON CRANE: Did we
have any questions?

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:50.630
AUDIENCE: If you had
to pick one cheese--

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:53.160
JASON CRANE: The question was,
with all these great cheeses

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:55.420
we're talking about and all
the cheeses you've tried,

00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:59.040
if you had to pick one cheese
to take to a desert island

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:02.320
with you, what
cheese would that be?

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.350
On the spot.

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:07.095
LAURA WERLIN: Oh my gosh.

00:33:07.095 --> 00:33:09.340
I hate to answer that
question because there are so

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:12.250
many thousands of cheeses,
not only that I love.

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:14.240
You know what, I will answer it.

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.870
I'm going to dodge it, but I'll
answer it at the same time.

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:21.670
So what I find is that,
when a cheese is really,

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:22.890
really, really well made--

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:24.790
And what I mean by
that, you might think,

00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:27.610
well, I know what a well made
cheese is, but you might not.

00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:29.880
What I mean by
that is, I'll never

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:33.930
forget this experience, where I
was eating a fresh goat cheese.

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:35.810
A simple cheese right?

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:39.920
And it was made just
outside of Austin, Texas,

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.980
famous cheesemaking
region, not so much.

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:48.170
And I know the cheesemaker,
and she hand ladles,

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:52.990
hand pours the curds
into this mold.

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:55.610
But it was a fresh chevre,
or fresh goat cheese.

00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:58.610
I tasted it, and I thought,
it rocked my world.

00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:00.626
At that moment in
time, that would

00:34:00.626 --> 00:34:02.000
have been my desert
island cheese

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.541
because that's when I realized
that fresh chevre was not

00:34:05.541 --> 00:34:06.040
like--

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:08.909
I mean that could be just a
special as a cheese that's

00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:13.469
aged in the mountains of
France for a year and a half.

00:34:13.469 --> 00:34:16.130
Now, speaking of
mountains in France,

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:20.670
although American cheese is my
first love there is a cheese

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:26.929
called Comte, C-O-M-T-E,
that I think is absolutely

00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:27.870
spectacular.

00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:29.290
I love Comte.

00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:33.040
And it tastes great
just by itself.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:36.010
It melts really well.

00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:39.090
And so that would be a
cheese I could consider.

00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:41.320
And then on this side
of the Atlantic--

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:45.048
I know I'm saying more
than one, but I have to.

00:34:45.048 --> 00:34:45.826
Oh my gosh.

00:34:45.826 --> 00:34:48.159
On this side of the Atlantic,
there are about a million.

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:51.940
But if I were staying
with that style of cheese,

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:53.300
there are actually two.

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:56.770
One is made in Vermont,
and it's a newish cheese

00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:59.860
by a wonderful
place called Cellars

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:02.870
at Jasper Hill and
Jasper Hill Farm.

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:04.560
Their kind of the same.

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:12.890
The Cellars is they blasted out
a cave in their hill in Vermont

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:15.812
to create cheese aging caves.

00:35:15.812 --> 00:35:18.270
And they not only age their
own cheese that they make there

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:21.210
on the farm, but they also age
other people in the region's.

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:25.390
Very small cheesemakers, so it's
been a unique model in the US.

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:29.860
And what it does is it
allows them to not only make

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:33.000
the local cheeses,
some of them, really

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.250
make them better because
those cheesemakers might not

00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:36.170
know how.

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:37.980
But it also allows
those cheesemakers

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:41.450
to find a market because they
don't have the distribution

00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:44.460
capabilities that
Jasper Hill does.

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:46.980
So what they do it
they age those cheeses.

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:51.150
And so they have this cheese
that they make themselves

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:54.710
that Jasper Hill makes
called Alpha Tolman.

00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:57.690
It's named after, I don't
know, somebody in their region.

00:35:57.690 --> 00:36:03.540
A-L-P-H-A and then T-O-L-M-A-N.
It's a delicious alpine style

00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:06.810
cheese that, I'm telling
you, get your hands on it.

00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:07.630
It's worth it.

00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:09.870
But then the other
domestic cheese that I--

00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:11.640
An other, not the other.

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.210
--that I love is
made in Wisconsin.

00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:15.600
And it's a cheese called
Pleasant Ridge Reserve.

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.910
And it too is an
alpine style cheese.

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:22.230
It's modeled after a cheese
from France called Beaufort,

00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:24.130
B-E-A-U-F-O-R-T.

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:27.830
And Pleasant Ridge Reserve
is a model of cheesemaking.

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:29.620
It represents so
much because it's

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:33.410
a cheese that is made
only from spring to fall

00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:36.160
when the cows are
out on pasture.

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.790
They do rotational
grazing, which

00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:41.520
means that the cows are moved
from different paddocks.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:45.320
As the cows eat the
grass, it gets down

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:50.140
to a level where the cheesemaker
thinks that the grass is not

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:53.760
really feeding the cow the
nutrients that it should

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.280
to make for the best milk,
and therefore the best cheese.

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:58.770
So then they move the cows
on, let the grass grow back.

00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:01.912
So it's a model of
sustainability as well.

00:37:01.912 --> 00:37:05.180
And what happens is that
the milk is so fantastic, ,

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:08.700
and the cheese, of course,
is too because of how good

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:09.580
the milk is.

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:13.370
And it's all really healthy
and healthful for the cows

00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:16.460
and for the land, and
ultimately for us.

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:18.490
And it's a magnificent cheese.

00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:20.470
I mean, I can't say anything.

00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:21.637
I can't say enough about it.

00:37:21.637 --> 00:37:22.761
JASON CRANE: Well, awesome.

00:37:22.761 --> 00:37:25.290
I think that's a great way to
tie up our conversation today.

00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:26.706
I really appreciate
you coming out

00:37:26.706 --> 00:37:28.830
to visit us here at
Google today, and everyone

00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:32.460
in the cafe who got to eat lunch
and try your delicious recipes,

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:35.260
and thank everyone here for
coming to listen to our talk

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:35.990
today.

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:37.872
And it was really
nice seeing you again.

00:37:37.872 --> 00:37:39.330
LAURA WERLIN: Yeah,
you too, Jason.

00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:40.505
JASON CRANE: And enjoy
the rest of your day.

00:37:40.505 --> 00:37:41.330
LAURA WERLIN: I
will I really will.

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:42.030
Thank you so much.

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:42.400
You're

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:43.275
JASON CRANE: Welcome.

00:37:43.275 --> 00:37:44.250
LAURA WERLIN: Yeah.
