00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.000
Antarctica today is a hotbed of scientific
activity.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.780
Scientists are shooting weather balloons into
space, hunting for galactic particles, and

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.469
flying across the continent to chart our changing
climate.

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.740
But over 60 years ago, Antarctica was a blanket
of unknowns, a territory that was a siren

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.570
song for adventure junkies and pioneering
scientists.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.830
And in the midst of the Cold War, international
peace was forged on the ice.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.030
It was very, very reconnaissance.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.620
There hadn't really been serious scientific
research done across the continent.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.230
But countries came together, we were actually
able to unfreeze the international relations

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.150
between east and west.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.050
This is David Drewry, a renowned glaciologist
and former director of the Scott Polar Research

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.050
Institute.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.510
He’s even got a mountain named after him.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.820
As a young scientist, David participated in
hundreds of groundbreaking flights across

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.280
Antarctica.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.940
We really wanted to understand what the climate
was like, as opposed to understanding how

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.309
the climate had changed.

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.470
While conducting research, David filmed his
experience, and we asked him to digitize a

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.440
roll of cine film, which hasn’t seen the
light of day... until now.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:22.250
Those rocks those mountains, it's just one
of those magical parts of the world.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.369
At one point, Antarctica was primed for conquest
, but the international community stepped

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.299
in to make the continent politically neutral.

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.770
From 1957-1958, scientists worked side by
side.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.400
We thought some of the scientists were rubbish.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.270
Look at them, all they're doing is studying
theses little sort of tiny mosses.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.660
I mean, who could possibly get interested
in that?

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.360
And they joked about, "What are they doing
flying around in these airplanes?"

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:57.720
A lot of good hearted scientific joshing.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.979
Thanks to friendly competition and collaboration,
techniques like radio glaciology, which uses

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.390
radar to map the ice, became vetted scientific
methods.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.970
This film was the foundation of our field.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.010
I mean, at a base-line level they were showing
that you can look through four kilometers

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.816
of ice with a radar pulse, and see what the
bottom of the continent looks like.

00:02:18.816 --> 00:02:23.440
But the real breakthrough was in the recording
system, invented by a radio glaciologist named

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.760
Stan Evans who flew with David.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:34.230
So what Stan did was to get a camera with
a piece of 35mm film that would slowly pass

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.939
over the oscilloscope, the film integrated
the signal.

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:44.330
And with the film continuously moving across
it, you built up a profile.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:52.770
We'd do our activity and then, at the end
of the flight, we'd come back to McMurdo.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.190
We could socialize, get a drink.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.920
We would go to the mess hall.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.780
Steaks, lobster, fresh salads would be flown
in from New Zealand.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.459
We went to the Russian station at Vostok,
it's the coldest place on earth.

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:11.190
The best thing was, a glass of vodka, nostrovia,
and you're pals forever.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:17.300
You have to remember just how hostile the
Antarctic is.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.980
And once you're working and doing all of these
things, if anything goes wrong, it goes badly

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.280
wrong and it goes badly wrong very quickly.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.750
But thanks to these intrepid scientists &amp; radar
profiles, a whole new world of lakes, valleys,

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.819
and mountain ranges were uncovered.

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:41.670
The whole object has been to build up this
picture of the ice sheet and what lies beneath

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.640
it.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.819
These techniques are still being used today,
inspiring the next generation, like Dusty

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.650
Schroeder, a Stanford radio-glaciologist.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.870
Decades after these radar films were taken,
Dustin is embarking on a massive digitization

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.819
project to see if there’s new information
to mine.

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.349
There were thousands of reels that we then
combined together.

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.900
We bought this used Hollywood equipment off
eBay, and we would splice them together and

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.519
tape them, put them onto the scanner and digitize
them.

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:19.219
That produced about 2 million images that
we're now processing through.

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:24.189
These radargrams are like slices of the ice
sheet, and can show how an ice shelf has changed.

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:27.369
These two radar grams are of lake Vostok,
they're the same film.

00:04:27.369 --> 00:04:32.539
You can see the outline of the bottom of the
bed of the ice sheet, you can see the lake.

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:36.349
This is how we knew the lake was there, this
is how we knew layers were drying down and

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:37.349
melting was happening.

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:42.860
It was a huge piece of our understanding of
one the largest lakes on earth.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.869
These films are extending our record of the
history of the ice sheet by almost 4 decades.

00:04:47.869 --> 00:04:53.080
And this invaluable data can now help us better
project Antarctica’s future.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.770
Trying to predict how the ice sheets gonna
behave over the next few decades is challenging,

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.719
it's one of the big tasks.

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:03.479
The hope with this whole collection of data
is just to give a window into anywhere where

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.800
we were lucky enough to have had data collected
at that period, to be able to compare how

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.020
that's changed from then to now.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.219
I think it's fantastic that he's been able
to now use different techniques to capture

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:17.990
all the information.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:26.409
Antarctica has been, and remains an absolutely
cornerstone element in understanding global

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:28.089
environmental processes.

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:45.319
So the more historic information we have,
the better.
