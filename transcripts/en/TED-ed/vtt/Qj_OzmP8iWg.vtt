00:00:01.722 --> 00:00:04.486
There are over two billion school-aged individuals

00:00:04.486 --> 00:00:06.610
living in the world today.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:07.799
That's more young people

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.862
than any other time in human history.

00:00:10.862 --> 00:00:12.412
That's billions of minds

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:15.100
teaming with uninhibited creativity.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.546
That's billions of curious souls.

00:00:17.546 --> 00:00:19.262
The world's youth is the embodiment

00:00:19.262 --> 00:00:20.844
of the world's future,

00:00:20.844 --> 00:00:22.553
and that future has no limits

00:00:22.553 --> 00:00:24.221
because each and every young person

00:00:24.221 --> 00:00:25.779
brings a completely new

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.718
and a completely unique perspective

00:00:27.718 --> 00:00:29.518
to the world around them.

00:00:29.518 --> 00:00:31.482
Ayana is passionately pursuing

00:00:31.482 --> 00:00:33.976
the meaning of life, among other things.

00:00:33.976 --> 00:00:35.763
What will life come to mean to her

00:00:35.763 --> 00:00:37.929
and to her closest friends?

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:40.025
Will future smartphone owners download

00:00:40.025 --> 00:00:41.932
a student-built mood app,

00:00:41.932 --> 00:00:44.367
and will they prefer iteration number one

00:00:44.367 --> 00:00:46.203
or number two?

00:00:46.203 --> 00:00:48.594
Will Sophia become an Olympian,

00:00:48.594 --> 00:00:49.536
a teacher,

00:00:49.536 --> 00:00:51.698
an advocate for world peace,

00:00:51.698 --> 00:00:53.681
or will she become all three?

00:00:53.681 --> 00:00:56.694
And will Tyler's obsession with space

00:00:56.694 --> 00:00:58.826
and his pursuit of infinity

00:00:58.826 --> 00:01:01.728
lead him to travel beyond the world his ideas

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:03.199
and the ideas of his peers

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.771
will most certainly define?

00:01:05.771 --> 00:01:08.244
Picture the collective potential and the ideas

00:01:08.244 --> 00:01:11.839
of over two billion passionate young people.

00:01:11.839 --> 00:01:13.558
TED-Ed is thrilled to announce

00:01:13.558 --> 00:01:15.846
a new program that aims to give them

00:01:15.846 --> 00:01:17.820
the space and time

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.940
to pursue those passions

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:20.922
and to support them

00:01:20.922 --> 00:01:22.437
in presenting those ideas

00:01:22.437 --> 00:01:26.437
in the form of short, TED-like talks.

00:01:26.437 --> 00:01:28.484
The program is called TED-Ed Clubs.

00:01:28.484 --> 00:01:29.436
The mission:

00:01:29.436 --> 00:01:30.955
to celebrate the best ideas

00:01:30.955 --> 00:01:32.795
of young people around the world.

00:01:32.795 --> 00:01:34.400
Here's how it works.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.785
Visit ed.ted.com

00:01:35.785 --> 00:01:38.489
and fill out the club facilitator application.

00:01:38.489 --> 00:01:40.040
Once approved, you'll receive access

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.156
to a set of free tools

00:01:41.156 --> 00:01:42.984
designed to help you start a TED-Ed Club

00:01:42.984 --> 00:01:44.424
at your school.

00:01:45.131 --> 00:01:47.443
There are 13 suggested meetings.

00:01:47.443 --> 00:01:49.048
Each meeting helps club members

00:01:49.048 --> 00:01:51.373
gain a discrete presentation skill.

00:01:51.373 --> 00:01:52.396
In the final meetings,

00:01:52.396 --> 00:01:54.473
club members present their ideas

00:01:54.473 --> 00:01:56.980
in the form of short, TED-like talks.

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:59.868
Teachers, you can nominate presentations

00:01:59.868 --> 00:02:01.395
to be featured on TED-Ed

00:02:01.395 --> 00:02:03.878
or at the annual TED Youth conference.

00:02:03.878 --> 00:02:06.466
And students, the world is waiting

00:02:06.466 --> 00:02:08.277
to be redefined

00:02:08.277 --> 00:02:09.449
by your biggest,

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:10.068
smallest,

00:02:10.068 --> 00:02:10.708
boldest,

00:02:10.708 --> 00:02:11.389
quirkiest,

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:11.905
bravest,

00:02:11.905 --> 00:02:12.791
most inspiring,

00:02:12.791 --> 00:02:14.863
and most brilliant ideas!
