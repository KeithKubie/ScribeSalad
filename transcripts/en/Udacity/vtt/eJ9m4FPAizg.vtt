00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.852
We want to end up with an equation for the total weight of the suitcase. And we

00:00:03.864 --> 00:00:07.679
know that, that is y. So, I'll start by writing y equals something, something

00:00:07.691 --> 00:00:11.585
that we need to figure out. Well, the total weight needs to equal the weight of

00:00:11.597 --> 00:00:15.391
the suitcase itself, and then also the weight of the glasses wipers that Grant

00:00:15.403 --> 00:00:19.135
puts in it. However, we know that the weight of the empty suitcase is just 7

00:00:19.147 --> 00:00:24.206
pounds. So, we can just substitute in 7 in that slot in the equation. The total

00:00:24.218 --> 00:00:28.891
weight of all the wiper sets will just be equal to the weight of one wiper set,

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:33.672
which is 0.5 pounds, times the number of wiper sets packed, which is x. So, we

00:00:33.684 --> 00:00:38.666
can substitute that into our equation as well. And in the end, we have y equals

00:00:38.678 --> 00:00:39.380
7 plus 0.5 x.
