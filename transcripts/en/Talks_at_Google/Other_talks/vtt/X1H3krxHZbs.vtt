00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.660
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks, everyone,
for coming out to the talk

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.174
"Food and Beer,"
which I hope when

00:00:05.174 --> 00:00:07.090
you heard that title for
a talk, you were just

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.210
as excited as I was
when this was first

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.332
proposed to the Talks team.

00:00:11.332 --> 00:00:13.540
So without any further ado,
I'm going to hand it over

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.350
to chef Daniel
Burns, brewer Jeppe

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.740
Jarnit-Bjergso, and their
co-author Joshua David Stein.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.520
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN: Thank you.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.040
Hi everyone.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.460
Yeah.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.676
It's an easy sell,
food and beer,

00:00:28.676 --> 00:00:30.320
and we're really
happy to be here.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.500
I think I speak for all of us.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.620
So the idea of the
book, obviously,

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.970
and these guys can talk
about it more, is--

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.300
both these guys
have deep knowledge,

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.280
Daniel in the world
of fine dining,

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.930
having worked at some of the
best restaurants in the world,

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.481
including the Fat Duck, Noma
where he was pastry chef,

00:00:53.481 --> 00:00:56.800
he headed research and
development for Momofuku here

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.250
in the city, St. John's.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.210
So kind of like
the greatest hits.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.634
And Jeppe is--

00:01:03.634 --> 00:01:05.259
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO:
Just making beer.

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:07.742
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN:
Just a dude making beer.

00:01:07.742 --> 00:01:09.400
But some of the
best beer and most

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.770
highly-rated beer in the world.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.190
So just so you guys know,
they have this restaurant out

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.678
in Greenpoint called
Torst, and then in the back

00:01:18.678 --> 00:01:20.136
there's a part of
it called Luksus.

00:01:20.136 --> 00:01:23.147
And that's kind of how
we set up the book,

00:01:23.147 --> 00:01:24.980
in the sense that the
first part of the book

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.720
takes you through
the Torst experience,

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.470
and it's really centered
around flavors of beer,

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.510
and the kind of diversity
of flavor in beer,

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.590
and its assonance and
resonance within cuisine.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.600
And then the Luksus section
in the back really walks you

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.080
through the tasting
menu, and what

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.020
that would feel like
being at Luksus,

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.854
which only has 16 seats, right?

00:01:50.854 --> 00:01:51.812
DANIEL BURNS: 16, yeah.

00:01:51.812 --> 00:01:53.228
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN:
So the chances

00:01:53.228 --> 00:01:57.050
of you eating there are slim,
although everyone should try.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.570
It's a wonderful experience.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.170
But I kind of wanted to start
it off-- these guys speak really

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.970
passionately about where we are
in the culinary world in terms

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.890
of beer.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.520
Maybe Jeppe, you
could start about

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.550
before you opened
Torst and Luksus,

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.482
what was the status of
beer within fine dining?

00:02:24.302 --> 00:02:25.760
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO:
I mean, I got

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.460
into craft beer or bitter
beer, whatever you call it,

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.800
about 20 years ago.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.720
I'm actually older than I look.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.930
[INAUDIBLE] and back
then I don't think

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.790
it even existed in fine dining.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.314
I mean, I didn't
do that much fine

00:02:46.314 --> 00:02:47.813
dining back then,
obviously, since I

00:02:47.813 --> 00:02:48.937
didn't have a lot of money.

00:02:48.937 --> 00:02:51.484
But the couple
times I did it, they

00:02:51.484 --> 00:02:52.900
might have some
beers on the menu,

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.030
but they were all pretty
bad, or not very [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.700
I moved to New York
about four years ago

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.470
and started exploring
the dining scene here,

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.060
and went to some of these
restaurants that [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.510
But before I moved to Noma,
it was a perfect example,

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.044
going to these restaurants
that were considered some

00:03:14.044 --> 00:03:16.335
of the best in the world,
some of the best in the city,

00:03:16.335 --> 00:03:16.959
in the country.

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.100
And, you know, food was
awesome, wine list was awesome,

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.460
I looked at the beer
list-- that's actually

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.170
how I got to work with Noma.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.879
I was eating there
one day, and Noma

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:30.170
is considered one of the best
restaurants in the world,

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.600
and I was looking at the
beer list and I was like,

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.516
what the hell is this?

00:03:33.516 --> 00:03:37.340
It was just a bunch of
random beers they put on,

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.990
and it wasn't well thought out.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.150
I remember that somebody
from Noma came down,

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.961
and he's one of
the most recognized

00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:44.960
sommeliers in the world.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.600
And he came down, and
he knew I was a beer guy

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.414
and I was a brewer and all
that, and he probably showed me

00:03:52.414 --> 00:03:54.799
the beer list, and he was
like, so what do you think?

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.840
And I glanced at it, I
looked at him, and I said,

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.832
it looks pretty bad actually.

00:03:58.832 --> 00:04:01.960
And he was like, what the
hell do you mean by that?

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.655
But instead of getting offended,
we started a conversation,

00:04:05.655 --> 00:04:08.700
and I had a meeting with
him after and I told him,

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.515
I can help you
out if you wanted.

00:04:11.515 --> 00:04:14.056
I know you're very good at wine,
doesn't mean you necessarily

00:04:14.056 --> 00:04:15.400
good at good beer.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.720
And, you know, he took
my advice in this,

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.510
and we redid the
whole thing, actually.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.410
So we're down from about
50 different beers to five

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.090
that were all
brewed specifically

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.810
for Noma, that had a
story, had flavor that

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.666
actually matched what they did.

00:04:29.666 --> 00:04:32.970
So that was a long answer
to a short question.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.580
Fine dining and beer wasn't
a big thing some years ago.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.246
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN:
And for you, Daniel,

00:04:37.246 --> 00:04:39.670
when you were working
in-- I mean, I don't know.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.936
Do you feel like working
in the kitchen, beer, is

00:04:42.936 --> 00:04:45.270
it true that that's what
guys drink in the kitchen

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.440
but not in the dining room?

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.456
DANIEL BURNS: After shift
drinking, that's it.

00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:53.220
Well, I've seen a
similar thing in sort

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.380
of like the last
five, six years, when

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.900
you go have these bigger
menus at [? EMP ?]

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.690
or places like that
throughout the world, that

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.830
like when they say 10
beverage pairs, 10 years ago,

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.160
for sure 10 is wine.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.492
Now might be one or two
cocktails, one or two beers.

00:05:11.492 --> 00:05:14.700
So the sommeliers
always think about, they

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.160
have zero budget,
access to every wine

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.590
anywhere in the
world, and they still,

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.670
when they see the
ten dishes to pair,

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.060
they're thinking
about beers now.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.630
Which is, I mean, that
says everything basically.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.920
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN: But when you
were starting at the Fat Duck,

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.644
for instance, beer wasn't
part of the initial scene.

00:05:33.644 --> 00:05:34.810
DANIEL BURNS: It wasn't, no.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.290
And it's-- as we
say with the book,

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.660
that's a big thing that
we're trying to bring

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.880
into the conversation
of fine dining and beer.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.735
And yeah, they said
it before, wouldn't it

00:05:44.735 --> 00:05:48.820
be great fast forward even a few
years, or five years from now,

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.530
that all the best
restaurants would

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:51.810
have beer as a pairing option?

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.184
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN:
Yeah, I guess

00:05:53.184 --> 00:05:54.642
I should stop here
and just mention

00:05:54.642 --> 00:05:57.408
that Luksus is the only
Michelin-starred restaurant

00:05:57.408 --> 00:05:59.650
to only have a beer pairing.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.370
So they are kind
of leading the way.

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.510
It is true that other
Michelin-starred restaurants do

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:11.530
have beer, but you can't-- I
don't know about you, Daniel,

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:12.910
Jeppe loves wine a lot.

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.737
But you can't have wine
at Luksus or Torst.

00:06:16.737 --> 00:06:17.820
It's just not on the menu.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.260
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO:
Well, we opened the place

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.926
three years ago.

00:06:19.926 --> 00:06:23.570
We actually had made a decision
and only got a beer license,

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:24.460
which you can do.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:29.512
And you can do beer, and beer,
wine, and spirits, or whatever,

00:06:29.512 --> 00:06:31.220
but we only chose to
have a beer license.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.530
And again, it's not
that we don't like wine,

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.584
but we just wanted
to don't lose focus.

00:06:36.584 --> 00:06:38.500
We didn't want to open
up and start with beer,

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.210
and then people are going
to come in and say hey,

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.560
can we please do some wine?

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.104
And it's easy to fall for that.

00:06:44.104 --> 00:06:46.520
And we're like, nope, we're
only going to do beer license.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.020
And it's actually illegal to
drink wine at our place, which

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:49.686
is kind of cool.

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.502
DANIEL BURNS: It makes
it hard to drink.

00:06:55.502 --> 00:06:57.960
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN: I think
there's an interesting dynamic,

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.370
in the sense that fine
dining is traditionally

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.750
a very elite-- honestly,
an elitist thing

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:08.740
to do, to have that disposable
income, to live in that world.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.400
And beer, on the other hand,
is a very democratic drink,

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.540
in the sense that everyone
here, if you wanted,

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.320
could go home and make beer.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.990
I don't know if it
would be very good,

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:20.130
but it could be very good.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:24.480
But you'd be hard-pressed to go
home and make a bottle of wine

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.850
from the grape to the bottle.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:29.050
And I think that's one
of the dynamics that's

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:33.820
so interesting at
Torst and Luksus,

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.430
that just because something's
democratic and accessible,

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.510
doesn't mean it's
not high quality.

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:40.926
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO:
No, but it's

00:07:40.926 --> 00:07:45.590
also one of the-- I've
actually answered that question

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:49.200
about, lately, why
hasn't beer done a bigger

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.340
impact on fine dining?

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.947
And I actually think
it has something

00:07:51.947 --> 00:07:53.530
to do with exactly
what you're saying.

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:57.320
Beer is by history
or by tradition

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:01.320
or whatever considered
to be a poor man's drink.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.155
It's extremely cheap, or
used to be very cheap.

00:08:04.155 --> 00:08:06.419
I don't know how much
a Budweiser is. $0.50.

00:08:06.419 --> 00:08:07.960
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN:
You mean America.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.070
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO: Yeah,
it's cheap all over the world.

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:11.695
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN: No, no, they
changed their name to America.

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:16.090
And America is cheap.

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:19.153
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO: No, but it
is considered a cheap product.

00:08:19.153 --> 00:08:21.692
Until five, ten years ago,
most people in the world

00:08:21.692 --> 00:08:23.150
considered it a
very cheap product.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:26.560
It was something that you had to
get drunk, pretty much, quench

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.554
your thirst.

00:08:27.554 --> 00:08:28.720
That is definitely changing.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.220
But it's a problem in the
fine dining restaurant world,

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.830
because it's very
hard to mark up.

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.830
The sommeliers can buy wine and
they can mark it up five times,

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:39.610
which they actually
do, and everybody

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:41.289
had to pay the
price for that wine,

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:45.540
because they know the wine
is supposed to be costly.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.402
But if you take a beer and
then you mark it up five times,

00:08:48.402 --> 00:08:51.340
you're like, why the hell do I
have to pay $15 for an America

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.592
all of a sudden, when I
only pay $2 in a store?

00:08:54.592 --> 00:08:56.770
And that's definitely
one of the reasons

00:08:56.770 --> 00:09:01.491
why it has been going slow
in the fine dining world.

00:09:01.491 --> 00:09:03.810
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN: I think
another aspect, although we

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:05.490
talk a little bit
about it in the book,

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.860
is that after
Prohibition in America,

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:13.130
the type of beer that we had,
the large industrial producers

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:17.692
of beer weren't making beers
that had so much flavor.

00:09:17.692 --> 00:09:20.150
And that's one of the things
that we try to do in the book,

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:23.937
is show the diversity
of flavor you can have.

00:09:23.937 --> 00:09:25.020
You can have tart, fruity.

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:31.022
As a chef, Daniel, being able to
bounce off all those flavors--

00:09:31.022 --> 00:09:33.230
DANIEL BURNS: Yeah, that's
actually the coolest part.

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:36.550
We talked a lot about wine
has all these tradition

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:40.570
and [INAUDIBLE] based
flavors associated with just

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:42.250
where the grapes grow.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:45.910
You can only make certain
flavors out of the wine there.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:48.190
Beer is the exact opposite.

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:51.850
You can take products for the
beer from all over the world,

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:55.620
and then add in any
flavors you want also.

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:59.770
So the words we've said a lot
is the spectrum of flavor,

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:03.230
that accessible in
terms of the beer world.

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:06.810
After the dish is made, it
can be much bigger than that

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:08.130
with wine or spirits.

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:09.380
So that's the exciting part.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.040
And there's so many ways
you can go with the pairing

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:12.740
once it's done.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.630
You can go very comparative
flavors with the dish,

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:18.410
or contrasting, or I
think the cooler one

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:22.060
we talked about too is that the
lesser elements in the dish,

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:24.992
like coriander, you can
have a beer that pairs very

00:10:24.992 --> 00:10:26.700
well with coriander,
even though it's not

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.140
a main component in
the dish, for example.

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:32.050
So then the guests'
experiences-- the beer works,

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:35.047
but you're not actually
quite sure why it's working.

00:10:35.047 --> 00:10:37.630
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN: Yeah, that's
what the experience of being,

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:39.660
especially when
you go to Luksus,

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.520
there's a beer-- is
it beer companion?

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.440
Beer host?

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.950
Somebody tells you about
all these bottles of beer

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:48.050
that you're drinking.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:50.870
And there's amazing
stories behind every one,

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:53.547
that you're like that
story, those stories,

00:10:53.547 --> 00:10:55.630
although it also exists
in wine, but these stories

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:57.546
are always so interesting
to me, that you have

00:10:57.546 --> 00:11:01.250
this bottle with this history.

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:04.410
Usually some weirdo somewhere
doing something strange

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:05.660
and adding whatever they want.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.790
This weirdo.

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:12.414
Jeppe, Daniel alluded
to it, that there's

00:11:12.414 --> 00:11:15.300
kind of two different ways you
can get flavors in beer which

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.830
aren't available in wine.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:21.804
You can either have
some flavors coming

00:11:21.804 --> 00:11:25.010
from the yeast or
the hops or the malt,

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:29.420
or you can just say fuck it
and add what you want inside.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:32.340
Like talk maybe a little
bit about Biscotti Break

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:33.910
as an example of that.

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:37.580
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO:
It's a general thing

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:38.330
about beer-making.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.246
We like to say there's
no laws in beer-making.

00:11:40.246 --> 00:11:41.830
There's a lot of
laws in wine-making.

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:44.084
You can't do this,
you can't do that.

00:11:44.084 --> 00:11:45.914
If you add an olive
to a wine, people

00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:48.488
would have a hard time
taking that seriously.

00:11:48.488 --> 00:11:51.460
I've added olive to a
beer and people love it.

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:53.960
Makes it a little easier.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.960
Biscotti Break is
a perfect example.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.760
It's a stout that I made a
couple years ago with-- we

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.300
tried to imitate a biscotti.

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.398
So we added coffee,
almond, and vanilla.

00:12:04.398 --> 00:12:08.130
And it's something you can get
so many flavors out of that.

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:10.753
And now we even did a
Doughnut Break, where

00:12:10.753 --> 00:12:13.010
we added a bunch of doughnuts.

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:17.421
I wanted to make it taste
like a liquid doughnut.

00:12:17.421 --> 00:12:19.409
So we do this beer
called Doughnut Break,

00:12:19.409 --> 00:12:22.020
and every time we make
it, we buy 1,000 doughnuts

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.092
from a small local doughnut
maker in South Carolina

00:12:25.092 --> 00:12:25.960
and add it.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.302
And it's fun.

00:12:27.302 --> 00:12:30.928
It's important to state
that we do all this

00:12:30.928 --> 00:12:31.886
to make delicious beer.

00:12:31.886 --> 00:12:33.549
It's not just to
do something crazy.

00:12:33.549 --> 00:12:35.674
I don't add olives just to
say hey, I added olives.

00:12:35.674 --> 00:12:37.423
It tastes like crap,
but it was fun to do,

00:12:37.423 --> 00:12:39.812
and people are going
to talk about it.

00:12:39.812 --> 00:12:43.260
We do it to bring something
out, a flavor out,

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.120
that I either
haven't had before,

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.390
or a flavor I'm trying to
find from doing all this.

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:51.444
But it is cool that
we can do that.

00:12:51.444 --> 00:12:54.168
Daniel, I was eating at
Luksus a couple of years ago,

00:12:54.168 --> 00:13:00.220
and we had a dessert with
[? liquids ?] [? and beets ?]

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:03.448
that I loved, and I talked
with Daniel about it after.

00:13:03.448 --> 00:13:05.480
We talked about,
wouldn't it be cool

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:10.650
if I made a beer with
[? liquids and beets ?]

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:13.630
for the appetizer, so you start
with a beer with this flavor

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:17.130
profile, where you have a
certain kind of the same flavor

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:17.630
profiles.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.368
And he was like,
yeah, let's do it.

00:13:19.368 --> 00:13:21.410
And it's cool that
we can do that.

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:24.560
I don't see how you would be
able to do that with wine.

00:13:26.864 --> 00:13:28.280
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN:
I mean, that's

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:32.240
the thing about making beer
as well, it's so reactive.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:36.421
There's actually a beer
coming out around the book.

00:13:36.421 --> 00:13:37.170
Is it already out?

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:38.430
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO: Not yet.

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:40.846
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN: There's a
beer that will be coming out

00:13:40.846 --> 00:13:43.989
in celebration of the
release of the book called

00:13:43.989 --> 00:13:46.280
"Fruit and Beer," and the
beer is called the Book Beer.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.130
So it's all very
solipsistic, I guess.

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:55.440
And we went down to Charleston,
where Jeppe works with this guy

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.545
at Westbrook, and we made the
beer in-- how long did it take,

00:13:59.545 --> 00:14:00.044
from--

00:14:00.044 --> 00:14:00.980
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO: Six hours.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:01.840
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN:
Yeah, six hours.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.940
So it's something
you can do quickly,

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:07.550
which gives you the
ability to kind of be

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:10.461
reactive and interactive
with Daniel's cuisine.

00:14:10.461 --> 00:14:12.336
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO:
Yeah, it takes so long,

00:14:12.336 --> 00:14:13.160
you have to ferment it also.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.430
That takes a couple
of weeks, at least.

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:17.367
But yeah, the actual beer-making
only takes a couple of hours.

00:14:19.149 --> 00:14:21.190
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN: I
don't know if I ever really

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:22.773
asked you guys, how
does that actually

00:14:22.773 --> 00:14:25.480
work, going through the
menu of Luksus pairing?

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:30.710
And how do you
guys work together?

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:33.740
DANIEL BURNS: The dish gets
decided, or close to decided.

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:37.390
And we need to taste
the dish, and that's

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:39.970
the time when we can try out
four or five different beers

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:41.820
and see which one works best.

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:45.640
And as you say, we can go
very widely varied in styles,

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:49.120
and see how they interact
with [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.290
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN: There's
always a clear winner

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.592
as to which one will work best.

00:14:53.592 --> 00:14:55.092
DANIEL BURNS: But
then you also have

00:14:55.092 --> 00:14:58.910
to think about the progression
of beers throughout the menu.

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:01.000
So you can't have
sour, sour, sour.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.708
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN:
How many courses is--

00:15:02.708 --> 00:15:04.810
DANIEL BURNS: There's
about 12, 12 servings.

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:08.370
So we do-- there's right now
between six or eight snacks,

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:11.030
and then you have
one beer with that.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:15.460
And then the main dishes,
four main dishes and a palate

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.590
cleanser, so one beer with
each of the main dishes.

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:19.484
So five beers paired.

00:15:19.484 --> 00:15:21.150
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN:
And I wanted to ask,

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:25.010
how does paired with beer,
how has that changed?

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:28.470
I mean, you had such a
crazy evolution as a chef.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:32.580
So Daniel obviously
worked at restaurants.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:35.830
He started out as
a mathematician,

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:39.150
then worked making soup, then
worked in high-end kitchens

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:41.812
on the savory side,
then went to Noma,

00:15:41.812 --> 00:15:43.786
moved over to pastry, right?

00:15:43.786 --> 00:15:45.718
I'm probably
skipping one or two.

00:15:45.718 --> 00:15:51.350
Went to Fat Duck moved
to pastry, went to Noma,

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:53.643
became a pastry chef.

00:15:53.643 --> 00:15:58.030
And then went to Momofuku,
and when you're not

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:01.790
cooking for people at
Momofuku, he stayed in a room

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:06.090
and came up with ideas that
drove the enterprise forward.

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:07.960
But you weren't plating food.

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.900
You were in that pure research.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:13.190
DANIEL BURNS: That was research
and development was my title,

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:16.635
and in charge of making
new dishes and all

00:16:16.635 --> 00:16:19.300
of these longer-term
fermentation projects.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:21.900
Like they have the [? hoisin ?]
and stuff available now,

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:24.680
which is really crazy
to see that it's finally

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:27.420
available for purchase, when
we started working on it

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:28.990
five, six years ago.

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:31.790
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN:
So how has now

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:35.070
cooking, right now, creating
menus and using flavors,

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:37.880
knowing that you're going to be
pairing it with beer changed?

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.849
Or has it changed the way
you think about flavor,

00:16:40.849 --> 00:16:41.390
for instance?

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:43.560
DANIEL BURNS: It
hasn't, actually.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.520
I get inspired most by,
first of all, the seasons.

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:51.430
And then also by
travel, go to new places

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:54.510
and taste new-- I know
you do as well, Jeppe.

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:56.780
When you travel somewhere
new, you're like, holy shit,

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:58.730
I've never tried this
type of citrus fruit.

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:03.670
And even just eating the-- very
much eating the local cuisine

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:07.550
wherever you go, it can be
the truest form of food.

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:10.736
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN: What's
a good recent example?

00:17:10.736 --> 00:17:13.589
DANIEL BURNS: I was
in Nashville recently,

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:19.490
and then to see the homestyle
cooking, the hot chicken

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:22.040
and whatever else goes
along with that, that can

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:26.960
be just super-honest cooking.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:33.460
But most of all the
seasons, and then it's

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:34.740
a matter of managing it.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:36.820
Now we're in the
third year, we can

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:40.170
start to sort of predict ahead,
OK, radishes are coming soon.

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:44.380
So you have to stay on top of
what's coming next in order

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:46.430
to change the menu
as often as we do,

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:48.690
because we try to change it
every four or five weeks,

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:51.190
that all the dishes change.

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:54.020
It takes a lot of foreplanning.

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:55.770
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN:
So yeah, that question

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:58.940
is a little bit about how you've
been evolving, and innovation.

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:02.760
And I wonder for both of you,
if you can answer, how do you

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:07.795
approach innovation within
Evil Twin and Torst and Luksus

00:18:07.795 --> 00:18:08.730
in the kitchen?

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:13.110
And how far do you push it?

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:15.589
So have you failed
doing it ever?

00:18:15.589 --> 00:18:18.130
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO: It's some
very simple things, which are

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:18.629
[INAUDIBLE].

00:18:18.629 --> 00:18:21.710
Evil Twin is the brewery,
and when I make beer

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:23.630
I don't think about
the restaurant,

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:27.115
because we talked about that.

00:18:27.115 --> 00:18:28.740
We talk about it in
the book, and we've

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:29.390
talked about that lot.

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:31.140
It's important for us
to say that it's not

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.081
like we worked together creating
a beer that matches the food,

00:18:34.081 --> 00:18:35.830
or the food matches
the beer, or whatever.

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:38.602
I make my beer,
Daniel makes the food.

00:18:38.602 --> 00:18:40.143
Sometimes we use
Evil Twin, sometimes

00:18:40.143 --> 00:18:41.170
we use something else.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:43.400
I mean, it's like a sommelier.

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.858
He tastes the food, he
finds the wine that pairs,

00:18:45.858 --> 00:18:47.730
and he puts them together.

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:49.962
So to talk about Evil
Twin and evolution,

00:18:49.962 --> 00:18:51.920
you know, that's something
I think a lot about.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:57.300
And I travel more
than normal people.

00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.000
I think I've brewed in more
than 20 different countries

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:00.900
the last four years.

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:04.900
I'm probably the brewer that
has brewed in the most different

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:07.150
countries ever.

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:10.920
And it's something I do to
learn not just about flavors

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.880
and ingredients, but
also to learn and stay

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:17.580
on top of the beer evolution
all over the world.

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.916
When I started professionally
coming into craft beer

00:19:20.916 --> 00:19:24.472
about 12 years
ago, yeah, I wanted

00:19:24.472 --> 00:19:25.680
to make a business out of it.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.560
And I wanted to create beer,
and I had a popular beer stall,

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.046
and I have a
distribution company,

00:19:31.046 --> 00:19:33.440
and we have the bar, the
restaurant, all that.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.550
But it was also, for me
it was also a mission

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:37.100
to spread the love of beer.

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.980
I know it sounds a little--
but I actually mean it.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:44.050
When I go to Mexico and
become a part of that scene,

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:46.320
and go to a festival that's
like the [? hit name ?]

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.700
for the festival,
it's to show them

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.904
or to teach them how you
can do it, and tell them

00:19:51.904 --> 00:19:54.320
about how we do it in the USA,
and how we do it in Europe.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.835
And that's the fun part.

00:19:56.835 --> 00:19:58.710
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN: I
think one of the things

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:00.209
you talk a lot about
is that you can

00:20:00.209 --> 00:20:02.230
make tremendous beer anywhere.

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:06.422
It's not like a brewery
that's not making great beer

00:20:06.422 --> 00:20:07.338
can't make great beer.

00:20:07.338 --> 00:20:08.682
It's in the recipe.

00:20:08.682 --> 00:20:10.454
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO:
Yeah, totally.

00:20:10.454 --> 00:20:12.620
That's also one of the big
differences between wine-

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:15.535
and beer-making, and why
beer-making in many ways

00:20:15.535 --> 00:20:17.860
is more approachable.

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.270
I mean, I get asked a lot,
how do you see yourself?

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:23.030
As a scientist or an
artist or a chemist?

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:26.430
And I always answer, I
see myself as a cook,

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:30.400
because what I do is the
same thing that Daniel does.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.130
We take some
different ingredients,

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:35.510
we put them together in
a certain kind of way,

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:37.617
and we try to make
something that tastes good.

00:20:37.617 --> 00:20:39.200
And that's all that
matters, you know?

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.330
Nothing else matters
when you make food.

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:43.190
Nothing else matters
when you make beer.

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:44.487
It has to taste good.

00:20:44.487 --> 00:20:46.070
Otherwise, there's
no reason to do it.

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:49.367
And-- what was the question?

00:20:49.367 --> 00:20:50.700
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN: That was it.

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.697
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO:
That was the question.

00:20:52.697 --> 00:20:54.780
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN: The
question's actually, like,

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:56.860
how far you push innovation.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:59.207
How important is it
to innovate, for you?

00:20:59.207 --> 00:21:00.790
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO:
I push it a lot.

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:05.000
I'm known for pushing it
more than most people.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.670
And it's, again, it's not that
I push it just to push it.

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:11.500
I do it because I get this idea.

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:16.320
It's more like I have this idea
of something I want to taste,

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.810
and nobody else
has done it before.

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:21.720
I have to do it to myself.

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.960
And that's definitely
something that

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:29.740
drives me a long way in my
view, maybe because I love food,

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:33.025
and I spend all my time
and all my money eating.

00:21:33.025 --> 00:21:35.410
If it's from street
kitchens to the best

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:40.950
restaurants in the world, I just
love to put things in my mouth.

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:42.240
That can sound a bit weird.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.670
But I really like flavors.

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:46.710
And that's not just beer, it's
food and beer and cocktails

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:48.450
and coffee and wine
and everything.

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:52.080
And it interests me so much
that I want to taste everything

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:56.620
there is in this world, and some
of that I have to do myself.

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:59.100
DANIEL BURNS: I
mean, innovation is--

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:02.630
having worked at these
Fat Duck and Noma,

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:07.210
you see 20 to 30 people
come in [INAUDIBLE] for free

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:08.290
every month.

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:12.220
And that's-- people
oftentimes going into, like,

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.150
write down all the
recipes they can,

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:17.131
and then go back to wherever
they work and just copy it,

00:22:17.131 --> 00:22:17.630
you know?

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:20.940
So that's, like, totally
crazy in my mind,

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:24.940
that anyone would want to do
that, or choose to do that.

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:27.370
So for me the big thing is,
I've seen a lot of things

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:31.110
from these best chefs in the
world, and I'm conscious of it,

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:34.196
and I will never copy
anything I've learned.

00:22:34.196 --> 00:22:37.130
The innovation is like,
OK, I've seen that and that

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:38.630
with a carrot, for example.

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:39.994
What am I going to do now?

00:22:39.994 --> 00:22:41.410
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN:
So it's almost

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:45.044
like you made a challenge
for yourself, because you've

00:22:45.044 --> 00:22:47.252
seen some of the best, most
innovative and best ideas

00:22:47.252 --> 00:22:52.587
in the world, and you
have to now avoid those.

00:22:52.587 --> 00:22:55.170
DANIEL BURNS: I mean, obviously,
and that's the thing I always

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:56.170
say to young cooks, too.

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:59.550
You can't just, like, I'm going
to work with my buddy who's

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:00.620
a chef for two years.

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:03.170
Well, you've got to
careful about that,

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:05.925
because it informs exactly
how you think about food.

00:23:05.925 --> 00:23:07.820
Whether you're
conscious of it or not.

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:10.030
Because you go home and
cook, and then you're like,

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:14.850
I think I'm going to make
flank steak with potatoes.

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:17.030
That's what's on the menu
in my section right now.

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:17.530
You know?

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:21.310
It's hard to get out of it
once you choose a restaurant.

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:24.990
But innovation, I'm very
conscious of where I've been,

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:26.890
what I've learned,
and then how I

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:32.120
can adapt it to make it feel
like our own in the kitchen

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.920
we're trying to do.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.580
But it's important.

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:37.670
The one big thing
everyone I think

00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:40.870
comes to Luksus
thinking a little bit

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:47.190
is that new Nordic,
Rene's scope of influence

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:49.100
has been very wide, and--

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:51.028
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN:
He's the owner of Noma.

00:23:51.028 --> 00:23:53.860
DANIEL BURNS: Yeah,
Rene Redzepi from Noma.

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:57.370
But I don't think new Nordic's
possible here in North America.

00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:02.639
But the use of less
proteins and more vegetables

00:24:02.639 --> 00:24:04.430
is something I've taken
very much to heart,

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:06.814
and so it's actually
possible to have

00:24:06.814 --> 00:24:10.771
quite a long-format tasting
menu, but still feel nice

00:24:10.771 --> 00:24:12.354
and a little bit
refreshed at the end.

00:24:12.354 --> 00:24:14.976
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN: Have
a spring in your step.

00:24:14.976 --> 00:24:16.850
DANIEL BURNS: So that's
the other thing, too.

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:19.290
You find so often when
these restaurants, they

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:21.140
have a tasting menu and
a la carte, and then

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:23.470
you just get super-full
when you take

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:24.595
the tasting menu sometimes.

00:24:24.595 --> 00:24:28.094
So I'm conscious about how much
food you eat by the end also.

00:24:28.094 --> 00:24:30.510
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN: We wanted
to open it up for questions.

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:37.020
These guys are obviously, have a
lot of expertise and knowledge,

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:38.964
and are, you know,
kind of friendly,

00:24:38.964 --> 00:24:41.796
so they might answer
things if you ask them it.

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:53.540
AUDIENCE: So this is
a question for Jeppe.

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:57.034
Seems like you experiment
a lot and make a lot

00:24:57.034 --> 00:24:58.200
of really interesting beers.

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.340
I'm sure you have
experiments that have failed,

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:05.940
and stuff that's
just come out awful.

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:07.560
So I'm kind of
curious if you could

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:09.310
talk a little bit about
something that you

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:11.685
were excited about and you
tried and it just didn't work.

00:25:17.361 --> 00:25:19.861
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO: Actually
I haven't had too many fails.

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:25.219
I've obviously been
asked that question,

00:25:25.219 --> 00:25:27.260
have you ever done anything
that tasted terrible?

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:30.206
I had done a few beers that I
definitely wouldn't do again.

00:25:30.206 --> 00:25:31.832
One of them was--
you can definitely

00:25:31.832 --> 00:25:37.305
call that a fail, because
I made a beer in Denmark,

00:25:37.305 --> 00:25:40.900
in the very beginning
of Evil Twin,

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:47.150
where I blended the beer with
[? 10% ?] wine, Chardonnay.

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:48.611
Because an old
brewery in Belgium

00:25:48.611 --> 00:25:50.854
had done the same thing in
the '90s, and I loved it,

00:25:50.854 --> 00:25:51.770
and I wanted to do it.

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:52.810
And the beer came
out really good.

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:54.268
I blended it, came
out really good.

00:25:54.268 --> 00:25:56.380
We wanted to export
it to the USA,

00:25:56.380 --> 00:26:00.470
but it's illegal to sell a
beer and wine blend in the USA.

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:03.030
So I made an experiment
where I actually

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:08.460
used grape juice to see if I
can ferment it with the beer

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:09.700
and see how that came out.

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:13.450
Not the same thing.

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:16.109
So that was definitely a fail.

00:26:16.109 --> 00:26:18.400
I had an idea it wouldn't
come out the same, obviously,

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.240
because it's not wine.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.740
But, you know,
fermented grape juice

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:23.340
should be close to something
you could call wine.

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:24.637
But it did not taste as good.

00:26:24.637 --> 00:26:26.720
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN: I
remember there was something

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.087
about blueberry skins.

00:26:28.087 --> 00:26:30.170
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO: That
was actually not a beer

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:31.110
done under Evil Twin.

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:35.280
I made a beer with
a brewery in Belgium

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.280
called Cantillon which
is known for-- we still

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.706
make it actually-- for
[INAUDIBLE] many beers.

00:26:40.706 --> 00:26:43.280
And we used blueberries,
and they had never

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.310
used blueberries before.

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:46.119
And the first year
we made it, we just

00:26:46.119 --> 00:26:47.510
added whole blueberries.

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:51.190
But it's something-- you know,
blueberries have the hard skin,

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:55.972
and if you don't break it down
before you add it to the beer,

00:26:55.972 --> 00:26:57.430
I don't know exactly
what happened.

00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:01.560
But something on the skin turned
the beer almost into vinegar,

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:04.560
and it tasted pretty
terrible actually.

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:06.560
The year after, we
froze the blueberries

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:09.670
before we added them, because
that breaks the berry down.

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:12.280
And now we freeze it,
and you know, it works.

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:15.560
But that was definitely
kind of a failure as well.

00:27:25.154 --> 00:27:27.570
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN: They'll
also give beer recommendations

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:29.990
if you ask.

00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:34.660
AUDIENCE: Is your beer, just--
is it bottled or canned beer?

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:39.400
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO: What
do I think of it, of canned?

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:42.691
We're moving all our beers,
or pretty much all, in cans.

00:27:42.691 --> 00:27:44.932
We've been doing that
last couple of years.

00:27:44.932 --> 00:27:45.880
It's way better.

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:48.296
I mean, it's better for the
beer, it's better for storage,

00:27:48.296 --> 00:27:53.140
it's better for the environment,
it's cheaper, it looks cooler.

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:57.593
I mean, it's-- I know, canned,
10 years ago if you sold beer

00:27:57.593 --> 00:28:00.970
in a can, you wouldn't buy it,
because you considered it bad

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:02.050
beer, pretty much.

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:03.540
But that has definitely changed.

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:05.955
I actually read that more
than 50% of the craft beer

00:28:05.955 --> 00:28:07.800
is in cans now, which
is kind of cool.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.920
But it's just a better
media to put it in.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:13.600
I mean, I'm glad someone
figured that out.

00:28:19.572 --> 00:28:21.780
AUDIENCE: A bunch of us in
the room are home brewers.

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:23.530
Can you talk about
your home brewing setup

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:25.674
that you've had over the
years, or still have?

00:28:25.674 --> 00:28:28.540
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO: I
don't have it anymore.

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:33.150
I started homebrewing-- I think
I did my first batch of beer

00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:33.775
in 2000, maybe?

00:28:33.775 --> 00:28:36.104
2001?

00:28:36.104 --> 00:28:37.020
I don't know.

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:39.650
You guys probably have
cool setups and everything.

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:41.306
We used plastic parts.

00:28:44.664 --> 00:28:46.330
Everything was
kitchenware, pretty much.

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:48.899
You couldn't get fancy
systems back then.

00:28:48.899 --> 00:28:50.969
I see homebrewing
systems now that

00:28:50.969 --> 00:28:53.010
looks like real breweries,
which is kind of cool.

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:55.295
I mean, when I started
homebrewing I was just

00:28:55.295 --> 00:28:57.650
like everybody else, you know?

00:28:57.650 --> 00:28:59.070
I was drinking
beer, and I thought

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:00.903
it would be fun to
actually see if you could

00:29:00.903 --> 00:29:04.110
make something that
tasted as good as the ones

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:04.860
that we bought.

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:08.446
And I found out pretty fast
that you actually could.

00:29:08.446 --> 00:29:10.070
My advice to homebrewers
is always just

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:14.594
experiment, because some
of the best beers I've made

00:29:14.594 --> 00:29:17.410
came from just trying
new things out,

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:19.710
and not really knowing
what I was doing.

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:24.425
But, you know, just see if it
worked, and often it actually

00:29:24.425 --> 00:29:25.300
came out really good.

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:28.210
So, I mean, I had a
very primitive setup.

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:30.790
What is yours?

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:36.185
AUDIENCE: All grain, just like
10-gallon pot mashed down.

00:29:36.185 --> 00:29:37.560
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO:
So it's not

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.395
one of those fancy things that
looks like a real brewery.

00:29:39.395 --> 00:29:41.001
AUDIENCE: I don't think I
know anyone in New York that

00:29:41.001 --> 00:29:41.360
has a nice big system.

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:42.693
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO: Maybe not.

00:29:43.832 --> 00:29:46.040
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN: I'm
surprised there's no one here

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:48.040
in the Googleplex.

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:50.040
AUDIENCE: We've tried.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.099
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN: How
far did you guys get?

00:29:52.099 --> 00:29:52.890
AUDIENCE: Not very.

00:29:56.660 --> 00:30:00.300
AUDIENCE: Yes, for Jeppe.

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:03.270
Just curious whether
the beers that you serve

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:07.330
are best paired with fine
dining, with any dining,

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:08.660
or on their own.

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:10.540
Does it make a difference
in terms of how

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:14.690
to best appreciate these beers?

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:16.940
JEPPE JARNIT
BJERGSO: Definitely.

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:18.380
If I understand
the question, what

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:20.370
is the beers that
we use at Luksus,

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:23.360
if they are best for that.

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:25.075
They're best for drinking.

00:30:25.075 --> 00:30:27.200
They just happened to pair
well with Daniel's food.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:31.258
I mean, when we
opened the restaurant,

00:30:31.258 --> 00:30:32.670
we hadn't done it before.

00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:33.740
We hadn't opened a
restaurant before.

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:35.720
We hadn't done a restaurant
with beer pairings.

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.968
Obviously we had an idea of
what we were going to do,

00:30:37.968 --> 00:30:43.360
but with the evolution
of his restaurant

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:46.340
and how Daniel was
cooking, the beer pairings

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:47.430
have changed also.

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:51.270
And we have realized that
what we use the most now

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:54.410
is beers with some
kind of wild yeast.

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:57.320
If it's been [INAUDIBLE] so
[INAUDIBLE] or whatever it is,

00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:00.810
and that's just because it
works well with Daniel's food,

00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:05.610
because Daniel's food is very
without some organic flavors

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:08.570
like earthy and a
little bit funky.

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:11.170
And you know he's used
fermentation and pickling

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:11.770
and all that.

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:14.720
So we just figured out
that that works best.

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.890
Had we done an old-school
French restaurant,

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:19.729
we probably would
have done wine.

00:31:19.729 --> 00:31:22.543
But had we done a French
restaurant with beer,

00:31:22.543 --> 00:31:24.470
we would probably have
used different beers,

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:28.291
more dark and full-bodied.

00:31:28.291 --> 00:31:29.790
AUDIENCE: I guess
I just sort of get

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:32.060
the idea of pairing both
from the food and the drink

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:36.720
point of view, whether the
beer makes the food better,

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.200
or the food makes
the beer better.

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:44.240
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN: It's
like a true marriage.

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:50.330
DANIEL BURNS: I think that a
good example is, maybe, there's

00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:53.180
the sour beer taste
at first, and then

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:55.790
the dish is quite sweet.

00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:57.800
They go somewhere together.

00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:01.100
With wine, it's going to
happen less, in my experience.

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:02.600
The wine is going
to-- the character

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.440
of the wine is going to stand
much more separately to when

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:07.500
you taste it with
the dish, I think.

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:10.850
So I think beer is
good in that aspect,

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:14.150
and you can choose
beers that, like, really

00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:17.750
harmonize with the dish.

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:22.110
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN: I think it's
also a matter of all the beers

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:24.126
that you have at Luksus.

00:32:24.126 --> 00:32:26.250
They can stand on their
own, and they're wonderful.

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:30.410
It's not that you can pair
every beer with fine dining.

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:33.990
Some beers are just-- and we had
talked about, like, super-sour.

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:39.770
And it's, like, not every
beer-- I don't know, I mean,

00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:44.650
in my experience-- is suitable,
really, for pairing this way.

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:46.990
Sometimes it's dominant
and so strongly-flavored

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:50.744
that you'd have a hard
time finding harmony.

00:32:50.744 --> 00:32:52.660
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO:
Yeah, I mean some beers,

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:54.900
like some wines, you
just want to drink alone.

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:56.566
Some beers you just
want to drink alone.

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:05.560
AUDIENCE: So essentially, I
believe there are two schools

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:08.130
of thought, which is
for example the Germans,

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:12.390
that if you put more than water
and barley and like the four

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:15.150
essential elements of the
beer, you cannot call it beer.

00:33:15.150 --> 00:33:17.460
And then you have
the free-for-all,

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:20.960
like you can add corn and
you can add maybe yogurt even

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.580
to a beer, and then call it--

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:25.250
JEPPE JARNIT BJERGSO:
I've done that.

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:27.820
AUDIENCE: Like, you
may-- as you said before,

00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:32.345
like you look for specific
tastes and flavors,

00:33:32.345 --> 00:33:35.180
and you're in search
of specific things.

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:36.870
But what are your
thoughts on the people

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:39.740
that just, like, put
beer in whatever they

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:43.050
find in the garage, and then mix
it and then they call it a beer

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:44.740
and then put it out there?

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:47.200
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO:
I mean, I think

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.330
that's a couple of
different questions.

00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:51.380
Let's take the German
purity law first.

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:54.770
It's not a law anymore, so you
can-- even the Germans could

00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:55.936
put olive in their beer now.

00:33:55.936 --> 00:33:58.540
I mean, I actually
think it's kind of cool,

00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:02.540
that-- I'm not a
big fan of laws,

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:04.860
but I think it's kind
of cool that they

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:07.690
had this way of developing
their beer scene in Germany,

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:10.389
where they had to stick
to the rules of only

00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:13.199
the four main ingredients,
because, you know,

00:34:13.199 --> 00:34:16.260
the best pilsners in the
world with no comparison

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:18.040
comes out of Germany,
for the reason

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.609
that they have done
over 500 years,

00:34:19.609 --> 00:34:21.650
and have been able to do
whatever else they have.

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:23.520
But you know what I mean.

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.300
They've definitely
perfected what they've

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:27.500
perfected about what they did.

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:35.120
But it also limits them a lot,
in terms of what they can do,

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:38.880
in terms of doing whatever.

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:41.340
I can't say I'm not a
fan of it, because I

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:44.280
do a lot of experiments, but
you know as I also explained,

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:47.239
I always have the
end product in mind.

00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:49.964
I always have in mind, you
know, I might add olive,

00:34:49.964 --> 00:34:55.560
or I might ferment it in my
garage inside my car's fuel

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:56.722
tank, something like that.

00:34:56.722 --> 00:34:58.180
But it has to taste
good, you know?

00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:00.630
And that's very important
to me, because people

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:04.520
that read about me and
the beers that I make

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:06.650
might think this
guy's just [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:09.342
and off doing crazy
things, so that people

00:35:09.342 --> 00:35:10.550
have something to talk about.

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:11.675
That's not what it's about.

00:35:11.675 --> 00:35:13.300
I always aim to get balance.

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:16.700
I always aim to get
good flavors out of it.

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:19.080
And yeah, sometimes you would
say it's a little bizarre.

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.360
I did a beer in Norway
with pizza [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.040
That was pretty much
the only exception

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:26.310
where we just did it for fun.

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:27.820
But you know, in
general, I think

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:29.796
if you have that in mind
when you make a beer,

00:35:29.796 --> 00:35:32.520
it should be free for all
to do whatever they want.

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:36.320
I mean, some people
now experiment,

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:41.933
we experiment with yeast, hops,
obviously, malts, adjuncts,

00:35:41.933 --> 00:35:43.474
different ingredients,
but now people

00:35:43.474 --> 00:35:45.270
have started to experiment
with fermenters,

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:49.070
concrete fermenters,
[INAUDIBLE] fermenters.

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:50.570
I actually think
that's pretty cool,

00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:53.150
because we might
expose some new or find

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:55.871
some new flavors from that.

00:35:55.871 --> 00:35:57.204
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN: In the back.

00:36:00.542 --> 00:36:02.150
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks
for being here.

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:03.040
Two questions.

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:05.620
So one is, can you
give us a sneak preview

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:08.110
of what might be coming
up on your next iteration

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:08.830
of your menu?

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:12.420
And then the other is, do you
have any good recommendations

00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:16.460
for chili beer, like spicy beer?

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:20.880
DANIEL BURNS: I'll leave the
spicy beer to [? Liam. ?] Yeah,

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:23.380
so we've changed the
main course recently,

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:24.900
which is duck right now.

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:28.640
So that will stay for
the next few weeks.

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:32.750
And then we're doing--
there's always a broth course.

00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:35.310
The snacks change most
often, so that can

00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:36.770
be changed different every day.

00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:38.980
But the broth we do every menu.

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:41.200
And right now it's
roasted turnip broth,

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:46.520
and it's changing to an onion
broth with asparagus and crab

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:47.370
next.

00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:49.250
So that should happen
in the next few days.

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:55.070
And then the first serving is
like chef's-- or like longing

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:57.900
for the green things, and
this is more like a salad

00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:00.450
at the start, with veal
tongue at the moment,

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:03.323
with warm vinaigrette.

00:37:03.323 --> 00:37:07.260
And then rhubarb just
came out, so soon

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:10.146
as it's here I jump on a
rhubarb dessert pretty fastish,

00:37:10.146 --> 00:37:10.980
I would say.

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:16.640
So the main dishes
evolve, sort of constantly

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:19.260
changing, where I'll change
the broth and the salad

00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:22.380
will change next week, and then
be time to change the duck.

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:24.350
The duck, the main
course, is the one

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:27.390
to sort of manage
the most, because we

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:29.340
age the ducks 10 to 12 days.

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:31.800
And then you have to
find the right supplier

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:33.910
and figure out the
cooking method fully

00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:35.160
before you put it on the menu.

00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:38.990
So I would say overall, if
we change the menu 10 times

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:41.300
a year, the main course
might change only eight,

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:44.300
because of all that stuff--
because you don't want to just

00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:46.070
say, oh, give me some ducks.

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:48.410
You want to source
everything properly,

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:52.620
and then set up the--
also from their side,

00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:55.080
even a small restaurant,
the lamb for example

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:56.600
we get from Elysian Farm.

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.720
That's-- Thomas Keller
uses them, and you know,

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:03.150
I try to change my lamb
neck order from 10 to 12,

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:05.940
and she's like freaking
out on the email.

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:10.240
It's quite-- certain good
products, for especially

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.130
proteins, are
highly sought after,

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:14.960
so you have to be a little bit
careful how you manage that.

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.460
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN:
The other thing,

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:17.960
just to mention,
about the menu too,

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:22.200
also have this thing
called the second course.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:26.100
DANIEL BURNS: So I'll never copy
anything I've done anywhere,

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:29.810
but that was a really
cool thing at Noma.

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:32.680
There was a la carte and
tasting when I started,

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:36.770
and so there was just
a choice of three.

00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:40.276
How a lot of restaurants do
it-- three starters, three

00:38:40.276 --> 00:38:41.400
main course, three dessert.

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:44.280
And those were
classic dishes that

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.650
had been on the tasting
menu and everyone loved it.

00:38:46.650 --> 00:38:48.660
And so they put it to
the a la carte, which

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:50.160
is one of the coolest
ways I've ever

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:51.920
seen anyone run an a la carte.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:54.710
It's basically classic
hits of the restaurant

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:56.790
for the a la carte menu.

00:38:56.790 --> 00:39:00.330
So for the main dish,
though, you would get, say,

00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:03.402
duck breast, and
then soon after,

00:39:03.402 --> 00:39:04.860
when the main dish
was cleared out,

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:07.510
you'd get a second serving
of the leg or the neck

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:08.320
or something else.

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:10.028
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN:
It's like a related--

00:39:10.028 --> 00:39:12.524
DANIEL BURNS: Yes,
so it's a way to show

00:39:12.524 --> 00:39:16.160
conscious use of the
product, and also--

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:20.710
but back when I first started--
Jeppe can speak to you,

00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:23.990
but Scandinavians didn't
used to eat out that much

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:26.050
at fine dining places.

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:28.320
And so oftentimes the
guests would be like,

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:29.750
no, no, we didn't order this.

00:39:31.577 --> 00:39:33.910
No, you don't have to pay
extra, it's just part of the--

00:39:38.431 --> 00:39:40.930
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO: Danish
people's favorite food is free.

00:39:44.083 --> 00:39:46.338
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN: Chili beer.

00:39:46.338 --> 00:39:48.900
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO: An
example of a good chili beer?

00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:53.774
AUDIENCE: Yeah I've tried
the [INAUDIBLE], I think?

00:39:53.774 --> 00:39:55.690
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO:
That's not a chili beer.

00:39:59.685 --> 00:40:00.560
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:05.012 --> 00:40:07.504
JEPPE JARNIT BJERGSO: That's
a version of [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:07.504 --> 00:40:08.459
Did you like it?

00:40:08.459 --> 00:40:09.500
AUDIENCE: It's delicious.

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:11.735
I love chili beers.

00:40:11.735 --> 00:40:14.068
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO: I've
made a couple of chili beers.

00:40:14.068 --> 00:40:18.649
The most common one is a
stout like [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:18.649 --> 00:40:19.440
It's made in Spain.

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:22.400
I don't speak Spanish, but I
want to give it a Spanish name

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:25.160
just to have a connection.

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:28.000
When you make a
spicy beer, when you

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.380
want some spiciness in
there, or some hotness,

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:32.950
the most common one
is definitely a stout.

00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:33.550
It just works.

00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:36.102
You know, like chocolate
and chili works really well.

00:40:36.102 --> 00:40:37.810
So a stout has a lot
of chocolate flavors

00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:39.270
to it, so it works really well.

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:42.460
I also made last
year a bit of beer

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:44.395
called Spicy Nachos,
that we later

00:40:44.395 --> 00:40:47.300
changed to Firewater, which is
actually the total opposite.

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:50.780
So that's a pale ale, 5.5%,
very light and refreshing.

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:55.125
And I used the jalapenos,
instead of red chilis.

00:40:55.125 --> 00:40:56.532
We used them fresh.

00:40:56.532 --> 00:40:58.408
So it has a lot of
jalapeno flavor,

00:40:58.408 --> 00:41:00.745
but not [INAUDIBLE] on the
spiciness, but more the chili

00:41:00.745 --> 00:41:00.940
flavor.

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:02.523
And it actually
worked extremely well.

00:41:02.523 --> 00:41:04.374
I mean, that was one
of my experiments

00:41:04.374 --> 00:41:06.832
where we're like, oh shit, this
actually works really well.

00:41:06.832 --> 00:41:07.770
DANIEL BURNS: Very juicy.

00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:08.395
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO:
Yeah, it was

00:41:08.395 --> 00:41:10.110
just like you have
a lot of the aroma,

00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:14.550
you have a lot of fresh
jalapeno which smells awesome,

00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:17.219
but you didn't get that crazy
bite, you got a little bite.

00:41:17.219 --> 00:41:18.760
DANIEL BURNS: That
one's in the book,

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:23.956
and then I decided to
pair spicy nachos with it.

00:41:23.956 --> 00:41:25.910
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN:
They're delicious.

00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:28.410
The best nacho recipe.

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:31.150
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO: We have a
new beer coming out in the fall

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:35.980
that we just went to Lima,
Peru, to make a test batch.

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:41.580
So it's a porter made
with purple potato,

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:47.800
some Peruvian corn, and Peruvian
chili-- I forgot the name,

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:50.290
but it's not very spicy,
but it's extremely aromatic.

00:41:50.290 --> 00:41:54.000
It almost tastes like a
tomato, but a spicy tomato.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.350
So that one is coming
out in the fall.

00:41:58.350 --> 00:42:00.044
I'm excited about that.

00:42:00.044 --> 00:42:01.502
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN:
Do you have a--

00:42:01.502 --> 00:42:02.543
AUDIENCE: Yeah, actually.

00:42:02.543 --> 00:42:04.686
So curious, when you
go to other breweries

00:42:04.686 --> 00:42:06.590
and you're using
their facilities,

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:09.210
how much are you working
with the folks there?

00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:10.440
What's the interaction like?

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.750
And then, I guess, how does
that compare to working

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:15.217
in other folks' restaurants?

00:42:15.217 --> 00:42:17.550
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO: I mean,
I always make the recipes.

00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:24.050
And sometimes they
give me feedback,

00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:25.860
and sometimes I have
to change things,

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:28.626
because [INAUDIBLE] with beer
I make a recipe and that's it.

00:42:28.626 --> 00:42:31.863
But 10% oats, I use a
lot of oats, both in IPAs

00:42:31.863 --> 00:42:36.650
and stouts for the
mouth feel and all that.

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:39.530
Some breweries are just not
set up to use a lot of oats.

00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:42.821
They might come back and say,
you know, if we use 10% oats,

00:42:42.821 --> 00:42:44.570
we got to get a stock
mass, and it's going

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:46.410
to take us 24 hours to make it.

00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:51.190
And we got a [INAUDIBLE] and
then you have to adjust it.

00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:52.740
And I think it's
kind of a fun thing

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:55.031
to do what I do, brew at all
these different breweries,

00:42:55.031 --> 00:42:58.762
because it always turns you to
rethink what you do, you know?

00:42:58.762 --> 00:43:00.262
It's not like they
come back to you,

00:43:00.262 --> 00:43:02.630
you have to redo the whole
recipe. [INAUDIBLE] I might

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:06.130
make another beer, but
actually I have to adjust.

00:43:06.130 --> 00:43:09.786
Plus sometimes we go
to a certain country

00:43:09.786 --> 00:43:11.660
and I have an idea of
something I want to do,

00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:13.410
but I can't get the
ingredients, you know?

00:43:13.410 --> 00:43:15.590
Specifically hops in Asia.

00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:19.672
I brewed in Taiwan and Japan
and couple of other countries,

00:43:19.672 --> 00:43:22.590
and you know, it's hard to
get some hops over there.

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:27.250
And I might have this idea of
making this IPA [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:29.500
that works really
well with this hop,

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:32.010
but if I can't get the
hop, I can't do it.

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:33.435
So--

00:43:33.435 --> 00:43:36.550
DANIEL BURNS: So a lot
of conversations happen.

00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:41.790
In terms of working in other
people's kitchens or-- the most

00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:44.800
important, we've started to
invite guest chefs to cook with

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:50.000
us at Luksus, which is-- I
mean, it's-- you invite friends,

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.390
and it can be amazing.

00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:54.890
The thing about collaboration
is something good

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:56.340
is going to come out.

00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:58.190
You have no idea what
before you start.

00:43:58.190 --> 00:43:59.640
That's the thing
I love about it.

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:02.810
Maybe you're going to learn
about a new product that they

00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:05.830
bring, or some guy's
knives he brought.

00:44:05.830 --> 00:44:09.430
It can be anything that's
going to-- the coolest part is

00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:13.590
for the cooks to
bring-- [INAUDIBLE] just

00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:14.620
came from California.

00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:16.744
He's going to open up a
place called Single Thread.

00:44:16.744 --> 00:44:19.410
And, you know, he's
pretty known chef,

00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:23.580
so to expose just for the
cooks that you work with,

00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:27.510
trying to mentor, to
have them just plop

00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:30.950
someone else in the kitchen
and see how they work, and then

00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:34.290
further go into other
restaurants around the world

00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:38.040
to either cook with friends or
people you've never met before,

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:39.269
is really great.

00:44:39.269 --> 00:44:41.310
You send the recipes ahead
and then they're like,

00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:43.670
well, we don't have--
we're in Australia,

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:45.065
we don't have that right now.

00:44:45.065 --> 00:44:46.500
So then figure it out.

00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:49.700
Once you get there, that's the
coolest part, too, you know?

00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:52.300
We're all focused
on-- restaurants

00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:56.030
are places for
experiences for people,

00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:59.490
so you just try to maximize
that with-- and figure it out

00:44:59.490 --> 00:44:59.997
together.

00:44:59.997 --> 00:45:01.580
That's the coolest
part about cooking,

00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:04.310
because if you're going
to another restaurant,

00:45:04.310 --> 00:45:06.340
that's all they're
concerned with, too.

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:10.920
It's how happy the guests
will be by the end.

00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:13.500
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO: In
terms of what I just said,

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:16.160
one thing is when I go out
and use someone else's brewery

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:18.830
to make a beer, another
thing is obviously

00:45:18.830 --> 00:45:20.534
I don't just make my own recipe.

00:45:20.534 --> 00:45:21.450
I make collaborations.

00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:23.033
I collaborate on the
recipe, you know?

00:45:23.033 --> 00:45:25.319
I know there's a lot of beer
collaborators out there.

00:45:25.319 --> 00:45:27.610
I actually think there's too
much these days, everybody

00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:29.214
collaborating with everybody.

00:45:29.214 --> 00:45:30.630
I think it's
important when you do

00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:35.420
that, you have to bring in both
breweries' ideas into the beer,

00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:37.640
because sometimes you
collaborate and it doesn't

00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:39.050
fit either brewery.

00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:41.500
And I'm like, what
the hell is this?

00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:47.560
That would be like Daniel
and some [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:48.980
a French restaurant, you know?

00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:50.930
It would just be too weird.

00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:53.040
So when we do
collaborate, we definitely

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:54.430
bring in each other's ideas.

00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:56.860
And I have, oh, I like to
use this, I like to use that.

00:45:56.860 --> 00:46:00.730
I'm doing a pretty
cool collaboration--

00:46:00.730 --> 00:46:04.264
I did the first one, we're
doing the second one next week--

00:46:04.264 --> 00:46:06.240
with a brewery called
Trillium in Boston,

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:08.170
which is like the talk
of the town right now.

00:46:08.170 --> 00:46:09.920
And I love those guys,
became good friends

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:13.210
of mine, where we wanted
to do two different beers,

00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:14.960
an IPA that they're
famous for and a stout

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:16.660
that I'm kind of famous for.

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:21.230
So I gave them an
IPA recipe and they

00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:22.845
made a Trillium version of it.

00:46:22.845 --> 00:46:25.470
And they gave me a stout recipe
and I made an Evil Twin version

00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:25.630
of it.

00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:27.338
That's kind of a cool
way to collaborate,

00:46:27.338 --> 00:46:31.660
when we take something from
each other and rethink it.

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:33.940
Actually, if you've
been to our restaurant,

00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:36.846
if you haven't,
what is it, June 23?

00:46:36.846 --> 00:46:37.762
DANIEL BURNS: June 26.

00:46:37.762 --> 00:46:40.178
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO: June 26
is a good day, because we're

00:46:40.178 --> 00:46:41.770
bringing Trillium in to us.

00:46:41.770 --> 00:46:43.520
We're doing a big tasting.

00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:46.700
We're also doing a
special dinner at Luksus,

00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:49.260
where we only do Trillium
pairings with the food.

00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:51.635
Have you heard about Trillium?

00:46:51.635 --> 00:46:52.510
AUDIENCE: I think so.

00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:53.330
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO:
I mean, it's

00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:55.310
like probably the most
talked-about brewery

00:46:55.310 --> 00:46:56.650
in the country right now.

00:46:56.650 --> 00:46:58.820
It's insane.

00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:02.730
That's going to be a fun
day, so come to [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:02.730 --> 00:47:05.730
DANIEL BURNS: We're going to
sell out just by word of mouth.

00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:08.420
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO: They're
rethinking the IPA, which

00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:11.750
is crazy because the IPA
is like 400 years old,

00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:14.430
and people have
rethought it many times.

00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:16.980
Them and Tree House,
also in Massachusetts,

00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:19.144
have created this
new style of IPAs

00:47:19.144 --> 00:47:21.060
that is totally different
than just delicious.

00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:22.960
It's pretty cool.

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:25.572
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN:
One more question.

00:47:25.572 --> 00:47:28.030
AUDIENCE: I'm very honored that
you named some of the beers

00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:32.250
after my name, Jesus.

00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:34.250
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO:
You can pay me later.

00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:36.422
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN: Evil.

00:47:36.422 --> 00:47:38.839
AUDIENCE: Also baby Jesus.

00:47:38.839 --> 00:47:40.255
So what made you
make that choice,

00:47:40.255 --> 00:47:43.166
and what do you
think about the fact

00:47:43.166 --> 00:47:46.370
that some states have banned
the sales of your beer?

00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:49.160
JEPPE JARNIT-BJERGSO:
Oh, that's only cool.

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:51.129
I'm not a religious guy.

00:47:51.129 --> 00:47:52.375
Let me state that at first.

00:47:52.375 --> 00:47:53.083
I'm from Denmark.

00:47:53.083 --> 00:47:58.160
We are probably the most atheist
country in the world, I think.

00:47:58.160 --> 00:47:59.361
It's a long story.

00:47:59.361 --> 00:48:00.714
It was kind of a coincidence.

00:48:00.714 --> 00:48:03.057
It was actually kind of a
lost in translation thing.

00:48:03.057 --> 00:48:05.098
We were talking about
something, and at one point

00:48:05.098 --> 00:48:07.338
I said, "Even more Jesus."

00:48:07.338 --> 00:48:10.396
I said "Jesus" because something
was crazy, you say, "Jesus."

00:48:10.396 --> 00:48:12.320
And then something
was even more crazy

00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:13.972
and I said, "Even more Jesus."

00:48:13.972 --> 00:48:15.680
And this guy I had
this conversation with

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:19.110
was like, this is the
perfect name for a beer.

00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:20.110
I like the name, too.

00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:22.598
It's very catchy and--

00:48:22.598 --> 00:48:24.062
DANIEL BURNS: Stirs the pot.

00:48:24.062 --> 00:48:26.502
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN: It
does you good to be banned.

00:48:26.502 --> 00:48:29.430
JEPPE JARNIT BJERGSO: So now
we have bunch of Jesuses.

00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:33.030
You have a lot of
beers out there.

00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:34.030
Do you really?

00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:34.739
That's awesome.

00:48:34.739 --> 00:48:36.280
JOSHUA DAVID STEIN:
Well, guys, thank

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:39.490
you so much for
listening to us, and we

00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:43.940
hope to see you in Greenpoint at
Torst and Luksus at some point.

00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:45.490
[APPLAUSE]
