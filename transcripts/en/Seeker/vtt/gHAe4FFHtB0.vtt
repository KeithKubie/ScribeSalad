00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.600
Science fiction is filled with tractor beams.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.890
So real researchers have been working on making
that technology science fact.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:11.099
And we’re getting closer with a new acoustic
tractor beam that has lifted the largest ever

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.759
object: a 2-cm ball!

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:21.039
In the movies, tractor beams are beams of
some undefined energy, but IRL that’s not

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:22.039
the case.

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:23.480
Commonly, researchers use sound.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.050
The idea of harnessing sound waves for levitation
isn’t new.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.510
Scientists have been exploiting the properties
of air and sound to this end for a while.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.810
Remember that air is a fluid that behaves
like a liquid, even if we can’t see or feel

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.130
it the same way.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.910
And sound is a physical vibration, even if
we don’t think of it as such.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.320
Basically: harnessing acoustic power is harnessing
the lifting effect of physical sound waves

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.270
as they move through the air.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.110
The sound compresses the air in waves and
those waves correspond to the sound’s wavelength.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.530
Acoustic levitation uses this wave to balance
against gravity.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.850
The result is a free-floating particle that
looks a little like science fiction magic.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.540
Dialing in the sound waves means lifting objects
with extreme precision.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.680
The thing is, it’s not exactly a technology
that’s easy to scale up.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.221
Researchers have been struggling for years
to lift an object larger than the sound wave

00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:12.250
they’re using.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.860
Every time they try, the object spins because
the rotating sound field transfers motion.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.090
Eventually, the object ends up flying out
of the sound wave.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.310
But researchers have finally managed to control
this spinning motion by spinning the sound

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.490
wave instead.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.850
Using ultrasonic waves at a frequency similar
to one that only bats can hear, they created

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.990
a vortex of sound that they twist to stabilize
the beam.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.810
From there, they increased the size of the
silent core to where it was able to hold a

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.240
two-centimetre polystyrene sphere.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.590
It’s tiny, but it’s two times larger than
the waves lifting it, making it the largest

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.060
object ever levitated with sound.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.680
So, yes, the object is still tiny, but the
implications are huge.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.960
Relatively speaking.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.960
The researchers are looking ahead to using
very deliberately directed tractor beams to

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.140
move kidney stones through the body or direct
a capsule of pharmaceuticals to a target area.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.640
So, it might be a while before we’re lifting
humans, but the upside is medical advances

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.170
will be great until then.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.390
Thanks so much for watching, guys, and be
sure to subscribe for more Seeker.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.380
Speaking of medical advances, what if one
shot could give you all your vaccines?

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.250
Trace has more on that, right here.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.090
But on tractor beams, if you think about how
this works, it can’t happen in space.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.280
Without air there’s no soundwaves.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:27.030
We’ll have to harness some other energy
for our sci-fi needs.
