00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.440
HONEST TRAILER : DARK KNIGHT RISES

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.680
NARRATOR
From director Christopher Nolan,

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.330
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Comes the obligatory finale to his Dark Knight

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:15.330
Trilogy…

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.220
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
That clearly peaked with the Joker.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.410
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
The Dark Knight Rises…

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.939
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
The epic final chapter that will mildly entertain

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:23.340
you when you’re watching it…

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.029
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
But will ultimately anger and disappoint you

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:27.580
when you really start to think about it.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.180
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Revisit the iconic Bruce Wayne…

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.930
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
A man who turned the pain of his parents death

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:33.930
into a Superhero.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.860
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
But for some reason, mopes around for eight

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.230
years after his sort-of-girlfriend dies

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.860
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Suit up, as he spends the first 45 minutes…

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.000
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Hobbling around on canes…

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.100
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Getting knocked over easily…

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.330
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Growing a gross depression beard…

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.690
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
And be told that his body is in complete shambles…

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.980
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Even though in the entire trilogy…

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.090
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
He has only clocked in maybe a year and a

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.360
half as the Batman.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.370
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
But chaos will arrive in the form of BANE…

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.680
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
A villain who no one can fully understand.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.890
BANE
“?Days has casty ya strength?”

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.070
BANE (CONT’D)
“Where I learn the truth about despair”

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.050
BANE (CONT’D)
“The bat never ‘scaped”

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.360
BANE (CONT’D)
“I bon your schedule captain.”

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.530
NARRATOR
Prompting mope-man

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.250
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
To un-retire and plop on a magic knee brace

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.630
that will instantly cure him.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.170
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
So he can take Bane head-on for a few minutes…

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.440
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Until he’s crippled again…

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.850
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
For a huge chunk of the movie

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.760
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Leaving this mumbling warlord…

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.240
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
To fulfill his overly-complicated plot…

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.780
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Of terrorizing Gotham for 3 pointless months…

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.440
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Which prompts only one riot and no gridlock…

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.600
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Seriously, where is everybody?

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.460
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Get ready for a nearly 3 hour Batman movie.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.909
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Where Batman only shows up for about 33 minutes…

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.450
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
And when he does show up, He’s so terrible

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.450
he…

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.530
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Reveals his secret identity to complete strangers.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.590
JOSEPH
“When you started, why the mask?”

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.440
BRUCE
“Protect the people closest to me.”

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.700
NARRATOR
Never conducts background checks on his maids…

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.590
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Or his board members…

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.530
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Uses ineffective gadgets…

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.810
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Stands atop random buildings that are way

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.489
too dangerous to balance on…

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.610
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
And wastes several hours painting a bridge

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.610
in gasoline.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.019
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
A story so large in scale that it was partly

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.090
shot in IMAX…

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.709
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Which becomes super-distracting…

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.549
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
When it’s constantly changing aspect ratios.

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:25.120
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
And a film so poorly paced…

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.170
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
It moves slow for 2 hours…

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.939
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Then it randomly zooms through 3 months of

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.060
time without telling the audience …

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.069
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Forcing this completely rushed ending that

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.760
will leave you asking questions like…

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.730
RED LETTER MEDIA
Why are the criminals constantly hitting Batman

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.510
with their guns instead of shooting him?

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.279
RED LETTER MEDIA (CONT’D)
Why would the CIA let masked men on to their

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:46.999
plane without checking who they were first.

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:50.120
RED LETTER MEDIA (CONT’D)
How did Bane know about the existence and

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.529
exact location of Batmans secret armory?

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:56.389
Especially after Luscious said it was off
the books.

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:59.599
NARRATOR
And why has no one stumbled upon his huge-ass

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:00.599
airplane?

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.859
RED LETTER MEDIA
How did Bane and his henchmen hide motorcycles

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:04.019
inside the stock exchange?

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.480
RED LETTER MEDIA (CONT’D)
How is it possible that Bruce Wayne completely

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.139
healed his broken back in less than 3 months?

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:13.430
Didn’t he need a…doctor?

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.099
NARRATOR
How did Batman get from the hole in the middle

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.860
of nowhere into the quarantined Gotham money
or equipment?

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.379
RED LETTER MEDIA
Why would they send the entire Gotham City

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.340
Police Force into the sewers all at the exact
same time?

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.099
RED LETTER MEDIA (CONT’D)
If Tamalore knew he was Batman, why did she

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:30.549
let him wander off with Luscious?

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.209
RED LETTER MEDIA (CONT’D)
Why didn’t she just kill him when she had

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.209
the chance?

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.189
RED LETTER MEDIA (CONT’D)
In fact, why didn’t she just detonate the

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:37.379
bomb right then?

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.280
NARRATOR
And why does Batman talk to Catwoman in his

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.629
Batman voice when she knows he’s Bruce Wayne?

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:45.409
RED LETTER MEDIA
How come everybody in Gotham could figure

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:47.249
out that Bruce Wayne was Batman.

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:48.569
except for Commissioner Gordon?

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.239
RED LETTER MEDIA (CONT’D)
Even the character with down syndrome, played

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.200
by Joseph Gordon Levitt, figured it out.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.019
RED LETTER MEDIA (CONT’D)
Why did Bruce Wayne show up in a French Café

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.719
after being pronounced dead?

00:03:57.719 --> 00:03:59.870
RED LETTER MEDIA (CONT’D)
Think that would have attracted the attention

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:00.870
of the media.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.629
NARRATOR
How did Batman eject and swim nine miles to

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:06.760
survive if he only had 5 seconds on the bomb?

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.260
RED LETTER MEDIA
Didn’t anyone in Gotham think it was weird

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:15.139
that Batman and Bruce Wayne both died on the
exact same day?

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:28.069
RED LETTER MEDIA (CONT’D)
Bruce Wayne was Batman!?

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:33.479
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Ugh, I’m pretty weird about Man of Steel

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:34.479
now.

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.770
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Thanks to Red Letter Media, be sure to check

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:37.770
