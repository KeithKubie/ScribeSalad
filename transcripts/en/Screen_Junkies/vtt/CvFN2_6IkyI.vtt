00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.260
From the dumb car-racing franchise

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.340
that just won't run out of gas,

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.760
comes the third film that was one Vin Diesel cameo away

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.680
from totaling the whole thing.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.520
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.780
Return to the dark pre-Rock era of Fast and Furious

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.040
before Universal knew people actually wanted to watch these things,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.460
and try to get pumped for a Fast film, without any of the main characters.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.340
No connection to the first two,

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.640
and a needlessly complicated timeline,

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.520
but it does have the most actual street racing.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.540
Watching people lean to the side is fun!

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.100
Right?

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.640
WWWWEEEEEEE!!!!!

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.980
You've seen the cars and butts of Los Angeles.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.520
You've seen the cars and butts of Miami.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.020
Now, travel across the globe for the cars and butts of Tokyo.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.720
A city in the middle of a big retro-tech phase?

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.840
'Cause this takes place after Fast 6, and they still have flip phones, iPods, and Lil Bow Wow.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.420
(in movie) Ay, I know you sure ain't have a laptop.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.600
Enter the underground world of drifting,

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.480
a skid-based racing style

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.300
with an origin that sounds like total bullsh*t.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.680
(in movie) First drifters invented drifting out here in the mounds.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.780
But turns out to be more or less true?

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.540
Whoa, next thing you're gonna tell me NASCAR was invented by

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.340
rum-runnin' bootleggers.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.800
Whatâ€½

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.780
Next thing you're gonna tell me is the submarine chase

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.200
from Fast 8 is based on Real Life 2.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.660
No? You're not gonna tell me that?

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.820
Well, it should be! I'd watch the hell out of that.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.340
Meet an all-new family you won't be spending too much time with,

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.300
like: Han, the snack man;

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.740
DK, the gangster with an uncle complex;

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.160
his henchman with a weird laugh;

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.720
(laughter demonstrated)

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.080
various girl-shaped objects;

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.840
(in movie) Winner gets me.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.220
and a Little Bow Wow that goes a long way.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.600
Strap in, as they all take a backseat to Sean,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.400
a 24-year-old that looks like a 34-year-old, playing a 17-year-old.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.400
(in movie) He's underage..

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.520
Who against all odds, is the worst actor

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.320
in a franchise with Vin Diesel in it.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.340
(in movie) My ride. (others mock him for accent, which sounds Southern)

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.880
Thrill, as this good ol' boy street racer

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.380
struggles to overcome the same weakness as Derek Zoolander.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.980
(in movie) Can't turn left.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:47.680
(music and screeching tires)

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.300
(in movie) I'm not an ambi-turner.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:56.100
(music and screeching tires)

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.020
And struggles to deliver lines that don't sound like a badly programmed southern robot.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.940
(in movie) I did this, I can't run away. I can't.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.200
(in movie) So if you don't drift to win, what do you drift for?

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.280
No need to tell us you're not a trained actor on your IMDB page, man.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.400
We could tell.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.900
(in movie) No, I mean, not where you live.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:15.900
Where'd you come from?

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.480
So strap in, as director Justin Lin attempts the impossible:

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.340
Create a semi-passable sequel to Point Break with cars,

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.800
and Brokeback Mountain with cars,

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.500
without any of the actors or story lines that made them popular,

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.300
that managed to make audiences everywhere say,

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.080
"Man, I actually miss the subtle nuance of Paul Walker and Tyrese."

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.140
Good job?

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.520
Starring

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.980
Floor It Gump

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.860
Ya-Cruise-A

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.660
Hanging With Mini Cooper

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.260
*grunting noise*

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
and...Roll Tide!

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.020
Car Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Shift.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.060
When did he learn how to speak Japanese?

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.580
He can barely speak Alabamian!

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.520
Hey Screen Junkies!

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.900

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.240

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.820
Fast franchise.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.120
Yaba-Dana-DOO

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.640
I love my nachos. You can't have them!

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.140
Pineapple pickle pancakes prostrating profusely to the Pope. Three. Times. Fast!

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.380
I have rug nuggets in my ham.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.080
I want a wedgie and I want it now.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.140
Yass queen slay, yaaass.
