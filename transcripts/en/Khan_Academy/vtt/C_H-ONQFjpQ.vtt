00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.580
 

00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.360
In the last video, I showed you
what a neuron looked like

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.790
and we talked about the
different parts of a neuron,

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.480
and I gave you the general
idea what a neuron does.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.270
It gets stimulated at the
dendrites-- and the

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.730
stimulation we'll talk about
in future videos on what

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.480
exactly that means-- and
that that impulse, that

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.450
information, that signal
gets added up.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.480
If there's multiple stimulation
points on various

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.660
dendrites, it gets added up and
if it meets some threshold

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.310
level, it's going to create
this action potential or

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.380
signal that travels across the
axon and maybe stimulates

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.550
other neurons or muscles because
these terminal points

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.280
of the axons might be connected
to dendrites of

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.550
other neurons or to muscle
cells or who knows what.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.690
But what I want to do in this
video is kind of lay the

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.100
building blocks for exactly
what this signal is or how

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.350
does a neuron actually transmit
this information

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.980
across the axon-- or really,
how does it go from the

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.630
dendrite all the way
to the axon?

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.960
Before I actually even talk
about that, we need to kind of

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.400
lay the ground rules-- or a
ground understanding of the

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.120
actual voltage potential
across the

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.060
membrane of a neuron.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.070
And, actually, all cells have
some voltage potential

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.660
difference, but it's especially
relevant when we

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.110
talk about a neuron and its
ability to send signals.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.745
Let's zoom in on a
neuron's cell.

00:01:20.745 --> 00:01:25.580
 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.870
I could zoom in on any point
on this cell that's not

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.410
covered by a myelin sheath.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.520
I'm going to zoom in
on its membrane.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.470
So let's say that this is
the membrane of the

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.260
neuron, just like that.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.060
That's the membrane.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.970
This is outside the neuron
or the cell.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.730
And then this is inside the
neuron or the cell.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.220
Now, you have sodium
and potassium

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.370
ions floating around.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.920
I'm going to draw sodium
like this.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.900
Sodium's going to be a circle.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.770
So that's sodium and their
positively charged ions have a

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.840
plus one charge and then
potassium, I'll draw them as

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.340
little triangles.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.150
So let's say that's potassium--
symbol for

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.320
potassium is K.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.190
It's also positively charged.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.710
And you have them just
lying around.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.340
Let's say we start off
both inside and

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.230
outside of the cell.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:38.550
 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.910
They're all positively
charged.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.800
Sodium inside, some
sodium outside.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.010
Now it turns out that cells
have more positive charge

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.130
outside of their membranes than

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.410
inside of their membranes.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.830
So there's actually a potential
difference that if

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.450
the membrane wasn't there,
negative charges would want to

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.380
escape or positive charges
or positive ions

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.130
would want to get in.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.620
The outside ends up being more
positive, and we're going to

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.870
talk about why.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.140
 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.480
So this is an electrical
potential gradient, right?

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.300
If this is less positive than
that-- if I have a positive

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.790
charge here, it's going to
want to go to the less

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:20.540
positive side.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.820
It's going to want to
go away from the

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:22.870
other positive charges.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.310
It's repelled by the other
positive charges.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.610
Likewise, if I had a negative
charge here, it'd want to go

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.290
the other side-- or a positive
charge, I guess, would be

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.530
happier being here
than over here.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.160
But the question is, how
does that happen?

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.570
Because left to their own
devices, the charges would

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.840
disperse so you wouldn't have
this potential gradient.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.910
Somehow we have to put energy
into the system in order to

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.860
produce this state where we
have more positive on the

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.070
charge of the outside than
we do on the inside.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.530
And that's done by sodium
potassium pumps.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.560
I'm going to draw then
a certain way.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.810
This is obviously not how the
protein actually looks, but

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.870
it'll give you a sense of how it
actually pumps things out.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.700
 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.230
I'll draw that side
of the protein.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.760
Maybe it looks like this and
you'll have a sense of why I

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.050
drew it like this.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.010
So that side of the protein or
the enzyme-- and then the

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.640
other side, I'll draw
it like this.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.380
It looks something like this,
and of course the real protein

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.250
doesn't look like this.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.510
You've seen me show you what
proteins really look like.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.620
They look like big clusters
of things, hugely complex.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.570
Different parts of the proteins
can bond to different

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.150
things and when things bond to
proteins, they change shape.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.565
But I'm doing a very simple
diagram here and what I want

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:37.170
to show you is, this is our
sodium potassium pump in its

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.580
inactivated state.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.680
And what happens in this
situation is that we have

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.290
these nice places where our
sodium can bind to.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.940
So in this situation, sodium can
bind to these locations on

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.320
our enzyme or on our protein.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.470
And if we just had the sodiums
bind and we didn't have any

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.070
energy going into the system,
nothing would happen.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.270
It would just stay in
this situation.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.650
The actual protein might look
like something crazy.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.290
The actual protein might be this
big cloud of protein and

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.200
then your sodiums bond there,
there, and there.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.940
Maybe it's inside the protein
somehow, but still, nothing's

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.500
going to happen just when the
sodium bonds on this side of

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.670
the protein.

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.730
In order for it to do anything,
in order for it to

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:24.490
pump anything out, it uses
the energy from ATP.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.580
So we had all those videos on
respiration and I told you

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.530
that ATP was the currency of
energy in the cell-- well,

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.030
this is something useful
for ATP to do.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:38.280
ATP-- that's adenosine
triphosphate-- it might go to

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.160
some other part of our enzyme,
but in this diagram maybe it

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.220
goes to this part
of the enzyme.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.170
 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.390
And this enzyme, it's
a type of ATPase.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.760
When I say ATPase, it breaks off
a phosphate from the ATP--

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.410
and that's just by virtue
of its shape.

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:57.910
It's able to plunk it off.

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.270
When it plunks off the
phosphate, it changes shape.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:06.320
 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.510
So step one, we have sodium
ions-- and actually, let's

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.070
keep count of them.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.310
We have three sodium-- these are
the actual ratios-- three

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:23.570
sodium ions from inside the
cell or the neuron.

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:29.330
They bond to pump, which is
really a protein that crosses

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.920
our membrane.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.590
Now, step two, we
have also ATP.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:41.040
ATP gets broken into ADP plus
phosphate on the actual

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.350
protein and that changes
the shape.

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:51.635
So that also provides energy
to change pump's shape.

00:06:51.635 --> 00:06:55.780
 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.430
Now this is when the
pump was before.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.920
Now after, our pump might look
something like this.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.570
Let me clear out some
space right here.

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.200
I'll draw the after
pump right there.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.860
 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.400
And so this is before.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.460
After the phosphate gets split
off of the ATP, it might look

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.830
something like this.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.360
Instead of being in that
configuration, it opens in the

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.130
other direction.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.420
So now it might look something
like this.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.170
 

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.500
And of course it's carrying
these phosphate groups.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.775
They have a positive charge.

00:07:28.775 --> 00:07:31.470
 

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:32.310
It's open like this.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:36.390
This side now looks like this.

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:38.940
So now the phosphates are
released to the outside.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:40.300
So they've been pumped
to the outside.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.190
Remember, this is required
energy because it's going

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:43.870
against the natural gradient.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.290
You're taking positive charge
and you're pushing them to an

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:50.670
environment that is even more
positive and you're also

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.740
taking it to an environment
where there's already a lot of

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.625
sodium, and you're putting
more sodium there.

00:07:55.625 --> 00:07:58.370
So you're going against the
charge gradient and you're

00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:59.980
going against the
sodium gradient.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:03.550
But now-- I guess we call it
step three-- the sodium gets

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:07.090
released outside the cell.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:10.350
And when this changes shape,
it's not so good at bonding

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:11.490
with the sodium anymore.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.660
So maybe these can become a
little bit different too, so

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.410
that the sodium can't even bond
in this configuration now

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:20.080
that the protein has changed
shape due to the ATP.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:26.110
So step three, the three Na
plusses, sodium ions-- are

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.590
released outside.

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.700
 

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.760
Now once it's in this
configuration, we have all

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.820
these positive ions out here.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.480
These positive ions want to get
really as far away from

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.240
each other as possible.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.320
They'd actually probably be
attracted to the cell itself

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.820
because the cell is less
positive on the inside.

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:48.590
So these positive ions-- and in
particular, the potassium--

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:52.170
can bond this side of the
protein when it's in this-- I

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:55.550
guess we could call it this
activated configuration.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:58.570
So now, I guess we could
call it step four.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:01.400
 

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:07.260
We have two sodium ions bond
to-- I guess we could call it

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:12.680
the activated pump--
or changed pump.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.320
Or maybe we could say it's
in its open form.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.930
So they come here and when they
bond, it re-changes the

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:24.430
shape of this protein back
to this shape, back

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:25.590
to that open shape.

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:27.660
Now when it goes back to the
open shape, these guys aren't

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.510
here anymore, but we have these
two guys sitting here

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.930
and in this shape right here,
all of a sudden these divots--

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:34.660
maybe they're not divots.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.860
They're actually things in this
big cluster of protein.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:42.230
They're not as good at staying
bonded or holding onto these

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:47.290
sodiums so these sodiums get
released into the cell.

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:53.310
So step five, the pump-- this
changes shape of pump.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:56.636
So pump changes shape
to original.

00:09:56.636 --> 00:10:05.200
 

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.220
And then once we're in the
original, those two sodium

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:15.920
ions released inside the cell.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.990
We're going to see in the next
few videos why it's useful to

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:19.690
have those sodium ions
on the inside.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:21.360
You might say, well, why don't
we just keep pumping things on

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.420
the outside in order to have
a potential difference?

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:24.500
But we'll see these
sodium ions are

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.620
actually also very useful.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:28.870
So what's the net effect
that's going on?

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:35.930
We end up with a lot more sodium
ions on the outside and

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:40.420
we end up with more potassium
ions on the inside, but I told

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.940
you that the inside is less
positive than the outside.

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:44.300
But these are both positive.

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.850
I don't care if I have more
potassium or sodium, but if

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:50.760
you paid attention to the ratios
I talked about, every

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.290
time we use an ATP, we're
pumping out three sodiums and

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:58.860
we're only pumping in two
potassiums, right?

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:02.880
We pumped out three sodiums and
two potassiums. Each of

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.610
them have a plus-1 charge, but
every time we do this, we're

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:08.960
adding a net-1 charge to
the outside, right?

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.910
3 on the outside,
2 to the inside.

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:14.560
We have a net-1 charge-- we have
a plus-1 to the outside.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.770
So we're making the outside
more positive, especially

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:19.520
relative to the inside.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.840
And this is what creates that
potential difference.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.000
If you actually took a
voltmeter-- a voltmeter

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.770
measures electrical potential
difference-- and you took the

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:31.800
voltage difference between that
point and this point-- or

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.440
more specifically, between this
point and that point, if

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.310
you were to subtract the voltage
here from the voltage

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:43.710
there, you will get -70
millivolts, which is generally

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:46.650
considered the resting voltage
difference, the potential

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:49.910
difference across the membrane
of a neuron when it's in its

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:51.010
resting state.

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:55.180
So in this video, I kind of laid
out the foundation of why

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:59.190
and how a cell using ATP,
using energy, is able to

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:02.290
maintain a potential difference
across its membrane

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:06.490
where the outside is slightly
more positive than the inside.

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:08.540
So we actually have a negative
potential difference if we're

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:10.810
comparing the inside
to the outside.

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:13.260
Positive charge would want to
move in if they were allowed

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.880
to, and negative charge would
want to move out if it was

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.030
allowed to.

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:18.680
Now there might be one
last question.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:23.380
You might say, well, if we just
kept adding charge out

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.930
here, our voltage difference
would get really negative.

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:29.290
This would be much more negative
than the outside.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:32.030
Why does it stabilize at -70?

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:34.240
To answer that question-- these
are going to come into

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.550
play in a lot more detail in
future videos-- you also have

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:42.530
channels, which are really
protein structures that in

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:46.740
their open position will allow
sodium to go through them.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:48.550
And there are also channels
that are in their open

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:51.120
position, would allow potassium
to go through them.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.020
I'm drawing it in their
closed position.

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:54.890
And we're going to talk in the
next video about what happens

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:55.940
when they open.

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.700
But in their closed position,
they're still

00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:58.950
a little bit leaky.

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:03.530
 

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:06.560
And if, say, the concentration
of potassium becomes too high

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:11.530
down here-- and too high meaning
when they start to

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:14.560
reach this threshold of -70
millivolts-- or even better,

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.820
when the sodium gets too high
out there, a few of them will

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:17.680
start to leak down.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.060
When the concentration gets
really high and this is really

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.560
positive just because of the
electrical potential, some of

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.990
them will just be
shoved through.

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:26.930
So it'll keep us right around
-70 millivolts.

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:29.790
And if we go below, maybe some
of the potassium gets leaked

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:30.580
through the other way.

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:33.240
So even though when these are
shut-- if it becomes too

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:37.150
ridiculous-- if it goes to -80
millivolts or -90 millivolts,

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.410
all of a sudden, there'd be a
huge incentive for some of

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:42.700
this stuff to leak through their
respective channels.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.410
So that's what allows
us to stay at that

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:46.550
stable voltage potential.

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:48.500
In the next video, we're going
to see what happens to this

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:52.400
voltage potential when the
neuron is actually stimulated.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:52.900
