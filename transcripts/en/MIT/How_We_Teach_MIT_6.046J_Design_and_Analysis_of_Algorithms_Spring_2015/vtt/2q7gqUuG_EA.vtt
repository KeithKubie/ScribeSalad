PROFESSOR: Co-teaching
with Srini,

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.860
Professor Srinivas Devadas
is really a lot of fun.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:11.940
We've taught before.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.170
We taught the 6006
that's on OCW together.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.480
And Srini is I would say one
of the most humorous professors

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.500
that I know at MIT.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.040
So it's really a lot of
fun to teach with him.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.910
And I mean, sometimes
it's like a comedy

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.470
routine in his lectures.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.040
And I like to do that too in
lectures, tell lots of jokes

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.090
and play together.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.780
So it's really nice
working together.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.460
We have a good dynamic.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.289
We're both super
flexible, like, oh, I

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:44.580
need you to cover this lecture.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.109
Oh, no problem, I
love that stuff.

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:48.150
In fact, we were both kind
of fighting over which

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.290
lectures we wanted to teach.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.290
Because I was
like, I really want

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.790
to teach this-- no,
no, I taught it.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.370
I really want to
teach it this time.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.840
So that's a nice
dynamic to have.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.730
It's not like oh, you
taught one too few lectures,

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.140
it's not balanced.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.450
Totally not like that.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.560
And both in 6006 and
6046, in the last lecture

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.260
we do a kind of
actual comedy routine

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.570
where we're somehow
fighting each other.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.350
It's all in good humor,
and it's pretty fun.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.720
The students really like it.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.350
He's also-- in both classes
he has creative ideas

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.350
on how to reward students
for answering questions.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.010
So in 6006, we were in a
relatively uncomfortable

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.930
lecture hall.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.917
And so we had these pillows
that we had custom printed

00:01:35.917 --> 00:01:38.000
and had the name of the
class and a little Rubik's

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.410
cube on it.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.665
And so if anyone ever
answered a question in class

00:01:41.665 --> 00:01:43.040
or asked a good
question, then we

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.970
would throw them a pillow,
kind of like a Frisbee.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.435
And so for 6046,
Srini was like, you

00:01:48.435 --> 00:01:52.030
know what we have to do this
time is get actual Frisbees.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.400
And so we got these blue
and purple Frisbees,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.470
also custom printed
with the class number

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.640
and a little diagram that is
in lecture 20 or something.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.660
And so whenever anyone asked
or answered a question,

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.650
we would throw them a Frisbee.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.700
We'd make jokes about
whether blue was better,

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.400
or purple was better.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.240
There was no better.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.840
It was just--

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.230
So this was tough for me,
because I had to really learn

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.210
how to throw Frisbees.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.750
But I think by the end of the
semester, I got pretty good.
