00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.400
 The Framy application encourages creativity 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.320
 By making it possible to create animations and characters 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.840
 Using a wide range of real facial expressions.

 Clicking just a few buttons 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.100
 Framy can create movie-like effects 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.580
 Combine images with videos. 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.800
 But Framy is not just a tool for producing videos 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.440
 But also a basic system 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.620
 You can express yourself and your feelings. 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.520
 The app provides a great channel for sharing your custom animations 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.300
 Share stories inspired by your imagination 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.020
 With people all over the world. 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.020
 Google has a great deal of expertise and tools 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.660
 To help you create a successful app development business. 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.140
 He also introduced the Google Play app for Framy 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.300
 Lots of useful ideas and tips. 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.580
 For example, the Google Play app recommends a multidimensional design 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.700
 With Framy enabled from creation 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.780
 New design chart 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.620
 The interface is simple and unified. 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.140
 And during the framy establishment 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.200
 Developers also use it 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.420
 Various services provided by Google 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.260
 Such as Google's staged offering feature 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.040
 Framy is an application that includes many innovative new features. 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.500
 And through Google's staged offering feature 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.480
 The Framy application can offer new features 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.160
 To a limited group of users 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.800
 Based on their comments and reports 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.760
 We review the issues and make improvements to these features 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.040
 Before being put to the public. 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.720
 The subtraction feature contributes significantly to the stages 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.400
 Design new experimental features for the Framy application. 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.420
 Framy also used the Google Cloud Test Lab. 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.800
 This feature allows you to test the Framy application on multiple devices 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.900
 Saving a lot in terms of the number of trial users and the time taken. 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.026
 We can then make system adjustments according to device types 

00:02:02.026 --> 00:02:05.420
 Thus greatly improving the user satisfaction 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.800
 Towards the performance of our application. 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.240
 Among Google's various features 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.580
 Framy also uses Google Translate 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.940
 Which allowed the use of different languages 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.840
 Language barriers were minimized 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.000
 Through the Framy application page on social networks. 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.960
 This has led to tremendous improvement 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.700
 In app user ratings 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.300
 Which increased from 3.5 to 4.1 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.040
 The figure continues to improve. 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.640
 In the future, Framy will continue to implement the development process 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.180
 And the process of merging related Google services with its user interface 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.440
 To make a Framy application 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.100
 A unique application that is suitable for users and everyone enjoys using it.
