00:00:06.643 --> 00:00:08.412
In the third millenium BCE,

00:00:08.412 --> 00:00:13.806
Mesopotamian kings recorded and
interpreted their dreams on wax tablets.

00:00:13.806 --> 00:00:15.146
A thousand years later,

00:00:15.146 --> 00:00:17.248
Ancient Egyptians wrote a dream book

00:00:17.248 --> 00:00:20.654
listing over a hundred common dreams
and their meanings.

00:00:20.654 --> 00:00:21.863
And in the years since,

00:00:21.863 --> 00:00:25.650
we haven't paused in our quest
to understand why we dream.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.121
So, after a great deal
of scientific research,

00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:29.787
technological advancement,

00:00:29.787 --> 00:00:31.005
and persistence,

00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:36.443
we still don't have any definite answers,
but we have some interesting theories.

00:00:36.443 --> 00:00:40.937
We dream to fulfill our wishes.

00:00:40.937 --> 00:00:42.494
In the early 1900s,

00:00:42.494 --> 00:00:46.512
Sigmund Freud proposed that while all
of our dreams, including our nightmares,

00:00:46.512 --> 00:00:49.851
are a collection of images
from our daily conscious lives,

00:00:49.851 --> 00:00:51.901
they also have symbolic meanings,

00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:55.464
which relate to the fulfillment
of our subconscious wishes.

00:00:55.464 --> 00:00:59.154
Freud theorized that everything 
we remember when we wake up from a dream

00:00:59.154 --> 00:01:01.050
is a symbolic representation

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.535
of our unconscious primitive thoughts,
urges, and desires.

00:01:05.535 --> 00:01:08.489
Freud believed that by analyzing
those remembered elements,

00:01:08.489 --> 00:01:12.182
the unconscious content would be revealed
to our conscious mind,

00:01:12.182 --> 00:01:14.747
and psychological issues stemming
from its repression

00:01:14.747 --> 00:01:17.615
could be addressed and resolved.

00:01:17.615 --> 00:01:20.789
We dream to remember.

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:23.192
To increase performance 
on certain mental tasks,

00:01:23.192 --> 00:01:24.535
sleep is good,

00:01:24.535 --> 00:01:27.107
but dreaming while sleeping is better.

00:01:27.107 --> 00:01:28.781
In 2010, researchers found

00:01:28.781 --> 00:01:32.767
that subjects were much better 
at getting through a complex 3-D maze

00:01:32.767 --> 00:01:37.476
if they had napped and dreamed
of the maze prior to their second attempt.

00:01:37.476 --> 00:01:39.973
In fact, they were up to 
ten times better at it

00:01:39.973 --> 00:01:44.211
than those who only thought of the maze
while awake between attempts,

00:01:44.211 --> 00:01:48.739
and those who napped but did not dream
about the maze.

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:51.269
Researchers theorize that certain
memory processes

00:01:51.269 --> 00:01:53.401
can happen only when we are asleep,

00:01:53.401 --> 00:01:58.202
and our dreams are a signal
that these processes are taking place.

00:01:58.202 --> 00:02:02.544
We dream to forget.

00:02:02.544 --> 00:02:05.053
There are about 10,000 trillion 
neural connections

00:02:05.053 --> 00:02:07.615
within the architecture of your brain.

00:02:07.615 --> 00:02:11.510
They are created by everything you think
and everything you do.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.869
A 1983 neurobiological theory of dreaming,
called reverse learning,

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:19.490
holds that while sleeping,
and mainly during REM sleep cycles,

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.765
your neocortex reviews 
these neural connections

00:02:22.765 --> 00:02:25.329
and dumps the unnecessary ones.

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:27.095
Without this unlearning process,

00:02:27.095 --> 00:02:28.924
which results in your dreams,

00:02:28.924 --> 00:02:31.623
your brain could be overrun 
by useless connections

00:02:31.623 --> 00:02:34.962
and parasitic thoughts could disrupt
the necessary thinking

00:02:34.962 --> 00:02:37.303
you need to do while you're awake.

00:02:37.303 --> 00:02:42.815
We dream to keep our brains working.

00:02:42.815 --> 00:02:46.257
The continual activation theory proposes
that your dreams result

00:02:46.257 --> 00:02:51.551
from your brain's need to constantly
consolidate and create long-term memories

00:02:51.551 --> 00:02:53.294
in order to function properly.

00:02:53.294 --> 00:02:55.792
So when external input falls
below a certain level,

00:02:55.792 --> 00:02:57.331
like when you're asleep,

00:02:57.331 --> 00:02:58.914
your brain automatically triggers

00:02:58.914 --> 00:03:01.588
the generation of data 
from its memory storages,

00:03:01.588 --> 00:03:04.458
which appear to you in the form of
the thoughts and feelings

00:03:04.458 --> 00:03:06.848
you experience in your dreams.

00:03:06.848 --> 00:03:07.724
In other words,

00:03:07.724 --> 00:03:10.966
your dreams might be
a random screen saver your brain turns on

00:03:10.966 --> 00:03:14.200
so it doesn't completely shut down.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.145
We dream to rehearse.

00:03:18.145 --> 00:03:21.994
Dreams involving dangerous and threatening
situations are very common,

00:03:21.994 --> 00:03:24.072
and the primitive instinct 
rehearsal theory

00:03:24.072 --> 00:03:27.790
holds that the content of a dream
is significant to its purpose.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.650
Whether it's an anxiety-filled night of
being chased through the woods by a bear

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.188
or fighting off a ninja in a dark alley,

00:03:34.188 --> 00:03:37.657
these dreams allow you to practice
your fight or flight instincts

00:03:37.657 --> 00:03:41.720
and keep them sharp and dependable
in case you'll need them in real life.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.947
But it doesn't always have 
to be unpleasant.

00:03:43.947 --> 00:03:46.388
For instance, dreams 
about your attractive neighbor

00:03:46.388 --> 00:03:50.571
could actually give your reproductive
instinct some practice, too.

00:03:50.571 --> 00:03:54.512
We dream to heal.

00:03:54.512 --> 00:03:57.786
Stress neurotransmitters in the brain
are much less active

00:03:57.786 --> 00:03:59.839
during the REM stage of sleep,

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:02.428
even during dreams 
of traumatic experiences,

00:04:02.428 --> 00:04:04.174
leading some researchers to theorize

00:04:04.174 --> 00:04:08.632
that one purpose of dreaming is to take
the edge off painful experiences

00:04:08.632 --> 00:04:10.881
to allow for psychological healing.

00:04:10.881 --> 00:04:13.998
Reviewing traumatic events
in your dreams with less mental stress

00:04:13.998 --> 00:04:16.070
may grant you a clearer perspective

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.140
and enhanced ability to process them
in psychologically healthy ways.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.279
People with certain mood disorders
and PTSD often have difficulty sleeping,

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:28.199
leading some scientists to believe
that lack of dreaming

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:32.689
may be a contributing factor
to their illnesses.

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:37.364
We dream to solve problems.

00:04:37.364 --> 00:04:40.263
Unconstrained by reality
and the rules of conventional logic,

00:04:40.263 --> 00:04:43.269
in your dreams, your mind can create
limitless scenarios

00:04:43.269 --> 00:04:45.256
to help you grasp problems

00:04:45.256 --> 00:04:49.295
and formulate solutions
that you may not consider while awake.

00:04:49.295 --> 00:04:51.527
John Steinbeck called it 
the committee of sleep,

00:04:51.527 --> 00:04:53.024
and research has demonstrated

00:04:53.024 --> 00:04:56.612
the effectiveness of dreaming 
on problem solving.

00:04:56.612 --> 00:04:58.958
It's also how renowned chemist 
August Kekule

00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.879
discovered the structure 
of the benzene molecule,

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:05.180
and it's the reason that sometimes 
the best solution for a problem

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.920
is to sleep on it.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.293
And those are just a few of the more
prominent theories.

00:05:10.293 --> 00:05:13.856
As technology increases our capability
for understanding the brain,

00:05:13.856 --> 00:05:15.497
it's possible that one day

00:05:15.497 --> 00:05:18.059
we will discover 
the definitive reason for them.

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:21.942
But until that time arrives,
we'll just have to keep on dreaming.
