00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.940
 We all have some concerns when it comes to money. 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.540
 So I thought, why do not we use technology to help? 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.220
 Money Forward allows you to manage your financial information 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.100
 From bank accounts to credit cards, bonds and loyalty points, 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.700
 All through one application. 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.820
 You can check everything right away at a glance at your smartphone, 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.540
 Such as checking your income, expenses, current balance, and the like. 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:37.020
 All of this data is updated in real time. 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.740
 We asked about Google's multidimensional design after it was announced, 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.360
 It was helpful to us. 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.700
 In the first month we achieved a 30% increase in total users, 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.720
 And 7% retention rate 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.160
 We faced a 4% drop in the bounce rate. 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.240
 Using user interface models on display, 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.940
 We were able to create a great user interface for our product. 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.960
 We've found that tablet users are more likely to pay for 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.600
 In-app purchases more than 1.5 times the number of smartphone users. 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.280
 While it is likely to drive both smartphone and tablet users 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.020
 Almost tripled. 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.600
 Before using 3D design, 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.860
 We should have allocated a lot of time whenever there was an update to the operating system. 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.680
 Now, however, the Android Support Library ensures that even after the operating system is updated, 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.320
 The app will work the same way. It is a real provider of time. 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.840
 A good example of how to help us is CoordinatorLayout. 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.200
 There was one case where we developed an advantage 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.280
 Automatically hide the title when you scroll down a page. 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.720
 But this feature stopped working after upgrading the operating system. 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.680
 Fortunately, the Support Library now provides this type of functionality. 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.900
 Our Android Wear app will be compatible soon. 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.560
 You can now add to your account book using voice recognition. 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.740
 Also think about adding a feature to send a notice to users 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.200
 About incoming city balances. 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.260
 For example, "Payment on Monday" or "Your credit is not enough." 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.960
 As our service addresses sensitive customer information, 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.720
 We are very attentive to safety. 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.720
 This means applying strict security measures at every step 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.800
 From processing device data to encrypting transfers. 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.260
 Google provides us with the ideal platform 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.460
 To explore new technology and create great applications 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:40.860
 Hopefully it will have a positive impact on the lives of many people.
