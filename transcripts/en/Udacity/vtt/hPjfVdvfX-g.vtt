00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
As the problem states, we need to define this procedure.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In Python it's really simple. We just use "def."

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Then the name of procedure, which is supposed to be called "udacify,"

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and the parameters that it takes in.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We'll take in 1 parameter, and we'll call it "s."

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Don't forget the colon.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Now we want to return the result,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
which is the concatenation of the uppercase U plus the string that's passed into it.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
If we give it "dacians," it'll be called "s" when we're executing this.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We'll add "U" to the front, and we'll return "Udacians."
