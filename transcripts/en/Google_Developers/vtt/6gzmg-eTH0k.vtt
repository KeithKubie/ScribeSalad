00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:09.042
in this section we are going to 
take the sample gadget 

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:11.544
that we just created 
that gave gifts to our friends 

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:12.879
and modify it a little bit

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.749
so that we can see the gifts, 
after we have given them

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:18.485
we are going to start 
by modifying our give gift function 

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:22.022
so that instead of just updating data
it also requests data back

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:24.791
in our data request object we are 
going to specify that in 

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:27.427
addition to updating the views 
application data 

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:29.929
we also request 
information on the viewer 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.801
the viewer friends and the personal 
information storage of the viewer

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:36.870
in the load friends function, 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.738
we're also going to 
do something similar

00:00:38.738 --> 00:00:41.441
so that when we load our list of 
friends and our view friends

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:46.046
we also request the personal 
application storage of the viewer

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:48.381
we are going to make these two 
requests parallel each other

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:50.850
so that when we initialize the 
gadget or give a gift 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.821
we can send the callback 
the same set of information

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:56.990
then we modify our "onLoad" 
friends function

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.827
so that in addition to specifying 
the viewer and the viewer friends

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:04.130
we pull out the gift data which is 
the list of gifts that we've given

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.133
again, we create the list of 
friends as a selection menu 

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.769
and once that has been 
inserted into the page

00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:11.871
we call the update gift list 
function 

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:14.274
which will display the list 
of gifts we have given.

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:18.011
update gift list pulls information 
out of the data array 

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:19.179
that we have given it

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:22.415
specified by the view id 
and the key of gifts 

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:24.250
which is where our information 
is stored

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.321
we then take this data and 
convert it back from a "json string" 

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:30.457
into a javascript object we can use

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:33.493
once we have this object, 
which is a pairing of a friend id 

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:34.561
and a gift id

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:37.197
we can convert that into a string 
which specifies 

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:38.898
the friend that we have given the 
gift to 

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:41.367
and the gift we have given them

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:44.671
we can then insert this list 
into the page as html

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:47.874
Finally we make a small change to 
the gadget XML file 

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:52.078
so that we have somewhere 
to insert the html

00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:54.214
here's a new version of our gadget 
that now displays 

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:55.882
the list of gifts that we have given

00:01:55.882 --> 00:01:57.984
so that when I click on the give 
gift button,
 

00:01:57.984 --> 00:02:00.286
it shows up in the 
list below.

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:02.055
for more information on 
what i just showed you 

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:04.190

social API
