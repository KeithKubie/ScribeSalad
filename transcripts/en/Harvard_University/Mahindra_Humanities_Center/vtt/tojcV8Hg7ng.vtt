00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.170
It's a great moment for
the Humanities Center

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.820
to have Sari Nusseibeh.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:13.320
Here.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.360
And for me, personally,
such a lovely satisfaction

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.180
to have Sari and his family.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.590
They'd spent a year
here in 2008, is it--

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:33.610
2008, no, sorry,
in 2004, 2004-2005.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.330
And before that,
I had invited Sari

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.130
on an occasion with
[? Abishai ?] [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.400
for the three of us to have a
conversation about guess what?

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.440
The situation hasn't
been solved since.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.900
But we had a very
good conversation.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.610
And I particularly timed
it on a Wednesday morning.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.180
Because it was on
that day several years

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.800
before that Sari
and [? Abisahi ?]

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.180
used to meet at the Christchurch
coffeehouse, if I remember,

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.290
to talk about Middle
Eastern politics.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.250
So we decided to time it, do
it at the same time, of course,

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.910
with the time difference.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.450
And we had a really
excellent conversation

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.080
on some of the underlying
issues that have

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.420
informed this long struggle.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.970
Sari Nusseibeh is professor
of Islamic and Political

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.800
Philosophy at Al-Quds University
East Jerusalem, where he served

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.390
as president from 1995 to 2014.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.270
He taught at Birzeit
University in the West Bank

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.750
from '78 to '91,
when he was placed

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.430
on administrative detention
in an Israeli jail for three

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.990
months.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.520
He has founded and chaired
several grass roots committees,

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.740
unions, and NGOs, including,
in 2002, the People's Voice,

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.770
a [? bi-national ?] public
campaign for a two state

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.450
solution.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.390
His latest books include
Once Upon A Country,

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.280
A Palestinian Life, What Is
A Palestinian State Worth,

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.660
The Story of Reason in
Islam, and most recently,

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.640
[INAUDIBLE] Al [? shifa. ?]
He was the Rita Hauser

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.300
fellow at Radcliffe
in 2004 and 2005

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.650
and give the Tanner
lectures at Harvard in 2008.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.020
This is only one occasion,
one event during which

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.600
Sari will be speaking.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.180
Peter, can you give
me the other event

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.530
where Sari will be speaking?

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.030
[INAUDIBLE] this
Thursday [INAUDIBLE]..

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.615
This Thursday?

00:02:51.115 --> 00:02:53.140
Sari, forgive me [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.630
Well, it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:58.438 --> 00:02:59.380
I could look it up.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.713
Please, if you would at the end.

00:03:00.713 --> 00:03:01.302
And just--

00:03:01.302 --> 00:03:02.226
But what time on Thursday?

00:03:02.226 --> 00:03:02.688
What time?

00:03:02.688 --> 00:03:03.187
[INAUDIBLE]

00:03:03.187 --> 00:03:04.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.435
Still to be arranged, TBA.

00:03:06.435 --> 00:03:11.320
Everything apparently
still to be arranged by me.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.410
To the study of political
philosophy and social ethics,

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.990
Sari brings remarkable
blend of scholarly insight

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.680
and pragmatic
strategic intelligence.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.900
The depth of his learning
in medieval and modern

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.270
Islamic philosophy
is only matched

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.540
by the range of his
expertise in traditions

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.380
of Western liberal thought
and ethical theory.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.200
Sari's personal and
professional involvement

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.290
with many significant
Israeli-Palestinian peace

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.880
initiatives gives his
view a rare authority.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.100
While fully aware
of the importance

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.130
of pragmatic and
strategic maneuvers,

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.790
Sari conceives of the
process of negotiation

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.780
as an ethical practice that
must be fully committed

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.280
to the mutuality and
dignity of the antagonist.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.990
And it is from Sari that I have
learned very important issues

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:13.440
about the ethics of negotiation
sometimes deployed in meetings.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.390
At other times, just
conceptually speculative,

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.140
the idea--

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.779
I remember once
in a conversation,

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:25.720
that once you get into
the chamber to negotiate,

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.870
you have a chance of
making your opponent.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.010
Your opponent only doesn't
come to you as given.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.460
And then the other concept
that I remember is the--

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.530
I won't get the words for it--

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.330
is that one of the most
interesting ways of actually

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.380
riding past the obstacles
that people bring with them

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.370
is to put a kind
of idea or a goal

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.610
outside of the
immediate negotiation

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.670
so people always have a
horizon to work towards.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.070
And that gives a different sense
of scale to where you're going,

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.440
and what you're speaking,
and what gains you want.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:11.310
So I like this idea, which
is both partly a distraction

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.210
and a horizon--

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.060
interesting strategy.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.700
Negotiation for Sari
is a noble calling.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.120
He insists on the
necessity, however remote

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.410
or aspirational it may appear,
of open dialogue, in which

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.390
the commitment to
the Palestinian cause

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.380
does not prevent him from
seeing how aims, goals, and even

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:38.020
values come to be transformed
in the processes of negotiation.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.780
Even in the darkest
times, Sari surpasses

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.770
dogmas and orthodoxies
to suggest that in order

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.590
to reach a workable
agreement, there

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.620
has to be an ethical
commitment to the very process

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.600
of negotiation.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.610
The title of this
evening's conversation

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.160
comes from the question
Sari posed in a talk

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.980
he gave in Jerusalem
last December.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:03.350
What, he asked, would
sharing a city mean?

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.240
Sari, welcome, and thank you so
much for coming here and being

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.525
in conversation [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:08.525 --> 00:06:09.290
Thank you.

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:13.790
Thank you, [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.770
You can speak sitting or
you can speak standing.

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.270
You can do whatever.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.760
After you speak--
yeah, I forgot to say

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.540
we have three photographs
from [? Mikhail ?] [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:33.230
new book on Jerusalem, which
we will show after Sari's

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:36.290
conversation and just use them
as part of our conversation

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.730
and indeed, yours.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.500
She is unable to
be with us today.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.500
But I am extremely grateful
to [? Mikhail ?] [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.410
for allowing us to
use her photographs.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.570
I'm very grateful, too.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.610
If I sat will you hear me?

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:55.460
I mean-- will it sort
of be impolite if I sat?

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:56.328
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:56.328 --> 00:06:57.196
No.

00:06:57.196 --> 00:06:58.500
OK.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.820
OK.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.320
Well, thank you very much.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:07.470
First of all, I'd like to thank
[INAUDIBLE] for hosting me

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.300
tonight.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.710
He has a very busy schedule.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.950
And he only arrived
yesterday, I think, and is

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:15.740
traveling away again tomorrow.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:16.740
Pleasure to [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:21.840
And it just happened
that he managed

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.000
this particular meeting.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.250
And [INAUDIBLE] was at the
Radcliffe Institute the year

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:30.070
I spent there.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:33.450
And so we had a
wonderful time together,

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:35.160
together with other
colleagues, actually.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.670
And it was a
memorable year for me.

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:41.700
Some other colleagues are
here, present, I think.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.590
Melissa was here somewhere.

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:44.350
I can't see her.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:44.430
But--

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:44.670
Where's Melissa?

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:45.310
--there she is.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.220
That's Melissa.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.470
And it was a
wonderful combination

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:53.070
of people, sort of doing
physics and doing this and that.

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.770
And so it was a
wonderful year for me.

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:59.910
And [INAUDIBLE],, by the way,
is also an excellent cook.

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:01.140
So is Melissa, by the way.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.530
So I was asked to say
something about Jerusalem.

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:11.280
And in particular, about
the idea of sharing.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.130
And I haven't really
prepared anything.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:18.600
But I want to sort of speak less
than 20 minutes, [INAUDIBLE],,

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.010
if you allow me.

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:20.760
Whatever you like.

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:25.590
And then I can take questions
and perhaps address them.

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:30.480
Maybe I just want to start
off by saying that today there

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.620
were municipal elections
and local elections

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.380
in Jerusalem and
in Israel, in fact.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:40.770
And just like every other
year for the past 50 years,

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:45.360
I think, ever since
1967, only a tiny portion

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.150
of the Palestinians
in fact participated

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:48.990
in those elections.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.840
I think less than 1%.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.800
Although this year,
there was an attempt

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.680
by a group of Palestinians
from Jerusalem

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.750
to participate in
those elections.

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:01.980
But we can discuss this.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:06.000
Why is it that the
Palestinians in East Jerusalem

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.300
have, for all this
time, been opposed

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.670
to participating in elections?

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:16.620
And what does this mean
in the context of thinking

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.450
about sharing the city?

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:22.590
As you know, there are
perhaps between three and 400,

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:26.850
or perhaps a bit over,
Palestinians in Jerusalem.

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:33.330
And you know, they have
actually been living,

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:40.830
since 1967, in a very strange
kind of suspended situation

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.230
because they are not regarded--

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:47.070
East Jerusalem is not regarded
by Israel as occupied,

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:50.920
as the other territories.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.060
And it's annexed.

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:55.090
So it falls under Israeli law.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:59.770
And the Palestinians, therefore,
are residents in Israel,

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:03.550
insofar as they
are Jerusalemites.

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:06.880
But they have not, in the
past 50 years, been involved.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.880
They haven't themselves
accepted to become

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.920
involved in any of the--

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:16.300
as a community-- in
the municipal elections

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:19.960
or in any other
sort of institution

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.630
in the Israeli system.

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:25.540
Nonetheless, of
course, there have

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:28.870
been also seeking
to find, together

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:34.510
with Palestinian colleagues,
people in the rest of the West

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:37.990
Bank in Gaza, trying to find
a national solution, not

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:41.080
a municipal solution,
to their problem

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.180
in the context of a
two state solution.

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:47.410
And they've been involved
in the negotiations,

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:52.630
along with other Palestinians,
in the context of that attempt

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:54.130
to reach a two state solution.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:58.060
And unfortunately, as
you probably all know,

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:03.680
that process has not really
borne any fruit so far.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.420
And if anything, in
fact, it looks like--

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.850
looked at objectively,
rationally speaking--

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:14.950
it looks like it's
been a failure.

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:19.810
And that day after
day, year after year,

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:23.290
we're being pushed, I
think, both sides, maybe,

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:28.340
by default, into
a single system.

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:34.330
But not a system in which
the two parties are partners,

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:39.280
but it is a system in which
one party is basically sitting

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.540
on top of the other party.

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:44.480
And in Jerusalem in
particular, there

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:49.150
have been problems
that in a sense

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:53.530
exemplify this
very odd situation.

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:59.260
The problems have been
the slow, if you like,

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:05.950
displacement of Palestinians
in the city-- displacement not

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:12.370
only as individuals, but also
as a culture, as street names,

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:14.050
as properties.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:18.250
In the past few weeks, there
have been various attempts,

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:23.050
successful attempts, to take
over some Arab properties

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:27.550
in the old city, buying Arab
properties in the Old City.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.310
And this has created
a lot of noise

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:32.720
among Jerusalemites,
among Arab Jerusalemites,

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:41.440
as a way of expressing anxiety
about their status in the city.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:45.760
In other words, we are living in
a situation that doesn't really

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:50.200
give us much [? chance ?]
on the Palestinian side

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.980
to think in terms
of an equitable

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.320
engagement with the other side.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:02.717
Now this morning, I was
asking my son, my eldest son--

00:13:02.717 --> 00:13:04.092
you know, I was
telling him I was

00:13:04.092 --> 00:13:08.270
going to talk about sharing, and
what should I say about that.

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:11.200
And he said, well,
there are three ways

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.560
of looking at sharing.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.520
One is you divide things up.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.390
You have an orange.

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:19.100
And you divide it
up in the middle,

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:22.450
and you sort of give
one part to the one side

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:24.140
and the other to the other.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:28.180
And the other way of
doing it is to peel it.

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:32.270
And then maybe the other party
will take either the orange

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.720
or the peel.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.510
[LAUGHTER] And that
has to do with--

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:40.450
[TELEPHONE RINGING]

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:45.290
--that has to do with what your
needs are, or concerns are.

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:48.650
So you know, one party
may just need the peel.

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:50.220
So you give it to them.

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.760
And the other party
needs the actual orange.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:58.880
But the third way, he said,
was to think of it, or sharing,

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.410
as an idea.

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:02.520
And I told him what
does that mean?

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.840
And he said, well,
in sharing an idea,

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.990
there is no giving things
away to somebody else.

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:11.720
You maintain possession,
if you like--

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:16.490
you and the other of the thing
that you have before you.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:20.600
And he said to me, well,
Jerusalem can be like that.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.050
Jerusalem can be an idea.

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:25.940
And I thought about this on the
train today to see whether I

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:31.160
can agree with him
and decided I can't.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.190
Because I thought, well,
even as an idea, people,

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:38.720
different parties actually can
disagree over what the idea is.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:42.200
And we end up, in
fact, needing to

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:47.030
once again having to come
to terms with one another.

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:51.020
Let me go back to the beginning
and then to talk a little bit

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.090
about the word sharing.

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:56.480
When I first started talking
or thinking about sharing,

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:01.860
it was on the basis of listening
to my sons and daughter--

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.040
no, sons-- my daughter, not yet.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:07.220
But my sons telling
their kids, when

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.220
they started fighting
with one another

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:13.970
over a piece of chocolate
or a cake or something,

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:18.200
and I'll hear them
tell their kids

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:22.310
you should share with your
brother or your sister.

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:25.820
And I started thinking
about that, what that means.

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:32.240
And decided, really, what that
means at the end of the day is

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.690
that you should be able to
somehow respect the other--

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:38.960
your brother, in this
case, or sister--

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.870
as an equal individual being.

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:46.160
And when I started trying to
think about how to apply this

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.500
to Jerusalem, I
started thinking, well,

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.550
you can't really do any
sharing between Israelis

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.850
and Palestinians until
and unless we somehow

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:59.760
come to see each other
as equal human beings.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:05.160
Now at some points in
the past 50 years--

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.490
[INAUDIBLE] just
mentioned, for instance,

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:11.690
my longstanding relationship
with [? Avishai ?] and many

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:13.730
other examples--

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:17.390
at some points, I could
see that, in fact, Israelis

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:21.530
and Palestinians could, in fact,
look upon each other as equals

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:24.350
and respect each other
and, therefore, would

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:29.120
be prepared to share with
the other whatever needs

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.860
to be shared between them.

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.560
But at other points,
and unfortunately,

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:38.900
more and more in the past
few years, the demography

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:41.150
of the Palestinians
and of the Israelis

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:43.880
has changed to such
an extent that it's

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:47.960
become far harder
on our side to look

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:53.090
at the other party as people
with whom we can share

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:58.400
and for the other side to look
upon us as a party with whom

00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.840
they can share.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.700
Of course, it's
far more difficult

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.010
if you're thinking
of the sharing

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:06.980
when it's being done
between parties.

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:09.560
Then when it's being
done between individuals,

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:13.460
individuals can get along with
one another far more easily.

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:16.130
But when you're thinking
of the claimants

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:18.560
to Jerusalem, Israelis
and Palestinians,

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:22.130
and when you think of the
way that both sides, Israelis

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:25.010
and Palestinians, have
actually transformed

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:28.430
over the past few years,
transformed to the worse,

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:38.540
transformed in a way that makes
each side begin to think more

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:42.530
specifically, of themselves
and to exclude the other,

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:45.290
it sort of has become
really a very hard business

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:49.010
to try and see how
sharing can be done.

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:52.830
I still hope that the
miracle will occur.

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:54.890
I always hope that the
miracle will occur.

00:17:54.890 --> 00:18:00.800
After all, this is the Holy Land
and one should never lose hope.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.810
And I'm sure
something will occur.

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:06.830
But if you look at things,
objectively, rationally,

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:08.600
unfortunately--

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.820
I see that the
situation has been

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:14.360
deteriorating over
the past few years,

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.370
over the past 10, 15 years.

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:20.270
And I see that it's going to
be much harder to try and do

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:21.710
something about it now.

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:23.870
Recently, you all heard--

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:27.020
I don't know how
Trump sounds here--

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:28.798
how does he sound here, Trump?

00:18:28.798 --> 00:18:29.654
[AUDIENCE MURMURING]

00:18:29.654 --> 00:18:30.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:31.250
OK.

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:37.980
But you know I'm
mentioning him because,

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.670
referring to what
[INAUDIBLE] said just now,

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:45.810
that sometimes you
have to try and see

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:49.080
beyond the immediate parameters.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:53.580
And what's been happening
over the past year

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:58.330
with us is that the United
States policy, if you like,

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:04.480
Trump policy, has been trying
to make us back home to see

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:08.350
beyond the existing parameters,
beyond the existing parameters

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:12.850
that we've actually been
living with for the past 15

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:14.140
years of negotiations.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:14.920
Hydro?

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.870
How are you?

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:19.600
I understand it's
affirmative action somewhere.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.508
[LAUGHS]

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:29.640
So you know, that's the
kind of thing that might--

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.605
How is Trump making you
see beyond the parameters?

00:19:32.605 --> 00:19:33.210
He sees.

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:33.710
No.

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:37.050
But what about you,
when you hear about--

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:37.600
OK.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:37.960
OK.

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:38.530
That's good.

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:39.940
Thank you for asking me.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:45.920
So I'm better when
I'm asked questions.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.650
So please ask questions.

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:51.640
Now of course, we on
the Palestinian side

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.340
are really very
angry with Trump.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:59.560
Because we've been sort of led
to believe over the past 10, 20

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:03.010
years, through the Oslo
process before that,

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:07.630
that we'll end up basically
having a state along the '67

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:10.750
lines, East Jerusalem
as its capital,

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:13.360
the refugee problem will
be resolved in the context

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.190
of the Palestinian state.

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:16.710
In general, that was the--

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:18.720
and this has failed.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.620
Now Trump came along, or
comes along, and says,

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:23.350
forget about that.

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:25.120
Maybe you can think
about two states.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.370
But look at the wider region.

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:30.700
Look at the world
around you and think

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:35.140
about how this part of
the geography of the map

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:38.260
can be linked up with
that, how people from here

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:42.850
can be sort of linked up
with people from there.

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:46.780
And it sort of makes one
think of a future beyond

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:51.550
or a geography, if you
like, or a political area

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:57.400
beyond the classical two
state solution or paradigm

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.810
that we've been thinking of.

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:01.090
Now I'm not saying
this is a good thing.

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:05.600
And indeed, I mean, we look
upon it as a terrible thing,

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.810
as Palestinians.

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:11.710
But I'm saying
that maybe one does

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:14.950
have to look beyond
existing parameters.

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:16.510
I mean, at one point--

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:18.670
I don't know if you
realize this or not--

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:22.930
but what today-- for most
of us, for a lot of us--

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:27.850
seems to be a very sort
of classical solution

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:30.340
and rational solution,
which is a two state

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:35.890
solution, at one point, believe
it or not, was totally crazy.

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:38.410
It wasn't accepted at all.

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:43.180
It took many years after '67, in
particular, it took many years

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:44.960
until the Americans
came on board,

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:48.280
the Europeans came on board,
everybody came on board

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:51.040
for a two state solution.

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.950
And it was a lot of hard
work to get everybody

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.390
to accept a two state solution.

00:21:56.390 --> 00:22:01.750
So now to think or to propose
that a two state classical

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:04.330
solution isn't
necessarily going to work,

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:07.660
but other things might work--

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:12.670
Can you just tell us a little
more about the Trump proposals?

00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:15.190
What are the Jew
territorial ideas?

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:17.030
I mean, what will happen?

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:19.720
I don't really know anything
about, I mean, you know,

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:20.710
the Trump proposals.

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:24.410
But what I gather is
that he's trying to bring

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:26.680
in the rest of the Arab world.

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:32.830
And he is basically trying to
go along with an Israeli, also,

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:35.260
policy of trying
to what they call

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:38.170
normalize relationships
between Israel

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:42.310
and the Arab world as a
prelude, or as a condition for,

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:48.610
going ahead with developing,
giving more leeway

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:50.200
for the Palestinians.

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.900
Now I don't know how
far they want to go

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:54.760
in terms of giving a leeway.

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:57.520
I don't know how far Trump
has in mind or anybody

00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.920
has in mind for the
Palestinians-- do

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:04.930
they want us to have a state
or not, properly speaking.

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:09.320
But I think they're trying to
think of the entire region,

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.180
so to speak.

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:16.720
They have many ideas of
linking up the region.

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:20.740
For instance, the minister
of transport in Israel

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:25.750
apparently has very daring
ideas about railway tracks that

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:28.580
will bring everybody together.

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:32.500
There was a visit recently
of Netanyahu to Muscat,

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:38.080
in which the sultan
of Oman was basically

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:42.670
welcoming this kind of new
world order, if you like,

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:44.260
or regional order.

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:46.760
Now I don't know where we
will end up as Palestinians.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.240
Maybe we will ask--

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.030
Diaspora.

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:51.430
--yes, it's possible, diaspora.

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:55.030
But also it's possible
that we will end up

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:57.730
in a single system
with Israelis.

00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:02.410
In other words, by default
again, in one state.

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:05.050
Now I'm not sure whether
immediately people

00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:08.910
will be able to achieve
full rights in such a state.

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:13.300
Certainly, it doesn't look
like this way for now.

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:15.590
But eventually, maybe,
that's what will happen.

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:19.510
I mean, if you look ahead,
not 10 or 20 or 30 years,

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:22.211
but further ahead, maybe
that's what will happen.

00:24:22.211 --> 00:24:23.710
Maybe that's the
only thing that can

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:27.370
happen to get the Israelis
and the Palestinians somehow,

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:31.240
who are living in that
area, to in fact share

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.790
the entire political system.

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:37.360
A lot has to be transformed in
the psychologies and attitudes

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.270
and creeds and beliefs of
the people, the Palestinians

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:41.590
and Israelis.

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:45.010
But maybe that's the
only way to go forward.

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:46.860
So you've finished?

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:48.360
Do you want me to
ask you questions?

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.050
How do you want to play this?

00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:49.590
I think--

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:51.570
I should stop
myself from talking.

00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:53.240
Well, let me ask you this then.

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:59.340
Well, two things-- one,
if you look back 40 years

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:02.460
and you now look at
the situation now,

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:04.480
think of what you had.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.720
You know, the hopes
you'd had, the

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:10.530
plans you'd had for the region,
and now think of where you are.

00:25:13.809 --> 00:25:14.850
How do you feel about it?

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:21.680
In one word, very sad--

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.440
I think it's very
sad because I think

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:29.660
that we've been paying a
high price, both Israelis

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:32.990
and Palestinians,
certainly Palestinians.

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:37.580
And to my mind, you
know, paying a price

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:42.330
that we needn't have paid
in some way or another.

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:45.020
I think that maybe we--

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:47.480
in some mysterious way
we need to have paid it.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:50.270
But when you look
at it rationally,

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:54.271
you don't think that
it was necessary.

00:25:54.271 --> 00:25:54.770
Look.

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:58.280
I mean, I started
out many years ago.

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:02.540
The first time I actually
accepted a two state solution

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:07.190
was, believe it or not, when I
was a student here at Harvard.

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:09.830
And someone came--

00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:13.190
Professor [INAUDIBLE]
came to visit.

00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:16.010
And he gave us a talk, the
Palestinian, Arab student

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:19.340
community here, about
a two state solution.

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:22.280
And I remember feeling
very angry with that.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:27.530
Because at the time, my idea was
why should there be two states?

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:30.110
You know, can't we
all live in one state?

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:34.590
And can't we all have equal
rights, and so on and so forth.

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:37.460
But then slowly, that was in--

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:42.830
when was it, in '74 maybe,
or thereabouts, or '75.

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:45.020
And then I went back home.

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:48.110
I started teaching at Birzeit.

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:52.200
And I started learning
from the students

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:58.460
I was teaching about the real
needs, as opposed to the ideas

00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:00.500
that I had in my head.

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:05.840
And I started seeing that
the students' real needs had

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:10.910
to do with two
basic needs, which

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:14.060
were freedom and independence,
to be independent

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:14.780
and to be free.

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:17.390
That's to say, to
have their own state.

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:20.390
And therefore, I went
along, basically,

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:23.570
with the idea of two
states on the basis

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:27.740
that the students I was teaching
wanted a state of their own

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:30.020
and were prepared
to have a two state

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.060
solution alongside Israel.

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:32.950
And that developed.

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:36.260
And so I worked
very hard in order

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:38.840
to try and bring that about.

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:42.170
And as you know, I was
part of or involved

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:48.020
in, whether second track
or indirect negotiations

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:50.450
with Israelis for
many, many years

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:54.230
trying to bring that solution
about, a two state solution.

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:58.010
But unfortunately,
for different reasons,

00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:01.230
this hasn't come about.

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:05.060
And I feel sad about this.

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:07.490
And I feel that, in
many ways, maybe I

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:10.850
was naive at the time to
think that a two state

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:13.640
solution is indeed possible.

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:18.750
And although I
reject, in my head,

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:23.570
thinking about things
being inevitable and so on,

00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:26.750
but you know, I've begun to
think recently that maybe--

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:29.690
maybe-- the idea
of Zionism is not

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:32.750
something that, in fact, works.

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:39.090
It isn't something that can
coexist with another party,

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:41.360
with the Palestinians.

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:43.580
It was at one point.

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:46.290
It could exist, could have
existed, maybe, at one point.

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:49.220
But I think there have
been transformations

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:52.430
taking place within
Zionism, within the state

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:54.020
ideology of Israel.

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:56.990
As indeed, also,
unfortunately, there

00:28:56.990 --> 00:29:02.060
have been also transformations
on the Palestinian side,

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:09.050
with the ideology on both sides
becoming less inclusive, less

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:14.270
accepting of the other.

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:17.450
So yeah, in one
[? state, ?] I feel sad.

00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:19.930
You know, we had David Grossman.

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:21.710
I'd invited David Grossman here.

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:25.820
And he gave a very effecting
and beautiful lecture.

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:31.690
You know, his view
was very pessimistic.

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:35.410
But he said that we live in
these different bubbles there.

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:37.630
I mean, he was very
honest about it.

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:39.610
We may share a
whole lot of things.

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:41.740
He said within the
bubble in which I live,

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:47.860
I can say whatever I feel like
about the Zionist, Israeli

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:48.640
nation state.

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:52.630
And he was very, very--
he's very critical.

00:29:52.630 --> 00:30:00.170
But when you talk, and even
he talked about both sides,

00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:03.410
and we talk about the
question of sharing,

00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:07.610
you talked about the analogy of
your children, that your son--

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:09.140
what does it mean
to share an idea,

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:13.460
or to share an orange, or
children, please share a cake?

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:16.650
And as you said, there is
a sense of equality there.

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:19.850
You know, you wouldn't say
that because you're a woman

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:24.530
or you're a girl, you should
have a smaller slice of cake.

00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:27.110
But what is it--

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:30.380
I mean, how are these
two sides disposed?

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:33.110
Can we talk about
sharing as if people come

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:35.789
to the table in the same way?

00:30:35.789 --> 00:30:36.830
What's the point of that?

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:38.750
I mean, do they really
come in the same way,

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:42.860
or are there profound
structural differences?

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:47.900
If somebody comes to the
table hungry, really hungry,

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:52.250
you know, they would see it as
a right to take 3/4 of the cake.

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:57.860
The question of sharing,
then, is not some ideal order.

00:30:57.860 --> 00:30:59.900
It is a sense of need.

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:06.870
It is a sense of psychic
desire, from trauma.

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:11.090
So should we be
talking about this

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:15.260
with all these [? negotiatory ?]
balances, two sides,

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:18.580
or are we evading something?

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:20.590
If I understand
you, I'm not sure--

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:26.950
but I think that the two ways
of looking at this orange,

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:31.860
in this case, looking
at Jerusalem, one way--

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:34.870
and that has been the
classical approach--

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:40.880
is to say Jerusalem has
Palestinians, has Israelis.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:43.960
A best way to approach the
problem of the conflict

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:47.660
between them, the conflicting
claims between them

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:50.290
is simply to divide it up--

00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:51.910
not share, but to divide.

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:53.240
Divide it up.

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:56.440
Divide it up between
one side, which is then

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:58.990
run entirely by
the Palestinians,

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:00.460
and the other by the Israelis.

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:02.750
And this is the
classical approach.

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:05.920
So here you're dividing,
you're not sharing, in a sense.

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.240
And it's much
easier, much simpler.

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:11.440
It's sort of taking the orange
in the middle, or some point,

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.560
and cutting it in
half and saying, OK,

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:16.180
you can do with your
piece what you want.

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:18.520
And I'll do what I want.

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:22.120
But this has become more
and more difficult to do,

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:24.640
the actual geographic division.

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:28.300
And so now people sometimes
say, well, maybe we

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:30.530
can have a shared capital.

00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:35.140
So it's not a capital that can
be divided up geographically,

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:37.300
but it can be shared.

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:42.010
But the question is
how can this be shared?

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:44.530
There has to be, as
you said earlier,

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:52.060
for a proper sharing, some
kind of equitable recognition

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:53.690
of the one by the other.

00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:55.240
Now by recognition,
what do I mean?

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:58.540
I mean, respect for the
creed, for the religion,

00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:01.540
for the culture, for
the national memory,

00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:04.930
for the narrative, for all
kinds of things which it's

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:08.440
very hard to do
now for the moment,

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:12.100
which it's actually becoming
harder and harder to do.

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:14.600
But that's the only
kind of sharing.

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:22.210
Now it's possible to share, for
instance, services in the city.

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:23.840
Even if it's somehow--

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:28.420
with the kind of porous open
border, you can share services.

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:32.120
You can share a lot of public
services, most of them,

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:32.620
perhaps.

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:34.840
You can share lots
of things and still

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:38.860
maintain some kind of
equitable geographic balance,

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:44.530
demographic balance on
one side and the other.

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:46.310
I mean, things are possible.

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:52.540
But I'm not sure that people are
up to, now, talking about this

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:54.550
or reaching solutions about it.

00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:57.040
When we talk about
sharing, there's

00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:01.610
also some kind of sense
of openness of the object.

00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:05.260
Now without talking about the
Palestinians or the Israelis

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:10.330
for a minute, the whole
security apparatus

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:14.889
is such that the question
of exchange or passing

00:34:14.889 --> 00:34:19.840
is so difficult, with the
barriers, the surveillance,

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.929
the wall that skirts--

00:34:21.929 --> 00:34:24.949
you know, that divides
people's lands--

00:34:24.949 --> 00:34:32.050
the settlements that are a
continual imperial outrage.

00:34:32.050 --> 00:34:40.929
So it seems to me that,
Sari, I applaud your sense

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:47.949
that maybe 40 years from now or
a half, something will happen.

00:34:47.949 --> 00:34:50.025
But from everything
you have said--

00:34:50.025 --> 00:34:50.650
Something good.

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:51.858
--something good will happen.

00:34:51.858 --> 00:34:54.820
But from everything you've
said over the past 40 years,

00:34:54.820 --> 00:35:00.130
and indeed, the
trough now, it seems

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:01.870
very difficult to imagine.

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:06.700
So what is this
dream of progress?

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:08.660
Of course, one has
to live that dream.

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:16.510
But are there small instances
of the local state or local

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:18.130
initiatives that
would give us hope?

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:21.070
Because what you just said
about today's election,

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:25.720
where less than
1% of Palestinians

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:28.070
are represented
in the municipal--

00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:28.825
Participating.

00:35:28.825 --> 00:35:30.700
--or participated in
the municipal election--

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:32.990
I mean, that's,
like, a disaster.

00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:36.840
And people do say-- by the
way, I was in Germany recently

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.800
and the people from Haifa--

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:43.810
people do say that there is some
sense in Haifa of there being,

00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:49.000
at least at the level
of the civil society,

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.880
groups that meet with
some element of equality

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.260
in their discussions of that.

00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:57.540
I'm sure that happens
in [INAUDIBLE]..

00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:58.900
I'm sure it happens in Tel Aviv.

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:02.790
But none of it seems to
impact on the structure.

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:03.290
Yeah.

00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:08.904
I was talking about--

00:36:08.904 --> 00:36:11.320
if you like, when I was talking
about sharing and dividing

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:14.200
and so on in the context
of Jerusalem, of course,

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:17.260
I was not taking into account
the rest of the West Bank,

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:21.050
and even more, the
West Bank, Gaza

00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:23.940
kind of geographic situation.

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:27.639
And of course, in the context
of the present situation,

00:36:27.639 --> 00:36:29.180
you can't really
talk about anything.

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:33.560
I mean, there's nothing
really to discuss seriously,

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.480
positively, in a
positive fashion.

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:38.570
But what I was trying to
say was that, in a better

00:36:38.570 --> 00:36:43.070
kind of situation, in a
better kind of climate,

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:46.340
it is still possible to address
the different issues that we

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:47.240
have.

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:50.810
It is mathematically possible
to adjust the different issues

00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:52.610
that we have, whether
it's in the West

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:55.100
Bank or Gaza or Jerusalem.

00:36:55.100 --> 00:37:00.920
The problem is not that it is in
itself, logically, if you like,

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:02.510
a puzzle that cannot be solved.

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:06.697
It is something
that is political.

00:37:06.697 --> 00:37:08.030
And that is the problem with it.

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:15.030
It is what poses a problem
politically, but not logically,

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:15.530
I think.

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:19.430
So if the climate is changed,
and that is possible.

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:23.060
And what makes it possible
is what you just said.

00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:26.850
That if you go beyond
the surface a little bit,

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:30.320
if you look at society, if you
look at individuals and so on,

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:33.290
you'll find that actually
people, at the end of the day,

00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:34.820
are human beings.

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:36.500
And they often, at
different levels,

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:40.440
interact with one another as
equals and as human beings.

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:45.080
It is only when
they take on, they

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:49.040
put on the cloak of politics
in one situation or another

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:52.670
that then there is
a different dynamic.

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:57.830
But underneath, I think, there
are many cases, I believe,

00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:02.480
of people really
believing that they

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:06.320
are equal to the other side.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.571
I can't think of examples now.

00:38:07.571 --> 00:38:08.070
But--

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:08.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:11.240
Sari, if I might say--

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:12.920
I'll give you an example.

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.730
I'll give you an example.

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:19.640
So one good example,
I think, is this--

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:26.630
the Youth Orchestra of
Israeli and Palestinians.

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:34.100
And which gave me once the idea
of writing something to talk.

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:38.170
And this was a talk--

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:42.590
the context was
something called sound,

00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:45.980
or sound and identity,
or space and identity.

00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:48.660
And I wasn't sure what
to say in this context.

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:50.480
That's the conference
I was invited

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.700
to speak or give a talk at.

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:56.470
And I was sitting with
Lucy, with my wife,

00:38:56.470 --> 00:39:03.050
at the place where there was
a Youth Orchestra, Israelis

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:03.860
and Palestinians.

00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:06.930
They were about 14,
15, 16 years old.

00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:09.320
And they were practicing
singing together.

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:10.790
And they were singing.

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:13.040
And they sang a beautiful song.

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:15.210
You can actually Google it.

00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:16.940
They sang a beautiful
song called, "I

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:18.470
Want to Make This Your Home."

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:20.630
"I Want to Make This Your Home."

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:24.960
Now this is an Israeli
and a Palestinian--

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.470
not just, you know,
there were 10 of them.

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:34.640
And I liked I liked the title,
that I want to make this home.

00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:38.120
I liked it being
sung by the Israeli,

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:42.440
addressed, as I imagined,
to the Palestinian.

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:46.130
And I liked it being sung by the
Palestinian, as I imagined it,

00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:47.390
being sung to the Israeli.

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:50.450
And they were singing
it in Arabic, in Hebrew,

00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:51.710
and in English.

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:55.800
And I said to myself,
you know, this is great.

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.650
This is a new sound.

00:39:57.650 --> 00:39:59.660
And this is a sound
that is creating

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:04.670
a new space of identity,
an identity of sharing.

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:08.870
And I went home, and I worked
a lot about this, on this,

00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:12.580
and developed a whole
sort of concept.

00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:14.990
And went very happily
to give a talk,

00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:18.440
and actually brought
together with me

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:21.920
to that talk the orchestra--

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:23.010
what you call them-- the--

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:23.510
Choir?

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:24.270
[INAUDIBLE]

00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:26.070
Was it a choir?

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:26.810
It was a choir.

00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:27.860
No, we showed it on--

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:29.930
because it was in
Hawaii, the conference--

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:34.010
I couldn't take
with me to Hawaii.

00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:37.610
But he came, not
the entire group.

00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:40.950
But it made me feel good.

00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:42.240
It still does.

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:45.020
And I think you'll
find many examples

00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:48.290
like this, which gives us
hope, which gives one hope,

00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:49.580
gives me hope.

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:53.390
It is saddening, yes, that
it's taking us so long,

00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:56.900
that it's taking so much time.

00:40:56.900 --> 00:41:00.320
It is saddening especially
for me as a Palestinian.

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:04.550
Because as you probably know,
the pressure on this side,

00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:09.200
on the Palestinian side,
is far, far, far greater

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.810
than it is on the Israeli side.

00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:14.870
We are sort of at the
receiving end, if you like.

00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:17.000
We live in constant anxiety.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.270
We live in constant--

00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:20.110
I don't know if--

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:26.920
I don't know myself, even, if I
am sort of fully normal by now

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:30.280
as a result of the pressures
that we live under.

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:36.190
But even so, my
hope still exists.

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:39.490
And I think we should
all continue to hope.

00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:42.190
And I think if we all
hope, then you know,

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:43.490
we all can do something.

00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:45.060
Let me ask you
one last question.

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:45.925
Then I want to show
the photographs.

00:41:45.925 --> 00:41:47.940
And I want you to
just respond to them.

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:48.640
OK.

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:53.080
So you said a moment ago
that if things change--

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:54.770
and this is a very
big question--

00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:56.740
I don't know what should change.

00:41:56.740 --> 00:42:00.640
Should it change within
the Palestinians?

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:04.810
Which parties there, which
governmental structure

00:42:04.810 --> 00:42:07.990
should change-- this we can
have a conversation about.

00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:15.280
But I want to put the whole
issue, the Middle East issue

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:19.720
in the more general context,
in the context of Saudi Arabia.

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:23.140
In the context of the
United States where,

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:28.150
of course, from what you
say, Trump is very happy

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:33.220
trying to rethink a kind of
a federation of Palestinians.

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:36.340
Whereas here, you know,
Mexicans are not allowed--

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:37.380
children [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:39.520
I mean, so I just
consider that to be

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:44.230
a hideous way of displacing
what is on his doorstep.

00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:46.360
But then you have Turkey.

00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:49.400
You have the
problems in Lebanon,

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:53.260
where there are a
number of Palestinians.

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:56.630
But generally, this kind of--

00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:59.930
Hannah Arendt called
tribal nationalism,

00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:05.170
nationalism where the
leaders of the country

00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:07.120
set themselves up as saviors.

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:10.180
I mean, Netanyahu does
this the whole time

00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:12.160
with Trump's encouragement.

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:14.440
The enemy is not--

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:16.130
that they are the enemy, really.

00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:16.880
They're the enemy.

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:19.640
The majority is
the real minority.

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:23.560
And they need to recover
everything that they've lost.

00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:27.430
So with that kind
of world scenario,

00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:32.100
how is it specifically affecting
the claims of the Palestinians

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:32.700
now?

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:33.199
Now?

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:37.990
You ask a very hard question.

00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:41.020
I think-- let me tell you.

00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:44.170
I mean, the Palestinians
have actually

00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:51.100
been living in a state of
chaos in the past 10 years,

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:53.850
especially since the
death of Arafat, I think,

00:43:53.850 --> 00:43:56.790
and with the lack of progress.

00:43:56.790 --> 00:44:01.510
And in particular, in
the past few days--

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:03.270
you may have heard or
not, I'm not sure--

00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:08.220
but there's been problems with
the actual structure, the PLO

00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:11.400
structure that we've had for,
as [? our ?] representative

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:13.180
for many years.

00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:19.440
But in the meantime, for some
reason, and somehow or another,

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:22.110
the Palestinians have
actually been able,

00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:28.530
are able, are managing, to
bring themselves together again.

00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:33.390
And so, for example, I was
contacted at one point a few

00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:37.070
months ago by somebody
who came and said--

00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:38.460
and two and three people--

00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:41.860
to me, look, something is
wrong with the structure.

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:44.250
These are academics,
journalists, Palestinians,

00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:47.160
one living in Turkey, one
living I don't know where.

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:50.940
But they came and said--
and one Israeli Palestinian.

00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:55.530
And we should get together
and try and think again

00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:58.660
of what we should be doing.

00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:02.310
And so we started the whole
movement, if you like,

00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:05.730
of Palestinians, Palestinians
that come from the refugee

00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:08.820
camps in Syria,
Palestinians that

00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:10.560
come from Europe, from
the United States,

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:14.070
Palestinians from Israel,
from the West Bank, from Gaza.

00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:20.610
And they started the sort of
social media now people use.

00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:22.410
And they've been
trying, you know.

00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:24.360
They've been coming
together again.

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:30.400
And it's amazing how people can
come back and become one again.

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:33.450
And maybe we are just
one group among many.

00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:35.700
But I can see that
sort of happening.

00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:37.890
So in spite of everything
that's happened

00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:41.440
to us, in spite of the pressure,
in spite of the defeats,

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:45.840
in spite of the chaos, in
spite of the entire world, led

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:51.900
by Trump, being against us.

00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:54.540
I don't know why
or how, but people

00:45:54.540 --> 00:46:00.330
seem to be able to gather their
strength together, reformulate

00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:03.250
their structures,
their strategies,

00:46:03.250 --> 00:46:04.680
their ways of thinking.

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:06.510
And so I'm not--

00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:09.660
I haven't-- on the contrary, I
mean, I think I'm very hopeful,

00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:17.400
Palestinian-wise, of a future
in which we will be able to live

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:23.520
dignified human lives in our
homeland and not, hopefully,

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.830
at the expense of anyone
else who will live with us

00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:27.700
in equality.

00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:31.360
And economically, you
think this is viable?

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:31.860
Yes.

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:34.920
I mean, I think economically
the entire region can change.

00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:40.110
And economically, I think we
can look forward to prosperity

00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:42.230
in the Arab world.

00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:45.490
There's no reason why not.

00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:46.060
Thank you.

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:49.020
No mathematical reason why not.

00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:51.253
If politics is about
mathematics, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:46:51.253 --> 00:46:53.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:53.830
Yeah.

00:46:53.830 --> 00:46:56.210
Could we just have these
photographs, please?

00:46:56.210 --> 00:46:58.140
Thank you.

00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:00.530
So I'd just like
you to look at them.

00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:05.220
This book was launched
just a couple of weeks ago.

00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:06.550
And it's about--

00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:09.360
Is it very costly?

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:10.300
I can get you a copy.

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:12.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:12.110 --> 00:47:13.340
But that's the cover.

00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:17.030
And these are all pictures
taken from her window

00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:18.720
over a period of time--

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:19.220
Wow.

00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:21.290
--which overlooks the--
you know where it is.

00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:23.170
It overlooks the wall.

00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:25.207
Yeah.

00:47:25.207 --> 00:47:25.790
So these are--

00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:27.540
And you can see the
way in which the--

00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:30.410
because of the way the
photographs have been taken,

00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:32.390
they have a kind of
a vertical dimension.

00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:35.100
You know, there's a
layered dimension.

00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:35.620
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:37.020
I can't see the--

00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:38.248
Why don't you and I--

00:47:41.236 --> 00:47:42.230
oh, I see.

00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:44.410
So this is in the
actual precinct.

00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:45.000
Yeah.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:45.499
OK.

00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:54.320
I thought under the
gentle general terms

00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:56.900
of sharing the
city these might be

00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:59.210
some moments of a
certain kind of sharing

00:47:59.210 --> 00:48:00.565
you might want to talk about.

00:48:00.565 --> 00:48:01.773
Can we have the next, please?

00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:07.880
No sharing here.

00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:17.790
Yeah, third one, please.

00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:31.320
You can hardly tell who
these people are, right?

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:43.000
OK?

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:48.940
Oh, Sari, that, by the way, is
a reflection through the window.

00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:49.990
Uh huh.

00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:52.810
So it's been relocated
from being out of sight

00:48:52.810 --> 00:48:56.710
to being placed above the wall.

00:49:03.263 --> 00:49:05.040
When we were
discussing pictures,

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:13.300
photographs, earlier with my
wife and daughter and my--

00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:15.280
I think over breakfast--

00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:21.570
and now I want to try and
remember what they were saying.

00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:25.680
But when you have pictures
of Jerusalem, I mean,

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:28.320
one of the things
is that one has

00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:33.790
to take into account is that
you are supposed to think

00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:38.590
not only of what you see,
but of what you do not see.

00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:41.770
So the picture has
meaning in so far--

00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:48.120
not only as what it shows you,
but what it doesn't show you.

00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:50.950
And so often, very
often, you will, say,

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:58.300
take pictures, say, of religious
Jews in the whole city, say--

00:49:58.300 --> 00:49:59.590
many of them.

00:49:59.590 --> 00:50:01.360
And you will see
only that picture.

00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:05.050
And the idea there is that
you're not just seeing them,

00:50:05.050 --> 00:50:06.910
you're not seeing
the other side.

00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:11.360
You're not seeing the Arabs
in the old city or vice versa.

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:13.960
Now, in the first
photo, the photo

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:16.210
shows the two sides together.

00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:21.220
So Michelle has a pleasant
way of looking at life.

00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:25.595
I don't know, what the rest.

00:50:25.595 --> 00:50:26.970
I mean, I like
that picture, too.

00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:34.650
I just hope that this is the
place where something might

00:50:34.650 --> 00:50:38.520
happen that will be
horrible, that will

00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:40.800
be a kind of explosive.

00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:41.300
Yeah.

00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:41.610
Yeah.

00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:42.109
Yes.

00:50:42.109 --> 00:50:45.720
The actual precinct,
I mean, this

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:51.060
is the place where everything
can just blow apart.

00:50:58.410 --> 00:51:01.640
It's the place that's
actually under--

00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:03.930
you know, it's
what is contested.

00:51:03.930 --> 00:51:06.420
And you know, what's
contested is not the place.

00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:07.770
It's the narrative.

00:51:07.770 --> 00:51:10.350
It's the history.

00:51:10.350 --> 00:51:13.350
You know, it's the
acceptance of each other.

00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:21.800
And I don't know if
you realize, but one

00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:24.620
of the things that people
must be reminded, I think,

00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:29.660
is that when the Muslims came
to that area, there was nothing.

00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:35.630
I mean the Muslims did not
come and destroy an existing

00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:36.890
temple, for instance--

00:51:36.890 --> 00:51:38.290
Jewish temple.

00:51:38.290 --> 00:51:39.560
They did not destroy anything.

00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:41.740
It was a totally what's it.

00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:46.250
And so 500 years later, they
came and built something.

00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:49.400
It wasn't-- and in many
ways, they built it,

00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:55.070
in my own opinion, as a way of
commemorating the existence--

00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:58.370
but this is not a very
popular thing for me to say--

00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:01.530
the existence of the temple.

00:52:01.530 --> 00:52:04.420
In my opinion, this was
the whole idea behind it,

00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:07.860
that this was an
affirmation of a continuity

00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:10.680
of the Abrahamic religions.

00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:15.510
That's why it was built. It was
not to deny the Jewish history.

00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:18.750
It was to reaffirm
it, in many ways.

00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:21.110
And this is, again,
what makes it sad.

00:52:21.110 --> 00:52:24.870
That now it's the point
over which there is

00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:27.690
this contention of narratives.

00:52:27.690 --> 00:52:31.740
And it's where things will
be made or be broken here.

00:52:35.291 --> 00:52:35.790
it's the--

00:52:35.790 --> 00:52:36.360
Flash point.

00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:38.280
It's the flash point.

00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:40.260
Let's move to some
questions from the audience.

00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:41.670
Yes.

00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:42.758
Please?

00:52:42.758 --> 00:52:47.640
What can we do [INAUDIBLE]
responding to your--

00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:48.890
sorry.

00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:50.860
Do introduce yourselves,
if you'd like to.

00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:53.260
My name is [? Sophie ?]
[INAUDIBLE]..

00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:55.150
I'm an Israeli.

00:52:55.150 --> 00:52:57.910
I'm a scholar and scientist,
and biomedical scientist.

00:52:57.910 --> 00:53:03.970
But involved in activism
of a pro-Israel pro-peace

00:53:03.970 --> 00:53:05.230
organization, J Street.

00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:07.300
But otherwise, the
question-- just what

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:12.240
can we do such that such
explosion will not happen?

00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:14.690
Sari, can we take two
or three questions?

00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:16.110
There was one somebody here.

00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:17.150
And then there was
somebody there.

00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:18.180
And then the three here.

00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:19.560
And then we'll go.

00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:22.441
And maybe people can answer
questions, as well as ask them,

00:53:22.441 --> 00:53:22.940
please.

00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:25.355
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:27.490
Hi.

00:53:27.490 --> 00:53:28.090
I'm Kayleigh.

00:53:28.090 --> 00:53:30.400
I actually lived in
Jerusalem this summer.

00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:33.650
I was at the Mormon university
on Mount Scopus, studying.

00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:36.700
So I was wondering about
just the legislation

00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:39.340
that may be needed or
what your insight is

00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:43.030
on possible legislation
needed to maybe invite

00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:45.640
those ideas of equity
between the people, allowing

00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:49.180
similar rights of citizenship,
especially in Jerusalem

00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:51.010
with the residency
and everything.

00:53:51.010 --> 00:53:53.140
Just, possibly, what
legislation is needed?

00:53:55.930 --> 00:53:56.460
Hm.

00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:57.250
[INAUDIBLE]

00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:05.870
My name is [? Ghazi. ?]
I am a student--

00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:07.790
a master's student at
the Harvard Graduate

00:54:07.790 --> 00:54:09.530
School of Education.

00:54:09.530 --> 00:54:12.680
My question is, again, slightly
similar, slightly linked

00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:15.350
to the picture that we
have in front, as well.

00:54:15.350 --> 00:54:17.840
Is that, when we talk
about sharing a city,

00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:19.790
one of the most important
things in Jerusalem

00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:24.390
that has to be shared would be
the common religious grounds.

00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:27.410
And one example of
religious places

00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:30.140
that are not being
shared is Hebron,

00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:32.900
where the mosque of Abraham
has been forcefully divided

00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:34.886
between a Jewish quarter
and a Muslim quarter.

00:54:34.886 --> 00:54:36.260
So I just wanted
to get your view

00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:38.810
on how, if we do
talk about sharing

00:54:38.810 --> 00:54:41.000
from an optimistic
perspective, would we ever

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.610
be able to share the
religious sites that

00:54:43.610 --> 00:54:47.230
are present within Jerusalem?

00:54:47.230 --> 00:54:47.730
OK.

00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:53.240
What can we do?

00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:55.300
I'm not sure what can
be done, actually.

00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:57.320
I think the most
important thing is

00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:05.300
to maintain the
faith in the ability

00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:08.600
to get there at the end.

00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:11.030
I mean, things
are so distressing

00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:13.040
and so disappointing and so--

00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:19.220
that you need to exercise even
more effort to try and maintain

00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:22.370
faith in the
possibility of reaching

00:55:22.370 --> 00:55:24.600
some kind of equitable solution.

00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:27.110
And I think that
requires a lot of courage

00:55:27.110 --> 00:55:30.170
and a lot of commitment,
a lot of hard work.

00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:40.150
And to sort of try--

00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:41.200
I'm not sure, actually.

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:42.670
I think there are
many things that

00:55:42.670 --> 00:55:47.050
can be done at the level
of human interactions.

00:55:47.050 --> 00:55:50.110
And even abroad, I mean,
maybe, to try and get

00:55:50.110 --> 00:55:53.150
more support for a solution.

00:55:53.150 --> 00:55:56.420
I think it's very important
for Israelis or pro-Israelis

00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:59.750
and pro-Palestinians
abroad to try and make

00:55:59.750 --> 00:56:03.810
peace between
themselves, for instance.

00:56:03.810 --> 00:56:10.130
I remember, in the past, I
used to come out sometimes

00:56:10.130 --> 00:56:13.310
with an Israeli
colleague to sort

00:56:13.310 --> 00:56:16.730
of garner support for
a peaceful solution.

00:56:16.730 --> 00:56:21.200
And we'd find the
audiences there,

00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:23.030
abroad, in the
states, or somewhere,

00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:25.460
Israeli-- pro-Israeli
or pro-Palestinian,

00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:29.370
needing to have peace be made
among them or between them.

00:56:29.370 --> 00:56:33.290
So I think a lot
has to be done here.

00:56:33.290 --> 00:56:36.262
I think there has to be
encouragement for people.

00:56:36.262 --> 00:56:38.720
People have to encourage each
other who want to make peace.

00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:41.450
They have to continue
to encourage each other

00:56:41.450 --> 00:56:43.400
and give hope for one another.

00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:45.560
But I don't, sure,
you know, I don't

00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:49.459
have any specific answers.

00:56:49.459 --> 00:56:51.500
With legislation, you
know, we have a problem now

00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:55.920
with the next nation
state law which

00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:58.490
has made things even worse.

00:56:58.490 --> 00:57:05.241
And I hope sometime in the
future it still can be changed.

00:57:05.241 --> 00:57:06.990
It needs a lot of work
to have it changed.

00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:11.650
So it's not just
one legislation.

00:57:11.650 --> 00:57:17.150
I think there's a whole dynamic
there that needs to be changed.

00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:21.020
And with the Hebron,
I think you're right.

00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:22.820
But the most
important thing there

00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:28.489
is to somehow come to accept
the narrative of the other.

00:57:28.489 --> 00:57:30.030
I mean, I don't know
if you remember,

00:57:30.030 --> 00:57:35.510
but in the case of this
particular place, there was--

00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:37.450
Clinton came up with an idea.

00:57:37.450 --> 00:57:40.940
I don't know-- you know, during
the talks that were rejected

00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:42.290
at the time--

00:57:42.290 --> 00:57:46.700
in which she sort of asked
Palestinians and Israelis

00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:49.190
to somehow think of
dividing things up

00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:52.310
in their minds between
what's above ground

00:57:52.310 --> 00:57:54.860
and what's below ground,
what's in history

00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:57.020
and what's in existence.

00:57:57.020 --> 00:58:01.530
And it was a roundabout way
of basically saying, look,

00:58:01.530 --> 00:58:04.280
you know, the Palestinians and
Muslims have to-- the Muslims

00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:05.450
or whoever--

00:58:05.450 --> 00:58:09.270
have to accept Jewish
history in this place.

00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:11.430
This has to be recognized.

00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:16.040
But likewise, the Jewish
people or the Israelis

00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:19.790
have to accept now the
status quo in this place.

00:58:19.790 --> 00:58:24.950
It's a kind of
exchange of ideas.

00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:26.870
But I don't really know.

00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:29.840
I'm not very sure.

00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:34.550
But maybe we need another
messenger from God

00:58:34.550 --> 00:58:36.630
who will come and tell us.

00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:38.476
But you were going
to be that messenger.

00:58:38.476 --> 00:58:39.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:39.370 --> 00:58:40.910
You're not telling us.

00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:45.360
Well, I did think, yes,
I put in an application.

00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:47.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:51.110
But look, I mean--

00:58:51.110 --> 00:58:53.690
because I mean, it
just doesn't make

00:58:53.690 --> 00:58:57.210
any sense for those religions.

00:58:57.210 --> 00:59:00.340
And I mean, Jerusalem,
in particular,

00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:06.290
is just as important for
Muslims, Christians, as well as

00:59:06.290 --> 00:59:08.630
Jews.

00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:11.390
And they all revolve
around the same places.

00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:13.400
And it's a question
of maybe we have

00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:15.680
to go back to the
idea of the idea

00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:20.060
and try to sort of, somehow,
work on the idea of religion

00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:23.300
in the context of those people.

00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:28.400
And maybe when we do that, it's
possible then to somehow be

00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:31.870
open to other people, other--

00:59:31.870 --> 00:59:32.430
yeah.

00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:34.890
I mean, religions can be
terrible, as you know.

00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:41.120
And you know, it's in my
case, for instance, I feel,

00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:42.785
in particular, that--

00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:49.141
yeah.

00:59:49.141 --> 00:59:49.640
Yeah?

00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:50.139
Yeah.

00:59:50.139 --> 00:59:50.950
Yeah, right there.

00:59:50.950 --> 00:59:51.449
Yeah.

00:59:51.449 --> 00:59:54.804
So this may be coming from
a little bit of a dark side.

00:59:54.804 --> 00:59:55.720
Where's the dark side?

00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:57.170
Oh, there, Melissa.

00:59:57.170 --> 00:59:58.120
I'm the dark side.

00:59:58.120 --> 00:59:59.120
Melissa's the dark side.

00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:02.600
Just because, given the
constellation of world leaders

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:07.115
we have right now, anything
bad can happen and does.

01:00:09.830 --> 01:00:13.340
So from a different
perspective, two questions--

01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:15.090
what's the worst
thing that can happen?

01:00:15.090 --> 01:00:17.240
What would be the worst
move that would destroy

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:20.180
any possibility of peace?

01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:24.840
And what would be,
on the not dark side,

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:27.650
what would be a situation
where the Palestinians

01:00:27.650 --> 01:00:32.130
and the Israelis had to work
together just to survive?

01:00:32.130 --> 01:00:38.120
So what can you imagine
bringing them together?

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:40.650
Like a crisis, climate change--

01:00:40.650 --> 01:00:42.069
I don't know, something.

01:00:42.069 --> 01:00:44.360
And then what could you
imagine is the worst thing that

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:49.260
could happen, for instance,
Trump and Netanyahu could do,

01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:50.780
and what are the other guys--

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:53.500
the Saudi?

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:56.464
I don't think Trump and
Netanyahu can do things--

01:00:56.464 --> 01:00:57.130
I mean, as such.

01:00:57.130 --> 01:01:00.250
But what can happen
the worst thing

01:01:00.250 --> 01:01:06.250
is a series of tragic
accidents or incidents, one

01:01:06.250 --> 01:01:17.350
leading to the other, and ending
up with, maybe, a major effort

01:01:17.350 --> 01:01:19.570
to expel Palestinians.

01:01:19.570 --> 01:01:24.650
So sort of one act
leading to another,

01:01:24.650 --> 01:01:27.940
becoming more explosive
and leading to eviction,

01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:30.010
mass eviction of people.

01:01:30.010 --> 01:01:32.930
And that would be
a terrible thing,

01:01:32.930 --> 01:01:38.970
I think, a worse thing
for a long period of time.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:48.650
And what can happen is if the
Palestinians and the Israelis

01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:54.680
get together, is
if suddenly we see

01:01:54.680 --> 01:02:01.430
Netanyahu attended by a lot of
right wing religious leaders

01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:08.180
hugging up Hamas with leaders
and Muslim religious extremist

01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:09.150
leaders.

01:02:09.150 --> 01:02:11.060
I think if that
happens and people

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:15.315
see that, I think people
will come together again.

01:02:15.315 --> 01:02:17.850
Sari, there's this
gentleman in green.

01:02:17.850 --> 01:02:18.726
Could you-- oh, yeah.

01:02:18.726 --> 01:02:19.225
All right.

01:02:19.225 --> 01:02:19.790
Fine.

01:02:19.790 --> 01:02:22.122
Could you just distribute
the mic as you see people.

01:02:22.122 --> 01:02:23.330
I don't want to conduct this.

01:02:26.651 --> 01:02:27.150
Hi.

01:02:27.150 --> 01:02:29.010
My name is Robin.

01:02:29.010 --> 01:02:30.880
I wanted to thank
you for coming today.

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.490
It's wonderful to hear you.

01:02:32.490 --> 01:02:36.240
And I wanted to just address
this woman's question what can

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:36.880
we do.

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:38.820
I think the first
thing-- everything--

01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:40.170
that was a great question.

01:02:40.170 --> 01:02:42.169
I always think of that myself.

01:02:42.169 --> 01:02:43.710
But I think the
first thing everybody

01:02:43.710 --> 01:02:48.300
has to do is vote, whether
it's here or in Israel.

01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:51.690
We've all got to vote and
make our legal representatives

01:02:51.690 --> 01:02:54.180
accountable for what
we think is right.

01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:58.920
But also I wanted to say that
we can support all the arts.

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:02.010
We see Mohammed Assaf has
been out there creating

01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:04.350
a lot of national pride.

01:03:04.350 --> 01:03:06.210
We've had the recent
Palestinian film

01:03:06.210 --> 01:03:09.270
festival in Boston,
which was magnificent

01:03:09.270 --> 01:03:13.860
and very rich representation
of the arts Boston

01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:15.990
has a wonderful
Palestinian comedian

01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:19.890
who communicates
with humor, love,

01:03:19.890 --> 01:03:21.600
and tremendous national pride.

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.440
Who's that?

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:24.990
I can't think of
his name right now.

01:03:24.990 --> 01:03:26.530
Do you remember his name?

01:03:26.530 --> 01:03:27.880
I can't remember his name.

01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:30.120
And we have the center
of Arabic culture

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:35.730
which often has social events
that celebrates and promotes

01:03:35.730 --> 01:03:36.770
understanding.

01:03:36.770 --> 01:03:42.660
And so I just wanted to say
participating and asking

01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:45.650
ourselves what can we
do is really important.

01:03:45.650 --> 01:03:47.220
And if you can't
remember his name,

01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:48.636
can you remember
one of his jokes?

01:03:51.839 --> 01:03:53.130
Not right now, I'm too nervous.

01:03:53.130 --> 01:03:56.124
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:58.119 --> 01:03:58.619
[INAUDIBLE]

01:03:58.619 --> 01:04:00.116
Gentleman in the green.

01:04:04.022 --> 01:04:05.980
We don't know what the
Trump plan is because he

01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:07.670
hasn't presented it yet.

01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:09.910
However, he did make
the startling statement

01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:12.100
that the negotiations will
be easier because he's

01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:14.140
taken Jerusalem off
the table, which

01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:16.420
is really incomprehensible.

01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:18.187
Rumors of the plan,
though, suggest

01:04:18.187 --> 01:04:20.020
that it's some kind of
a rump state with Abu

01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:22.691
Dis as its nominal capital.

01:04:22.691 --> 01:04:24.940
And Israel, of course,
continues to refer to Jerusalem

01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:26.600
as its undivided capital.

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:28.990
So I'm wondering whether
this is really a red line,

01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:31.300
whether the protests in
Gaza or the beginnings

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:34.750
of a fourth intifada and
whether New Jerusalem really

01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:39.280
is, just to be very
specific, non-negotiable.

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:42.190
Jerusalem is
non-negotiable for us.

01:04:42.190 --> 01:04:46.510
We have to have
equal rights in it.

01:04:46.510 --> 01:04:48.168
It is non-negotiable.

01:04:48.168 --> 01:04:51.379
You're [? expecting ?]
[? a fourth ?] intifada is

01:04:51.379 --> 01:04:55.110
on its way [INAUDIBLE]?

01:04:55.110 --> 01:04:57.857
Gaza is under such pressure.

01:04:57.857 --> 01:05:00.315
Gaza is under such pressure,
people living in such poverty.

01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:08.280
They're living in such distress
that even if it explodes,

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:10.470
it will simply implode.

01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:13.180
And this is what's
happening with it.

01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:19.110
And Gaza has to be addressed
at the humanitarian level.

01:05:19.110 --> 01:05:24.090
And it needs
emergency assistance.

01:05:24.090 --> 01:05:29.700
It needs both Israel, as well
as the Palestinian authority

01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:34.320
to open up, to facilitate.

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:36.790
[INAUDIBLE] Egypt [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:36.790 --> 01:05:42.600
Egypt-- but you know, the
immediate neighbors and parties

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:45.000
that are responsible
are both Israel

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.290
and the Palestinian authority.

01:05:46.290 --> 01:05:48.330
And the Palestinian
authority has

01:05:48.330 --> 01:05:52.560
to look after the
people in Gaza.

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:56.280
And Israel has to enable
the [? EPA ?] to look

01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:59.400
after the people in Gaza.

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:01.616
But no, I don't think
there's an intifada coming.

01:06:01.616 --> 01:06:03.240
Although there's a
weekly, as you know,

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:06.690
there's a weekly
march, every Friday.

01:06:06.690 --> 01:06:12.270
Yesterday, three kids 12
years old were killed.

01:06:15.361 --> 01:06:16.860
Apparently, they
thought they were--

01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:21.960
but I mean, they were putting
out things for catching birds,

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:24.710
like 12-year-olds do.

01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:27.540
It's a distressful
situation in Gaza.

01:06:32.475 --> 01:06:37.400
[INAUDIBLE] a primary
barrier to the resolution

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:40.960
of the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict,

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:45.660
with the internal conflicts
among Israelis on the one hand

01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:47.950
and among Palestinians
on the other, which

01:06:47.950 --> 01:06:54.730
make the leadership challenges
extremely difficult. What hope

01:06:54.730 --> 01:06:58.280
do you see for
progress with respect

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:01.790
to the internal conflicts
among Palestinians?

01:07:01.790 --> 01:07:05.300
Because some wonder whether
there's going to be one or two

01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:07.100
Palestinian states.

01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:09.920
I mean, given the
rather profound division

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:15.970
that has at times led to almost
a civil war among Palestinians.

01:07:15.970 --> 01:07:20.930
With still more to come,
probably, in the near future--

01:07:20.930 --> 01:07:22.120
we didn't go into that.

01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:26.800
But yes, I mean,
we, as Palestinians,

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:32.700
have a major crisis at the
moment in our leadership

01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:36.240
as a result of failure in the
peace process on the one hand

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:42.530
and internal failures
on the other hand,

01:07:42.530 --> 01:07:47.250
in addition to the major
differences between Hamas

01:07:47.250 --> 01:07:49.240
and [INAUDIBLE] and so on.

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:51.490
So we have a major problem.

01:07:51.490 --> 01:07:53.140
And we have to deal with it.

01:07:55.832 --> 01:07:58.780
And the Israelis,
of course, do, too.

01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:01.670
The Israelis have
a problem, I think.

01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:02.170
Yeah.

01:08:02.170 --> 01:08:06.520
I mean, yeah.

01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:10.168
But so what's the question?

01:08:10.168 --> 01:08:11.740
Well, the question is--

01:08:11.740 --> 01:08:12.780
What?

01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:14.075
For what?

01:08:14.075 --> 01:08:15.950
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:16.450
42.

01:08:22.461 --> 01:08:22.960
Hi.

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:26.474
My name is Talal [? Jabari. ?]
I'm a Palestinian diaspora.

01:08:26.474 --> 01:08:29.830
I study at HKS.

01:08:29.830 --> 01:08:31.740
I thought it was
really interesting,

01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:34.450
the example that you brought
up about the orchestra

01:08:34.450 --> 01:08:37.569
and about forging
a new identity.

01:08:37.569 --> 01:08:41.500
And obviously, being a
Palestinian diaspora,

01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:43.029
as I'm sure it is
for Palestinians

01:08:43.029 --> 01:08:46.130
who live in the
Palestinian territories,

01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:49.319
it's such a central
theme in our life.

01:08:49.319 --> 01:08:51.279
And so I was
wondering, you know,

01:08:51.279 --> 01:08:54.319
in forging that new identity,
what that would look like?

01:08:54.319 --> 01:08:56.800
And if you could
elaborate on that.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:59.790
And thank you for coming.

01:08:59.790 --> 01:09:02.000
Well, thank you for coming.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.040
But how come you're a
diaspora person if you're

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:07.719
a [? Jabari. ?] I
don't understand.

01:09:07.719 --> 01:09:08.471
So--

01:09:08.471 --> 01:09:08.970
Yes.

01:09:08.970 --> 01:09:10.859
Go ahead.

01:09:10.859 --> 01:09:12.720
So my dad is actually Syrian.

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:13.990
My mom's Palestinian.

01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:18.770
But I first and foremost
identify as Palestinian.

01:09:18.770 --> 01:09:20.180
That's a different story.

01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:20.680
OK.

01:09:25.210 --> 01:09:27.460
Well, I think that
[INAUDIBLE] will tell us

01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:31.040
about identities and forging
identities better than I can.

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:32.620
But--

01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:33.687
Not tonight

01:09:33.687 --> 01:09:39.760
[LAUGHTER]

01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:43.640
But I think you can start with--

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:48.350
it's hard when you-- it's
easier when you're talking,

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:50.670
say, to a friend.

01:09:50.670 --> 01:09:54.620
And you can forge a kind
of identity between the two

01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:55.520
of you.

01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:58.280
And you can be anything,
and they can be anything.

01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:02.240
And the bigger the circle--

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:05.270
again, this is reverting
to another wisdom,

01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:08.210
piece of wisdom my wife was
telling us this morning--

01:10:08.210 --> 01:10:13.400
the larger the circle, the
larger the circle of identity,

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:17.210
the more difficult
it is to merge.

01:10:17.210 --> 01:10:20.780
So you have to start
small and work upwards.

01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:24.200
And I think if you form
a group, a small group,

01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:26.900
it can influence.

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:29.750
It can have ripple
effects, perhaps.

01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:32.310
But then, as Robin
was saying earlier,

01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:35.930
I think at the end you have
to be effective politically

01:10:35.930 --> 01:10:39.710
by actually becoming a
politician, at least by voting.

01:10:39.710 --> 01:10:41.600
I mean you have to vote.

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:44.640
But you can do far
more than voting,

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:49.610
You can be more
active in creating

01:10:49.610 --> 01:10:51.160
this kind of community.

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:53.780
There are many communities,
Israeli-Palestinian communities

01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:58.400
by the way that, I mean,
examples that we have

01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:01.310
that can be built upon.

01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:05.510
By the way, Robin, who spoke
before you is married to--

01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:09.800
I just discovered-- someone who
is a cousin, a distant cousin.

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:13.328
He's a distant cousin who
was born in Syria, too.

01:11:13.328 --> 01:11:16.260
[INAUDIBLE]

01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:19.040
There you are.

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:20.400
Yeah.

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:23.990
Can I ask [? Lucy ?]
Nusseibeh to speak?

01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:29.510
Because clearly, you
have been inspiring Sari

01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:32.170
with these various
ideas all day.

01:11:32.170 --> 01:11:33.170
[LAUGHTER]

01:11:33.170 --> 01:11:36.290
Photographs in the
morning, circles

01:11:36.290 --> 01:11:39.380
of identification in the
afternoon-- so could you--

01:11:39.380 --> 01:11:42.620
and have your own NGO.

01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:45.710
And could you add
to this discussion

01:11:45.710 --> 01:11:50.060
by answering the good Leninist
question, what is to be done?

01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:51.830
[LAUGHTER]

01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:55.110
Take a step back.

01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:57.690
I don't think I could
answer the question at all.

01:11:57.690 --> 01:11:59.090
Thank you very much for the--

01:11:59.090 --> 01:12:00.250
What should not be done?

01:12:00.250 --> 01:12:02.300
--invitation.

01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:06.950
I mean, I think I would
just add to what others

01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:10.610
have been saying, the importance
of really reaching across

01:12:10.610 --> 01:12:14.060
to the humanity of other people.

01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:17.270
That part of what
seems to be going on

01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:21.890
is this aim,
polarizing, at allowing

01:12:21.890 --> 01:12:24.530
us to dehumanize other people.

01:12:24.530 --> 01:12:27.320
And that it's important
to resist this.

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:31.040
And it's important to
resist the kind of despair

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:34.360
and discouragement
that is thrown at us.

01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:40.850
The kind of resilience that Sari
actually exemplifies and was

01:12:40.850 --> 01:12:44.870
insisting on, I
think, earlier, this

01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:48.640
is really incredibly important.

01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:51.420
Not just in the
Israeli-Palestinian context,

01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:55.170
I think, but in a
more global context.

01:12:55.170 --> 01:13:00.360
As we look around us, we
have to reach out and say no!

01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:02.400
This is not who we are.

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:06.530
And this is not how we will
accept seeing other people.

01:13:06.530 --> 01:13:11.380
We are insisting on
engaging with others

01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:17.950
as equal human beings with total
reciprocal respect, something

01:13:17.950 --> 01:13:18.890
like [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:18.890 --> 01:13:23.050
Lucy, can I ask you
whether these ideas

01:13:23.050 --> 01:13:26.050
of some kind of convergence
that you were talking

01:13:26.050 --> 01:13:28.600
about happened at
different levels,

01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:30.460
are there any in Jerusalem?

01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:32.860
Are there any
state institutions,

01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:35.290
or are there
national institutions

01:13:35.290 --> 01:13:36.340
that give you hope?

01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:40.000
For instance, in India, we
do have the Supreme Court.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.120
And give or take, we have
hope in the Supreme Court

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:48.160
that minorities, social
justice issues will be,

01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:54.220
not always, but quite often
welcomed and hospitably dealt

01:13:54.220 --> 01:13:55.000
with.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.970
Are there any institutions in--

01:13:57.970 --> 01:13:59.050
for both of you--

01:13:59.050 --> 01:14:04.510
in the Israel-Palestinian
confluence

01:14:04.510 --> 01:14:08.500
that give you hope for the
future or for the present?

01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:13.520
I think there used to be.

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:16.580
I can't think of
any at the moment.

01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:19.120
There is an interesting
case recently of--

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:20.130
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:14:20.130 --> 01:14:20.980
No, no, no.

01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:23.960
But I was going to say there
is an interesting case of the--

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:26.300
because you know, you would
say the Supreme Court,

01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:27.270
for instance.

01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:29.690
But in Israel, in
particular, that

01:14:29.690 --> 01:14:32.580
has been influenced by politics.

01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:35.420
And so it's not as
reliable as it was.

01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:38.510
But most recently,
for instance, there

01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:42.860
was this case of the
American Palestinian student

01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:46.580
who was coming in to study
at the Hebrew University.

01:14:46.580 --> 01:14:50.000
And she was prevented from
doing so to begin with.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:56.120
And actually, one of the things
that made her case stronger,

01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:58.580
that eventually
made a difference,

01:14:58.580 --> 01:15:01.850
was the fact that the
Hebrew University itself

01:15:01.850 --> 01:15:05.180
and the academics there, or
a sufficient number of them,

01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:08.400
stood up for her and
made a whole thing.

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:11.300
And so finally, she is now at
the Hebrew University studying.

01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:15.320
[? Roger ?] [INAUDIBLE].

01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:16.030
Speak without the mic?

01:15:16.030 --> 01:15:16.530
Yeah.

01:15:16.530 --> 01:15:18.900
We don't need mics here.

01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:24.790
The case you've just raised
is very interesting to me

01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:25.290
personally.

01:15:25.290 --> 01:15:31.230
Because that young woman
was interested in pursuing

01:15:31.230 --> 01:15:36.675
the study of international human
rights at Hebrew University,

01:15:36.675 --> 01:15:41.150
which makes the denial of her
entry all the more poignant.

01:15:41.150 --> 01:15:43.951
But as I understand
it, one of the facts

01:15:43.951 --> 01:15:48.861
that counted in her favor is
that although at an earlier

01:15:48.861 --> 01:15:52.298
point in her studies as
a student [INAUDIBLE],,

01:15:52.298 --> 01:15:55.735
she had been a proponent of the
boycott [INAUDIBLE] sanction

01:15:55.735 --> 01:16:01.136
that she had later
renounced that stance

01:16:01.136 --> 01:16:04.475
and that this
counted in her favor.

01:16:04.475 --> 01:16:06.850
I'm perhaps putting
you on the spot.

01:16:06.850 --> 01:16:10.238
Could-- at least
among diapora Jews

01:16:10.238 --> 01:16:14.174
who oppose current
Israeli policy,

01:16:14.174 --> 01:16:17.864
the BDS movement is
usually seen as one

01:16:17.864 --> 01:16:23.522
of the most divisive factors.

01:16:23.522 --> 01:16:27.950
Friends of mine, like
[INAUDIBLE],, no relation,

01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:33.035
apparently, who supported are
ostracized by certain portions

01:16:33.035 --> 01:16:35.240
of the Jewish community.

01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:37.690
And her case, in particular,
was very interesting,

01:16:37.690 --> 01:16:40.140
[INAUDIBLE] where her
renunciation of that tactic

01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:43.090
seems to have played a
role in her admission.

01:16:43.090 --> 01:16:46.167
And I'm curious,
from your perspective

01:16:46.167 --> 01:16:51.354
on the Palestinian
side, whether BDS

01:16:51.354 --> 01:16:57.776
seems to have any
constructive role to play

01:16:57.776 --> 01:17:07.180
or whether it's seen as largely
irrelevant to [INAUDIBLE]..

01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:11.860
So this is putting me
on this on the spot.

01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:14.750
It's a very difficult question.

01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:19.580
Look, let me start
somewhere else on BDS.

01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:23.890
Because normally, when people
talk, the Palestinians talk

01:17:23.890 --> 01:17:27.280
about BDS, they not
only are thinking

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:29.860
of Americans or Europeans.

01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:31.960
They're thinking
of Palestinians.

01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:37.090
And they're saying basically
that, in Palestine itself,

01:17:37.090 --> 01:17:40.675
we, the Palestinians,
should boycott

01:17:40.675 --> 01:17:43.240
our counterparts, Israelis.

01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:44.360
So what does that mean?

01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:47.020
It means basically
boycotting everything--

01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:50.972
from the economic to the
trade to the commerce to this,

01:17:50.972 --> 01:17:51.760
to this--

01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:53.320
right up to the
negotiation level.

01:17:58.100 --> 01:18:00.940
This is something
that is, I think,

01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:04.450
a thing entirely
separate from the call

01:18:04.450 --> 01:18:09.700
for Europeans or Americans
to boycott Israel, right?

01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:12.520
And you know, I would argue
very strongly, personally,

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:15.820
that the level of the
Palestinians, the thrust,

01:18:15.820 --> 01:18:20.380
the force shouldn't be
to boycott, but to do

01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:24.640
the opposite, to engage.

01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:27.430
Because that is the way
to bring the Israelis

01:18:27.430 --> 01:18:31.340
and the Palestinians
closer to one another.

01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:37.240
Now concerning the outside,
now, I think it varies.

01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:40.660
As far as the Jewish
community is concerned,

01:18:40.660 --> 01:18:45.820
I think this is a situation
that has to be solved

01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:47.570
within the Jewish community.

01:18:47.570 --> 01:18:52.060
But I'll tell you as far as
the non-Jewish community is

01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:53.140
concerned.

01:18:53.140 --> 01:18:57.310
Because in the past,
I've had situations

01:18:57.310 --> 01:19:03.400
where more than once someone
was invited to Israel

01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:06.310
to participate in a talk at
the Hebrew University or Tel

01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:07.750
Aviv or somewhere--

01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:10.060
would write to me and say,
look, I've been invited.

01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:11.350
I'm worried about this BDS.

01:19:11.350 --> 01:19:12.550
What do you think?

01:19:12.550 --> 01:19:18.010
And can I come and give a
talk at your university,

01:19:18.010 --> 01:19:20.660
somehow, to sort
of balance this.

01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:27.260
And my reaction
would have been, was,

01:19:27.260 --> 01:19:29.680
in fact, on more
than one occasion,

01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:32.560
that they should make
up their own minds what

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:34.430
they wanted to do.

01:19:34.430 --> 01:19:39.340
But in any case, if they
decided to come and participate

01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:45.130
in whatever, then they would
be welcome to come and give

01:19:45.130 --> 01:19:49.480
a talk at our place,
but not to use the fact

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:52.480
that they are coming to give
a talk at our university

01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:57.760
as a kind of justification
to go and talk over there.

01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:02.020
But they have to go through
the ethical, if you like,

01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:04.180
management processing
themselves.

01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:11.420
They have to decide what best
fits their moral bearings.

01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:13.330
Now has it been useful?

01:20:13.330 --> 01:20:18.070
In many ways, the campaign
for BDS in American campuses,

01:20:18.070 --> 01:20:22.270
in Europe, has been useful in
the sense it's raised awareness

01:20:22.270 --> 01:20:27.490
in a way that this did not
happen before concerning

01:20:27.490 --> 01:20:28.480
the Palestinian plight.

01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:33.560
So there is that part of it
which you can say is positive.

01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:38.110
On the other hand, it's
also created more friction,

01:20:38.110 --> 01:20:41.860
whether within the Jewish
community or between the pros--

01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:44.650
you know, the pro-Israel and
the pro-Palestinian groups.

01:20:44.650 --> 01:20:48.190
And you see, if you're
thinking like me,

01:20:48.190 --> 01:20:50.800
then you're thinking
you want to make--

01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:52.370
this is a point I made earlier--

01:20:52.370 --> 01:20:55.720
you want to make the pro-Israels
and the pro-Palestinians

01:20:55.720 --> 01:20:57.820
actually to make peace
between one another.

01:20:57.820 --> 01:20:59.530
That's what you want to do.

01:20:59.530 --> 01:21:01.660
And you don't want to
create the friction.

01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:04.390
And you need that
peace abroad in order

01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:07.090
to support the peace within.

01:21:07.090 --> 01:21:09.430
So how do you solve this puzzle?

01:21:12.610 --> 01:21:14.380
You should go to
the United Nations

01:21:14.380 --> 01:21:20.470
and ask for
intervention and to get

01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:22.150
pro-Israelis and
pro-Palestinians

01:21:22.150 --> 01:21:26.170
to get together.

01:21:26.170 --> 01:21:33.440
Because the conflict
outside actually only

01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:35.930
serves to create
more conflict inside.

01:21:42.281 --> 01:21:42.780
Thanks.

01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:45.600
Talking about boycotts
and academic boycotts

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:49.740
that you mentioned, as a
former president of Al-Quds

01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:52.710
University, how do
you see the boycott?

01:21:52.710 --> 01:21:55.212
If I understood well,
Palestinian universities

01:21:55.212 --> 01:21:56.670
boycott [INAUDIBLE]
are not allowed

01:21:56.670 --> 01:21:58.980
to collaborate with
Israeli universities.

01:21:58.980 --> 01:22:00.660
So how do you see this?

01:22:00.660 --> 01:22:04.450
Would you favor collaborations
of Palestinian universities?

01:22:04.450 --> 01:22:04.980
I do.

01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:07.470
I do is the simple answer.

01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:09.960
I mean, I do, in fact.

01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:15.990
But my position has been
very unpopular in the past.

01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:19.800
[INAUDIBLE] At first, as you
say, the Council for Education,

01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:23.250
the Palestinian Council for
Education, took a position--

01:22:23.250 --> 01:22:24.690
this is even after Oslo--

01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:31.200
to not to have any, to
prevent any connections

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:33.480
between Israeli and
Palestinian universities.

01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:37.650
I was a member of the
Council for Education.

01:22:37.650 --> 01:22:41.280
And I said to the
Council that I will not

01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:42.670
abide by this decision.

01:22:42.670 --> 01:22:44.880
And we are an
independent institution.

01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:46.170
You want to go this way, fine.

01:22:46.170 --> 01:22:48.750
But you know, my
way is different.

01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:54.210
And we, in fact, did go
on and institute relations

01:22:54.210 --> 01:22:57.480
with Israeli counterparts
all the way up to 2000--

01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:00.240
I think, and 14,
was it-- or whenever

01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:04.290
it was that Israel invaded
Gaza the second time.

01:23:04.290 --> 01:23:06.120
And [INAUDIBLE] the first time.

01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:09.180
And at that point,
it became very hard.

01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:14.400
And I convened a meeting with
all the Palestinian academics

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:16.980
at my university who
were engaged in projects

01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:18.760
with Israeli counterparts.

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:20.790
And I asked them how
they felt, and it

01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:25.990
was a very emotional point,
emotional period at that time.

01:23:25.990 --> 01:23:30.210
And after a lot of discussion,
the majority decision was,

01:23:30.210 --> 01:23:33.030
you know, should
suspend our relations

01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:34.980
with Israeli counterparts.

01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:40.600
But we should look again at
this after a period of time.

01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:43.810
But we should not stop anything
that's ongoing at the moment.

01:23:43.810 --> 01:23:45.050
So there was that.

01:23:45.050 --> 01:23:47.119
And after I left
the administration,

01:23:47.119 --> 01:23:48.660
I think people at
the University have

01:23:48.660 --> 01:23:51.870
been less enthusiastic about.

01:23:51.870 --> 01:23:54.990
But as I was saying
earlier, I mean,

01:23:54.990 --> 01:24:00.370
in the case of the
Israeli-Palestinian relations,

01:24:00.370 --> 01:24:03.520
you know there are many
things you can boycott.

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:07.710
And I think the last
one you want to boycott

01:24:07.710 --> 01:24:10.200
is, in fact,
academic cooperation.

01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:14.430
I mean you can start with
the mafia on both sides.

01:24:14.430 --> 01:24:17.430
And stop them from cooperating.

01:24:17.430 --> 01:24:20.250
And the underworld, there's
a lot of cooperation.

01:24:20.250 --> 01:24:21.840
And you know, and you can go--

01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:22.511
Adelson.

01:24:22.511 --> 01:24:23.010
Adelson.

01:24:23.010 --> 01:24:23.775
Adelson, yeah.

01:24:23.775 --> 01:24:24.990
[LAUGHS]

01:24:24.990 --> 01:24:26.820
Academics, I think,
should be able to--

01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:30.360
and actually, we stand to
benefit, the Palestinians,

01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:32.010
from this cooperation.

01:24:32.010 --> 01:24:32.700
Please.

01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:32.930
Sorry.

01:24:32.930 --> 01:24:34.429
You've been waiting
for a long time.

01:24:34.429 --> 01:24:35.080
I apologize.

01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:36.060
Thank you.

01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:40.530
I have a question about the
whole concept of sharing.

01:24:40.530 --> 01:24:46.950
And I wonder how it
works when one side comes

01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:52.650
to the table holding all of
the cards or all of the oranges

01:24:52.650 --> 01:24:59.160
or all of the cakes, and the
other side doesn't have it.

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:04.010
So does the concept
of sharing work there,

01:25:04.010 --> 01:25:10.860
or is it more a matter
of giving and receiving?

01:25:10.860 --> 01:25:16.830
And if the latter, then to what
extent does the giver really

01:25:16.830 --> 01:25:18.510
want to give?

01:25:18.510 --> 01:25:21.960
And to what extent does
the recipient really

01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:24.430
want to receive?

01:25:24.430 --> 01:25:30.820
So I have a little bit of doubt
about this notion of sharing,

01:25:30.820 --> 01:25:33.810
although I believe
in it firmly myself.

01:25:33.810 --> 01:25:35.780
Well, as [INAUDIBLE]
was saying earlier,

01:25:35.780 --> 01:25:37.360
I think one of the
things you have

01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:40.420
to do when you come
to the table is

01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:45.760
to change who you are
sitting in front of.

01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:51.310
So of course, I mean, I think
there's [INAUDIBLE] point

01:25:51.310 --> 01:25:57.460
that, of course, a negotiator
or the party that is negotiating

01:25:57.460 --> 01:26:04.120
with you has to be somehow
worked in order to begin

01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:06.020
to see you differently.

01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:10.480
And I think once they do
that, then it's not a matter--

01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:14.650
it ceases to be a matter
of giving as a kind of-- it

01:26:14.650 --> 01:26:18.820
becomes a matter of,
perhaps, a moral imperative,

01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:21.490
or perhaps even a need.

01:26:21.490 --> 01:26:23.980
In the case of the Israelis
and the Palestinians,

01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:27.010
I'll tell you something that
struck me some time ago, when

01:26:27.010 --> 01:26:28.330
I was younger.

01:26:28.330 --> 01:26:31.430
That Shimon Peres said--

01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:35.650
that I used very often--

01:26:35.650 --> 01:26:40.060
at one stage, Shimon Peres
was actually trying to get--

01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:42.370
he was talking about
the need to make peace

01:26:42.370 --> 01:26:43.570
with the Palestinians.

01:26:43.570 --> 01:26:45.100
This was in the '80s.

01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:46.090
It was in the mid-'80s.

01:26:46.090 --> 01:26:48.080
So it was before anything.

01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:51.610
And he was making this
statement to Israelis

01:26:51.610 --> 01:26:54.250
in his own backyard,
so to speak.

01:26:54.250 --> 01:26:57.480
And he said something like this.

01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:00.840
He was telling them, we
have to make an exchange

01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:01.800
with the Palestinians.

01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:07.590
Because it is true that we,
the Israelis, hold the present.

01:27:07.590 --> 01:27:10.380
But the Palestinians
hold the future.

01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:12.780
And the exchange
you have to make

01:27:12.780 --> 01:27:15.570
is for us to give them
a part of the presence

01:27:15.570 --> 01:27:19.290
so that they can give
us a part of the future.

01:27:19.290 --> 01:27:21.060
This is the real exchange.

01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:23.430
And so we the Palestinians
actually are not

01:27:23.430 --> 01:27:25.650
weak at the negotiating table.

01:27:25.650 --> 01:27:29.100
Yes, we don't have guns, or
we don't have enough of them.

01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:30.030
We don't have rockets.

01:27:30.030 --> 01:27:31.590
We don't have all of that.

01:27:31.590 --> 01:27:34.260
But don't be mistaken.

01:27:34.260 --> 01:27:35.940
We are very strong.

01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:38.076
We are very strong.

01:27:38.076 --> 01:27:40.700
So there is a question here, and
then there's a question there.

01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:41.510
You want a question.

01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:42.551
That's the last question.

01:27:42.551 --> 01:27:43.700
So one, two, yeah.

01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:44.630
Thank you.

01:27:44.630 --> 01:27:46.080
Thank you so much.

01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:50.510
So the language and the rhetoric
of oranges and their sharing,

01:27:50.510 --> 01:27:52.970
as well as the
language of sharing

01:27:52.970 --> 01:27:55.670
in the title of the
conversation and the rhetoric,

01:27:55.670 --> 01:27:58.110
the attendant rhetoric
of giving and exchange,

01:27:58.110 --> 01:28:00.530
all that reminds me of
the kind of language

01:28:00.530 --> 01:28:02.270
that is used in a
considerable chunk

01:28:02.270 --> 01:28:05.720
of the academic literature
on Israel-Palestine.

01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:09.980
Which really uses the language
of settler colonialism

01:28:09.980 --> 01:28:11.930
as the basis, as
the primary basis

01:28:11.930 --> 01:28:14.720
for making sense of
what sharing is like.

01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:16.730
And I take the last
sentiment to be

01:28:16.730 --> 01:28:19.010
attendant to the ways in
which a straightforward

01:28:19.010 --> 01:28:21.920
metaphor of sharing
might not be as

01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:24.830
attendant to the
political imbalances that

01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:27.840
are historically
mediated and sedimented.

01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:31.220
So my question is really
about in what ways

01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:33.800
can we have the
historical process

01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:36.170
and the ongoing, indeed,
historical process of settler

01:28:36.170 --> 01:28:39.350
colonialism be central to
a conversation about going

01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:40.860
forward?

01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:43.490
And one way in which I've
been struggling with this is

01:28:43.490 --> 01:28:45.470
is precisely through
the coalitions

01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:49.490
that have been forming recently
between Jews and Palestinians

01:28:49.490 --> 01:28:52.460
and indeed, non-Jews
and non-Palestinians

01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:55.220
around a settler colonial
perspective that recognizes

01:28:55.220 --> 01:28:58.760
the extent, ways in which
religion and culture play

01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:01.310
a role, but also points
to their contingency.

01:29:01.310 --> 01:29:03.840
And so you can have
an anti-Zionist Jew,

01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:07.220
and an anti-Zionist Palestinian,
and an anti-Zionist humanist

01:29:07.220 --> 01:29:10.610
working together
for a way of life,

01:29:10.610 --> 01:29:14.180
a cohabitation that recognizes
the humanity of everyone

01:29:14.180 --> 01:29:16.610
there in ways,
perhaps, that fall

01:29:16.610 --> 01:29:19.106
beyond the rhetoric of sharing.

01:29:19.106 --> 01:29:20.480
So I'm wondering
if you can speak

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:22.820
to the question of
language and the framework

01:29:22.820 --> 01:29:26.660
that we've been using in
making sense of the issue.

01:29:26.660 --> 01:29:30.250
Well, I mean, don't
forget when we

01:29:30.250 --> 01:29:33.610
use the term sharing
in this context,

01:29:33.610 --> 01:29:37.000
we're thinking in
terms of the existing

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:40.270
parameters, political
parameters which

01:29:40.270 --> 01:29:46.030
are to do with having to
try and still make out

01:29:46.030 --> 01:29:50.440
a case for some kind of
resolution between the Israelis

01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:53.650
and the Palestinians on the
basis of two states, basically.

01:29:53.650 --> 01:29:54.430
All right?

01:29:54.430 --> 01:29:56.800
And you know, if
you cannot do that,

01:29:56.800 --> 01:30:01.030
we're still thinking in the
context of the same parameters.

01:30:01.030 --> 01:30:05.890
We're thinking if that's
not possible, then

01:30:05.890 --> 01:30:10.030
how else within, again, the
existing circumstances can

01:30:10.030 --> 01:30:16.360
we, in any case, bring about
some kind of an equitable

01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:22.510
kind of living condition for
both Israelis and Palestinians.

01:30:22.510 --> 01:30:28.430
Now what you're saying, in
fact, pushes a bit further.

01:30:28.430 --> 01:30:31.870
What you're doing is
basically telling us

01:30:31.870 --> 01:30:35.170
we should reconsider
the parameters.

01:30:35.170 --> 01:30:37.420
And you know, the
parameters that

01:30:37.420 --> 01:30:41.020
are being used in
the modern context

01:30:41.020 --> 01:30:44.740
or in the existing context
do not actually work.

01:30:44.740 --> 01:30:46.210
And you may be right.

01:30:46.210 --> 01:30:48.820
And actually, it's
something that is--

01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:51.670
I mean, I mentioned it
earlier-- that it's something

01:30:51.670 --> 01:30:53.170
that does occur to one.

01:30:53.170 --> 01:30:56.980
That maybe, for instance,
Zionism as such,

01:30:56.980 --> 01:31:03.390
even Palestinian nationalism
as such are just as they are

01:31:03.390 --> 01:31:06.300
and as [? they ?] become
are things that cannot

01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:13.350
of themselves resolve into
something that as you call

01:31:13.350 --> 01:31:19.890
humanitarian humanitarian
state of peace between people.

01:31:19.890 --> 01:31:25.210
Well, I think we
have to work slowly.

01:31:25.210 --> 01:31:30.250
I mean, I'm prepared to
look at my case, at my age,

01:31:30.250 --> 01:31:36.130
I'm prepared to look at every
way people offer you to push

01:31:36.130 --> 01:31:46.370
forward and towards peace and on
a peace that will be equitable,

01:31:46.370 --> 01:31:49.430
that will offer
dignity and respect

01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:53.870
for different people,
different individuals belonging

01:31:53.870 --> 01:31:57.547
to different backgrounds.

01:31:57.547 --> 01:31:59.380
And at the end of the
day, it doesn't really

01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:07.930
matter very much how you get
there or what sort of theoretic

01:32:07.930 --> 01:32:10.150
construct you use in
order to get there.

01:32:10.150 --> 01:32:13.270
In my case, say, as a
person living in Jerusalem,

01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:17.110
all I need is to finally
find peace at home.

01:32:17.110 --> 01:32:20.005
Now you know whether through
this theoretic construct

01:32:20.005 --> 01:32:25.510
or that, at the end of the
day, it's secondary for me.

01:32:25.510 --> 01:32:26.410
But you're right.

01:32:26.410 --> 01:32:31.160
I mean, I think
the language we use

01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:36.860
is very much stuck to a
certain framework of politics

01:32:36.860 --> 01:32:43.240
that we are today following.

01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:45.810
A peace with dignity,
peace with equality--

01:32:45.810 --> 01:32:48.070
so that's where all
the rubs come in.

01:32:48.070 --> 01:32:54.490
If you're willing to accept some
kind of ad [? hocary, ?] then

01:32:54.490 --> 01:32:55.909
you can get a kind of peace.

01:32:55.909 --> 01:32:58.450
But it's not with dignity and
equality, which is your demand.

01:32:58.450 --> 01:32:59.961
Yes, a final question, please.

01:32:59.961 --> 01:33:00.460
Hi.

01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:01.760
Thank you so much for coming.

01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:07.070
My question is kind of going off
of what Abdullah's just said,

01:33:07.070 --> 01:33:09.550
We've talked so much about
understanding and reaching

01:33:09.550 --> 01:33:11.750
across for that understanding.

01:33:11.750 --> 01:33:15.760
But I haven't heard
the word responsibility

01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:17.770
or accountability
be used so much.

01:33:17.770 --> 01:33:20.620
And I feel like the
root of this is really

01:33:20.620 --> 01:33:23.050
within Israeli
society to overcome

01:33:23.050 --> 01:33:27.980
a great deal of denial of
accountability in the region.

01:33:27.980 --> 01:33:31.380
And we're talking a lot
about recognizing each other

01:33:31.380 --> 01:33:32.990
as human beings.

01:33:32.990 --> 01:33:36.730
And the Israeli military's
behavior on the Gaza Strip

01:33:36.730 --> 01:33:42.740
is not recognition of
Palestinians as human beings.

01:33:42.740 --> 01:33:48.250
And so I want to just to
end, if you have any--

01:33:48.250 --> 01:33:52.780
to my mind, the only
kind of route, at least,

01:33:52.780 --> 01:33:55.960
might be within local
communities in Israel

01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:57.760
to begin to have
these conversations,

01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:01.120
to begin to start even talking
about the idea of settler

01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:04.640
colonialism, which is
not discussed widespread

01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:06.850
in the Israeli youth.

01:34:06.850 --> 01:34:11.500
And one idea that's
applicable, perhaps,

01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:13.240
is the idea of truth
commissions, which

01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:17.260
has been used in South Africa.

01:34:17.260 --> 01:34:21.070
And I wonder if you know of
any, or involved with any,

01:34:21.070 --> 01:34:26.360
or promote any discussion
groups among the young people,

01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:31.400
among education groups in
Palestinian communities,

01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:33.770
or if you know of any
within Israeli communities

01:34:33.770 --> 01:34:37.220
that adopt these kind
of values of recognition

01:34:37.220 --> 01:34:40.040
that might overcome some of
this denial and blindness

01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:43.100
on the part of Israelis.

01:34:43.100 --> 01:34:46.500
Well, you know, your question
is very difficult to answer.

01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:49.500
I mean, I don't really
know such groups.

01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:56.290
I think that the problem
is-- is to have such groups.

01:34:56.290 --> 01:34:59.140
I mean, the problem is
that people, as you say,

01:34:59.140 --> 01:35:01.810
are in denial of
their responsibility.

01:35:05.330 --> 01:35:09.370
If you think about
Israel as the soldiers

01:35:09.370 --> 01:35:12.670
that are shooting at
the people in Gaza,

01:35:12.670 --> 01:35:20.160
or if you think of
Israel as the occupation,

01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:24.990
or Israel as the
colonial movement,

01:35:24.990 --> 01:35:30.840
or you know, as the displacement
movement of the Palestinians.

01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:34.260
And if on the Israeli side,
you think of the Palestinians

01:35:34.260 --> 01:35:36.000
as the terrorists,
and as I don't

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.430
know what and what
and what, it's

01:35:38.430 --> 01:35:43.360
very hard to get
either side to think

01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:47.120
in terms of reconsidering
their self view,

01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:50.230
their self appreciation.

01:35:53.460 --> 01:35:56.220
And so it's sort of
going to take time

01:35:56.220 --> 01:35:59.850
to get there to the point
where you can start,

01:35:59.850 --> 01:36:04.800
for instance, like, commissions
that will look into,

01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:07.440
that will accept
responsibility on the part

01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:09.780
of the entire group.

01:36:09.780 --> 01:36:11.500
I think it'll take a long time.

01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:14.040
I don't know of any
that exists today.

01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:16.470
I mean, there are
Israeli groups,

01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:24.170
like, for instance, the soldiers
and so on who were wonderful

01:36:24.170 --> 01:36:24.980
stories.

01:36:24.980 --> 01:36:30.800
I mean, I was reading something
by David Schulman recently,

01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:33.590
who is at the H University.

01:36:33.590 --> 01:36:38.870
Something even more
interesting by a woman

01:36:38.870 --> 01:36:41.750
called Hillerman, I
think, Dr. Hillerman.

01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:44.390
She produced her book in
Hebrew about two years ago.

01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:49.040
But now it's coming
out in English--

01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:51.360
I think Chicago Press.

01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:58.440
And I mean, you read her, and
you see that she actually--

01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:02.580
I mean, she's accompanied
Palestinian workers.

01:37:02.580 --> 01:37:05.310
She's accompanied
Palestinian prisoners.

01:37:05.310 --> 01:37:06.990
She has gone to jail.

01:37:06.990 --> 01:37:10.020
She's been in the middle
of Gaza, the middle of--

01:37:10.020 --> 01:37:11.970
and in each and
every corner, she

01:37:11.970 --> 01:37:17.630
is describing exactly
how she sees--

01:37:17.630 --> 01:37:19.640
the underdog, the
Palestinians being treated,

01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:21.110
that kind of situation.

01:37:21.110 --> 01:37:25.580
And this kind of
testimony, I think,

01:37:25.580 --> 01:37:27.470
is something very important.

01:37:27.470 --> 01:37:31.550
Not only because it tells
about the Palestinians.

01:37:31.550 --> 01:37:36.510
I think because, as I see it,
it does also about herself.

01:37:36.510 --> 01:37:40.700
It tells about the existence of
this human spirit in the midst

01:37:40.700 --> 01:37:42.290
of the Israeli, you know.

01:37:42.290 --> 01:37:45.510
In this case living
in West Jerusalem.

01:37:45.510 --> 01:37:48.520
So you just have to
have more of this.

01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:52.760
You know, sometime, sometime
further on in the future,

01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:55.380
maybe you'll have a
commission of human rights.

01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:58.490
And we'll be able to.

01:37:58.490 --> 01:38:00.470
But we're still a
long way from there.

01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:06.937
Peter, could you just announce
Sari's next talk, please?

01:38:06.937 --> 01:38:07.436
Yeah.

01:38:07.436 --> 01:38:10.154
I got a technical
failure earlier.

01:38:10.154 --> 01:38:13.520
But I hope many of you know
that Professor Nusseibeh

01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:16.580
they will be giving a talk
this Thursday, as well.

01:38:16.580 --> 01:38:18.980
Which I suppose
the title relates

01:38:18.980 --> 01:38:20.870
in some ways to what
you were describing,

01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:23.560
the hopeful image of
a possible future.

01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:26.450
But this will address a more
academic and philosophical

01:38:26.450 --> 01:38:28.760
theme, Are Possible Facts Real?

01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:31.160
An Abyssinian Vignette.

01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:36.230
And this will be this Thursday
from 5 to 7 PM in the Tsai

01:38:36.230 --> 01:38:39.010
Auditorium, which is CGIS South.

01:38:39.010 --> 01:38:41.360
So I hope you'll all
come to hear Professor--

01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:44.450
But it's not about politics.

01:38:44.450 --> 01:38:47.630
And it may be still very
boring for a lot of you.

01:38:50.690 --> 01:38:51.380
And--

01:38:51.380 --> 01:38:53.000
I-- want to thank Sari.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:58.640
Because in fact, what you've
made us aware of in this both

01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:03.680
despairing and at the same
time, committed conversation--

01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:06.600
isn't there a Palestinian word
called [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:07.410
or something?

01:39:07.410 --> 01:39:07.520
Yeah.

01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:07.730
Yes.

01:39:07.730 --> 01:39:07.960
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:08.820
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:09.650
We're here.

01:39:09.650 --> 01:39:10.490
I'm going to stay.

01:39:10.490 --> 01:39:11.270
I'm resilient.

01:39:11.270 --> 01:39:12.500
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

01:39:12.500 --> 01:39:16.100
With that sentiment,
I think many

01:39:16.100 --> 01:39:18.050
of us in other
parts of the world

01:39:18.050 --> 01:39:19.940
have to take on
that same attitude.

01:39:19.940 --> 01:39:29.090
We live in a very, very divided,
ferociously uncaring situation

01:39:29.090 --> 01:39:29.590
now.

01:39:29.590 --> 01:39:31.230
And you see it in India.

01:39:31.230 --> 01:39:33.110
You see it of course in Turkey.

01:39:33.110 --> 01:39:37.580
In this country, where there
is plenty in some areas,

01:39:37.580 --> 01:39:40.250
you see it at every level.

01:39:40.250 --> 01:39:43.520
And of course, the most
ludicrous identification

01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:48.800
of those who are out of work
with an economic fraudster who

01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:52.940
is supposed to be the savior
or the sign of the future

01:39:52.940 --> 01:39:54.300
just makes you baffled.

01:39:54.300 --> 01:39:56.960
So that the things we don't
understand about the Middle

01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:00.140
East and about that region--

01:40:00.140 --> 01:40:02.360
there are many things we
don't understand here.

01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:05.960
And I hope in our
mutual vulnerability

01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:08.300
we will find both
knowledge and strength.

01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:09.140
Thank you.

01:40:09.140 --> 01:40:09.740
Thank you.

01:40:09.740 --> 01:40:11.590
[APPLAUSE]
