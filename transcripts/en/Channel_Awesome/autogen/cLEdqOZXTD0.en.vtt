00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:15.380 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a dummy ones ever do that
 

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.100 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a dummy ones ever do that
again<00:07:15.500><c> or</c><00:07:16.070><c> they</c><00:07:16.250><c> seem</c><00:07:16.910><c> to</c><00:07:17.090><c> be</c><00:07:17.240><c> just</c><00:07:17.270><c> the</c><00:07:17.870><c> dumb</c>

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:18.110 align:start position:0%

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:21.260 align:start position:0%
ones so again it's this internal logic
 

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:27.610 align:start position:0%
ones so again it's this internal logic
works<00:07:21.470><c> like</c><00:07:21.710><c> that</c><00:07:22.100><c> doesn't</c><00:07:26.290><c> not</c><00:07:27.290><c> gonna</c><00:07:27.440><c> go</c>
