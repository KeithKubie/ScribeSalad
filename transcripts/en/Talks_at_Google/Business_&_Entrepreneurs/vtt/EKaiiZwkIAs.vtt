00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.353
Let's welcome our speaker.

00:01:16.353 --> 00:01:18.768
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:23.980
Mr. Nadeem, you had--

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.190
NADEEM HUSSAIN: You
can call me Nadeem.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.620
SPEAKER 1: Nadeem, you
had an unusual beginning

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.470
after spending nearly
30 years in banking.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.950
You came back to Pakistan
to start a new venture

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.907
at the age of 49?

00:01:37.907 --> 00:01:39.147
NADEEM HUSSAIN: Yep.

00:01:39.147 --> 00:01:40.522
SPEAKER 1: What
was easy and what

00:01:40.522 --> 00:01:43.740
was hard to start
something new at that age?

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.300
And how did you decide to
start a microfinance bank

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.550
back in Pakistan after having
lived in different countries?

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.790
NADEEM HUSSAIN: So I spent
about 27 years with Citigroup

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.280
in about eight
different countries.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.830
And my last assignment
was actually

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.340
out of the buyable that
was responsible for Iraq

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.430
during the sovereign
debt restructuring.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.750
So of that 27 years,
I spent half my time

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.300
in investment consumer
marketing and half my time

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.110
in risk management.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.670
I was 49 years old, and I
figured of that 27 years,

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.000
I only spent 5 years in
Pakistan launching the consumer

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.410
bank in Pakistan.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.600
Otherwise, I'd been
outside Pakistan.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.480
And I felt it was time for me
to go back and do something

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.762
in Pakistan.

00:02:26.762 --> 00:02:27.970
Pakistan had been kind to me.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.630
I'd got where I had because
of my education in Pakistan

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.370
and subsequently in the US.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.300
But this talk of saying that
I've done enough at Citi--

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.780
You know, I had become
relatively senior in Citibank,

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.210
making decent
money, but I wanted

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.225
to go back and create
something in Pakistan,

00:02:47.225 --> 00:02:50.570
and I hoped I would be
able to change an industry.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.500
It was very ambitious
for a person who had only

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.890
worked five years in Pakistan
and had actually never done

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.930
microfinance before.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.760
And the reason I wanted to
do microfinance were twofold.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.240
One was simply capital.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.640
If I wanted to own
a bank in Pakistan,

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.900
a commercial bank capital
requirement was $100 million

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.670
and a microfinance capital
requirement was $10 million.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.190
So you can see that decision
was an easy decision

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.770
to get into as far as capital
requirement was concerned.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.940
But there's huge financial
exclusion in Pakistan.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.820
Of a country right now
of 200 million people,

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.530
less than 6.7 million people
have access to formal credit.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.010
So my view was that if we could
create a microfinance bank,

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.510
which could actually
institutionalize this process,

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.001
you know, create a bank which
was run by professionals

00:03:39.001 --> 00:03:40.000
as opposed to necessary.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.740
But it's not that the
other institutions are not

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:42.615
run by professionals.

00:03:42.615 --> 00:03:45.080
But people who had capital
market experience, people

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.870
who had consumer
experience, people

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.880
who had global
experience-- you would have

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.860
to learn microfinance
because all

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.940
my knowledge of microfinance
was a book written by Dr. Yunus.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.850
So I hadn't done
microfinance before,

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:57.850
so that was a challenge.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.080
But I thought that we would be
able to create a world class

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.680
institution using the
27 years of knowledge I

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.310
had at Citi and the
capital I'd built up

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.860
at Citi through options.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.660
And the funny part is that
when I exited Citibank,

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.970
Citibank stock was $35.

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.279
You know, it came down to
close to $2 afterwards,

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:20.219
so that wasn't--

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:23.240
thinking on my
part, it was luck.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.930
But right now I was reading
the Citibank stock--

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.880
Citicorp stock is
back to 2009 years.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.720
It was a big
decision in the sense

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.650
that I'd spent 27 years
working for one company,

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.427
getting a salary, in a very
comfortable environment.

00:04:38.427 --> 00:04:40.510
You know, when you're
getting a check every month,

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.310
you're getting a nice
bonus every year,

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.814
you get transported
to a new country

00:04:43.814 --> 00:04:45.230
and the company
takes care of you.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.954
It's a nice life.

00:04:46.954 --> 00:04:48.370
And it's not boring
because you're

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.350
moving from country to
country, so it's a new market.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.940
So you're always getting
a different experience.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.420
When I was growing up, like
most Pakistanis at that stage,

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.569
my ambition was to become
the head of a multinational

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:03.610
in Pakistan, because, you
know, it's a great job.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.080
You get a lot of perks.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.780
Make a million bucks,
and I'd be done.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.570
That was my initial
ambition, and you know,

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.410
I'd be a happy camper.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.920
I never, at that stage,
thought I'd work for myself

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.210
or create a company for myself,
because that whole mindset

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.360
at that time was to go find
a multinational to work

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.640
for, and get promoted,
and become a country

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.330
head or maybe a regional head.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.000
So the first transition
was that I would

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.860
be creating my own company.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.460
And my family comes from the
middle class in Pakistan.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.010
My father used to be
in the Pakistan Navy

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.140
and then got into the
automotive industry.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.300
My mother was a high
school principal.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.780
There was no examples of any
entrepreneurship in my family,

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.990
so I was the first
person to actually move

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.540
from a salaried job into an
entrepreneurship kind of thing.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.980
So that was a first
decision, moving away

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.540
from the safety net of a
nice tax free job in Dubai,

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.540
coming back to
Pakistan, and you know,

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.050
putting my own capital at risk.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.420
So out of the $10 million,
I put in $6 million.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.174
IFC put in a million
dollars, and there

00:06:12.174 --> 00:06:14.090
were two local investors
who put in $3 million

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.000
to get to the $10 million.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.400
The second thing was I had
never worked in Pakistan

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.260
beyond five years.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.672
And actually I was a Pakistani.

00:06:21.672 --> 00:06:23.380
I used to go back
every year to Pakistan.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.800
Working in Pakistan,
especially in the microfinance

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.700
environment, would
be very different,

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.900
so that was another challenge
that I knew I would experience.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.710
But I'm an impulsive
kind of person.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.240
So once the bug bit me that
I was going to go back,

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.010
I actually didn't
wait for my bonus--

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:43.551
which that year, incidentally,
would have been half a million

00:06:43.551 --> 00:06:46.030
bucks, because we just
finished the sovereign debt

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:47.230
restructuring of Pakistan.

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:50.410
And Citibank made close to
$120 million on that deal.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.520
It was a massive deal.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.260
So I was country head,
Iraq, but I couldn't wait.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.120
So I just gave in my
resignation saying

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.890
I'm going go back to Pakistan.

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:02.050
And my boss said, hold on.

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.160
I was four months away.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.201
I said, no, I can't wait.

00:07:04.201 --> 00:07:05.650
I've got to go back.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.716
And I just went back
and started Tameer Bank.

00:07:09.716 --> 00:07:11.090
SPEAKER 1: Micro
enterprises tend

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.500
to estimate that demand-side
interest rates are typically

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.750
high for micro loans.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.760
And recent randomized controlled
trials show that direct cash

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:22.600
transfers-- that is, cash
without any strings attached--

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.350
has more impact on
poverty and livelihoods.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:29.950
So how does Telenor Bank
ensure that micro loans are

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.620
impactful in upward mobility
and breaking out of the poverty

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:34.774
cycle for the communities?

00:07:34.774 --> 00:07:36.190
NADEEM HUSSAIN: I
thought this was

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:37.440
going to be an easy interview.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.200
So there are two
schools of thought,

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.380
and both come up with
scientific evidence.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.900
One says, in a controlled
group environment,

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.830
when you do microfinance
lending, over a period of time,

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:52.860
you actually show improvement.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.720
And it was out of an equal
group of people who actually

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.410
demonstrate that,
no, you can't isolate

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:03.880
that improvement whether it's
a floor that's been converted

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:08.780
from mud to wood, or a
bathroom had been put in,

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:12.490
or kids are going to school,
or there's less people getting

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:15.750
sick because of the incremental
income that you have--

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.500
is not necessarily due
to the intervention

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.240
of the microfinance
bank, but there

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.630
could be other sources
of income coming in.

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:23.200
And because money's
fungible, you

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.290
can't necessarily isolate
the impact microfinance

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:28.270
lending has had.

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:32.679
So both exist, and both are done
by very prominent people who've

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.960
done A/B testing
and demonstrated

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.549
that they are right.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:39.940
In my 11 years, my sense was
that I met enough customers

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.400
that we changed their lives.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.700
The intervention we had done had
made them actually better off

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.940
than they were before.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:51.460
The big risk in microfinance
is that overindebtedness.

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.800
You get a customer to
actually take more money

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:57.000
than he or she can repay,
and that's when they default.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.950
Otherwise, typically, the rates
of default in microfinance,

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:03.940
if you got the right undwriting,
are typically under 1%.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.790
The big challenge
in microfinance

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.740
is not that your
customer is going

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:12.340
to default because they
haven't given you collateral.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:13.840
It's your business model.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.660
How do you take care of
the long tail customer?

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.760
Your business model
takes into account

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:22.090
that you're going to sell, as
opposed to a bag of teabags,

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:24.300
one [INAUDIBLE] at a time.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.050
So you have to build
a business model that

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:29.466
incorporates that you're selling
one [INAUDIBLE] at a time.

00:09:29.466 --> 00:09:31.090
And unless you can
do that-- and that's

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:33.673
why large commercial banks are
not successful in microfinance,

00:09:33.673 --> 00:09:36.360
because their business
model is very different.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.860
It's, you know, $100
million, or $10 million,

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.830
or a couple hundred thousand
dollars of loan at a time.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.500
But microfinance is
one loan acquired

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:49.040
at a time for an average
of maybe $350 or $300,

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.440
where the customer has
no finances, no credit

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.570
report of any kind,
and you're actually

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:58.480
estimating their ability
to repay the debt

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.580
service by human intervention.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:04.780
And that's the reason that,
typically, microfinance rates

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:05.920
are high.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.910
It's not because microfinance
banks make a lot of money.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:12.790
So if you look at, globally,
what kind of money microfinance

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:15.880
banks make or microfinance
institutions make,

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.680
it's not a very high number.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.920
You'll you'll find
a microfinance bank

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.700
making $100 million or
$50 million of income.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.450
It's rare, I would
say, at current,

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:29.320
like 10 banks,
globally, would do that.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.500
The reason the rates
are high is the cost

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:37.630
of customer acquisition and
the cost of underwriting.

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:39.670
So if you look at
interest rate--

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:41.100
let's say the
interest rate's 30%.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.630
And you said, well, you
know, you're a poor guy,

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:45.480
and you're lending at 30%.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.210
That's not fair.

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:47.584
I mean, you're
gouging a customer

00:10:47.584 --> 00:10:49.054
who's already very poor.

00:10:49.054 --> 00:10:50.470
So what service
are you providing?

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:52.820
You're just maximizing
your own returns.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.510
But if you break and
peel that onion of 30%,

00:10:55.510 --> 00:11:00.610
you find out that out of
that 30%, typically 15%

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:02.661
is cost of administration.

00:11:02.661 --> 00:11:03.160
Why?

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.367
Because very few
microfinance banks

00:11:06.367 --> 00:11:08.200
use scorecards for the
moment, so everything

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.950
is human intervention.

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:13.750
Tameer Bank had 2,000 people
by the time I was exiting.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:17.650
Because you need to go
and see the customer.

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:21.000
You need to figure out, are they
able to repay your debt or not?

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.760
So you have to go
a couple of times

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.120
to figure out what their
repayment ability is.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.970
Because typically, in developing
countries at that level,

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:31.730
corruption is high because
these people are not

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:34.110
used to getting anything
done without paying money.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:38.566
So if they need a passport,
they need a CNIC card,

00:11:38.566 --> 00:11:40.190
which is like an
identity card, they're

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:43.220
always needing some kind of
money [INAUDIBLE] in between.

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.920
So typically they're
immediately offering money

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.260
to your relationship
manager, and that's

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:49.790
something you know
you want to avoid

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:52.206
because you want to have a
culture of where money is being

00:11:52.206 --> 00:11:52.730
taken.

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:54.410
So you have a separate
person waiting

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:55.990
on a verification process.

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:59.660
When they go and recheck that
the customer's estimation

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:02.649
of what you're estimating
the repayment is correct.

00:12:02.649 --> 00:12:04.190
Then you have to
talk to the neighbor

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:05.731
to see if this person
has been living

00:12:05.731 --> 00:12:07.760
in his house for a long time.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.930
Then you go to his place of work
and talk to his neighbor again.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.815
So it's a very laborious,
people-intensive process.

00:12:13.815 --> 00:12:15.815
And commercial banks cost
about-- administration

00:12:15.815 --> 00:12:18.310
is typically around 2%, 3%.

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:21.622
A microfinance bank is 15%.

00:12:21.622 --> 00:12:22.580
Then you have cost of .

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:26.210
Funds typically commercial
banks have low cost of funds

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.790
because they have checking
accounts or they have savings

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:29.570
accounts.

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:32.200
Typically, microfinance banks
don't have checking accounts.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:32.910
They can't.

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:35.930
Tameer Bank had one, but
most microfinance banks

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:38.115
are dependent on going
to the independent market

00:12:38.115 --> 00:12:39.395
to raise money.

00:12:39.395 --> 00:12:42.830
Because the customer's view
is, if I have to borrow money,

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:45.860
I'll borrow from a microfinance,
but if I have to deposit money,

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.900
I'll go to a commercial bank
because that money's safe.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.830
So if you're willing
to lend to me,

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:57.940
you can't be all that, you know,
strong as far as your capital

00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:59.330
adequacy is concerned.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.160
So it takes time for
microfinance banks

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.080
to reduce the cost of funds.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:06.470
Typically, you're borrowing
300 basis points over the money

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:07.340
market rate.

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:10.150
So let's say the money market
rate in Pakistan is 6%.

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:13.490
Typically, microfinance
will borrow at 9% to 10%.

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:16.800
So 15% plus 10%, you're at 25%.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.460
Let's say default is
1%, so you're at 26%.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.890
If your margin of 1%
or 2%, you're at 28%.

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:23.450
So the rates are
high, but that's

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:25.790
the reason the rates are high.

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:28.670
If microfinance banks start
investing in technology,

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:31.070
you can bring that
administration count down.

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:34.820
If every time you're improving
secondary using scorecards

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.340
or artificial intelligence
to create algorithms which

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:41.030
can forecast what your
default rate is going to be,

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:43.940
you can bring some of that
administration cost down.

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:48.200
If you create checking account
or mobile account programs,

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.300
you can bring your
cost of funding down.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:53.700
So in Tameer, my ambition
was to bring out--

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:57.250
our ending rate was 28%,
so bring it down to 15%.

00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:00.350
And credit card rates in
Pakistan are 30%, 32%.

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:02.570
So, you know, hopefully
the new management

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:03.950
is looking towards that.

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:05.920
But that's the reason.

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:09.710
Microfinance rates
range from 30% to 40%,

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:12.260
but they don't make that much
money just because of the way

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.590
this whole business model is.

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:19.040
SPEAKER 1: So Telenor Bank
has created and instituted

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.760
a successful mobile payment
system called EasyPaisa,

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.094
and many have tried to
introduce mobile money in Asia,

00:14:26.094 --> 00:14:28.460
but there have been
very few successes.

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:32.220
How did Tameer go about
creating a new infrastructure

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.000
and network to
enable mobile money?

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.500
What are the
challenges you faced,

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.309
and how did you overcome them?

00:14:39.309 --> 00:14:40.850
NADEEM HUSSAIN: The
biggest challenge

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:43.940
in creating a
mobile distribution

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:46.920
network is behavioral change.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.730
And you've got to
realize that the poor are

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:50.990
willing to pay for services.

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:52.790
They don't want charity.

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:57.110
And their view of value for
money is much, much more acute

00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:58.790
than yours and
mine, so you know,

00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:59.940
we spend some extra money.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.060
But they have a finite
budget, and they

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:03.500
have to work within that.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.312
And they are willing to pay
for value if you create value.

00:15:06.312 --> 00:15:08.270
They are never going to
pay for more than that.

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:10.440
But there's a behavior
change requirement.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.990
So when we looked at
Pakistan, and we said,

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:15.380
listen, this financial
exclusion that we

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.780
have is not limited to credit.

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.730
It's also limited to savings.

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:22.070
Since 1947 in Pakistan,
it was created--

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:25.130
it's going to be 70
years this month--

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:26.780
the entire commercial
banking industry

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:30.500
has only opened close to
32 million bank accounts.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.240
And if I take unique
bank accounts,

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.460
you're probably talking
about 15 million.

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:38.090
And the savings [INAUDIBLE]
in Pakistan is under 6%.

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:41.420
So we said there ought to be a
solution for savings as well.

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.550
And savings generation
get generated

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:45.020
when you start payments.

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.060
So how do we create
a payments culture?

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:49.460
Pakistan is a cash society.

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.860
And there's about
3.3 million rupees

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.950
of money floating in the system
because everybody pays cash.

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:56.822
In a country of
200 million people,

00:15:56.822 --> 00:15:58.280
unfortunately,
registered taxpayers

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.590
are about 1.2 million.

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:03.230
The bulk of the taxes are
collected in a indirect basis.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.310
So people don't
have bank accounts.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:06.720
They want to keep money.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:10.250
But they use money
all the time-- cash--

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:11.960
and cash is expensive.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.920
You know, it depreciates in
terms of its physical form.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.060
You need to carry it.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.145
It can get stolen.

00:16:18.145 --> 00:16:20.540
So if you can do digital
payments, in many ways,

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.170
you're better off.

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:25.100
So we said, OK, we want to get
into the branchless banking

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.390
business.

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:31.280
And again, the idea of EasyPaisa
didn't just come to me.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.690
And I went to Kenya
to look at M-Pesa.

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:36.740
I went to Philippines
to look at GCash.

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.850
And I looked at
various applications,

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:42.150
and obviously, Telenor was
a partner at that time,

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:44.710
so they had some
insights as well.

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:47.060
And we said the
easiest way to get

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:50.960
people to start using
branchless banking as payment

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.160
of utility bills.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.770
Now you guys typically pay
through your phone maybe.

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:58.210
But in Pakistan, every
month other than the telco

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:00.170
payments, 30 million
utility bills

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:04.369
are created for
power, gas, water.

00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:07.069
And people typically
go to a bank,

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:09.920
get in line during
banking hours,

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.650
give up their work time
to make that payment.

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:14.750
And banks hate these
people because they

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:15.869
congest the lobbies.

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:18.079
So can you imagine,
they're not bank customers.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:19.910
They're just coming
to pay utility bills,

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:21.326
and they're standing
at the teller

00:17:21.326 --> 00:17:23.119
while the bank
customer's on the side.

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:25.130
So the bank makes it as
difficult as possible

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:28.700
for these guys to pay, but
that was the only venue.

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.820
And we said OK, if we can
create a mechanism where we just

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:36.080
start accepting utility bills
and make it easier compared

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.340
to what they're
doing right now, we

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:41.150
can start a behavioral change.

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:45.570
12,700 banks in
Pakistan, 9,000 ATMs

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:48.040
where people never use
ATMs for repayment of bills

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.210
although you can.

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:52.050
95% of use is just
for cash withdrawals.

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:53.750
That's a typical psyche.

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:56.822
You can even make an
inter-bank payment through ATM,

00:17:56.822 --> 00:17:57.530
but people don't.

00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:59.071
They just use it
for cash withdrawal.

00:17:59.071 --> 00:18:01.250
That's the psyche globally.

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:05.870
So we said, Pakistan
has now, let's say,

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:09.410
90 million unique SIMs--

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:14.530
people with 420 million
SIM cards outstanding.

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:18.170
And 99% of those are pre-paid.

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:20.210
So it's not like post-paid
accounts over here.

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:24.260
Most people actually buy
scratchcards or do a top up

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.450
very frequently in
the month whenever

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:28.940
they run out of SIM balance.

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:31.560
In order to accommodate that,
the telcos had to set up

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:35.340
a vast [? agent ?] network
where people could go and buy

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:35.840
SIM cards.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.423
Just like India,
just like Bangladesh,

00:18:37.423 --> 00:18:39.030
and most developing countries.

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:42.020
So the telcos had set up
an [? agent ?] network,

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.880
multiple of what the
bank branch network was.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.810
So the vision was if you
can change that [? agent ?]

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:51.890
network into providing basic
banking service like opening

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:54.830
an account, closing an
account, making a utility bill,

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:57.590
making a transfer,
then you would actually

00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:00.080
create an alternative network--

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:03.080
which would be far more
convenient for the target

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:05.630
market we were looking at
it, because this network

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:06.980
is in the neighborhood.

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.450
It's open seven days a week.

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:11.250
It's open probably
14 hours a day.

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:13.220
The owner doesn't
go to play golf.

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:15.530
So it's something
that's service-oriented

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:19.250
because these agents are selling
a whole bunch of other stuff

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:21.770
other than just airtime.

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:26.630
So we basically started
onboarding telco agents

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:29.550
for accepting utility
bill payments.

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:30.960
Now that was a
behavioral change.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:34.100
When these customers go to a
bank, they see a bank brand.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:36.110
They see the board of the bank.

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:39.239
And they're comfortable that
my payment, when I make it,

00:19:39.239 --> 00:19:41.030
is going to go through
the utility company,

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:42.824
and my power won't be cut off.

00:19:42.824 --> 00:19:44.240
So we are telling
them, hey, guys,

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:47.420
why don't you go to the small
shop, the mom-and-pop store

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:49.480
in your neighborhood
and pay your utility

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:51.140
bill, and you're going to be OK?

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:53.030
And the guy says hell no.

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:56.030
If I can't make this payment,
and this guy shuts down

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:59.570
tomorrow, and my power gets
cut off, where's my address?

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:01.220
Who do I go to?

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:03.940
So we tried to overcome
that by issuing

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:06.740
a receipt by Telenor Bank.

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:09.200
So we said, listen, Telenor
Bank is a central bank

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.730
regulated entity.

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:13.377
If your power gets cut
off, you can take the bank,

00:20:13.377 --> 00:20:15.210
go to the central bank,
and the central bank

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:17.130
will make you whole.

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:20.870
And the second policy we had
was because the average payment

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:21.864
was very small.

00:20:21.864 --> 00:20:23.780
The average utility
payment for the common man

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.280
was under 2,000 rupees.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:30.620
So our policy was never
dispute, just make that payment,

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.112
so that power
never gets cut off.

00:20:32.112 --> 00:20:34.070
Even if you think the
customer is in the wrong,

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:35.450
just make that payment.

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:38.870
Get that confidence level up
so this behavioral change takes

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:41.620
place, so people start
paying the utility bills

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:46.000
at the local mom-and-pop
store as opposed to a bank.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.420
And that was the behavioral
change we wanted.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:49.790
We ran a lot of campaigns.

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:53.360
We tried brand
ambassadors standing

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.420
at these mom-and-pop stores,
saying pay your utility bill.

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:57.260
It's interesting.

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:58.610
Here's a receipt.

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:02.230
And our own policy was
no dispute, just pay.

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:07.520
And the time I left,
Tameer bank was doing 10%

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.200
of the $30 million bills paid.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:12.830
So $3 million bills were
being paid through us.

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:16.850
And that customer saw this
confidence of actually going

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:21.560
to a mom-and-pop store and doing
a banking transaction started.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.130
So that was the initial step.

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:28.380
The second step we said-- and
I know if you're in a startup,

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:30.000
you make great plans.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.040
And when you go to the
ground, you sometimes

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:35.190
find out that those plans are in
the [? basement ?] of a basket

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:37.260
because you called it
wrong, but you have

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:38.830
to figure out a way to pivot.

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:40.980
So we thought our
biggest product was going

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:42.870
to be international remittance.

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:47.370
Pakistan gets $17 billion a
year from workers in the Middle

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:50.250
East, in the UK, and in the US.

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:53.420
And we said, you
know, bank branches,

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:57.270
12,700 close on a Sunday,
half day on Saturday,

00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:00.600
closed long period on
Friday for prayers.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.260
We would be able to use
our agents across Pakistan,

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.260
60,000 agents, and be able
to do this payment out.

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:10.010
And therefore the
large payment providers

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:12.030
would flock to come
to us because we would

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:14.569
have such great distribution.

00:22:14.569 --> 00:22:16.110
Well, the only thing
we miscalculated

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:19.270
was the average remittance
size is $40,000-- sorry,

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:21.160
40,000 rupees.

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:23.460
And the small agent
doesn't have liquidity

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:26.020
to pay out five of
these payments in a day.

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:27.950
And all you need is--

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:31.140
if Pakistanis go to ATM
and it's not working,

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:32.710
it's oh, no problem.

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:35.160
But if you go to withdraw
cash from a [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.710
banking agent, and
there's no cash,

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:38.350
they say, oh, these
guys are frauds.

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:41.610
And that whole confidence
level you've built up changes.

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:44.530
So our international
remittance product failed.

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:46.570
But in that whole
learning process,

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:48.570
we understood that
there's a huge component

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:49.980
of domestic remittance.

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:53.640
$15 billion are paid
domestically in Pakistan.

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:56.010
And the way the
money's transferred

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:58.220
is something called
hawala hundi, which

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:01.320
is informal payments
through money agents,

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:05.077
or through the post office, or
people going to your hometown

00:23:05.077 --> 00:23:06.410
and you just give them the cash.

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:08.850
So they give it to
your family back home.

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:11.430
And we said, let's try
domestic remittance.

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:14.260
And domestic remittance
was a phenomenal success.

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:15.960
And as I said, in
our regional plan,

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.720
there was no domestic
remittance as a product.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.530
But that's when you
start pivoting, too--

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:23.950
when your original plan fails.

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:27.310
And that's what actually was
the biggest behavioral change

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:29.220
in the industry we created--

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:32.240
that instead of going
to informal channels,

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.890
you could go to an
EasyPaisa agent and say,

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:36.329
I want to transfer money.

00:23:36.329 --> 00:23:38.370
And he would say, who do
you want to transfer to?

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:41.340
And in Pakistan there's
a universal identifier

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:44.820
called a computerized
national identity card.

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:47.160
So it's a 16 digit
number everybody has.

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:49.110
You just can't live
without, or you wouldn't

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:50.410
be able to do anything.

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:53.130
So if I was transferring
money to you,

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:55.650
I would show them my CNIC card.

00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:57.812
I would give them
your CNIC card number.

00:23:57.812 --> 00:24:00.270
If you had a cell phone, I'll
give you a cell phone number.

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:02.140
I'd get my cell phone number.

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:04.860
And then the agent would
hand over his feature phone,

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:07.710
because remember, you're
working on SMS at that time.

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:09.840
Smartphones hadn't come in.

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:14.440
And he would ask you to put in
a PIN number, six digit number.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:18.200
Incidentally, 90% of those
PIN numbers were 123456.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.107
But at Tameer, we
overcame that, OK?

00:24:20.107 --> 00:24:21.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:24.780
And within three
minutes, that money

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:26.850
was available to 60,000 agents.

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:28.710
And the beneficiary
would go to the agent

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:30.168
and see if I had
the money come in.

00:24:30.168 --> 00:24:32.160
He would say, OK,
show me your CNIC,

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.440
and they would
physically show the CNIC.

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:35.380
He'd say, OK.

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:38.240
The agent would give him the
phone and say put in your PIN--

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:41.144
miraculously, 123456
would be done,

00:24:41.144 --> 00:24:42.720
and the money
would be withdrawn.

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:45.280
It was a huge
change from waiting

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.550
for the post office
or informal services,

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:50.520
and it was phenomenally
successful.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:54.130
So we got to the second stage
of what was getting people now

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:56.160
to get to a comfort level
after utility bills,

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:59.610
to start making
domestic remittances.

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:02.680
The problem was that
we went to the agent.

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.980
The agent said, I'm
not going to do this.

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:08.490
You know, I make a 100%
margin on the things I sell.

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:09.870
This thing takes time.

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:13.466
You want me to add at
least 40 characters

00:25:13.466 --> 00:25:15.090
by the time I'm done
with the transfer.

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:17.700
So I'm going to add the
CNIC number from myself,

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:18.770
CNIC number for you.

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:20.650
With just 16, there's 32 digits.

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:22.730
I'm going to add a 16 digit pin.

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:24.840
38 digits, it's
going to take time.

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.850
So they extracted the
pound of flesh then.

00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:30.870
For every dollar we
made, they took $0.70.

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:33.490
That's the price we paid
for getting the agent

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:36.560
network to absorb or
except branchless banking.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:40.020
With me, $0.30 were left, which
we split between the telco

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:42.150
Telenor and Tameer Bank.

00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:46.410
So we had to again look
at doing huge volumes

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:49.170
to be able to make money, but
the agents were very happy

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:51.180
because initially,
they were reluctant,

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.160
but then they
started signing up.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.140
But the end state
was mobile wallets,

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.210
because we are still not
into branchless banking

00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:59.010
because we want
physical interaction.

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:00.790
You have to go to an agent.

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:03.540
It's like when I see an
ad in the paper, which

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:07.530
says XYZ Bank has
opened a digital branch.

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:09.420
You can walk into the
branch, and there's

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:11.030
no human intervention.

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:12.870
And I say to myself,
why in the hell would

00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:15.780
I want to get in my car,
and travel for five miles,

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:18.910
and then go to the branch,
and say, wow, digital branch.

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:22.320
You know, the smartphone
is my digital branch.

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:24.310
I should be able to
transact anything

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:26.340
while sitting in
my bed watching,

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:29.300
you know, season three of "Game
of Thrones" and the latest

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:31.530
episode, and doing
my transactions.

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:35.200
So it's just mind boggling for
me, this digital branch concept

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.670
with no human intervention.

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:39.128
Maybe it's a busy street next
to your office, but why would

00:26:39.128 --> 00:26:42.460
I even want to walk anywhere
to do my transactions?

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:46.370
So our next target was
creating mobile wallets.

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:49.250
That if you could create
mobile wallets instead of just

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:53.540
physical activity, and
if the customer was

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:56.120
able to populate the
mobile wallet, then,

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:58.740
you know, person to
person transactions,

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:02.300
utility bill payments, person
to business transactions,

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:05.490
G2P, government to person,
transactions would take place.

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:07.550
And there's 3.3 trillion
rupees floating,

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:11.090
and the system would start
coming into the banking system.

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:14.540
And we would have a
secondary revenue stream.

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:17.290
Maybe we would have some
float on these mobile wallets

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:19.680
versus the transaction fee.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.800
So initially we
had a hurdle of how

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:25.490
to open these bank accounts,
because the central bank

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:29.420
required a physical face to face
to open a bank account for KYC

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:31.380
and anti-money laundering
purposes-- that

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:34.190
to know your customer,
you got to see them.

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:36.440
Now, that's a difficult call.

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:40.230
That means either the customer
would have to go to my branch

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:43.880
and my network of agents
would not be able to open,

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:47.040
or they would have to take a
photograph of the customer--

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.055
a photograph of the CNIC--

00:27:49.055 --> 00:27:51.260
which meant that
the feature phone

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:54.171
wouldn't work because the
pixel quality was too poor.

00:27:54.171 --> 00:27:56.420
And the agent would have to
have a smartphone, and who

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:57.950
would fund that smartphone?

00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:02.540
So our advantage of having
a large network kind of

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:06.050
got underleveraged
as a consequence

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:07.930
of this requirement.

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:10.250
But sometimes things
happen in the industry

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:11.700
which don't happen
because of you,

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.590
but you get the benefit from.

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:15.410
So the Ministry of
Interior decided

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:18.620
that every person
with a cell phone

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:21.050
had to be biometrically
verified because there were

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:23.790
a lot of activities taking
place-- sometimes kidnappings,

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:26.840
sometimes terrorist activity
from cell phones they couldn't

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:27.950
identify.

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:32.090
So if I gave myself
my identity card

00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:34.520
at the time I'm
making a transaction

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:39.249
to a branchless banking agent,
that branchless bank agent

00:28:39.249 --> 00:28:41.540
could take my CNIC card and
have five more SIMs issued,

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:43.580
which I didn't know about.

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:46.460
So the Pakistan telcom authority
first came up with a way

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:49.250
that if you put in
your CNIC card number,

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:52.120
you find out how many SIMs
have been issued in your name.

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.994
And I did mine, I had 15 SIMs.

00:28:53.994 --> 00:28:55.910
And I knew that only
three of those were mine,

00:28:55.910 --> 00:29:01.190
and the rest were people using
my identity for creating a SIM

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:03.980
card account with telco.

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:07.052
They were paying them on
time, but it wasn't my SIM.

00:29:07.052 --> 00:29:08.510
And if tomorrow
something happened,

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:11.120
the agencies or I
would be responsible.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:15.730
So first this whole purge
took place of multiple SIMs

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:17.090
went away.

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:18.980
But they still said
it's not working,

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:23.720
so they said every SIM has
to be biometrically verified.

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:27.950
So if you hold the phone, you
would have to go into an agent

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:30.140
and be biometrically
verified, which

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:32.620
would be verified by the
National Identity Base we have

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:36.540
which is called NADRA, and then
your SIM would become active.

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:39.135
And if you wanted
a SIM immediately,

00:29:39.135 --> 00:29:40.010
you couldn't get one.

00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:41.850
You'd have to get
biometric verification.

00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:43.641
You'd get an official
address, and it would

00:29:43.641 --> 00:29:45.530
be delivered to your home.

00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:49.610
That took away like 35 million
SIMs from the telephone market.

00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:52.740
Immediately over a period of
time, the same took place.

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:54.620
But then we had a
very strong case.

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.980
And we went to the central
bank and said, hey,

00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:00.140
this SIM is
biometrically verified

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.150
by the central database.

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:04.460
Why am I required
to see a customer?

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:08.810
Let's create bank accounts
in line with transactions

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:10.768
and know your customer risk.

00:30:10.768 --> 00:30:13.226
So let's say we have something
called a level zero account.

00:30:13.226 --> 00:30:15.830
And this level
zero account says,

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:17.410
you can do 50,000 rupees--

00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:19.350
50,000 rupees is $50--

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:21.770
of transactions in a month.

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:23.720
That's good for
90% of Pakistanis,

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:26.500
given the per capita
income we have.

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.580
Central bank allowed
us and the industry

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:30.740
to do a remote account opening.

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:34.460
So all you have to do is send an
SMS to four of the banks which

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:38.240
are connected with telcos, and
you can open a mobile account.

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:41.270
The first thing that came about
was the one minute account,

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:44.220
which actually doesn't exist in
many countries, including here.

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:46.670
You have to physically go into
a bank to open an account.

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:50.300
In Pakistan, you can open a
level zero account remotely

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:52.460
under one minute.

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:54.800
So this hurdle of
opening a mobile account

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:57.020
went away with this
new regulation.

00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:59.720
And right now there are
27 million mobile accounts

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.520
in Pakistan over a
three year period,

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:07.220
as opposed to the 32 million
bank accounts since 1947.

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:10.100
So branchless banking or
technology can actually

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:13.160
make a huge impact
when used properly,

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:15.470
and it can change
behavior of people.

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:21.560
So obviously, nothing is easy,
so we have 27 million or 23

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:23.090
million mobile accounts.

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:25.840
But the next question you would
ask me is, that's great, sir,

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:27.640
but how many are active?

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.560
Because opening an
account is easy,

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:32.250
because I run a sales
campaign where the agent gets

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:34.030
paid for every mobile account.

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:37.390
And he has his grandmother
and his dog opening an account

00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:39.200
just because he wants
to get to that target

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:42.450
when we have got to pay him
for opening a mobile account.

00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:45.720
But less than 25% are active.

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:50.380
And active is generously defined
as one transaction in 30 days.

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:55.910
That's the GSMA definition of
a mobile account being active.

00:31:55.910 --> 00:31:59.020
So we have yet to
create the ecosystem

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:04.180
to have the customer leave
money in their mobile account,

00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:07.300
so that this becomes
a source of revenue

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.100
for the branchless
banking players.

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:13.060
Because until you get to
a stage where I can-- so

00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:15.310
I was given a number of--
getting to a tangent.

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:19.100
I was giving a speech about
what I call digital Pakistan.

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:22.150
And I said, three things need
to happen, and if we do that,

00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:24.110
we'd get exponential growth.

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:26.100
The first one is the
one minute account,

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:27.880
and that's actually
taking place.

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.880
The second was the
six orange purchase.

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:34.360
I should be able to buy six
oranges with digital cash as

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:35.305
opposed to cash.

00:32:35.305 --> 00:32:37.060
So if I'm going
into Pakistan, you

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:39.850
have a lot of hawkers,
people with the small trades.

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:42.930
If I'm doing a $1 purchase
and I'm paying in cash,

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:45.490
I should be able to
pay with digital cash.

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:47.700
And that acceptance
hasn't taken place.

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:50.620
That merchant acquisition
hasn't taking place yet.

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:52.570
And when it does,
suddenly you'll

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:55.900
see a very high level of
activity in mobile account.

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:57.820
And the third thing
was the five click

00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:00.164
onboarding-- that if you
are sitting in a village

00:33:00.164 --> 00:33:02.080
and you want to become
an e-commerce merchant,

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:04.240
you should be able
to, in five clicks,

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.670
be able to set up the
photograph of your product,

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:10.070
set up your payment mechanism,
set up your logistic mechanism.

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:12.490
And the fifth click you
should become a merchant.

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:15.350
Obviously, that needs
3G and 4G coverage,

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:16.730
which is happening in Pakistan.

00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:18.480
So those things, when
you have those kinds

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.080
of things happening,
suddenly you

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:22.670
see digital transactions
taking place.

00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:25.777
So that was the challenge, and
I think we're halfway there.

00:33:25.777 --> 00:33:27.360
So we've got the
mobile accounts open.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.970
Now we have to make them active.

00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:32.230
SPEAKER 1: As a
startup investor,

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:35.230
what is your view on
the current technology

00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:38.677
and entrepreneurial
scene in Pakistan?

00:33:38.677 --> 00:33:40.260
NADEEM HUSSAIN: So
Pakistan, remember,

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:43.011
is a country of
200 million people.

00:33:43.011 --> 00:33:45.260
You know, that's a lot of
European companies combined,

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:48.550
and you won't get to
200 million people.

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:51.010
The lens you see
Pakistan from here

00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:53.720
is, there's blood
in the streets.

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:56.810
There's bomb blasts,
or the prime minister

00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:58.570
has been removed for corruption.

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:00.990
Negative news carries easily.

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:04.250
And I've been here for
two days, and I've met,

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:06.740
I think, 12 people
already, a lot of them

00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:09.928
VCs, just talking about
what's happening in Pakistan.

00:34:09.928 --> 00:34:11.969
Because there's a
counter-narrative to what's run

00:34:11.969 --> 00:34:13.540
by CNN and Fox--

00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:16.159
you know, a lot of
positive things happening.

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:19.300
So what's happened in the last
six, seven years in Pakistan

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:21.060
is an emerging middle
class, for example.

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:23.739
There's 30 million people
in the emerging middle class

00:34:23.739 --> 00:34:25.630
with purchasing power.

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:28.780
Because the inflation rate has
been around 4%, 4 and 1/2%,

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:32.810
salaries and the company growth
rate has been around 8% to 10%,

00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:35.823
so people have been
getting incremental income.

00:34:35.823 --> 00:34:37.239
And now you have
30 million people

00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:41.110
in one country which
have purchasing power.

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:44.330
Right now, there are 45 million
smartphones in Pakistan,

00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:47.469
which is expected to go
up to 80 million by 2020.

00:34:47.469 --> 00:34:50.440
So remember the
smartphone is calling--

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:52.210
and you guys know
this better than me--

00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:55.480
calling is just 1% of a
feature of a smartphone.

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:58.540
It's the biggest invention
I see that's happened

00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:02.030
in our lifetime, and it's going
to revolutionize many things.

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:06.370
If you have a smartphone,
I can do e-health with you,

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:09.377
I can do e-education with
you, I can do e-entertainment

00:35:09.377 --> 00:35:11.460
with you, I can do e-financial
services with you--

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:13.840
and I'll talk [INAUDIBLE]
of the initiatives here.

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:17.380
Basically, the world changes
when you have a smartphone.

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:21.400
By 2020, Pakistan is going
to get 90% GSMS coverage--

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:24.470
3G and 4G all over Pakistan.

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:28.480
So suddenly, rural Pakistan gets
connected with urban Pakistan.

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:30.560
And with purchasing
power increasing,

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.380
you've got a whole
bunch of people who

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:34.320
can now-- it works both ways.

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.820
They can buy things which they
previously didn't have access

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:39.070
to, or I have access to them.

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:41.230
I can run a remote
education program.

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:44.870
I can do e-health consultations
at clinics, whichever doctor

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:48.970
is present in Karachi, but I'm
in a remote part of Pakistan,

00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:50.350
and I can do diagnostics.

00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:52.840
And then I can use
e-payments to pay the fee,

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:55.900
immediately uplink, and
again, use my e-pharmacy

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:59.030
to send the medicines
out to those people.

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:01.510
So Pakistan is now
getting connected.

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:03.850
And this is what I'm talking
to the VCs over here, that

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:07.660
here is a country which is
starved for seed capital.

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:11.380
They have two PE firms
and three VCs in Pakistan.

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:14.240
I'm the largest Indian
investor in Pakistan.

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:16.810
And I'm far from
a high net worth,

00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:19.150
as far as Pakistan's rich
families are concerned,

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:22.450
which are sitting on
half a billion of cash--

00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:24.037
liquidity, half a
billion dollars, OK?

00:36:24.037 --> 00:36:25.870
And if I am the largest
individual investor,

00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:30.550
it's a travesty, because these
guys can invest a lot more.

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:32.860
But I view this as
a major opportunity

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:36.100
because I think Pakistan
is grossly undervalued.

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:37.950
With all these things
I'm talking about,

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:40.320
this big consumer is
going to take place,

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:43.210
and the valuations over
a period of time go up.

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:47.302
The VCs outside Pakistan will
recognize Pakistan as a country

00:36:47.302 --> 00:36:48.760
where they ought
to come and invest

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:51.820
once they get over the
Pakistan risk hurdle.

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:54.370
And then what
valuations we have now

00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:56.920
are going to
exponentially increase,

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.617
and people who
invest now are going

00:36:58.617 --> 00:36:59.950
to be able to ride that benefit.

00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:02.500
They're taking the
initial risk, and people

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:06.289
will get rewarded for being
in Pakistan at the right time.

00:37:06.289 --> 00:37:09.380
SPEAKER 2: We have a
Livestream question.

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:13.120
The question is whether
the regulatory environment

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:17.450
in Pakistan poses a huge
challenge to the startups.

00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:21.670
And what is changing,
and what can

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:26.150
the startups do to
not fall into that?

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:29.120
NADEEM HUSSAIN: So, you know,
there's good news and bad news.

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:30.820
The good news, for
example, if people

00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:33.460
are starting a
microfinance institution,

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:35.110
Pakistan's regulatory
environment

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:37.730
is recognized by the
economic intervention unit,

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:42.070
as number three in the world,
so that's very sorted out.

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:45.470
But if you're not in
a microfinance world,

00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:49.720
then it's a challenge,
because the laws

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:51.850
are geared for the old economy.

00:37:51.850 --> 00:37:54.640
And they're not geared
for the new economy.

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.430
So if you look at
neighboring India,

00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:59.590
they have startup India where
they have taken five or six

00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:01.090
different things
and said, we've got

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:04.630
to change these laws if we are
going to make an entrepreneur

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:06.570
culture happen in India.

00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:08.290
Pakistan's recognized
those things.

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:11.050
For example, if I want
to register my company,

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:12.630
I ought to be able
to do it online,

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:14.950
and painlessly, and there
should be a separate window.

00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:18.160
That window exists, but it's
not very effective right now.

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:20.230
If I am investing, I
should be able to do

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:23.410
a down round, which Pakistan
law doesn't currently allow.

00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:25.300
I should be able
to give employee

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:28.100
options, which Pakistan law
doesn't currently recognize.

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:30.400
So we've identified
all the issues

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:32.970
working with the Securities
and Exchange Commission,

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:34.910
working with the tax regime--

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:38.440
now to provide shelter for
both investor and investees,

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:43.070
because you're going to have
a lot of startups that fail.

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:45.379
And you want to make
that investor actually

00:38:45.379 --> 00:38:47.170
get some protection
for all that money that

00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:49.030
gets written off initially.

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:49.870
So getting there.

00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:51.430
We're not there yet.

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:53.270
But it's recognized
by the government

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:56.020
now that Pakistan
has the largest youth

00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:58.020
cohort in the world.

00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:00.370
75% of people are under 35.

00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:02.920
50% of people are under 25.

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:05.470
As these young people
graduate, there's

00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:08.320
no way our current
economy can absorb them

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:10.420
through regular
employment, so there

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:12.616
has to be entrepreneurship.

00:39:12.616 --> 00:39:14.240
In order to make that
entrepreneurship,

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:17.030
it can be a dividend,
or it can be a bond.

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:18.970
Because if you don't
have employment

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:21.010
for the youth coming
out, then they'll

00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:23.024
get into what I
call reverse ATMs.

00:39:23.024 --> 00:39:24.940
So when you stop at a
traffic light, they say,

00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:25.990
can I have your phone?

00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:26.770
Can I have your wallet?

00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:28.350
Can I have anything
else that [INAUDIBLE]??

00:39:28.350 --> 00:39:30.683
And they'll be withdrawing
from you non-voluntarily, OK?

00:39:30.683 --> 00:39:31.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:33.361
Because you've got to
give them employment.

00:39:33.361 --> 00:39:35.810
There has to be means for
them to sustain themselves.

00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:38.735
So that's why the government in
the private sector, and that's

00:39:38.735 --> 00:39:41.110
why I have so much passion
for entrepreneurship because I

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:42.490
think that's the future.

00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:44.797
Because Pakistan is
such a young population,

00:39:44.797 --> 00:39:46.380
and I work with young
people, and they

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:49.690
have far more brilliant ideas
than I can even think of.

00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:51.820
And they need an
environment where

00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:55.360
people can believe in them,
mentor them, help them grow,

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.850
and provide capital.

00:39:56.850 --> 00:39:58.450
But I'm just one
person, so we need

00:39:58.450 --> 00:40:01.930
to have a whole slew of
people and support system

00:40:01.930 --> 00:40:06.520
from the government that
makes this a much, much bigger

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:08.110
play on a grander scale.

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:10.440
And we're getting there,
but we're not there yet.

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:14.520
SPEAKER 2: So follow-up question
on that note, what roles are

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:16.580
dedicated incubators playing?

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:19.210
And if you can name
a few, which are

00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:20.460
playing active role in this?

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:23.380
NADEEM HUSSAIN: So there are
34 incubator accelerators

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:26.800
in Pakistan, and I would say
probably three years ago,

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:27.970
there were five.

00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:30.400
So there's a mushrooming
and understanding

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:35.080
that incubators and
accelerators can play a role.

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:40.660
There's PlanX, Plan9, Nest
i/o, my incubator, 10XC.

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:43.630
You know, universities
are incubators as well.

00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:48.400
It's good news and
bad news again.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.970
The good news is
that entrepreneurs

00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:53.450
who want to go into an
accelerator incubator program

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:55.402
now are able to get mentorships.

00:40:55.402 --> 00:40:58.510
They are able to get
co-working space.

00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:00.790
The bad news is there's
only one accelerator that

00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:06.010
actually pays you or values
you and gives you money.

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:09.460
And once you graduate,
there's not enough seed funds

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:12.580
available over there, VCs,
that when you're graduating

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:16.310
and your initial capital is
burned up, to give you money.

00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:18.390
So the risk we run
sometimes is that you

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:20.860
can have default
rates far higher

00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:23.580
than the natural
95% default rate,

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:26.719
because there's not enough
capital once you graduate.

00:41:26.719 --> 00:41:28.260
And that's one of
the things that I'm

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:30.810
spending at least the
bulk of my time on,

00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:34.380
is getting people so that
seed funds and VCs are theirs,

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:37.260
so when people graduate and
have a great idea they don't

00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:39.099
die because of lack of capital.

00:41:39.099 --> 00:41:40.890
They ought to die
because it's an idea that

00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:44.070
can be scaled, not because
there's no capital,

00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:48.352
and great ideas just,
you know, finish off.

00:41:48.352 --> 00:41:51.340
SPEAKER 1: OK, we have time
for maybe one last question.

00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:54.536
SPEAKER 2: Do we have
questions from the audience?

00:41:54.536 --> 00:41:55.660
NADEEM HUSSAIN: Mesmerized.

00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:58.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:02.110
SPEAKER 2: Yeah?

00:42:02.110 --> 00:42:04.680
AUDIENCE: How long do you think
it would take for behaviors

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:07.940
to change as far as actually
using digital wallet

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:12.054
and digital transactions
on the six orange thing

00:42:12.054 --> 00:42:13.220
that you were talking about?

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:15.761
NADEEM HUSSAIN: So one of the
constraints of the six orange--

00:42:15.761 --> 00:42:17.180
if you know the
banking business,

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:19.880
then there's something
called merchant acquiring.

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:22.430
That if you use your
credit card or debit

00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:25.550
card at a merchant or the point
of sale machine, POS machine,

00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:28.100
where he just swipes your card.

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:30.230
And, you know, the
payment gets made.

00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:32.170
It takes money from
your credit card

00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:34.130
and pays it to the supplier.

00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:39.110
So the constraint in Pakistan
was that that POS machine cost

00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:42.240
about, let's say, $30, $35.

00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:45.820
And if I want to go
to a real small shop,

00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:49.460
his or her inventory is
not equal to the $30 risk

00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:50.470
I'm taking.

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:53.570
Or if I want to build 100,000
merchants, I need $30 million

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:57.560
of capital to put 100,000
machines in place.

00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:59.900
But technology has a
way of changing things,

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:01.920
and now you have QR codes.

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:04.750
So a QR code now
at a merchant can

00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:08.130
be put in where a POS machine
is no longer required.

00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:10.500
And if the customer
has a smartphone,

00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:15.110
he just puts his QR code,
and a payment can be made.

00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:18.500
But the challenge that's
still remaining is that--

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:21.189
typically, the way
that a bank makes

00:43:21.189 --> 00:43:23.605
money is that there's something
called a Merchant Discount

00:43:23.605 --> 00:43:24.740
Rate, MDR.

00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:26.570
So if you sign
[? up a ?] merchant,

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:29.614
the merchant's going to
pay you 1 and 1/2%, 1%,

00:43:29.614 --> 00:43:31.280
depending on where
you are in the world,

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:34.430
as fees for the facilitation
that you're doing

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:36.066
for increasing their sales.

00:43:36.066 --> 00:43:37.440
Because other than
cash, a person

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:41.250
can come in and use a
credit card or a debit card.

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:42.770
But a mom-and-pop
store or a hawker

00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:44.570
are not going to give you 1%.

00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:45.810
He says, thank you very much.

00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:46.642
I like cash.

00:43:46.642 --> 00:43:48.350
First, you're asking
me not to take cash.

00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:50.840
Then you want to charge
me for not taking cash?

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:52.140
Doesn't work for me.

00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:54.800
So this business model
needs to be worked out

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:56.300
that if you create
these merchants

00:43:56.300 --> 00:44:00.590
then you make money from float,
as opposed to transaction fee,

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:03.270
and the Pakistani
market is not there yet.

00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:06.830
So while QR code has
been established,

00:44:06.830 --> 00:44:10.940
and people like experimenting
like [INAUDIBLE] with QR

00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:15.710
codes, or HBL, or Mastercard,
the real inflection point

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:17.770
has come when they figure
out the business model.

00:44:17.770 --> 00:44:20.070
AUDIENCE: Do you think that's
a major hurdle right now?

00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:22.403
NADEEM HUSSAIN: Yeah, but I
think we're about, probably,

00:44:22.403 --> 00:44:25.110
a year to 18 months away
before that gets correct.

00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:27.980
I'm going to take a shot at
it as well, so let's see.

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:29.835
Great.

00:44:29.835 --> 00:44:30.710
SPEAKER 2: All right.

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:34.340
So we have one final
question-- maybe a minute

00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:36.500
and a half for that
pretty broad one.

00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:40.970
What can companies like Google
and other [INAUDIBLE] companies

00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:46.350
do, in your opinion, in
the emerging markets?

00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:49.670
NADEEM HUSSAIN: I think one
of the things Google or large

00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:52.430
players can do, very
honestly, broad response--

00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:55.760
believe in Pakistan, believe
in the talent that exists,

00:44:55.760 --> 00:45:01.080
and use some of the CSR and
non-CSR money in supporting--

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:03.170
and some of that is
already being done.

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:05.810
So 10XC, my accelerator
has a special deal

00:45:05.810 --> 00:45:09.830
for data with cloud funding
from Google for startups,

00:45:09.830 --> 00:45:11.630
but there's going to
be a lot more of that.

00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:13.010
Take some investment dollars.

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:15.230
Put it in the
infrastructure in Pakistan.

00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:18.890
Because this is, like I said,
a 200 million people country

00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:21.420
with a large youth
cohort, which will become

00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:24.170
Google customers for life.

00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:27.140
So there's a lot more investment
that needs to take place,

00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:29.450
and a lot more understanding
and appreciation

00:45:29.450 --> 00:45:32.170
of what the local dynamics
are, not just for Google,

00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:34.730
but for other people
in the Bay Area who

00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:39.156
want to access a country
of 200 million people.

00:45:39.156 --> 00:45:41.110
SPEAKER 1: Let's
thank our speaker.

00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:42.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:42.910 --> 00:45:44.760
NADEEM HUSSAIN: Thank you.
