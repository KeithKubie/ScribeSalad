[melancholy piano music]

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.920
JUST LIKE YOU, YOU, YOU, YOU.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.289
USED TO CLOWN AROUND...

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:12.772
I GOT HIT WITH AIDS.

00:01:12.772 --> 00:01:15.809
CONSEQUENCES.

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:20.746
GOT INTO SOME
REAL TROUBLE, BOY.

00:01:20.746 --> 00:01:23.616
STOLE FROM MY MOM AND DAD...

00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:26.085
STOLE FROM MY OWN SISTER!

00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:29.255
AND THEN ONE DAY...

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:30.823
A PIANO FELL ON MY HEAD.

00:01:30.823 --> 00:01:34.994

00:01:38.464 --> 00:01:40.333
ONE FOR EACH KEY.

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:43.603
YOU'D THINK I'M LEARNING,
BUT, NO.

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:45.204
SEE, I'M JUST LIKE YOU.

00:01:45.204 --> 00:01:46.772
I GOT BACK OUT THERE,

00:01:46.772 --> 00:01:51.210
STARTED MAKING
SOME REAL CRIMES, HOMEBOY.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.945
OH, YEAH.

00:01:52.945 --> 00:01:54.814 line:92%

00:01:57.883 --> 00:01:59.685
I GOT TRAMPLED
BY A HERD OF BUFFALO.

00:01:59.685 --> 00:02:02.888

00:02:02.888 --> 00:02:05.224

I THINK WE'VE HAD ENOUGH.

00:02:05.224 --> 00:02:07.660
- NOT DONE WITH MY STORY!

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.364
I WAS LIKE YOU!

00:02:11.364 --> 00:02:13.733
I DECIDED IT'D BE COOL

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:16.569
TO HANG OUT
WITH SOME OF THE TOUGH KIDS.

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.005
MM. YOU KNOW
WHO I'M TALKING ABOUT.

00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:23.208
THEY WERE HANGING
ON THE STREETS LATE AT NIGHT.

00:02:23.208 --> 00:02:27.012
MORE THAN
CIGARETTE SMOKERS, HOMES.

00:02:27.012 --> 00:02:29.415
AND THEN...

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:32.885
ONE DAY I GOT SHOT
OUT OF A CATAPULT.

00:02:32.885 --> 00:02:34.586
- THAT'S IT.
OKAY.

00:02:34.586 --> 00:02:36.055
- INTO THE MOUTH OF A DRAGON!

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:38.257
- STUDENTS, EVERYTHING YOU'VE
HEARD HERE TODAY IS A LIE.

00:02:38.257 --> 00:02:39.558
- I DON'T LIE ANYMORE.

00:02:39.558 --> 00:02:41.494
- YOU'RE ALL EXCUSED.

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:45.765
- LOOK AT ME!
- PLEASE, I APOLOGIZE.

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:47.733
- I SHOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE!

00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:49.435
- THANK YOU, AURELIO.

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:50.536
I APOLOGIZE, DENISE.

00:02:50.536 --> 00:02:52.238
- SO I GOT REALLY DEEP
INTO CRIME.

00:02:52.238 --> 00:02:56.008
I DID A DRIVE-BY AT MY OWN
DAUGHTER'S<i>QUINCEAÑERA!</i>

00:02:56.008 --> 00:02:59.712
YEAH, SHOT UP EVERYBODY--
DEAD, KILLED!

00:02:59.712 --> 00:03:01.580
YEAH!

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.283 line:92%
YEAH!

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:04.951
THEN I GOT SUCKED
INTO A WORMHOLE.

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:06.085
CONSEQUENCES.

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:08.086
- THAT'S IT. OKAY.
EVERYBODY GO.

00:03:08.086 --> 00:03:09.889
- I WAS IN ANOTHER DIMENSION,

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.057
TRIED TO INTRODUCE
MY OWN PARENTS TO EACH OTHER.

00:03:12.057 --> 00:03:14.294
ALMOST FAILED.
ARM WAS DISAPPEARING.

00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:15.761
- I'VE HAD IT.

00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:17.696
- I INVENTED<i>JOHNNY B. GOODE</i>■
AT MY PARENTS' PROM,

00:03:17.696 --> 00:03:20.299
AND AT THE LAST MOMENT,
THEY KISSED, AND IT CAME BACK.

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.234
- THE FASTER WE GET AWAY
FROM HIM, THE BETTER.

00:03:22.234 --> 00:03:24.103
- BUT NOBODY BELIEVE ME!

00:03:24.103 --> 00:03:26.539
WHERE'S MY CRACK?
WHERE'S MY CRACK?

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:28.608
OH.

00:03:28.608 --> 00:03:31.277
[booming crash]

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:32.445
OH!

CONSEQUENCES!
