00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.610
- Welcome to a conversation with history.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.670
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.870
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.600
Our guest today is Seyla Benhabib,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.900
who is the Eugene Meyer
professor of political science

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.310
and philosophy at Yale University

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.150
and director of the program in

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.010
ethics, politics, and economics.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.960
She is the author of numerous books,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.200
including Critique, Norm and Utopia,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.200
Situating the Self,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.310
The Reluctant Modernism of Hannah Arendt,

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.450
and The Claims of Culture.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.340
She is the 2004 Tanner
Lecturer at UC Berkeley.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.720
Seyla, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.718
- Thank you.

00:01:09.718 --> 00:01:10.730
- [Harry] Where were you born and raised?

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.370
- I was born in Istanbul, Turkey,

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.570
and I came to the United States in 1970,

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.780
but basically I was raised in Istanbul.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.010
I went to school there,

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.420
the English High School for
Girls, for secondary school,

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.200
junior high basically,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.383
and the American College
for Girls for senior high.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.550
- And how and when did
your family come to Turkey?

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.230
- My family came to Turkey, as we say,

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.750
in 1492, along with the Ottomans

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.330
when they conquered
Istanbul from Byzantium.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.790
And my ancestors are Sephardic Jews

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.496
who fled Spain, excuse me, in 1492,

00:01:55.496 --> 00:02:00.496
when the Inquisition was
forcing Jews, basically,

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.610
either to convert or,
you know, decimating them

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.730
or forcing them to go underground.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.710
And at the time, the Ottoman Empire

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.901
had a policy of giving refuge

00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:16.150
to the Jewish community
escaping from Spain.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.470
Why or how this policy was there,

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.610
whether it was an attempt also to capture

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.340
Eastern Mediterranean trade or whether

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.610
it was some ancient rule of hospitality,

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.933
but in any event, as far back as we know,

00:02:28.933 --> 00:02:33.933
we came to Turkey at about 1492,
you know, during that time.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.960
- And looking back, how do you think

00:02:39.562 --> 00:02:43.713
this family history shaped
your thinking about the world?

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.500
- Well, I think that it makes me aware

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.500
of the fragility of good
political institutions.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.930
I never take them for granted.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.750
I am always attentive to the ways in which

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.560
particularly collective
ideologies of purity,

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.540
be it religious purity, racial purity,

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.933
or national purity, can go wrong.

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:14.490
I mean 1492 is also the period

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.030
that is referred to, for example,

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.670
in Spanish history, as
the Second Reconquista,

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.670
or the reconquering of
Spain from the Muslims.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.480
And it is the consolidation of Catholic,

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.030
the Catholic kingdom
of Spain and authority.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.690
And at the same time, its consequence

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.690
was the decimation of
first the Jewish minority

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.461
and also, to a lesser extent,

00:03:40.461 --> 00:03:43.910
the triumph over the Muslim community.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.067
So this makes me very distrustful

00:03:47.067 --> 00:03:52.067
of, basically, collectivist
ideologies of any kind.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.370
It makes me very attentive
to what I would like to call

00:03:57.598 --> 00:04:02.598
practices of good governance
and state-building,

00:04:03.491 --> 00:04:07.100
and makes me realize how fragile

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.250
and unpredictable sometimes, you know,

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.670
the course of history is.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.030
So it may be not an accident that in the,

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.473
more in the last decade, I
have been writing more and more

00:04:17.473 --> 00:04:21.212
on questions of refuge,
asylum, citizenship

00:04:21.212 --> 00:04:26.180
and cultural conflict and
multiculturalism and nationality,

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.630
because I have so much that
I can also bring to this.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.200
I mean my nerve ends are constantly

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.800
sensitive to these issues.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.920
- We'll talk about that
later in the interview,

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.120
your current work, but let's,

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.630
let me ask you about your parents.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.210
How do you think, looking back,

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.210
that they shaped your views of the world?

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.110
Did they just build on this history

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.850
that we've just discussed?

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.180
- Well I think that my,

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.129
the family background is in some ways

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:05.129
quite typical, I think, for
diasporic Jewish communities.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.840
I have a grandfather who was a rabbi.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.840
But my father could not
even complete his studies

00:05:17.312 --> 00:05:20.550
as the Second World War broke out.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.320
My parents were married in 1939.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.168
My father was, for a brief period,

00:05:25.168 --> 00:05:28.210
inducted into the Turkish Army,

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.650
and then it turned out that Turkey

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.460
stayed out of the war
and declared neutrality.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.750
And my father subsequently
became a businessman.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.122
And my mother's history is that she was

00:05:42.122 --> 00:05:45.050
educated, actually, in a
French elementary school,

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.840
and then she went to
an Italian high school.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.440
So we grew up, you know, with a background

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.240
of multiple European languages at home.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.750
I mean at any one point in time

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.360
we could shift from Turkish
into French into Ladino,

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.710
and then came English,

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.830
and my mom also spoke Italian.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.210
So we were very much, I
think that what I would

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.370
say about the family background is that

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.713
we were very much, you
know, part of Europe.

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.220
All these European currents of thought,

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.470
you know, sort of literature and ideas,

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.710
went through us even though we were

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.036
living in a primarily Muslim,

00:06:23.036 --> 00:06:26.270
and to many understandings, quote unquote,

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.720
an Oriental, you know, community.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.780
We were part of this legacy.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.920
But my mother in particular was someone

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.910
who really could have studied further

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.920
if the circumstances of being

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.722
a woman at that point
would have permitted.

00:06:42.722 --> 00:06:45.620
I mean, for example, my mother's mother

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.926
never went to school, she
didn't know how to read,

00:06:48.926 --> 00:06:53.180
which is always a remarkable fact for me

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.840
when I think back that, you know,

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.806
her granddaughter is, you
know, a professor at Yale.

00:06:58.806 --> 00:07:00.860
And you know, my grandmother, basically,

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.804
did not know how to read.

00:07:02.804 --> 00:07:05.240
But my mother was offered a scholarship

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.700
by Mussolini's Italy to go
and study history of art,

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.170
and of course, my grandmother said

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.470
you are going absolutely nowhere,

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:17.370
and she was married off the next year.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.720
So I come from this mixture of, you know,

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.415
Oriental and Western values,

00:07:22.415 --> 00:07:23.910
where women were educated
but then married off

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:25.900
at the age of 19 and 20,

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:30.020
where you went a certain way
but you didn't go all the way.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.290
You didn't push the envelope all the way.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.030
- And how did this diversity,

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:36.860
which you must have lived everyday,

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.028
now I'm talking about sort of

00:07:39.028 --> 00:07:41.246
being in the Istanbul community,

00:07:41.246 --> 00:07:45.820
that must have been an amazing experience

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:50.010
in terms of sensitizing you to issues,

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:52.710
concerns, and sensibilities

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:54.890
that we're just now encountering

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:57.363
in big parts of the United States.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.960
- Istanbul itself was, and
I think it's lessened now,

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.790
but it was one of the big cosmopolitan

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:10.790
centers of, in a way, the old Europe.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:14.180
I mean, we not only had
this diversity of languages

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:18.450
and affiliations, if
you wish, in the family,

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:20.493
but the schools that I went to,

00:08:21.764 --> 00:08:26.351
there were a lot of girls of Greek origin,

00:08:26.351 --> 00:08:31.100
ethnic Greeks who had remained in Turkey.

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.180
I had Armenian friends growing up,

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:35.380
and this is something that people

00:08:36.998 --> 00:08:38.010
who know about the Armenian massacres,

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:39.803
for example, do not realize,

00:08:40.793 --> 00:08:42.686
that there were still a substantial number

00:08:42.686 --> 00:08:46.099
of Armenians who remained in Turkey.

00:08:46.099 --> 00:08:47.693
I do not have the exact numbers,

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:51.050
but I believe that they were

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:54.210
probably, in size, as large
as the Jewish community,

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:58.232
which was about 100,000 when
I was growing up in the 1950s.

00:08:58.232 --> 00:09:03.232
And there were also
children of various foreign

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:08.150
diplomats, teachers, embassies.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:11.970
And so Istanbul was basically a city

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:16.807
in which you heard five or
six different languages.

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:20.247
You could encounter,
you know, neighborhoods,

00:09:20.247 --> 00:09:23.620
varieties of food and taste.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.770
So the very concept of, you know,

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:29.630
cosmopolitanism in multiculturalism,

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:32.410
there's also that aspect of it in the old,

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:36.093
in the older metropolises, you know,

00:09:36.093 --> 00:09:41.093
a city like Istanbul, that
was quite remarkable I think.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.160
- And then where were you educated

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.170
once you left Turkey and
came to the United States?

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:51.030
- I came to Brandeis
University with a scholarship.

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.710
- The Wien.

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:54.790
- Yes, funded by Larry Wien,

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:56.957
the Wien International Scholarship, right.

00:09:58.065 --> 00:09:59.450
And I was there for two years

00:10:00.342 --> 00:10:02.064
and did my degree in philosophy

00:10:02.064 --> 00:10:03.233
and then moved to Yale from there.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:07.650
- And what drew you to
political philosophy?

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:11.803
Was it the teachers that you had or what?

00:10:14.107 --> 00:10:17.335
- No, I think it was more,

00:10:17.335 --> 00:10:20.467
it was probably several things.

00:10:20.467 --> 00:10:22.630
I mean, first I think it was

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:27.530
simply the biographical background

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:29.460
and always, you know, the sense of

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.516
sort of being in Turkey but
not really being, you know,

00:10:34.516 --> 00:10:37.280
Turkish in the ethnic or national sense

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.570
and negotiating those
conflicts as I was growing up.

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:45.030
But then, of course, 1968,
the Student Movement.

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:50.030
And I was in the American
College for Girls,

00:10:50.254 --> 00:10:54.520
which was an elite, you
would say, junior college,

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.567
and the news of the Vietnam
War was coming to us.

00:10:57.567 --> 00:11:00.563
And we had many teachers
who themselves were,

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:05.697
in many cases, draft evaders who had come

00:11:05.697 --> 00:11:09.190
to teach in Istanbul
in an American school,

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:11.550
and had refused to go to the war.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.790
So the news of the Vietnam War

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:16.072
was basically what we talked about

00:11:16.072 --> 00:11:19.130
during our lunch hours.

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:22.620
And I remember seeing those pictures

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.750
of, you know, babies
with napalm, you know,

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:28.500
who had been exposed to
napalm bombing and et cetera.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.660
And I think that there was

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.293
a speedy process of politicization.

00:11:34.699 --> 00:11:36.820
So not only then there
was the Vietnam War,

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:38.330
there was the Student Movement,

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.150
and in Turkey in particular,

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:43.580
there was an emergence
of an independent left,

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:47.513
a very significant
mobilization among the workers.

00:11:48.679 --> 00:11:52.340
So history sort of was
knocking at the door,

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:55.260
and if you were a thoughtful
or reflective person,

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.880
you had to focus on the political issues.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:01.500
But of course, you know,
I'm sure it was also

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.550
a personal affinity that drew me.

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:05.460
I mean I was always
interested in philosophy.

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:09.930
I think I have a mind that
tends towards abstractions,

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:14.110
but I also am interested in seeing

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:17.307
the way in which these
abstractions and principles

00:12:17.307 --> 00:12:21.890
are at work or play themselves
out in the course of history.

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:26.328
So I would say that,
beginning with 1968, you know,

00:12:26.328 --> 00:12:30.300
both the student movement,
anti Vietnam War movements,

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:34.035
the workers movements in Turkey,

00:12:34.035 --> 00:12:37.140
you know, politics has just
never left my life since then.

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:40.202
- And what was your dissertation on?

00:12:40.202 --> 00:12:43.720
- My dissertation was on Hegel.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.910
It was on Hegel's philosophy of right.

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:49.304
It was on his philosophy of the state

00:12:49.304 --> 00:12:51.400
and it was called Natural Right and Hegel,

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.510
an essay on modern political philosophy.

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:55.410
So it seems in many ways

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:57.840
I was asking the same questions,

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.060
and I think I have been
asking the same questions.

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.060
I think most people who do philosophy,

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.690
I really believe, have a certain

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:06.400
central question, an existential question

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.430
that accompanies them most of their lives.

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:11.670
And you write different works,
you write different books,

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:13.190
but I believe that you're basically

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:15.280
asking the same question.

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:20.280
And for me, the issue,
starting already in that work,

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:23.888
was how to reconcile universalistic

00:13:23.888 --> 00:13:28.888
principles of human rights,
autonomy, and freedom

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.586
with our concrete particular identities

00:13:32.586 --> 00:13:37.080
as members of certain
concrete human communities

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:41.280
divided by language, by
ethnicity, by religion.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.720
And so I went to Hegel's
philosophy of right

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.529
because Hegel is really one of the first

00:13:47.529 --> 00:13:50.040
systematic thinkers in modernity

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:53.700
who says, look, we have three
principles in the state,

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.300
there is morality, there is legality,

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.941
and then there is ethical life.

00:13:58.941 --> 00:14:00.060
You know, morality is what we all

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.330
should have in common as
moral, rational beings,

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:04.920
legality is the system of
rights under which we live,

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.153
and ethical life is
basically the structure

00:14:07.153 --> 00:14:09.850
of a family, the market, civil society,

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:12.120
and the concrete state to which we belong.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.920
So that's what I focused on,

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.810
and it seems to be, for the last 30 years,

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:19.300
I have been circling around this question

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:20.663
in one way or another.

00:14:21.509 --> 00:14:24.210
And you know, giving it different answers.

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:27.235
But the question seems
to me to have remained.

00:14:27.235 --> 00:14:29.510
- And in a second we'll talk about,

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:30.985
you know, where you are now,

00:14:30.985 --> 00:14:33.290
what the current iterations
are, to use your word.

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:36.530
But before we do that,
could you help our audience

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:40.801
understand what a
political philosopher does?

00:14:40.801 --> 00:14:43.910
At one level it's a silly question,

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:47.040
but also I think it may be a way

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.857
to then talk about your
current work actually.

00:14:49.857 --> 00:14:52.957
- What does a political philosopher do?

00:14:52.957 --> 00:14:56.962
I think to be a political philosopher,

00:14:56.962 --> 00:14:59.397
it's more a vocation than a career.

00:14:59.397 --> 00:15:03.000
I mean, we can be in universities,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.200
and in some contexts
one can be a journalist,

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.000
one can be a human rights activist.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.940
But basically, it is,
I would say that it is

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:18.229
a vocation for thinking
about the political.

00:15:18.229 --> 00:15:21.420
Not just politics, the day
to day in our politics,

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:24.310
but about the phenomenon of the political,

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:28.355
that all known human communities
of any degree of complexity

00:15:28.355 --> 00:15:32.220
organize themselves according
to certain principles

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:37.220
of justice, equality,
reciprocity and authority.

00:15:37.986 --> 00:15:40.629
I mean, these are
anthropological universals.

00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:43.590
You know, you can go to
ancient Indian communities,

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:45.083
to Aboriginal communities,

00:15:46.097 --> 00:15:47.887
there will be a system of power

00:15:47.887 --> 00:15:48.720
and a system of legitimation

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:51.470
according to which goods are distributed,

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:55.620
offices are distributed,
and rewards are arranged.

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:58.440
So in that sense, the political,

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.970
understood as this domain,

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:05.970
is fundamentally constitutive
of our lives as humans.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.450
And that's why, for example,

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:13.410
Aristotle defined the human animal

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:17.400
as the zoon logon echon, that is to say,

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.790
the animal who is capable
of reasoned speech.

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:22.469
And to be capable of reasoned speech,

00:16:22.469 --> 00:16:24.610
it means also that we are capable

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:27.860
of persuading others, and that we are,

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:32.190
together, capable of
forming a system of values

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:37.190
and a system of principles
on using our reasoned speech.

00:16:38.577 --> 00:16:41.160
So, in that sense, the political

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.400
is fundamental to the human condition.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.687
I mean, particularly today, you know,

00:16:48.551 --> 00:16:52.120
we live in such a moment of
the decline of the political.

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:54.330
You know, we live in a period when

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:56.510
the political is simply understood either

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:59.180
as strategic bargaining of various games,

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:02.440
the way a lot of political
science understands the political

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:05.958
is various interest groups
positioning themselves

00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:10.958
as trying to get, you know, various gains,

00:17:11.213 --> 00:17:14.097
whether material, office, or authority,

00:17:14.097 --> 00:17:17.890
or we have, I think, a
culture at the moment,

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:20.760
particularly in this country,

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:24.000
a culture that personalizes the political

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
and reduces it to the
sensationalistic and to the intimate

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:31.270
so that the political disappears

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:36.270
in the sensationalist stories
about the individuals.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.050
So I think we are at
a very troubled moment

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:45.627
as far as political culture is concerned.

00:17:47.753 --> 00:17:51.820
So the vocation of the
political philosopher

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:55.330
becomes more and more difficult.

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:58.360
I mean, we are part of, I would say,

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.400
the process of collective
cultural reflection.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.720
And some of the work that we do

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:06.010
is very close to cultural criticism.

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:07.120
The other work that we do

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.650
may be more systematic and reconstructive

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:12.220
in terms of trying to understand

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:14.160
what the principles of justice are

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.890
for, you know, modern societies.

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:17.950
What, you know, distribution should

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:20.130
look like in our kinds of societies,

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:23.320
what is the basis of authority.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.428
But in particular I think that

00:18:25.428 --> 00:18:30.428
political theorists must remind one

00:18:30.549 --> 00:18:34.530
of the significance of the political

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:37.210
as opposed to what counts as,

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:39.510
you know, politics in everyday world.

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:41.880
I mean, to the degree to which, you know,

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.250
sort of, politics has almost become

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:48.670
a pejorative term in our
culture, increasingly.

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:49.823
I mean, politicking.

00:18:51.063 --> 00:18:54.207
It's not something to which
we attribute a lot of value.

00:18:54.207 --> 00:18:56.800
But that itself is a
major issue and a problem,

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.300
and it is really a kind of, you know,

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:02.948
decline in public culture
to have come to that point.

00:19:02.948 --> 00:19:06.922
- What are the prerequisites
of doing this kind of work?

00:19:06.922 --> 00:19:10.190
Obviously abstract thinking

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:14.269
is very crucial to these endeavors.

00:19:14.269 --> 00:19:17.125
But how much are you influenced,

00:19:17.125 --> 00:19:20.920
you clearly draw on tradition and history.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:23.390
As you just said, you're going back

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:28.390
to the themes that recur but
in fact are being forgotten,

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:33.053
really, because of the processes today.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:42.139
- I mean, obviously you need
a certain kind of training

00:19:42.139 --> 00:19:46.140
in the history of political
thought, first of all.

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.780
I mean, you know, there is a tremendously

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:52.110
rich and important tradition,

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:56.020
and I personally regret that I do not know

00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:58.420
as much about the history
of political thought

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:01.621
outside the Western tradition.

00:20:01.621 --> 00:20:04.949
I mean I myself am more of a specialist,

00:20:04.949 --> 00:20:07.392
particularly, on European
and German thought,

00:20:07.392 --> 00:20:11.130
and it took me many years
to acquire the kind of,

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:14.173
let's say, German language
proficiency that I have.

00:20:14.173 --> 00:20:17.249
And there is a certain kind of dedication

00:20:17.249 --> 00:20:20.930
and training, first of all, you know,

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:24.820
to this tradition that you have to have,

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:29.820
but there also has to be
a passion about politics.

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:32.780
I mean, there has to be a
passionate involvement with it.

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:36.381
You must care about the
world around you, I think,

00:20:36.381 --> 00:20:40.270
to really want to bring the principles

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:43.450
of philosophy to bear upon the world,

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:45.850
rather than simply seeing
the world as a kind of

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:48.700
fallen, you know, it's a mess,

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.330
because most of the time,
if you read the newspaper,

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:53.100
it certainly appears as a mess.

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:55.150
And you know, the tendency to want to

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:58.720
sort of look beyond it maybe be great.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.890
That's why most philosophy
actually sort of

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:03.400
looks beyond the world to something else.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.640
But the political philosophy

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:07.050
is always in a strange situation.

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:09.920
She is always caught in mediating

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.960
very abstract principles
with concrete realities

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.743
such as to think through,

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:19.650
to use Arendt's term, what we are doing.

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:22.270
And to think through what we are doing

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:25.950
and where we are going in light
of this abstract principle,

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:28.041
of course it involves
training, but as I say,

00:21:28.041 --> 00:21:32.223
I think it also involves
a passion and a vocation.

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:38.597
- And you're also, as you just suggested,

00:21:38.597 --> 00:21:42.210
affected by events and the chaos

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:43.710
that those events are producing,

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:48.700
and in some ways, it's
an ordering process,

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:51.423
a putting together of the facts

00:21:51.423 --> 00:21:55.070
by referring back to works that we think

00:21:55.070 --> 00:22:00.070
are not relevant in the first
instance, but can be made so.

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:03.250
You use the term, in your
lectures, iterations.

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:05.970
Talk a little about that, what that is.

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:07.503
It's rethinking, I guess.

00:22:07.503 --> 00:22:08.623
- Yes, yes.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:13.940
The term iteration seems at first,

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:17.320
very simply, like repetition.

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:20.591
You know, you reiterate a phrase,

00:22:20.591 --> 00:22:24.620
you reiterate in a song, let's say.

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:28.694
You have the jingle, the
lyric, that keeps coming back.

00:22:28.694 --> 00:22:33.694
But I think that iterations
are complex processes

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:40.690
of appropriating and
transforming at the same time.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:45.380
I mean these are cultural
and intellectual processes

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:47.680
whereby at times it may seem as if

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:50.027
we are simply repeating the original,

00:22:50.027 --> 00:22:54.320
but what we are really doing
is we are creating new meaning.

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:57.810
And these processes of
iteration are particularly

00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:02.810
visible in certain domains
like legal interpretation.

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:08.530
And this is interesting because,

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:13.530
in any liberal democracy with
a constitutional tradition,

00:23:13.799 --> 00:23:18.455
we live through the reinterpretation,

00:23:18.455 --> 00:23:20.640
reappropriation, and the
reiteration of the past.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:24.140
In other words, what makes a tradition,

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:27.640
a body of doctrine, a body of law,

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:31.412
alive for us in the
present is our capacity

00:23:31.412 --> 00:23:35.920
to appropriate this body of law,

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.030
and yet, at the same time,

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.940
to think it through in the present.

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:45.588
So these are processes of
creative rearticulation

00:23:45.588 --> 00:23:50.430
through which, really,
traditions continue themselves,

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:52.610
legal doctrine maintains itself,

00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:56.641
and I would even say that
this capacity for iteration,

00:23:56.641 --> 00:23:59.380
and I refer to this in some other works

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:02.700
as the narrative
constitution of identities,

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:06.330
I think that this capacity for narrativity

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:08.970
is fundamental to the human condition.

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:12.360
I mean, maybe another way to put it

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:15.720
would be that we are storytelling animals.

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.678
And when we are no longer capable

00:24:17.678 --> 00:24:20.840
of telling stories about ourselves,

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:24.000
about our traditions,
about our lives together,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.940
something terrible
dries up in the culture.

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:31.940
I think that the culture ceases
to be a live legacy for it

00:24:34.477 --> 00:24:37.903
when we can no longer tell the new story,

00:24:37.903 --> 00:24:41.450
when we can no longer reiterate
it and reappropriate it.

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:44.160
So I'm interested in understanding

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:48.960
those moments of appropriation
and the emergence of the new,

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:51.360
how when it seems as if we're really

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.740
just continuing the old,
but continuing the old

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:55.960
is always reinterpreting it from

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:59.140
the standpoint of where we are at today.

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:02.830
- Do women have a unique contribution

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:04.493
to contribute to this dialogue?

00:25:05.453 --> 00:25:08.250
I know that in contemporary
political science,

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:12.470
some of the great
thinkers have been women.

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:16.560
I mean you've worked on Hannah Arendt,

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:18.410
and we'll talk about her in a minute,

00:25:19.623 --> 00:25:22.415
but Judith Shklar, Hanna Pitkin here,

00:25:22.415 --> 00:25:23.993
at Berkeley and so on.

00:25:24.829 --> 00:25:29.340
So comment on that, because there are,

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:31.730
is there an interface here between

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:35.130
being a woman and doing theory well?

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:38.120
Or was it merely that theory was a place

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.440
that women were allowed to occupy

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:43.473
before the walls of
discrimination came down?

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:50.490
- That's really a complex
and fascinating question.

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:56.310
I mean I do think it is remarkable

00:25:56.310 --> 00:26:00.230
that, among all theoretical fields,

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:02.260
I mean, you know, there aren't that many

00:26:03.247 --> 00:26:06.480
women in theoretical physics
or theoretical mathematics,

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:10.640
that political philosophy has produced

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:15.070
significant names in the past century

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:18.172
and hopefully also into our century.

00:26:18.172 --> 00:26:22.230
Now some of the
individuals whom you named,

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:25.108
like, you know, Hannah
Arendt, Judith Shklar,

00:26:25.108 --> 00:26:26.850
who was my senior colleague

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:30.580
and whom I had the pleasure
to meet at Harvard,

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:34.010
and I worked with her for several years.

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:36.996
- And you taught at
Harvard, we should mention.

00:26:36.996 --> 00:26:38.537
- Yes, I did, right.

00:26:38.537 --> 00:26:41.026
And Hanna Pitkin, whom
I do not know personally

00:26:41.026 --> 00:26:42.733
but whose work I greatly
admire and respect.

00:26:44.125 --> 00:26:45.650
Some of them have reflected upon

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:47.740
the particular juncture in their

00:26:48.944 --> 00:26:51.660
own work and political philosophy.

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:56.660
I think that there is a
certain, maybe, puzzle

00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.676
that women bring to the world of politics

00:27:00.676 --> 00:27:02.226
which has always seemed so much

00:27:03.289 --> 00:27:04.930
an exclusively male world.

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:09.610
And even today, in very simple numbers,

00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:12.490
when you look at the
level of representation

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:16.680
in the House of Representatives,
in our Congress,

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.700
or you know, in most
parliaments all over the world,

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:23.084
there is no parity anywhere.

00:27:23.084 --> 00:27:25.180
And the number of women
in the political sphere,

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:29.460
usually it's somewhere
between 10 to 25 to 30 percent

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:33.170
in the most successful social
democratic legislatures.

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:36.436
For example, in Sweden
and Denmark and so on

00:27:36.436 --> 00:27:39.036
you will find higher numbers
of women participating.

00:27:40.027 --> 00:27:43.810
So it has seemed, I think,
for a very long time,

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:48.580
that the political has been
an exclusively male domain,

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:51.700
and as Arendt puts it,
the political seems to be

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:56.136
concerned with honor,
recognition in the public sphere,

00:27:56.136 --> 00:28:00.490
competition, which are very different

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:02.831
than the virtues of the private sphere,

00:28:02.831 --> 00:28:07.360
to which women have been
historically assigned,

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:09.787
which is more about continuing life,

00:28:09.787 --> 00:28:14.787
nurturing the young,
attentiveness to everyday-ness.

00:28:16.587 --> 00:28:19.610
You know, the virtue of the
public sphere may be honor,

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:22.963
but the virtue of the private
sphere is care and concern.

00:28:26.047 --> 00:28:28.420
So it could be that, because of this

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:31.053
understanding of the political

00:28:31.053 --> 00:28:35.560
as also an exclusively male domain,

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:38.967
that women who have been outsided,

00:28:38.967 --> 00:28:43.200
who have been marginals,
have reflected upon this

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.840
and have reflected upon this critically.

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.972
It's almost as if, you know,

00:28:47.972 --> 00:28:49.440
if you are excluded from something,

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:52.340
sometimes you can have an almost better

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:55.530
and more creative critical
perspective on it.

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:58.354
So I think that, to a large extent,

00:28:58.354 --> 00:29:02.180
women political
philosophers have reflected

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:04.700
upon the domain of the political,

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:08.230
partially also realizing its illusions,

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:09.770
partially realizing that it is

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:12.940
one sphere among others in human activity.

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:15.790
But there has also been this
heightened concern about it.

00:29:16.875 --> 00:29:18.230
What is it really?

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:20.710
I mean, Hanna Pitkin herself,

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:23.730
who is also a feminist
theorist, talks about this.

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:25.830
But for example, in Hannah Arendt's work,

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:27.850
you have these categories of the public

00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:31.330
and the private very clearly articulated.

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:34.900
And she always praised the
public and the political,

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:36.390
in many ways, over the private.

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:38.980
But on the other hand,
only she could have written

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:40.300
in the way which she has written

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:42.380
about the private and the intimacy,

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:46.583
you know, or about the
principle of natality.

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:49.260
That every child that is born

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:52.400
introduces a new principle of freedom,

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:54.218
and that there is no way to predict

00:29:54.218 --> 00:29:58.430
what any human being will bring.

00:29:58.430 --> 00:30:00.951
This is before cloning and programming.

00:30:00.951 --> 00:30:03.358
But natality, I mean,

00:30:03.358 --> 00:30:07.030
how does one introduce that
into political thought?

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:10.460
Inevitably, there are certain
gender experiences there

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:14.919
that are flowing into the theory.

00:30:14.919 --> 00:30:19.919
- Your current work and the
subject of your lectures

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:26.450
focus on identifying the processes

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:29.118
by which universal norms assume

00:30:29.118 --> 00:30:31.720
an authoritative position,

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:34.590
though they're outside the
boundaries of the nation-state.

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:38.257
That is a first rendering, on my part,

00:30:38.257 --> 00:30:40.300
of the complicated work.

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:45.300
And interestingly, you
relate this subject matter,

00:30:45.829 --> 00:30:50.829
in a very important
way, to unsolved puzzles

00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:54.790
in the work of Arendt and
Kant in your lectures.

00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:58.510
So this is, so as you
grapple with these problems,

00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:00.540
and let's talk about those problems,

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:03.750
it's very clear you
turned to that tradition

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:07.593
to find the iterations or to
help create the iterations.

00:31:08.435 --> 00:31:09.920
Talk a little about that,

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:13.636
why you got interested in the subjects

00:31:13.636 --> 00:31:18.636
of migration, humanitarian
intervention, and so on,

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:25.363
where there is a search for legitimating

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:31.570
these new universal norms in a context

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:33.683
that transcends the nation-state.

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:38.160
- I think maybe the best
way to talk about this

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:42.500
may be by going back to 1948

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:46.360
and the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.670
After the experience of two world wars,

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:52.140
I think that the nations of this world

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:57.140
entered a learning process
where it was established

00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:03.320
that self-governing nations,
whatever their differences,

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:08.320
had to respect a minimum set
of rights and universal norms.

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:15.720
So the 1948 declaration
initiates what I call

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:19.123
the rise of an international
human rights regime.

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:23.900
And since then, the
number of international

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:25.813
treaties and conventions,

00:32:25.813 --> 00:32:29.060
the convention, let's
say, on the elimination

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:32.350
of all forms of
discrimination against women,

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:36.100
the convention against
cruel and unjust punishment,

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:39.130
the convention on the rights of the child,

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:42.960
the international covenant on
social and economic rights,

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.730
the international covenant on
civil and political rights.

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:47.320
If you look at all of this,

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:52.320
there are numbers and numbers
of treaties and conventions

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:57.570
that have been signed and ratified,

00:32:57.570 --> 00:32:59.670
not by all the nations of the world,

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:04.200
I think we have about 190 to 195

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:09.200
recognized nation-states
or political entities.

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:10.750
Not all of them have signed it.

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:15.750
In some cases, two-thirds
do and one-third does not.

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:21.110
But there is a new moment in the evolution

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:25.860
of the international
community where we are

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:29.590
going beyond what would be simply called

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:34.530
international law based on treaty rights.

00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:39.530
So for example, let's
say the U.S. and Japan,

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:44.020
the U.S. and China have
a number of treaties

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:48.140
and international
obligations to one another

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:49.840
that can range from trading

00:33:51.196 --> 00:33:53.320
to the hunting of tuna fish, et cetera.

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:56.130
Those are international treaty obligations

00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:59.890
that nations can voluntarily
undertake with one another.

00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:04.630
This has been the norm, also,
of much of international law.

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:07.400
But the kinds of human rights treaties

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:11.769
and the kinds of norm conventions
that I'm talking about

00:34:11.769 --> 00:34:15.440
initiate a new moment in that

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:20.256
these are now almost a kind of,

00:34:20.256 --> 00:34:23.930
I will say very carefully, they are almost

00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:26.230
a quasi-constitutional structure

00:34:27.847 --> 00:34:29.760
for the international community at large,

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.920
where what the nations
are obliging themselves to

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:37.920
are not, you know, how much
tuna fish can be hunted

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:42.120
or how much Chinese exports can come in

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:44.423
and, you know, how they are regulated,

00:34:45.879 --> 00:34:47.670
but very fundamental norms, right?

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:49.250
The convention on the elimination

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:51.730
of discrimination against women.

00:34:51.730 --> 00:34:54.490
I mean, think of the many countries

00:34:54.490 --> 00:34:56.502
that are signatories of these

00:34:56.502 --> 00:34:59.360
where the internal
practices of these countries

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:02.390
can hardly be assessed to have

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:04.240
ceased discrimination against women.

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:07.830
Now what is this moment in human history

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:12.830
when, increasingly, there
is a juridification,

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:18.740
a constitutionalization, of a set of norms

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:22.990
and the fact that
nation-states acknowledge them?

00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:27.068
Now, for me, I'm describing
this as the cosmopolitan moment,

00:35:27.068 --> 00:35:30.420
as the emergence of cosmopolitan norms.

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:34.396
And this is different than
international trade law,

00:35:34.396 --> 00:35:36.602
international treaties,

00:35:36.602 --> 00:35:39.780
but it is genuinely, I think,

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:44.570
novel development for the human community.

00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:47.130
And yet, at the same time that we have

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:50.570
the emergence of these treaties

00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:55.570
and norms that are becoming
more and more accepted

00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:57.730
by the nations of the world,

00:35:57.730 --> 00:36:00.180
there is also the
fundamental contradiction

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:05.180
that the nation-states are
the addressees of these norms,

00:36:05.890 --> 00:36:07.070
they are the signatories.

00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:10.400
When you look at whose signature
is under these treaties,

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:11.430
it's always the state.

00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:13.860
And yet, at the same time,
these norms themselves

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:16.703
constrain the very action
of the states themselves.

00:36:17.685 --> 00:36:20.690
In other words, the states
are both signatories,

00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:23.049
and yet, at the same time,
they are constrained,

00:36:23.049 --> 00:36:26.680
they are constrained by these very norms.

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:29.240
I mean, if Egypt signs the convention

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:31.620
on the elimination of
discrimination against women,

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:33.360
this has consequences.

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.710
So Egypt is both the
addressee of these norms,

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:37.950
but it also has consequences for the way

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:40.330
in which, let's say, the rights of women,

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:41.780
divorce, property, et cetera,

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:44.910
are dealt with in a country like Egypt.

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:48.480
So in my lectures, I try to reflect upon

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.630
the rise of cosmopolitan norms

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:53.730
and republican self-determination.

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:56.800
And for us in the United States,

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:59.924
these issues became particularly relevant

00:36:59.924 --> 00:37:04.117
with the decision of the
Bush treaty to rescind

00:37:04.117 --> 00:37:08.140
the participation in the
international criminal court,

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:10.301
their own treaty establishing

00:37:10.301 --> 00:37:11.150
the international criminal court

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:12.530
on the basis of the argument

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:16.873
that this would give rise
to spurious and ill-founded

00:37:16.873 --> 00:37:21.873
prosecution of American
civilians and military.

00:37:22.792 --> 00:37:24.063
I do not agree with that argument,

00:37:24.969 --> 00:37:26.824
but I think that we see, very clearly,

00:37:26.824 --> 00:37:28.090
that there is a conflict,

00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:30.500
and particularly for the United States

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.860
that spearheaded the development

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:35.766
of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights

00:37:35.766 --> 00:37:38.142
with Eleanor Roosevelt,
to find ourselves now

00:37:38.142 --> 00:37:40.743
in this position of sort of, you know,

00:37:40.743 --> 00:37:42.260
saying, oh well, we remain sovereign,

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:44.650
the world can go
cosmopolitan, but you know,

00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:46.831
American law is sovereign.

00:37:46.831 --> 00:37:47.870
I mean, this is simplifying it.

00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:50.951
So I have been thinking
about these puzzles.

00:37:50.951 --> 00:37:52.960
Now, very briefly, the
reason why I went back

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:56.180
to Kant and Arendt is that

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:04.010
they had a sense, particularly Kant

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:10.500
is famous for having written an essay

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:14.063
in 1795 called Towards a Perpetual Peace,

00:38:15.618 --> 00:38:18.451
and it is an essay that articulates

00:38:18.451 --> 00:38:23.451
certain conditions that
nations must respect

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:29.360
if there ever will be perpetual peace.

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:33.250
And Kant is very aware
that this is totally,

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:35.090
to some extent, the term perpetual peace,

00:38:35.090 --> 00:38:39.250
it's also almost like, the
German term is ewigen frieden,

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:42.520
it's eternal peace, it's also
the peace of the cemetery.

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:46.731
So he's very aware of
the fact that, you know,

00:38:46.731 --> 00:38:48.321
this is ironic, he says.

00:38:48.321 --> 00:38:50.633
Nobody expects a philosopher to come out

00:38:50.633 --> 00:38:54.900
and tell generals and kings, at his time,

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:57.794
I mean we're not talking about
democracies, this is 1795,

00:38:57.794 --> 00:39:01.130
how to run the world and how
to articulate principles,

00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:03.800
but if there is going to be
perpetual peace among nations,

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:06.570
here are the conditions
that I will lay out.

00:39:06.570 --> 00:39:08.880
And he says the
constitution of every state

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:12.751
must be a republican constitution,

00:39:12.751 --> 00:39:15.010
that is, it must permit representation,

00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:18.340
and that the nations of the world

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:21.840
should move towards a
cosmopolitan federation

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:24.550
where they regulate their
relationships with one another

00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:27.650
according to laws, that they should

00:39:28.598 --> 00:39:31.360
increasingly seek a common body of laws.

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:35.570
And he also says, in the third definitive

00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:39.200
article of perpetual
peace, that there is one

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:41.735
right that belongs to a human being

00:39:41.735 --> 00:39:44.563
as a human being in the world community,

00:39:45.503 --> 00:39:46.670
and that is the right hospitality.

00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:49.827
That is, if someone comes upon your shores

00:39:49.827 --> 00:39:54.827
through need or for commerce or barter,

00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:59.493
and if their purposes are peaceful,

00:40:01.596 --> 00:40:03.823
you cannot deny them access.

00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:07.373
You cannot deny universal hospitality.

00:40:08.843 --> 00:40:12.380
Also, in particular, if that
will mean their destruction.

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:14.840
So the right to universal hospitality,

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:16.270
that is, the right of human beings

00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:17.750
to seek contact with one another,

00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:19.940
to seek access to each other's land,

00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:21.450
to seek access to resources,

00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:23.750
is a fundamental human right.

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:25.570
It needs to be regulated and there is

00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:29.051
a certain margin as to
how much, for example,

00:40:29.051 --> 00:40:31.970
you owe to the stranger
who comes upon your land,

00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:36.470
what kind of obligations do
you owe to this stranger.

00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:39.810
I mean, Kant's own formulation is somewhat

00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:42.311
more minimal than I would like it to be,

00:40:42.311 --> 00:40:44.130
because he says you have
a right of visitation

00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:46.470
but not a right of long-term stay.

00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:48.270
The host can determine that.

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:50.730
And I would like to argue, actually,

00:40:50.730 --> 00:40:53.570
that the human right to visitation

00:40:54.617 --> 00:40:57.310
is more extensive than
Kant makes it out to be,

00:40:57.310 --> 00:40:59.870
and that nations have stronger obligations

00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:02.470
to asylees and refugees
which are different

00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:04.340
than the obligations to immigrants.

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:07.590
But this is a fascinating beginning point.

00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:09.010
- And what's really interesting,

00:41:09.010 --> 00:41:11.100
he's writing several hundred years ago

00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:14.300
and he's laying the groundwork

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:18.390
for theorists working today

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:20.880
to clear some of the confusion

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:24.699
about the issues of immigrants, refugees,

00:41:24.699 --> 00:41:28.620
which we see every day in the headlines.

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:33.620
And in fact, really,
the European community,

00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:36.736
I think you're suggesting,

00:41:36.736 --> 00:41:38.920
in what I heard and what I read,

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:42.680
is a real site for experimentation

00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:44.750
with regard to these matters today.

00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:46.900
That is, you know, real politicians

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:50.040
acting in the real world,
having to make decisions,

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:54.170
which are changing the nation-state

00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:58.541
and the limits it can impose without

00:41:58.541 --> 00:42:01.530
consulting these cosmopolitan norms.

00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:03.293
Is that fair?

00:42:04.219 --> 00:42:07.160
- Oh, I think that that
is absolutely fair.

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:14.220
I mean, there is the Geneva Convention

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:19.660
on the status of refugees, 1952,

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:24.640
and its protocol added in the '60s.

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:27.170
And all states that are signatories

00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:31.360
to the Geneva Convention
have the obligation

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:34.570
to conduct themselves vis-a-vis refugees

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:38.213
and asylum seekers in a particular way.

00:42:38.213 --> 00:42:40.280
And the most important aspect of this

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:43.440
is that, if someone reaches your shores

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:48.440
and raises a claim to refuge and asylum,

00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:51.672
you have an obligation.

00:42:51.672 --> 00:42:52.505
You as the state have an obligation

00:42:52.505 --> 00:42:57.505
to examine the veracity or
truthfulness of that claim

00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:58.970
and reach a decision.

00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:02.233
You have an obligation of what
is called non-refoulement.

00:43:02.233 --> 00:43:05.897
That is to say, you cannot
send the refugee back

00:43:05.897 --> 00:43:09.760
without having examined this claim.

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:11.950
You ought not send the refugee back

00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:13.990
into the point of danger.

00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:18.990
Now, everybody, you know,
in many ways, violates this.

00:43:19.092 --> 00:43:22.260
I mean, what we do, for
example, with Haitian refugees

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:25.651
is that we catch them in
the high seas even before

00:43:25.651 --> 00:43:29.440
they set foot upon the
continental United States,

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:31.513
because once they have done so,

00:43:32.753 --> 00:43:34.525
the government is under an obligation

00:43:34.525 --> 00:43:35.940
to conduct itself in various ways.

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:39.521
And even if it does not
respect it, it is liable,

00:43:39.521 --> 00:43:43.630
legally, as a signatory
of the Geneva Convention,

00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:47.100
for its treatment of refugees and asylees,

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:49.630
and various kinds of international groups

00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:53.390
and other NGOs can in fact
take the government to task,

00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:55.240
which, you know, which they have done.

00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:57.970
So the method becomes preventing them

00:43:57.970 --> 00:44:02.060
from setting foot on
soil in the first place.

00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:06.320
Which is really quite
devious, and, of course,

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:09.905
we now see the criminalization
of all these issues

00:44:09.905 --> 00:44:13.318
in the United States under
the Bush Administration.

00:44:13.318 --> 00:44:15.663
There no longer is anything, really,

00:44:15.663 --> 00:44:17.463
I mean all matters of refuge, asylum,

00:44:18.819 --> 00:44:20.513
and also immigration have become

00:44:20.513 --> 00:44:22.903
so much absorbed into,
you know, criminal law

00:44:24.464 --> 00:44:26.040
with this notion of homeland security.

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:28.010
I mean I think that we are in the midst,

00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:30.030
frankly, of a frightful mess

00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:32.580
from the standpoint of international law,

00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:34.503
which is being flouted, right?

00:44:35.662 --> 00:44:37.825
Now the situation in Europe

00:44:37.825 --> 00:44:39.440
is presenting itself somewhat differently,

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:43.058
precisely because, also,
the European nation-states

00:44:43.058 --> 00:44:44.293
are forming the European Union.

00:44:45.745 --> 00:44:47.320
And the consequence of
forming the European Union

00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:50.563
is that internal border
controls have been eliminated.

00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:55.270
That is to say, you can now, in principle,

00:44:55.270 --> 00:45:00.072
you should be able to drive
from Krakow down to Lisbon

00:45:00.072 --> 00:45:05.072
without internal border
controls, as a European citizen.

00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:10.400
But the elimination of
internal border controls

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:12.520
does not mean that the question

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:15.990
of Europe's external borders is,

00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:18.550
that issue has also been solved.

00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:23.550
Continental Europe is a
very wealthy environment.

00:45:23.650 --> 00:45:25.783
It has very extensive rights,

00:45:27.408 --> 00:45:29.750
and for a lot of the refugees
and asylees of the world

00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:32.093
it is a very desirable focus.

00:45:36.202 --> 00:45:40.463
So you have had, over
the last number of years,

00:45:40.463 --> 00:45:44.470
millions of people trying to enter

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:48.743
the boundaries of the European Union.

00:45:51.318 --> 00:45:54.133
So, from Moroccans, Kurds, Africans

00:45:56.810 --> 00:46:01.810
to people also from even
China, mainland China,

00:46:05.330 --> 00:46:07.810
there has always been some crisis

00:46:07.810 --> 00:46:11.017
about refugees and asylum seekers

00:46:11.017 --> 00:46:14.250
within Europe at the moment.

00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:16.900
But this has caught it
in a difficult moment.

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:19.897
Just as they are eliminating
internal borders,

00:46:19.897 --> 00:46:21.783
they are in the situation of

00:46:21.783 --> 00:46:23.393
having to draw external borders.

00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:26.820
So there have been various agreements,

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:29.050
like Schengen and Dublin, that have,

00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:31.140
you know, tried to control

00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:36.140
refugees and asylees from coming in,

00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:40.010
so that we see a very mixed picture

00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:42.730
at the moment, within the European Union,

00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:47.007
of great liberality
within the member states,

00:46:47.007 --> 00:46:52.007
but rather harsh measurements developing

00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:56.530
towards refuge and asylum seekers.

00:46:56.530 --> 00:46:58.935
But the one difference here is that,

00:46:58.935 --> 00:47:03.270
because of the various legal traditions

00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:05.230
and because of the way in which

00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:09.244
Europe subscribes also
to the Geneva Convention,

00:47:09.244 --> 00:47:12.620
the practice of trying to sort of

00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:15.480
maybe stop people in refugee centers

00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:18.990
before they even touch
the European continent

00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:20.340
has not been that successful.

00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:22.570
I mean the Blair government is asking

00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:24.820
for the establishment of so-called

00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:27.060
refugee processing centers

00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:29.800
in countries where
refugees are coming from,

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:32.123
but the European Union
has not accepted that,

00:47:32.966 --> 00:47:33.799
because they realize it's

00:47:33.799 --> 00:47:35.623
a violation of the Geneva Convention.

00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:39.630
- So the interesting problem for you,

00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:43.080
and it was a puzzle for Hannah Arendt too,

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:47.000
but not, in other words, in the sense that

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:52.000
she saw the need for the
rights you talk about.

00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:57.155
But she saw also that, in the past,

00:47:57.155 --> 00:48:02.155
these rights had been
guaranteed by the nation-state,

00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:06.280
by the people coming together and making,

00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:07.920
talking about we the people,

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:10.760
but in fact it was within a bounded area.

00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:14.230
And what, the problem for our times

00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:17.660
is that globalization is creating

00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:19.390
movements of people, the need for

00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:21.660
humanitarian intervention and so on,

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:26.610
where a base for cosmopolitan norms

00:48:26.610 --> 00:48:29.433
exists outside the boundary of the state.

00:48:30.295 --> 00:48:32.530
And so a lot of this that
we see going on this world,

00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:34.030
that you were just discussing,

00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:38.270
is, in a way, the iteration of the polity

00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:41.030
as it grapples with these problems.

00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:43.510
And by focusing on this, you're able

00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:46.150
to move this discussion along,

00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:50.000
beyond where Hannah Arendt
could take it, in a way.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.786
Because the times have moved on, in a way.

00:48:53.786 --> 00:48:54.619
Is that fair?

00:48:56.512 --> 00:49:01.437
- Well I hope it's also true.
I would like to think so.

00:49:01.437 --> 00:49:05.013
When I finished my book on Arendt in 1996,

00:49:05.013 --> 00:49:09.042
I was actually looking at the distinction

00:49:09.042 --> 00:49:10.840
between the public and the private

00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:12.980
and her concept of the public space.

00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:14.400
But by the time I finished the book,

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:18.137
I was fascinated by her concept

00:49:18.137 --> 00:49:21.003
of statelessness and the
right to have rights.

00:49:21.003 --> 00:49:22.651
This notion of the right to have rights,

00:49:22.651 --> 00:49:24.682
and what she meant by this is that

00:49:24.682 --> 00:49:28.950
the irony of developments
in the 20th Century

00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:32.010
had been that, precisely
at the point at which

00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:35.600
individuals did not seem
to have a nation or a state

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:40.120
to protect them, that precisely
at that point at which,

00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:43.170
when the sheer fact of being a human being

00:49:43.170 --> 00:49:45.710
ought to have entitled
one to certain rights

00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:49.650
and to certain protections, it
seemed as if one had nothing,

00:49:49.650 --> 00:49:52.260
that to be stateless was basically

00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:54.640
to become a complete pariah,

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:57.400
and that to be a stateless person

00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:00.820
was also to be rendered,
in a way, rightless.

00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:03.290
But the whole notion of
universal human rights

00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:05.730
is rights that accrue
to us or belong to us

00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:07.240
in virtue of our humanity,

00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:10.270
not in virtue of our
citizenship or membership.

00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:13.040
So she was understandably very pessimistic

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:15.373
that the right to have rights

00:50:15.373 --> 00:50:19.370
would ever be guaranteed
in an international system,

00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:21.136
and basically she thought that

00:50:21.136 --> 00:50:24.387
only the possibility of establishing

00:50:24.387 --> 00:50:27.705
a political entity to which one belonged

00:50:27.705 --> 00:50:31.010
would resolve this condition.

00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:32.230
And she was thinking, of course,

00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:34.780
of refugees from the Second World War,

00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:37.470
Jewish refugees and stateless peoples.

00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:40.480
And she said, although
she was not a Zionist,

00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:42.760
let's admit the fact that it is only

00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:44.530
the establishment of the state of Israel

00:50:44.530 --> 00:50:47.653
that has, in effect,
made these individuals

00:50:47.653 --> 00:50:50.140
into beings entitled to rights.

00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:53.850
So her work, ended up,
to me, with an aporia,

00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:56.590
that there was a problem and there was

00:50:56.590 --> 00:50:59.130
a solution which she was
only half-hearted about,

00:50:59.130 --> 00:51:01.560
because she did not think
that the nation-state

00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:03.250
was a solution to everything.

00:51:03.250 --> 00:51:05.570
The nation-state, let's say,
was the solution to the Jews,

00:51:05.570 --> 00:51:07.950
but it created the Palestinian refugees.

00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:10.410
So one group was saved
but the other group,

00:51:10.410 --> 00:51:12.980
you know, emerged, and she
was very well aware of that.

00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:15.140
So I started thinking about this.

00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:20.080
And I decided, there were,
there have been developments,

00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:25.080
developments in the arena of
international institutions,

00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:28.050
in the arena of various conventions,

00:51:28.050 --> 00:51:30.020
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,

00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:32.730
Geneva Convention, where
we have gone beyond

00:51:32.730 --> 00:51:36.760
the point that Hannah
Arendt has articulated.

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:39.462
But what we have not
been able to deal with

00:51:39.462 --> 00:51:43.360
remains the following problem.

00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:47.760
Border crossings are still
a quasi-criminal activity

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:52.160
unless accompanied by the
right kinds of papers.

00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:54.410
And there is one voice in me that says,

00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:55.860
from a moral point of view,

00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:58.060
the only justifiable argument is really

00:51:58.060 --> 00:52:00.510
for a world without borders.

00:52:00.510 --> 00:52:02.730
I don't think that that's
going to be viable,

00:52:02.730 --> 00:52:05.000
you know, politically, and communities

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.880
will need to govern themselves.

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:08.710
There will need to be some borders,

00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:12.150
but really, we are, again,

00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:13.980
at a point when we have no way

00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:16.635
of dealing with the
system of border crossing

00:52:16.635 --> 00:52:21.433
in terms of quasi-criminal language.

00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:25.420
So, on the one hand, in the global world,

00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:30.311
we have an unprecedented
mobility of peoples.

00:52:30.311 --> 00:52:35.311
We are aware of the needs
of refugees and asylees,

00:52:35.350 --> 00:52:38.420
not to speak about the 30
million displaced persons

00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:41.750
as a result of civil wars
within their own countries,

00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:44.520
and yet the map that
we navigate, literally,

00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:46.410
is the map of the nation-state.

00:52:46.410 --> 00:52:49.720
And so we have no way,
as a world community,

00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:54.290
of addressing this
problem of border movement

00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:56.890
and trans-border justice, except through

00:52:56.890 --> 00:53:00.040
the categories of the old nation state.

00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:01.710
So what I am doing, really,

00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:03.570
is I'm trying to problematize,

00:53:03.570 --> 00:53:08.070
I'm trying to raise this dilemma
to people's consciousness.

00:53:08.070 --> 00:53:12.891
And you know, to think it through.

00:53:12.891 --> 00:53:16.630
You know, do I have any concrete

00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:19.730
and specific solutions to offer to this?

00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:22.770
I would say we need to move towards

00:53:22.770 --> 00:53:26.660
decriminalization of border movements.

00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:29.597
I think that one has to have a much more

00:53:29.597 --> 00:53:33.240
universally anchored system of, you know,

00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:37.980
refuge and asylum, and I would also plead

00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:41.300
for the extension of municipal

00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:45.500
or city rights for long-term residents.

00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:50.281
And I just don't think that
it will be possible for us

00:53:50.281 --> 00:53:55.281
to envisage a world
completely without borders,

00:53:55.760 --> 00:54:00.380
although we can ideally work
closer and closer towards it,

00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:03.520
because there is the question, still,

00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:06.903
of democratic representation
and accountability.

00:54:08.563 --> 00:54:12.267
So we are caught in this
puzzle of, as I say,

00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:16.160
you know, sometimes people
think this is harsh,

00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:20.193
but democracies require borders.

00:54:21.305 --> 00:54:23.439
They require boundaries in the sense

00:54:23.439 --> 00:54:27.711
that one needs to know who
is representative to whom

00:54:27.711 --> 00:54:29.770
and who is accountable to whom.

00:54:29.770 --> 00:54:32.010
So it's very difficult
to square the circle.

00:54:32.010 --> 00:54:33.620
I mean, I think it is possible

00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:36.860
to have an empire without borders.

00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:38.210
I don't think it's possible to have

00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:40.220
a democracy without borders.

00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:42.250
And so this creates, you know,

00:54:42.250 --> 00:54:44.990
the sort of philosophical
and moral dilemma

00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:47.860
that I have been trying to
address in these lectures.

00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:50.050
Can you reconcile cosmopolitanism

00:54:50.050 --> 00:54:54.250
and democratic self-governance?

00:54:54.250 --> 00:54:58.130
- And interestingly enough,
as a political philosopher,

00:54:58.130 --> 00:55:02.010
you have to do what the
system works against,

00:55:02.010 --> 00:55:03.790
that you were saying earlier, namely,

00:55:03.790 --> 00:55:07.710
you have to go back and
look at the great issues

00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:12.300
that we've, the political philosophers

00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:14.130
have worked on through the years.

00:55:14.130 --> 00:55:15.890
What is a citizen?

00:55:15.890 --> 00:55:17.890
What is the power of the sovereign?

00:55:17.890 --> 00:55:19.400
And so on.

00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:24.150
These are the big questions
that, by focusing on them,

00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:29.150
can help us kind of clarify
the current confusion

00:55:30.021 --> 00:55:34.350
about what are the rights of man

00:55:34.350 --> 00:55:36.037
versus what are the rights
of the citizen, and so on.

00:55:36.037 --> 00:55:39.370
- Absolutely, because when
we read the newspapers,

00:55:39.370 --> 00:55:41.560
I mean, you know, we are confronted

00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:46.370
with images, news stories, you know.

00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:50.970
We have all heard about Guantanamo Bay,

00:55:50.970 --> 00:55:53.976
but how many of us really know

00:55:53.976 --> 00:55:57.131
that one of the difficulties
about the situation

00:55:57.131 --> 00:56:00.110
in Guantanamo Bay is that,
because the United States

00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:03.484
is a signatory of the Geneva Convention,

00:56:03.484 --> 00:56:06.520
particularly if there are regular,

00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:08.490
quote unquote, prisoners of war,

00:56:08.490 --> 00:56:09.990
and the question is who has

00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:12.320
the status of being a prisoner of war.

00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:14.870
As Colin Powell pointed
out before his voice

00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:17.320
was drowned out six months ago,

00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:19.580
we would be in violation of the fourth

00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:21.810
article of the Geneva Convention

00:56:21.810 --> 00:56:23.970
which requires that prisoners of war

00:56:23.970 --> 00:56:27.820
be also permitted access to counsel.

00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:30.530
And so, you know, the
way this administration

00:56:30.530 --> 00:56:34.280
has dealt with it by saying that

00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:38.050
these are basically illegal noncombatants,

00:56:38.050 --> 00:56:39.630
that is, they do not represent

00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:43.763
a regular enemy army which
we would have to recognize,

00:56:43.763 --> 00:56:46.950
you know, in combat under
the Geneva Convention.

00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:49.490
So, you know, the ordinary citizen looks

00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:52.750
at something like this,
looks at a news item,

00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:54.730
and says, well so, I mean, you know,

00:56:54.730 --> 00:56:56.010
but what is at stake here?

00:56:56.010 --> 00:56:58.420
But in order to understand
what is at stake,

00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:01.610
we have to go back to these categories.

00:57:01.610 --> 00:57:06.610
Let me just give you another
aspect of this issue.

00:57:06.610 --> 00:57:08.800
I did not talk about
Guantanamo in the lectures,

00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:11.680
but I could have, I
was focusing on Europe.

00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:13.540
I mean, how many of us know

00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:15.980
that Guantanamo is basically a base

00:57:16.848 --> 00:57:19.823
that we have rented
from Cuba for 99 years?

00:57:21.290 --> 00:57:22.550
But then the question is,

00:57:22.550 --> 00:57:25.314
is it part of the sovereign United States

00:57:25.314 --> 00:57:26.950
or is it not part of the
sovereign United States?

00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:30.970
As we know, there is a
recent court decision,

00:57:30.970 --> 00:57:32.773
a federal district judge,

00:57:33.708 --> 00:57:34.710
that is challenging this notion that it is

00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:36.710
not part of the sovereign United States,

00:57:37.586 --> 00:57:39.140
because if it is part of
the sovereign United States,

00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:44.140
they cannot hold the prisoners
without access to counsel,

00:57:44.504 --> 00:57:47.407
without giving them the
writ of habeas corpus,

00:57:47.407 --> 00:57:48.430
without letting them know for what reason,

00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:52.010
on what basis, they are
being held accountable.

00:57:52.010 --> 00:57:55.510
This is, in many ways,
such a sort of legal

00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:59.610
and political quagmire,
not to say scandal.

00:57:59.610 --> 00:58:03.330
But as ordinary citizens, to
be able to think about this,

00:58:03.330 --> 00:58:05.298
we have to go back all the way

00:58:05.298 --> 00:58:08.966
and understand the principles on which

00:58:08.966 --> 00:58:13.966
we have to act as a nation.

00:58:16.244 --> 00:58:19.290
So, in that sense, the history
of political philosophy,

00:58:19.290 --> 00:58:20.893
it's always there with us,

00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:24.170
whether we recall it or not.

00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:27.210
- On that note, Professor Benhabib,

00:58:27.210 --> 00:58:30.810
I wanna thank you very
much for taking the time

00:58:30.810 --> 00:58:33.390
and being with us today on our program,

00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:35.910
and really, for this
fascinating discussion

00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:41.494
of the work of theory and the
implications of globalization.

00:58:41.494 --> 00:58:42.794
Thank you.

00:58:42.794 --> 00:58:43.627
- Thank you.

00:58:43.627 --> 00:58:45.360
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:47.663
for this conversation with history.
