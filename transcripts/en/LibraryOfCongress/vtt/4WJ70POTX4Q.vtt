00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:06.320
&gt;&gt; Fred Bowen: All right,
good afternoon again.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.850
My name's Fred Bowen, still Fred
Bowen for those who have hung

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.830
around for this talk two.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.700
I'm the author of
23 sports books

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.380
for kids 8 to 12 years old.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.340
I also write a weekly
kid's sports column

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.240
for the Kids Post page
of the Washington Post.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.850
And the Washington Post is
one of the charter sponsors

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.910
of the National Book Festival.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.890
Before we get started with Jason
Reynolds, first a word of thanks

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.810
to the cochairman of the
festival, David Rubenstein,

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.380
and the other generous sponsors.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.220
If you want to become
a sponsor or donate

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.100
to the National Book
Festival, look in your program,

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.620
look on the back,
there's a way to do it.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.540
And it would certainly be a
good use for anyone's money.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.810
We're going to have questions
after the presentation,

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.490
and if you could go
stand at the microphone,

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.790
that would be very helpful.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.730
And you might be on the
videotape of the event.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.540
It's now my great pleasure
to introduce Jason Reynolds.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.320
First thing you should know is
he is a local guy, all right.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.050
[cheers]. He was born
in Washington, DC,

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.100
raised in Oxon Hill, Maryland.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.480
He is a graduate Bishop
McNamara High School

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.400
and the University of Maryland.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.590
It's so easy to get
yay's on that.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.500
But now the more
important thing is,

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.830
now he is a really
important voice

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.420
in young people's literature,
with such award-winning books

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.180
as All American Boys, As
brave as You, Long Way Down.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.490
And when I say award-winning,
I don't mean little awards.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.400
He was a finalist for
the National Book Award.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.260
He had a Newberry Honor Award.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.590
He won the Walter Dean Myers
and Caretta Scott King Award.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.870
He's also the author of such
fun books as the Track series.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.060
I think there was a
picture of it up there.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.550
And Miles Moralas Spider-Man.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.390
One thing he absolutely
does not do,

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.880
he does not write boring books.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.750
So he is here to talk
to you about the books.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.250
He will be signing his
books at booth 11 at 5 PM.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.510
Let's give it up for
local guy, Jason Reynolds.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:46.080
[ Applause ]

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.380
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: Hello, hello.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.680
Everybody all right?

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.980
Y'all good?

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.280
All right.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.850
So there's a whole
lot of y'all in here.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.240
And we only got a
little bit of time.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.570
So I'm trying to figure out
how to do this because I got

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.670
like 25 minutes, and
that's question and answer

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.160
and everything else
and me talking.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.870
And there's so many
young people here.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.730
And there's so many
not-so-young people here.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.950
And I'm trying to figure out
how to best serve everybody.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.620
So I could talk a little bit or
we could just do a whole bunch

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.480
of questions and I could
really answer all the questions

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.780
that you may have.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.080
Anybody have any
questions, first of all,

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.380
just so I can know
what's happening?

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.680
Not yet, all right.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.980
So here's what we'll do.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.280
Really quickly I'm
going to tell you --

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.190
we're going to talk
about something else.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.680
We're not going to talk
about books for a second.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.020
I got -- all right, who's
from Washington, DC?

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.620
Is anybody from DC?

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.600
All right, so we're going to
talk about DC for a second,

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.900
and then we'll talk
about the books.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.390
When I was growing up a long
time ago, Washington, DC,

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.650
had a very special music,
still has a special music,

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.170
especially if you're
coming from my community.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.330
And when I say my community,
I mean the black community.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.210
And what this music is,
it's called Go-Go music.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.560
Has anybody heard
of Go-Go music?

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.860
[applause].

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.610
All right, a whole
bunch of y'all.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:57.910
If you haven't heard
of Go-Go music,

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.210
let me explain how it works.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.510
Go-Go music was started in
1970s by a wonderful man

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.040
who is now passed on,
his name is Chuck Brown.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.100
Chuck Brown wrote a whole
bunch of really good songs,

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.680
his most famous song was a
song called Bustin' Loose.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.110
All the old heads in the
house know this song.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.360
I feel like bustin' loose.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.710
That music was rooted in
African music, that even mixed

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:21.330
with music of Latin America,
soul, funk, house music,

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.020
and every other kind of
music he could think of.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.640
He put it all in the pot and
stirred it up and mashed it up

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.030
and it became a new music
that he called Go-Go.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.400
And the reason he called it
Go-Go is because the point

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.430
of the music was for
it to never stop.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.800
When you went to a Chuck
Brown party, you were supposed

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.910
to hear the same song
for two hours, right,

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.670
two hours of you just rocking.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.800
The song going and going
and going and going,

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.480
and it was a beautiful,
beautiful thing.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.770
Then when the 1980s and then the
early 1990s, this music started

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.380
to change as younger people
started to grab a hold to it.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.130
So you had new bands come
in and you had Red Essence,

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.180
you had Proper Utensils,
these are --

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.480
people, some of y'all are
like, what is he talking about?

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.240
You have homework tonight.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.490
Go home and look these bands up.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.900
And then in my generation,
you had bands

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.430
like the Northeast Groovers,
Junkyard Band, Backyard Band.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.940
These are all Washington,
DC, bands.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.670
These are young people
with minimal resources

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.430
who have taught themselves
how to play instruments,

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.690
who have formed 15 person bands
and who are playing shows night

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.090
after night for kids who are
coming from their neighborhoods.

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.740
Imagine, imagine coming to
see a whole bunch of kids

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.040
from neighborhoods that most

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.910
of us are too afraid
to walk through.

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.990
And those kids have formed
basically their version

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.290
of a symphony orchestra.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.240
It's the most beautiful
thing you will ever see.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.580
And so we would go
to the Go-Go as kids.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.890
You would go in and
you'd see the band

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.280
and there would be 15 people.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.110
A bass player, a keyboardist.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.180
There'd be four people
on a microphone.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.480
A guitar player.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.780
A singer or two.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.380
There's always a girl in the
band to sing, a guy in the band

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.590
to sing, whose voice was
always terrible, right.

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.340
A rapper who was
a terrible rapper.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.630
You had a man who played
the conga -- the congas --

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.210
or as we say in DC, the congas.

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.830
And usually this
is two conga drums.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.580
But in this city for this music,

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.600
we played four, four
conga drums.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.890
Rototoms, timbales, these
are instruments used

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:21.980
in salsa, reggae.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.440
Everything is mixed
up in the same pot.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.340
And all these kids are
there and they're rocking.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.440
Now, here's the position for
the people on the microphone.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.060
You had the rapper, the
singer, the yeah man.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.560
And what the yeah man was,

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.320
was he was the guy whose
job was to say yeah, right.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.260
That's it, his only role was
to stand there and every now

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:44.730
and then just say yeah!

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.030
That's it.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:47.370
And we loved him, right.

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:48.970
He was the ad-lib
guy, the hype man.

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:52.350
And then you had what we
called the lead talker.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.010
The lead talker was the
maestro of the band.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.840
He was the leader, the
captain, the quarterback.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.110
He was the boss.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:06.300
And his job was to conduct the
band and to control the crowd.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.590
And the way he did this
was by making sure everyone

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.130
in the crowd felt important.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:15.640
Here's how it worked.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.240
Halfway through a Go-Go
set there'd be a breakdown.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.540
And what that meant was

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.050
that everybody would stop
playing their instruments except

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.230
for the drummer and
the conga player.

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:29.410
And during this breakdown, the
lead talker would then look

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.850
out into the audience and he
would ask a couple of questions.

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:35.440
Number one, where y'all from?

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.770
And number two, what's
your name?

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:40.970
And if he was good, he'd
ask, and who's your crew?

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:45.000
What we would do before
we went to the Go-Go,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.300
was we would make signs.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.470
People in DC would
make signs, right.

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:53.230
They would say, Minnesota
Avenue Crew, right.

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:55.300
The Kennedy Street
Honeys, right.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:59.000
All these different crews and
neighborhood affiliations,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.570
blocks that they lived on.

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:03.800
The 1300 block of this, the
1400 block of this, right.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.100
Wherever you were from.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.400
Southside, Wheeler Road,

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.840
all these different
neighborhoods represented.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.950
And you would come with
your sign or your T-shirt

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:12.550
with your neighborhood
and your name

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.850
and your crew written on it.

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:15.150
And you would hold it up.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:18.560
And when the lead talker
said, let me see who we got

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.590
in the building, he'd
look out into the crowd

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:23.890
and he'd call out your name.

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:25.490
He said, where y'all from?

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:28.980
And you'd say, you know,
I'm from, you know, uptown.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:30.280
Where y'all from?

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.580
You'd say, commentaries.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:32.880
Where y'all from?

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.180
We'd say Berry Farm.

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.480
Whatever he was saying.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.120
And then he'd say,
well, what's your name?

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.910
Right. And you'd
yell your name out.

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:40.500
Right. Or he'd see
the sign and he'd say,

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.990
I see you little
Jason, good to see you

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:44.120
in here tonight, little brother.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.070
I see you, Rasheed, I'm glad
you came out tonight, sis.

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:48.830
Shouting you out on
the microphone, right.

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:52.170
And then after all that, he
said, and who's your crew?

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:53.700
And you'd say, oh, you
know, you'd name your crew.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.000
It was a big deal.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.150
Now, here's why this
was important.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.250
Follow me, here's why
this was important.

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:03.240
The day after the
Go-Go, what we knew was

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.340
that all these parties
were being recorded

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.290
on to cassette tapes.

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:10.780
And you could go to the store,

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.490
what they called
the PA palace --

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:15.840
which was basically a kiosk
in any mall in the area,

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.520
that sold cassette tapes of
the Go-Go you just came from.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.860
So you'd walk up to the man
and you'd say, hey, man,

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.320
you got last night's
Backyard Band?

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.640
Last night's Junkyard Band?

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.830
And the guy would say,
here you go brother, $5.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.780
You'd give him the $5 and you
get in your car, or you get back

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.870
to your house, and you turn
the tape on, and you wait

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:37.380
and you wait and you'd wait.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.760
And then the breakdown came.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.730
And he'd say, let's see
who we got in the building.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:46.100
And you're like, here it comes.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:49.120
And he'd say, tell me
where y'all from in here.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.160
And you're waiting to
hear your voice scream

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.580
out your neighborhood,
scream out your street.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.490
He's saying, what's your name?

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:57.360
Or you wait for him to say,
I see you little, Jake,

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.660
good to see you,
thanks for coming

00:09:58.660 --> 00:09:59.960
out tonight, little brother.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.730
And that's me, right.

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:05.110
Imagine what it felt like for
the whole city to know the name

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:07.310
of my block, the
name of my friends

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:08.820
and what we called ourselves.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.060
And to hear my name on a tape

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.610
that was circulating
all over town.

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.330
See, when we were growing up,
we didn't want to meet Jay-Z,

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.690
we wanted to meet Big G
from the Backyard Band.

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:22.030
He represented something for
us because he had the control

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:27.340
and the power to make the whole
city know that we existed.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:30.190
That's all I think about
when I'm writing these books.

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:32.110
I'm the lead talker.

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:33.790
That's my job.

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.910
My responsibility is to
look out in the crowd

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:37.800
and say, where y'all from?

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.200
Right? What's your crew?

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.670
Right? What's your name?

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.630
And to put those names,
those neighborhoods,

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:45.240
those feelings in a book.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:48.770
We don't value how important
it is for young people just

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:52.330
to see themselves, to feel
represented in a book.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.370
It meant the world for
kids growing up in DC

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:56.540
to hear their names
on those tapes.

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:58.720
Something so small
that nobody outside

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.240
of our community even knew was
happening, yet for a lot of us,

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.930
it was the biggest
deal in the world.

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:05.470
It was like winning a Grammy!

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:07.900
To hear your name on a
tape coming out of a mouth

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.690
of somebody you respected.

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:12.060
Somebody that you felt
like could see you

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.970
and understand what it is
you were going through.

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.260
That's what it means
to write Ghost.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:18.560
People are like, well,
why you write Ghost?

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.320
Because it's a true
story about Matt Carter,

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.510
one of our best friends
who grew up in [inaudible].

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:25.030
True story.

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:26.650
Right? His story is now --

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:30.130
it now exists outside of his
own mind and his own world.

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:32.490
The whole world gets
to call his name out.

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:34.470
Gets to hear him call
his own name out.

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:36.130
Gets to hear me call
his name out.

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:39.800
What an amazing, amazing
experience for him, who is 36,

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.060
37 years old, to
give to his children

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:45.300
who are now 15, 16
and 17 years old.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:46.600
It's amazing.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.140
And some of you are
probably like, well,

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.610
what if we're not from DC?

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:51.910
What about us?

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:54.300
What if we don't understand the
community in which you've come?

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:56.960
What if we don't understand
the experiences that Ghost had?

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.940
What if we don't know
how to hear that music?

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.200
Here's the thing
about Go-Go music.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.800
If you hear it and
you've never heard it,

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.850
you will say it sounds
like noise.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:08.850
If you hear it -- and
anyone from DC knows this.

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:12.010
If you hear this music and you
have never heard it before,

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.960
you will say that it
sounds like noise.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.350
It is never recorded

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:18.650
on state-of-the-art
recording equipment.

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:21.540
So it's always a little muffled.

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:24.070
And the music has so
many different sounds,

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:26.410
that if you're not familiar
with the way it sounds,

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:29.300
if your ears haven't been
trained to the rhythms

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.590
and the multi-rhythms of
that music, you will say

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:35.070
that it sounds dissonant.

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:41.110
But if you give it some time
-- if you give it some time --

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:44.940
give it a fair ear -- a
fair listen -- lean in --

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:47.670
have some patience -- right?

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:50.390
Be a little more disciplined and
a little more active in trying

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:53.370
to understand what
the music is about.

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:57.330
If you go see it live,
step into the spaces

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.030
that you normally
don't step into.

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:01.400
Be around the people that
you're normally not around.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.300
Diversity your friendship
circles.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.980
Diversify your schools.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:06.830
Diversify your libraries.

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:09.130
Diversify your bookshelves.

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:11.430
Right? [applause].

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.080
Then perhaps you
would at least --

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.420
you would at least
understand why the music sounds

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.230
so good to the rest of us.

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:24.720
You would at least maybe be able
to understand the brilliance

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.190
that it takes to make the music,

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.280
even if the music
isn't something

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.510
that directly connects
to your life.

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:32.160
There's a way for
us to still connect

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.160
to the things even they're not
rooted in our own experiences.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.360
We can't use that
as a copout anymore.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.660
Do a little work.

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:39.970
Try to understand.

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:42.590
Your kids need you
to try to understand.

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:44.750
Because you are not
necessarily living the life

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:49.100
that your kids are living, even
if they're living in your home.

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.220
So you will have to
do a little work.

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:54.000
It's going to sound a
little noisy at first.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.950
But be a little patient.

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:59.150
And if you are, then you'll be
able to hear your name called

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:00.450
out on the cassette tape.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:03.670
And you can learn how to
rock with the rest of us.

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:05.150
I got about 15 minutes,
10 minutes,

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:06.930
I'm going to take
some questions.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:08.390
And we can boogie.

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:13.770
All right, you can ask any
question about any book

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:17.520
or anything and I'll give
you an honest answer.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.880
Have at it.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.510
What you got?

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:26.220
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.590
So the question is,
how did I pick

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:29.880
out the name Aralia for Sunny?

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.840
Because her name -- I picked
it out because it's you.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.490
You know what I'm saying?

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:34.950
I knew. You didn't even
know I was thinking

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:36.830
about you the whole
time, you know.

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:40.570
But in truth, Aralia came
from one of my good friends.

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:42.690
I called her and I said,
look, you're a dancer,

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:45.520
you've been a dancer
for a very long time.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.660
I have no idea how to
write dance into this book.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:53.060
So if you give me all the like
secrets to how write dancing

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.240
into a book, I'll put
your name in the book.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.620
And that's how Aralia
sort of happened.

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:58.540
So shout out to my home
girl Aralia who told me how

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.560
to write all the like
weird dance moves

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.860
that Sunny does in the book.

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.560
Let's go -- I got
your microphone.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:07.250
Yeah. Say it again.

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:09.520
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite
book that you wrote?

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.210
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: What's my
favorite book that I've written?

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:14.560
It's hard.

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.850
What's your favorite
book that I've written?

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:21.760
Patina. Mine too, my man.

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.000
Yeah, mine too.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.140
I don't know if y'all know
how big of a deal that is,

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:32.770
that my man's favorite
book is Patina.

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:34.770
Anybody else?

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:36.190
Yeah, we'll go back and forth.

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:38.060
If you have a question,
I'm going to get you,

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.980
but it might be easier for
you to get to the microphone.

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:41.840
I'll promise I'll
get you though.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.140
Yep?

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.310
&gt;&gt; So I'm a happily
married school librarian,

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:48.760
but I refer to you as my
fictional literary boyfriend.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.220
I think you are amazing.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:51.520
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: Thank you.

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.670
&gt;&gt; I will not ask you to marry
me because that would be weird.

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:54.970
But.

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:56.270
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: A little bit.

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:58.590
&gt;&gt; I read your books and I
sense in them a mixture of anger

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:01.390
and frustration about the things
that we see in our communities

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:05.050
and in our country, coupled with
this joy of just what it means

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:06.570
to be human and a family.

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:07.870
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: Yeah.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:09.170
&gt;&gt; How do you prioritize when
you're writing your books,

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:10.920
what I'm going to be
angry about in this one

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.310
and talk about in this one?

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:15.230
And then keep that
intention with the joy

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:16.700
and happiness that we feel too?

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.000
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds:
I think it's tough.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.300
I think that's a good question.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:20.600
I think it's tough.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.900
My mother always says,
don't ever trust nobody

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.380
who is all cry and no laugh.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.380
Right. I think that like
if we were being honest

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.250
about humanity, there's
no way that we could talk

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:29.710
about the bad things without
talking about the joy.

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:32.110
I'm around kids all the
time, right, young people

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:33.770
who are experiencing
heavy things.

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:35.690
And it's interesting because
anytime a young person has

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:37.710
experienced trauma or
anything that has sort

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:40.500
of been heavily weighted,
there are still never moments

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.580
where they aren't cracking
jokes with their friends.

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:45.870
Right. Like no matter
what you've been through,

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:49.260
if you're 11 years
old, you're goofy.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.000
Doesn't matter, right.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.330
And there's beauty
in that in a way

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.290
that I think I'm
always thinking about.

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:57.530
I think children get
it right in that way.

00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:59.860
I think as we get
older, we sort of --

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.750
the hardness crystallizes
in a different way.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:03.480
But as young people, they're
a little more malleable.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.470
They understand that
you can be both and.

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:08.940
I could be upset and still laugh
at the things that are funny.

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:10.240
Because that's life.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.890
Anybody who's ever had
loss in you life --

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:14.280
I don't know everybody's
sort of death traditions.

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.830
But in the black community,
there's nothing sadder

00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:19.810
or funnier than a
funeral, right.

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:21.110
It's just the way it works.

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:22.410
You know what I mean?

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:23.710
And I think I try to show

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:25.010
that in the books as
often as possible.

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:26.310
It's fair to the kids too.

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:27.860
I just think -- look, I'm
not interested in sort

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:30.630
of writing what we all
call pain porn in life.

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:31.930
That's not me.

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:37.380
I think life is good
and bad and complex.

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:39.880
And I want to put that all that
in every book the best I can.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.180
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.480
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: Thank you.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.780
&gt;&gt; Why do you write books?

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:46.500
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds:
Why do I write books?

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.960
I ask myself this every day.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:53.870
There's so many other art
forms that are so much easier.

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:55.170
You know what it is?

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:57.610
I write books because at the end
of the day, I think that you --

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:02.180
I think you deserve --
look, the greatest gift

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:07.330
that we can give one another is
the gift of own stories, right.

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:08.860
If I can give you my story,

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.380
that means that I've basically
given you a huge part of myself,

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:13.070
and I'm trusting you with that.

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:15.080
And so I wanted to do
is say, you and I --

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:19.080
the minute that you read one of
my books, you and I are friends.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.380
We know each other.

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:23.480
That means that you know
there's somebody in the world

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.840
who you may see or you may not
see, who is thinking of you.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:30.750
And that is a powerful, powerful
tool when things get tough.

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:33.750
Right. That's the reason that
I do this every day, you know.

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:35.050
Thank you.

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:38.000
It's a pretty dress you got on.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.950
&gt;&gt; What advice would you
give to future writers?

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:44.190
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: What advice
would I give to future writers?

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:47.910
Well, there are a couple things
I'll tell you really quickly.

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:50.140
The first two are going
to sound really silly.

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:51.440
You got to read.

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.740
You got to write.

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.040
I know that feels
obvious, but the truth is

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.640
that you'd be surprised how many
writers don't read or write.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.160
Therefore, they ain't
really writers

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.390
but they call themselves
writers, right.

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:02.060
The other thing that you have
to understand whether you want

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:03.710
to be a writer or whether
you want to be anything,

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:06.240
is that excellence is a habit.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.790
Never forget this, okay.

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:09.090
Excellence is a habit.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:11.620
It's not something you
can turn on or turn off.

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:12.920
You're either going
to be excellent

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.220
or you're not going
to be excellent.

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.520
You're going to create
positive habits

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:16.900
for yourself right now, right.

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.200
You want to be a writer?

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.720
Let's say -- you
want to be a writer?

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:22.320
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: You turn
your homework in on time?

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.620
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:24.920
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: All right,

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.220
you headed in the
right direction then.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.520
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:28.820
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: You got it.

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:31.220
&gt;&gt; What gave you the idea to
write your Miles Morales book?

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:33.800
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: What gave me
the idea to write Miles Morales?

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.220
Well, Miles Morales book
is, of course, as you know,

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:38.350
a little different than
a normal Spiderman story.

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:41.560
And the reason why is because
I feel like Peter Parker

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.280
as I know, as beloved as he is,

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.860
I think it's a little
bit corny, right.

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:47.470
Here's what I mean.

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:49.110
I think that Peter Parker says,

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:51.150
that with great power comes
great responsibility, right,

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:52.450
that's his whole thing.

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:53.750
And that's true, by the way.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:55.540
I think that's true.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.460
But that's not true for
a 15-year-old, right.

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:00.380
When I was your age --
let's say right now,

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:02.310
right -- how old are you?

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:03.610
&gt;&gt; 11.

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:04.910
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: 11.

00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:06.210
So let's say I said,
look, I'm getting ready

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:08.130
to give you all this power.

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:10.100
You're going to be able
to jump from here to here.

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:11.400
You're going to run this fast.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.910
You're going to be the
fastest person on earth.

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:15.800
You're going to have
superhuman strength.

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.400
Are you going to be
responsible with it?

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:23.980
Go ahead, tell us a lie in
front of all these people.

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:25.280
[laughter].

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:26.580
What you going to do with it?

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:27.880
You going to go the
basketball court?

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:29.180
You going to go to
the soccer field?

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:30.480
You going to go to
the baseball mound?

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.610
&gt;&gt; I'll probably just
play around with it.

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:33.990
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: There you go.

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:35.500
And that's an honest
answer, right.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:36.800
And guess what?

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.100
So would I.

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:39.400
Like that's actually
what anybody

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.700
in this room would do, right.

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:44.280
And so what I wanted to show was
a young man with all that power

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:47.050
who just honestly wanted
to play around with it,

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:48.970
or at least his friend wanted
him to play around with it.

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:50.950
Because that's who we
are as human beings,

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:53.070
especially when we are
a little bit younger.

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:54.450
And that's why, that's
what I wanted to get at,

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:56.650
make it a little
more real, you know.

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:59.220
Thank you for reading
it, by the way.

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:02.950
&gt;&gt; I have two questions to ask.

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:04.700
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: Okay.

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:07.620
&gt;&gt; The first one is: What's your
favorite part of writing books?

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:08.920
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds:
My favorite part

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.220
of writing books
is finishing books.

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:11.520
Next question?

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.970
[laughter].

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:14.530
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite sport?

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:15.830
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds:
What's my favorite?

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:17.130
I grew up playing basketball.

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:18.430
I'm always going to be a --

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:19.750
and I was lucky to grow
up in the time of Jordan,

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:23.040
even though I really like
LeBron a lot these days.

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.390
But I grew up playing
basketball, man,

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:27.340
that was my sport, still is.

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:28.640
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:29.940
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: Thank you.

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:31.940
&gt;&gt; How long does it
take you to write books?

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:33.260
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: How long
does it take me to write books?

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:34.560
It depends on the book.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:35.860
Every book is different.

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.460
Ghost took six weeks.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:40.290
Long Way Down took two weeks.

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:43.970
And it took me a year
and a half to edit.

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:48.730
Right. Patina took a year,
almost a year to write.

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:50.030
Every book is a little
bit different.

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:51.330
You never really know.

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:52.630
I just kind of sit down
and do the best I can.

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:54.090
But some books take
a little bit --

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:56.080
I mean, All American Boys
took six weeks, you know.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.770
It just kind of depends
on what the book is, man.

00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:00.130
Every book's different.

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:03.910
&gt;&gt; So how many books
did you write down?

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:06.220
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: How many
books did I write down?

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:08.270
How many books have I written?

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:10.850
I think we're at number
12, something like that.

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:13.250
I don't know, 12, 13.

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:15.000
We're up there somewhere.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.520
I just do my work, I
ain't worried about it.

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:19.640
Just keep it going, you know.

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.940
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:23.500
&gt;&gt; In your opinion what is
the scariest sea creature?

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.050
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: In my
opinion what is the scariest

00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:26.590
sea creature?

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:28.160
Any sea creature I can't see.

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.460
[laughter].

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:33.660
For sure. Yeah.

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:38.540
&gt;&gt; I have read all of the Track
series books except for Lu

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:42.440
because it isn't, you
know, released yet.

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:43.740
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: Yeah.

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:49.190
&gt;&gt; But how do you think Lu
will like as a story play out?

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:50.490
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds:
So you want me

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:51.790
to tell you what the book is --

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:53.090
you want me to break
it all down for you?

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:54.390
[laughter].

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:55.750
So here's what -- I won't tell
you that because I want you

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:57.640
to read it and I want
it to feel fresh to you.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:02.300
But what I will say is, every
question will be answered.

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:04.220
All the questions
will be answered.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:06.330
And Lu is a very
different kind of character,

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:09.090
and that's all I'm going to say.

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:12.900
And thank you for reading the
other three, I appreciate that.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:17.320
&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt; I've read -- I
started reading your books

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:21.150
in like seventh grade, and I've
been following them since then.

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:23.700
And I feel like I've watched
you grow in popularity as I go

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:25.070
to each of the events you're at.

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:26.560
And like your books are too.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:29.580
Like I think Long Way Down
is becoming a play, right?

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:30.880
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds:
Yeah, for sure.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.570
&gt;&gt; Like how are you responding
to that, dealing with it?

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:33.870
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds:
To the success?

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:35.170
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:36.470
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: That's
a very good question.

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:37.940
So my best friend
is here, right,

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:39.260
my best friend in the world.

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.060
Somebody that I've
known since I was --

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:44.540
it's been 31 years of
friendship with this person.

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:46.870
And he's in the crowd.

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:49.970
And people like him are
sort of the anchors --

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:53.300
like things get crazy and they
get noisy, and it's easy for me

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:54.600
to look out into the audience --

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:55.990
and I'm so grateful for
all of you who have come.

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:57.890
And I'm so fortunate that
any of you care anything

00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:59.530
about the things
that I've written.

00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:01.940
But this isn't my
real life, right.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.190
Like this is a part of my life
and it's a part that I love

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:05.490
and I'm sharing it with you.

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:08.370
But my real life is at
my mom's kitchen table.

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:11.090
My real life is with my home
boys who've known me my whole

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:13.860
life and know all the things
that y'all will never know.

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:16.980
Right. And so I try my
best to surround myself

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:20.210
with like the people who
love me and who know me.

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:21.510
Because they're the
ones who are going

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:22.810
to always tell me the truth.

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:25.650
And we all need the truth, even
when it makes us uncomfortable.

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:27.450
And that's how I deal
with it, you know.

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:31.090
[applause].

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:32.780
You got to wait till the end.

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:34.080
I got you the very
last question,

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.980
but I can't get you right now.

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:37.280
Yeah?

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.290
&gt;&gt; Hi. So I really admire
your craft because you try

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:40.590
so many different things.

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:45.970
You've done a verse novel
that took place like in a day.

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:49.210
You're on to four
of the Track books

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:53.260
and then you've done a
Spiderman book that is based

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:55.290
on a character that we love.

00:24:55.290 --> 00:25:00.550
So what is your craft
process like?

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:02.730
Or maybe I'm mostly
just thinking

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:05.670
of who is the hardest
character you've ever written?

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:07.390
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: So first
of all, I want to thank you

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:10.770
because I do these talks and
I do panels all the time,

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:12.670
and you know what people
never ask me about?

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:14.870
Craft. Ever.

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:17.780
People want to know whatever
it is they think I represent.

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:19.690
But I work as hard as
everybody else in this business.

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:22.580
I sit down at the page and
-- you know what I mean?

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:23.880
Like for me it's craft, right.

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.850
[inaudible] So thank
you for that, right.

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:28.600
And so in terms of the hardest
character I've written --

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.830
oh, it's hard.

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:33.130
That's a tough question.

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:34.430
I mean, there's so
many different --

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:38.270
I mean, Patina was not a
difficult character to write,

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:40.260
but she was one that I wanted
to take really, really,

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:42.930
really good care of and to
think about and be thoughtful

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:44.260
about how to write her.

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.680
Because I didn't want --

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:50.580
I wanted to write a girl
character as a human being.

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:53.950
And that took time
and compassion,

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:55.980
me dealing with my own stuff.

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.250
Me really sort of like
taking my time to make sure

00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:00.700
that I nailed this down, that
I'm not swaying too far this way

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:03.640
or that way, slipping into
all the cliches that so many

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:07.720
of us slip into and
really writing a young lady

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:11.380
as a human being dealing with
all the things that young ladies

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:12.680
that I grew up with deal with.

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.500
And so that was probably
not the hardest character,

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.800
but the character that
was most challenging.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.190
Thank you for that.

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:21.350
I got time for one
last question.

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:23.680
And even though you
broke all the rules,

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:24.980
I'm going to take your question.

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:26.280
What's your question --

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:27.730
oops, actually, I'll
take your question too.

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:29.180
Real quick, what's
your questions?

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:30.480
&gt;&gt; When you write a book,

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:34.810
normally how many
drafts do you write?

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:36.110
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: It depends.

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:39.350
I mean, Long Way Down
I think was 20 drafts.

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:41.460
Ghost was two.

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:43.400
Sometimes it just kind
of works, you know,

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.910
and other times you
got to work it out.

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:46.390
It just kind of depends
on the book, you know,

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:47.690
every book is different.

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:49.250
You ready?

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:50.550
You ready?

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:51.850
Y'all ain't ready.

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:53.150
Last question real quick.

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:57.110
I gave you a shot,
you know what I mean?

00:26:57.110 --> 00:27:00.060
&gt;&gt; When you were little,
did you like candy?

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:02.060
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds: That's the
perfect question to end on.

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:04.640
When I was little,
did I like candy?

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:07.250
The question is,
did I like candy?

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:09.950
And the answer is not only
did I like candy then,

00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:12.050
I just had like a brownie
and a blondie upstairs.

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:15.680
Anything with sugar in it
is for me, you understand?

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:16.980
Not you though, but
for me for sure.

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:18.730
All right, y'all, peace.

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:20.030
Have a good night.

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:21.380
[applause].
