00:00:20.474 --> 00:00:22.390
PROFESSOR: This is going
to be really informal

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.630
and you can try and
follow along if you want.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.350
I'm just going to show you my
basic workflow from Illustrator

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.650
to After Effects to
Premiere and some important,

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.358
I guess basic tools
that you might use.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.840
This is Elizabeth.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.430
OK.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.110
I just started.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.600
We finally got
everything set up.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.702
I don't know how to
make it any better.

00:00:53.395 --> 00:00:53.895
OK.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.430
So first thing is
creating your new canvas.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.370
So if you open up Illustrator,
it's just File New.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.520
You can name it
whatever you want.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.970
And then the profile is
going to be automatically set

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.440
to one of the options, but I
adjust the width and the height

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.220
to match the screen size of
the video that we capture.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.219
Which is usually
1920 by 1080 pixels.

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:26.010
So you want to make
sure the width is 1920,

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.350
the height is 1080, and
the units are pixels.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.571
And you can keep the color mode
and the pixel grid the same.

00:01:35.571 --> 00:01:37.030
And you press OK.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.490
And your screen should
look something like this.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.110
And this is just
the drawing surface

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.360
on which you're going to work.

00:01:52.617 --> 00:01:54.450
Do you guys want to
follow along or should I

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.110
just keep going from here?

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.610
Nod.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.340
AUDIENCE: How about-- sorry,
can you go through just

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.060
like drawing a single shape.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.054
And then maybe draw
a person's face

00:02:11.054 --> 00:02:13.524
and then export it
out of Illustrator

00:02:13.524 --> 00:02:17.760
and then animate it in After
Effects and save the movie?

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.176
PROFESSOR: That's
what-- yeah, OK.

00:02:19.176 --> 00:02:19.530
Yeah.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.180
AUDIENCE: Oh, is that
what you're going to do?

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.079
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:21.620
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.780
Sorry.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:22.280
Go ahead.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.014
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:02:23.014 --> 00:02:24.480
No worries.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.060
So this is just going
over some basic tools.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.210
I like expanding
the right tool panel

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.300
just so I can see everything,
especially the layers.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.550
That's a tool I use a lot.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.310
Basic tools that you're going
to use are the paint brush.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.400
This is how you mimic
writing on your tablet

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.840
so you can mimic
your handwriting.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:54.850
You can draw basic shapes with
this, but they appear as lines.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.960
So everything in
Illustrator is a vector.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.080
So this is a solid object.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.280
And then if you
want to make shapes,

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.100
there's a rectangle
tool over here

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.060
and you can hold down on
it and find other shapes.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.210
And then you can just
drag to place it.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.200
If you want to change
the border color,

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.490
or the color of an individual
line, you can click on this.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.720
This is stroke color.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.190
Double click and it'll just
give you a full-color spectrum.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.490
You can select anything.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.570
And if you want to change
the fill-- right now,

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.150
the fill, the white box
with the red line through it

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.520
means that it's transparent.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.645
But you can choose any color
you want and change the shape.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.890
If you want to draw
a free-form shape,

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.830
the pencil tool will
connect lines to make

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.630
a potentially solid object.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.630
So if you want to
make an irregular

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.840
polygon or some other shape,
the pencil tool automatically

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.550
connects them even if you don't
completely draw them together.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.107
You can also redraw
lines sometimes

00:04:09.107 --> 00:04:10.690
if you draw them in
the same direction

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.340
that you originally did.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.648
So you can adjust the
border of a shape slightly.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:21.709
What else?

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:28.060
The black selection tool can
help you select entire objects.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.127
You highlight--

00:04:30.127 --> 00:04:30.960
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.543
PROFESSOR: No.

00:04:31.543 --> 00:04:33.454
No worries.

00:04:33.454 --> 00:04:34.620
Is it not recording?

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.661
AUDIENCE: No, it was not.

00:04:38.694 --> 00:04:41.110
PROFESSOR: Do you want me to
do a Quicktime recording just

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.609
as backup?

00:04:41.609 --> 00:04:43.168
AUDIENCE: Yes, as a backup.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.090
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:02.440
So the black selection arrow can
help you select entire objects

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.470
or you can drag to
select groups of objects.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.450
The white selection arrow, you
can select individual points

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:09.060
on objects.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.740
So you can select a point on the
path and then move it around.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.930
So you can warp a line
that already exists.

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.345
And change its direction
and things like that.

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:30.260
The eyedropper tool
is useful if you--

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:36.581
let's say I took a paint brush
and I had a specific stroke

00:05:36.581 --> 00:05:37.080
weight.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:43.260
I had a specific
color that I was using

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.420
to draw a circle or a spiral.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:57.920
And then I reverted back
to black at one point,

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.790
but I want to go back
to that size and color.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.870
The eyedropper tool will
hold both those informations.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.730
So if I just eyedropper
that, then it

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.750
will turn blue and
in 8-point brush.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.270
But if I eye-drop the block,
then it'll go back to 1-point

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:14.450
in black.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.330
So it just saves
you some time if you

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.490
want to completely
recreate something.

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.630
The last thing that's important
in Illustrator is layers.

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:28.930
I usually divide up my project
based on types of objects.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.840
So if I was doing
this from scratch,

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.320
I would probably
put all the stuff

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.590
I drew with a paint brush on
one layer and all the shapes

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.180
on a separate layer.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.720
You create a new layer just by
clicking this new little page

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.820
here.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.130
And it's basically just
a way to group objects

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:48.960
and manipulate them
independently from each other.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:56.296
So, for example, I will move
this square into layer one.

00:06:56.296 --> 00:06:57.920
And I'll those animate
using layer two.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:08.760
And you can toggle a
lock on each layer.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.800
So if I put a lock
on layer one, that

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.600
means I can't do anything
to these objects,

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.530
like I can't manipulate
them accidentally.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:19.540
And the eyeball triggers
whether you can see it or not.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:23.550
So sometimes you want to
draw something in one layer

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.030
and then you create a
couple more on top of it,

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.470
and you don't want to
see the original one.

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:30.220
And I usually name
my layers something

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.790
to remind me what they are for
the purposes of After Effects.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:37.720
Just so it's less
confusing when I get there.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.840
So this would be text.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.086
And layer two will be rectangle.

00:07:48.054 --> 00:07:50.470
That's pretty much all there
is to know about Illustrator.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:54.400
You can save the files.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.760
It'll save as a .ai, which
is important when you animate

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.500
something.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:06.170
Save it somewhere where you're
going to remember where it is.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:09.514
And you can just keep
the default settings.

00:08:09.514 --> 00:08:11.180
So here's where it's
going to branch off

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:15.050
if you want a still transparent
image over your video

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.990
or an animation.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:19.070
If you just want a
still transparent image,

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:22.120
you can draw it in
Illustrator like this.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.670
Just click File, Export.

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:28.780
And it'll automatically
go to PNG.

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:33.549
Click Use Artboards because that
preserves the screen dimensions

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:36.390
that you specified
in the beginning.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:37.740
And you click Export.

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:39.590
And it'll give you
this pop up window

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:42.490
and here is where you
can choose whether you

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:48.880
want a white background, a black
background, or a transparent.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.670
Which is really nice if you
just want a text overlay

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:53.350
on your video because
you automatically

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:57.930
have an image with vector
art in it, or vector words,

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:00.580
and a transparent background.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.490
And you can just click
OK, and then your image

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:04.420
will be exported.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:06.140
I think mine's in
my downloads folder.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:06.700
Yeah.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:10.100
Just as a PNG file, which
you can import into iMovie

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.840
or Premiere or Final Cut Pro.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.640
And overlay it just like
another video track or an image.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:23.180
That is everything
for Illustrator.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.062
So I will close that.

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:33.125
Now, if you want
to animate, animate

00:09:33.125 --> 00:09:37.190
in After Effects most likely.

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:38.880
You can also learn
Flash animation,

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.680
but that's a different
concept behind it.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:51.780
So the way to start a
composition in After Effects

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:56.570
and import your images that
you started in Illustrator.

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.160
You exit out of
the initial window

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.630
when it asks you to create a
new composition because we're

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:05.090
going to just import our
files from Illustrator

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:06.930
as a new composition.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:11.040
So you just double click
in the project window

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.664
and it'll give you a pop-up
window that says Import File.

00:10:13.664 --> 00:10:15.330
I'm sure there's
another way to do this,

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.830
but this is just
how I was taught.

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:22.640
You can probably go File
Open or something like that.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:27.430
Go to wherever you saved
your Illustrator file,

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:30.490
enable all acceptable
files, and then import it

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:33.460
as a composition.

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:38.620
That just means it will process
each layer in your Illustrator

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:41.505
file as a different layer
in your composition, which

00:10:41.505 --> 00:10:43.380
will be important when
it comes to animating.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:50.230
And then from here, you
can alter your Composition

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:50.730
Settings.

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.651
And you can name
your composition.

00:11:01.651 --> 00:11:03.150
It will automatically
adopt the name

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:05.600
that you named your
Illustrator file.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.440
You can customize the
width and the height,

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.690
which should be the same
dimensions that you specified

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:11.200
before.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.320
You want it to be
in square pixels.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.760
Sometimes it defaults
to a different size,

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.846
and I think rectangular
pixels are silly

00:11:19.846 --> 00:11:21.470
and they mess up how
your video's going

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:23.440
to look eventually.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.680
Or how your animations
relate to your video.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.810
The frame rate is
important because it

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:30.120
allows you to match up
your animation exactly

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.530
to your video.

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:33.860
In Adobe Premiere
the frame rate is 30.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.242
The default for
After Effects is 25.

00:11:36.242 --> 00:11:37.950
And that messed me up
on my first project

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:40.140
because I was trying
to time everything

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:45.820
and then it was off by
five frames per second,

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.825
which is really frustrating.

00:11:47.825 --> 00:11:49.950
I don't know what they are
for iMovie or Final Cut,

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:54.642
but I would check when you go in
before you start your project.

00:11:54.642 --> 00:11:56.777
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:56.777 --> 00:11:57.360
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:03.420
I set the background
color to white

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:07.330
just so I can see
everything because I usually

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:11.000
draw with a white
background in Illustrator.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.400
If you want to set the default
background in Illustrator

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.090
to black and do
white text, and set

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:18.510
that as transparent in
front of your video,

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:20.740
then a black background
would make more sense.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.780
This background color does
not export with the video,

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:26.000
though, so your animations
are still transparent.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.980
It's just so you can see
things in After Effects.

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.660
And usually what I do before I
start an After Effects project

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:35.720
is I look at how long the
audio is for the portion

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:36.750
that I want to animate.

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:39.580
So for example, I was
working with Andrea yesterday

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:43.050
and she wanted a goat during
one of her lines when she says,

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:45.750
and the force of a mountain
goat jumping on your teeth

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:48.370
is some amount of newtons.

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:50.580
Or whatever a line is.

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.880
And you look at the
duration of how long

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.810
it takes you to say that line
in your editing software.

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:59.099
And that's how long I set my
duration of my animation to be.

00:12:59.099 --> 00:13:00.140
Just so it's really easy.

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:01.460
It's really modular.

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.580
I'm animating for
this part of the video

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:06.547
and I have this much
space to do it in.

00:13:06.547 --> 00:13:08.630
And because I don't have
an audio track right now,

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:12.350
I'm just going to
set it to 15 seconds.

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:14.126
So that's good.

00:13:14.126 --> 00:13:16.500
Then you can double click on
your composition to open it.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.760
And this is going to
be your display window.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.320
This is your timeline.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.600
It's where I guess the
animation is taking place

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.650
and you can see
different things.

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:29.930
And here is where
you're going to be doing

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:31.340
a lot of the animation stuff.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:35.470
This little Options
window, I guess.

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:37.120
You can still toggle
the visibility

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.830
just like you did
in Illustrator.

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:43.920
And so let's say-- I'm going
to show you how to animate

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.850
this rectangle, for example.

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:49.310
So the first thing you want
to do is right click on it

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:51.640
and Create Shapes
from the vector layer.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:55.540
Basically this just
allows After Effects

00:13:55.540 --> 00:14:00.220
to take the vector shapes,
or objects that you created

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:06.800
in Illustrator, and translate
it into a manipulable format

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.180
for After Effects.

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:15.130
So then you have this new
item-- object-- I don't know,

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:16.990
called Rectangle Outlines.

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:19.860
And you can look inside
in their contents.

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:21.930
If you had multiple
objects in the same layer,

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:23.590
you'd have multiple
groups, but I just

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:27.990
have the one rectangle
so I only have group one.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:32.320
And so in order to move
this, what I'm going to do

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.770
is open up group one.

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:38.780
And I have different options.

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:40.380
And you guys are
going to be doing

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.789
a lot of Transform animations.

00:14:42.789 --> 00:14:45.330
So these are things like if you
want something to move around

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.750
on the screen, if you want
something to change in size

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:51.770
or rotate, or things like that.

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:53.960
So what you're going to
do for if you wanted--

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.560
let's say I wanted
this rectangle

00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:00.760
to move across the
screen and grow bigger.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:04.260
The things that I will--
and in After Effects you

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.810
want to think in key frames.

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:09.130
So what does it look like at
one point in the animation,

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:13.420
and then what do you want it
to look like in two seconds?

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.080
So right now this is
where I want it to start.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:20.710
So I'll click a little
stopwatch on position and scale,

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:23.770
and these will set key frames
for both position and scale.

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:26.050
So now After Effects
remembers where the rectangle

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:28.140
is at this point in time.

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:32.820
Then I'll set it forward
to let's say two seconds.

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.540
In two seconds I want
my rectangle to move.

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:38.600
And then it's as easy as
dragging the rectangle

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:43.030
to where you want it to be
and then changing its size.

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:46.180
So let's say I want it to
be really big like that.

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:49.370
And then once you make
those changes, After Effects

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:53.470
automatically sets another key
frame for you in your timeline.

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:56.490
And then you can review what
you want the animation to do

00:15:56.490 --> 00:16:00.460
by dragging this back
and pushing Space, which

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.940
is the same thing as Play.

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:05.280
And then you can watch
how over the two seconds,

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:09.150
it transitions from one point in
space to another point in space

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:12.890
and one size to another size.

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:14.900
You can edit and
delete key frames.

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:16.730
You can add more in the middle.

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:19.160
Let's say I wanted it to
go up and left before I

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.750
wanted it to go up and right.

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:24.330
You can just set it to the
middle of this animation

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:29.010
and drag it up and left to
where you would want it to be.

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:34.080
And then it'll keep scaling
the size at the same time,

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.075
but then it will just
adjust its position path

00:16:37.075 --> 00:16:37.950
in the new animation.

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:50.490
And that's the bare
bones of animation.

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:55.180
The one other thing you guys
might use is-- let's see.

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.330
If you want to
group multiple items

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:03.930
and have them move
at the same time,

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:12.230
for example-- I'm going
to take my text layer,

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:13.980
Create Shapes from
Vector Layer, and now I

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:18.470
have another layer of objects.

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:21.329
Except this one
has many contents.

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:24.210
Many groups of things
that I can manipulate.

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:27.540
So let's say I want both
these spirals to move

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:29.324
at the same time.

00:17:29.324 --> 00:17:30.990
I haven't found a
better way to do this,

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:34.820
but-- so I learned that
the spirals are groups

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.060
two and three.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.110
I can click on Contents just
to highlight everything,

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:42.660
Add a New Empty
Group, and it's just

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:46.090
labeled whatever the highest
number-- one after the highest

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:47.060
number.

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:50.990
You can rename it to
something like Spirals

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:53.370
so you remember it.

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:57.480
You can highlight
both of these and just

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.820
drag it into the new group.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:05.381
And that way you can
transform spirals as a unit.

00:18:05.381 --> 00:18:07.110
Let's say I wanted
them to rotate.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:14.330
And so then-- OK.

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:15.330
That's kind of rotating.

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.720
And so it set the key
frames for rotations,

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.130
but instead of just
manipulating one spiral

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:26.580
I have two grouped together.

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:32.300
And then the rectangle animation
is still going from before.

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.004
AUDIENCE: Can you [INAUDIBLE]?

00:18:34.004 --> 00:18:35.170
PROFESSOR: What do you mean?

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:37.210
AUDIENCE: With the
point they pivot on?

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:38.170
PROFESSOR: Pivot point?

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:39.410
I think so.

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:43.580
I don't usually rotate
things in my animations.

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.300
I think it's probably
the anchor point.

00:18:52.592 --> 00:18:53.800
AUDIENCE: See the cross-hair?

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.740
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.740
So that's the pivot point.

00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:01.631
I don't know how to
change that necessarily.

00:19:01.631 --> 00:19:02.130
OK.

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:02.671
There you go.

00:19:02.671 --> 00:19:06.130
You can just adjust it in
relation to the anchor point.

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:07.595
So you can change this value.

00:19:10.651 --> 00:19:11.150
Yeah.

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:12.990
A lot of this is
just playing around

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:14.644
and seeing what you want to do.

00:19:14.644 --> 00:19:16.060
You can ask me
questions afterward

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:18.667
and I'd be happy to
troubleshoot it with you.

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:22.800
Yeah.

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.130
So I guess that's how you pivot.

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:27.180
And so it'll maintain
the rotation just

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.898
around the smaller
anchor point now.

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:34.753
Let's see.

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:45.310
This is might be useful.

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:49.660
So if you go in and you have a
lot of work-- so for example,

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.840
in a different project
what happened was

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:55.440
I had the outline of a
cell and I was showing

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.070
contents of the nucleus.

00:19:57.070 --> 00:20:00.560
And when I screened it
to my project advisor,

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:04.250
she said it's great
but we're not focusing

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:05.380
on the nucleus of the cell.

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:08.010
And so I can't really
see what's going on.

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:09.890
So I had already done
all this animation

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:12.060
with individual squiggles
of DNA and proteins

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.800
moving around in
the nucleus, and I

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.970
wanted to preserve
that animation,

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:20.270
but I needed to just
zoom in on everything.

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:22.920
And you can do this with a
thing called Null Object.

00:20:26.166 --> 00:20:27.790
Let's see if I remember
how to do this.

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:28.289
OK.

00:20:28.289 --> 00:20:31.600
Layer New and then
a Null Object.

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:35.320
And so it'll appear in
here as just Null One.

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.930
And basically it's a way to
group multiple animations

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:38.777
at the same time.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.940
You can just leave that
named Null One I guess.

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:48.920
So let's say I want the
spiral and the rectangle

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:53.250
to both be smaller because
they're both way too big.

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:59.680
So then you can you
can set the Null Object

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.070
as the parent of these layers.

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:05.210
It says Parent and you
can have a drop-down menu.

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:09.410
And so you can set both these
layers to have their parent

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:13.700
as Null One, and then you can
animate Null one as though it

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:15.970
were an independent object.

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:22.940
So let's say I just want the
scale of everything to go down.

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:27.100
So because those are both groups
that are under the Null Layer,

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.450
then the scale goes down.

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:30.290
Or you can animate
it independently.

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:33.050
So let's say I want
the scale at 100%,

00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:36.860
but as the rectangle grows
I want everything to shrink

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:38.270
because it got too big.

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:41.494
So then you can turn the
scale down of everything.

00:21:41.494 --> 00:21:44.160
And so when I run the animation,
the rectangle is going to grow,

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.690
the spirals are going to
rotate, but then everything,

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:48.260
because it's all grouped
under the Null Layer,

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:49.051
is going to shrink.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.960
And so I guess those
are the basics of it.

00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:02.530
Once you have your
After Effects file,

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:04.695
I would save it
as something just

00:22:04.695 --> 00:22:05.820
so you don't lose anything.

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:17.530
And then you can do
one of two things.

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:24.230
So if you want to
edit in Premiere,

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:29.350
you can start-- Adobe
products are really nice where

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:31.520
they auto-update to each other.

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:36.200
So if you change the
Illustrator files that make up

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.100
the composition
in After Effects,

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:41.290
then your After
Effects will change

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:42.940
to reflect those changes.

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:45.000
So if you messed up
drawing something,

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.580
or you want a shape to look
a little bit different,

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:51.130
if you update the Illustrator
file your After Effects project

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:52.470
will also update.

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:57.305
Same thing with your After
Effects Project and Premiere.

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:08.230
So if I have a
Premiere project, you

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:12.200
can drag your After Effects
composition into Premiere

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.000
just to import media.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.840
And then I have
my test animation

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:19.590
and I can drop it here
to create a sequence.

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:23.430
And so right now,
because it's transparent,

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:24.940
I can't see anything.

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:35.830
But if I were to add a
color match in light blue--

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:38.610
this is going to
be really garish--

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:42.620
and add it on the video
layer below the animation,

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:43.520
then it will appear.

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.503
So the animation
itself is transparent.

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.320
And so now if I make
changes in After Effects,

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.160
it'll automatically
update those changes

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.480
in Premiere, which I
find really handy as I'm

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.830
video editing and
switching back and forth.

00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:02.530
If you don't want to edit in
Premiere, that is totally fine,

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:07.397
and you just need to
export your composition.

00:24:07.397 --> 00:24:09.230
I was just playing
around with this earlier.

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:11.880
Usually I don't export,
so I don't necessarily

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:16.550
have the ideal settings
for it, but we can

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:18.580
play around and see what works.

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:21.584
So File Export to
Adobe Media Encoder.

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:28.920
And then it adds it
automatically to the queue.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:35.780
And you can choose preset
export settings over here.

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:39.800
I created a preset for the
videos that I'm working on

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.770
and so I usually
just select that.

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:50.470
And then once you do all that,
then you can just push play.

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:53.034
And then the media
encoder does its thing.

00:24:53.034 --> 00:24:54.450
I don't know exactly
what it does.

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:56.890
I think it's a combination
of rendering and just making

00:24:56.890 --> 00:25:04.580
sure-- changing the file format
from the After Effects Project

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:08.347
to, in this case, an MP4 file.

00:25:08.347 --> 00:25:10.573
AUDIENCE: So, for
a lot of yours,

00:25:10.573 --> 00:25:13.744
I'm imagining you want to
do Animation Overlay, right?

00:25:13.744 --> 00:25:16.860
So you can't do that
in stuff like iMovie,

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:18.610
so what you will
have to do, which

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:22.347
is a super techy workaround,
is you create the animation

00:25:22.347 --> 00:25:24.782
in After Effects,
you go in Premier

00:25:24.782 --> 00:25:28.191
and that's where you overlay
it on top of your live action

00:25:28.191 --> 00:25:31.600
footage, and then you export
that little chunk into your Add

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.574
Movie Project.

00:25:32.574 --> 00:25:34.522
Does that make
sense to you guys?

00:25:34.522 --> 00:25:37.236
So would you mind showing real
quick how to do it in Premiere

00:25:37.236 --> 00:25:40.920
where you overlay an animation
on top of your live action

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:41.420
footage?

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:42.086
PROFESSOR: Sure.

00:25:47.846 --> 00:25:49.220
So it's basically
just doing what

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:53.680
I was doing and just using
something besides the color

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:54.650
mat.

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:57.240
I will see if I have any
movies on my computer.

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.290
I don't know if I do.

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:03.290
AUDIENCE: So if you are holding
your hands out like this,

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:07.440
what's the best way to time
and place the animations?

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:08.364
PROFESSOR: Oh, OK.

00:26:08.364 --> 00:26:09.403
AUDIENCE: Because
you basically have

00:26:09.403 --> 00:26:11.069
to draw them without
seeing a background

00:26:11.069 --> 00:26:12.344
in After Effects, right?

00:26:12.344 --> 00:26:13.010
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:19.540
OK.

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:20.237
I have a video.

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:33.790
So the way I would
animate in After Effects

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:36.470
is to use the time codes.

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:38.720
So Premiere has a time
code, and it's right here,

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:46.510
and it matches up with
where the movie is.

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:57.200
So right now the animation
is overlaid for my movie,

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.899
and the formatting
is weird because I

00:26:58.899 --> 00:26:59.982
didn't do the movie first.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:12.970
What I would do is,
let's say for example

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:17.320
I wanted at five
seconds something

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.170
to happen, like something
to pop up above my hand,

00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:22.980
then I would take
note of the time code

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:25.120
or whenever you raise
your hand in the video.

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:30.332
So let's say it was at
11 seconds and 24 frames.

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:42.530
Then you go back into
Adobe After Effects

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:47.060
and you can scroll
over to 11 frames

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:50.420
and make sure the time
code here is listed here.

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:52.680
And so you just
switch back and forth

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:57.362
and adjust the time code of
your animations to the time code

00:27:57.362 --> 00:27:59.070
where you want it to
appear in the video.

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:06.270
And you can drag key
frames to adjust that.

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:12.810
So if I say, well the rectangle
moved too fast in this video,

00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:14.840
I actually want the
animation to end

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:26.720
at 3:29 instead of two seconds,
I can drag my cursor to 3:29,

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.267
and then just drag the
key frame to match it.

00:28:29.267 --> 00:28:31.100
That's usually how I
do it just because it's

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:33.710
a lot easier to visualize.

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:36.820
And then it will
automatically update in here

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:39.920
and the animation
just got a lot longer.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:43.590
And so now when I push play,
instead of taking two seconds

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:45.747
it's still going until 3:29.

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:51.430
It's a lot of playing around.

00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:57.320
I don't have a really, really
concrete method of doing it.

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:59.500
And I'm still learning
animation too,

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:04.454
so I don't have
the perfect answer,

00:29:04.454 --> 00:29:06.620
but usually it's a lot of
switching between windows,

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:09.248
which is why when you have
two monitors it's really nice.

00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:15.200
But a lot of just checking the
time code exactly and making

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.936
little adjustments at a time.

00:29:16.936 --> 00:29:18.560
It's kind of like
how you edit a movie.

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:19.640
You start with a rough cut.

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.723
You start with a rough
animation of what you want,

00:29:21.723 --> 00:29:25.150
and then you can adjust the key
frames to time it to the video

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:27.479
that you're working with.

00:29:27.479 --> 00:29:30.272
AUDIENCE: So I think what will
be most productive for you

00:29:30.272 --> 00:29:32.902
guys is if you attempt
to do your own animation

00:29:32.902 --> 00:29:36.353
and then if you run into any
problems, email [INAUDIBLE],

00:29:36.353 --> 00:29:37.832
or you can email me.

00:29:37.832 --> 00:29:40.297
We'll be around tomorrow
if people are working,

00:29:40.297 --> 00:29:44.241
and I'll be on campus tomorrow
actually if you need help.

00:29:44.241 --> 00:29:46.706
But I think the
most efficient route

00:29:46.706 --> 00:29:49.171
is if you try a little
bit on your own first

00:29:49.171 --> 00:29:54.434
and then when specific questions
pop up you can come ask us.

00:29:54.434 --> 00:29:55.100
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:58.510
And if you have anything
specific in mind

00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:02.030
that you don't think you can
accomplish with what I've

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:05.070
taught you so far, then you
can definitely come talk to me

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:06.710
or I can come over
and talk to you.

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:10.680
And we can talk through
what your picture was

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.480
for animating something
and how you can best

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.830
do that either using the
tools that I just taught you

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:17.070
or using other things.

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:19.910
Like I know how to
mimic handwriting

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:20.810
to write out a word.

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:22.976
And I don't know if that's
necessary for any of you,

00:30:22.976 --> 00:30:25.240
but that's a thing that you
can do in After Effects.

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.760
It's just a little
more complicated

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:29.679
than what I've shown you so far.

00:30:29.679 --> 00:30:30.970
AUDIENCE: I have two questions.

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:34.900
One of them is I have used
Adobe Premiere before,

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:38.596
but in the sizing, of
course I'm not sure

00:30:38.596 --> 00:30:40.400
when I'm doing
[INAUDIBLE] it looks

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.750
like the sizing is correct.

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:44.485
However, when I export
it into external video,

00:30:44.485 --> 00:30:46.000
the sizing was wrong.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.960
So is this a thing?

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:51.100
PROFESSOR: For
exporting from Premiere?

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:54.025
AUDIENCE: I mean like, if
I see the screen like this,

00:30:54.025 --> 00:30:56.066
is this everything that's
on the screen that will

00:30:56.066 --> 00:30:58.015
be shown in the actually video?

00:30:58.015 --> 00:30:58.640
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:06.470
So what this is-- I recorded
this movie on my camera

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:08.350
on my computer, which
is lower quality

00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:16.260
than your camcorders, which
should record in 1920 by 1080.

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:21.700
So right now, this in the
upper right hand corner

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:23.270
is what's going to be exported.

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:25.270
So if I exported
it right now, it

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:28.510
would export with this
weird black border

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:32.580
because my video is smaller
than this composition.

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:34.910
AUDIENCE: So it's preferable
to expand the screen?

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:36.370
Can we expand the video?

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:40.770
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you
can individually--

00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:44.050
you can double click, and this
is how you digitally zoom.

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:44.550
Basically.

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:46.960
You can manipulate it
just like any other object

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:50.759
and make it bigger so
it fills the screen.

00:31:50.759 --> 00:31:51.634
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:54.342 --> 00:31:55.508
PROFESSOR: What do you mean?

00:31:55.508 --> 00:31:58.044
AUDIENCE: So this [INAUDIBLE]
would be the one that--

00:31:58.044 --> 00:31:58.710
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:01.160
So whatever you see
in this preview screen

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:04.470
is what's going to come
out when you export it.

00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:06.560
And then you can
change export settings.

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:09.400
File Export Media.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:12.740
And you can change the file
type that you want it to be

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:16.320
and the video format.

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:20.360
I use the settings that
MITx needs to upload usually

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:24.940
just because it works and it
produces a high enough quality

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:26.930
video.

00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:30.630
But if you know things
about audio and video

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:33.240
and things like
that, you can add

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:36.580
a copyright encoded
into the video itself

00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:38.890
if you really want to protect
it and things like that.

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:40.270
But less necessary.

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:42.686
AUDIENCE: If you're going to
check the camera we're given,

00:32:42.686 --> 00:32:45.131
it's how many frames per second?

00:32:45.131 --> 00:32:47.087
AUDIENCE: I think it's 30.

00:32:47.087 --> 00:32:48.554
I'll double-check it.

00:32:51.274 --> 00:32:53.690
AUDIENCE: And if I want to get
a-- let's say I have video.

00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:55.210
I took a video.

00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:57.818
But at the moment I
want to cut that frame

00:32:57.818 --> 00:33:00.696
and extend that frame to
make it like a picture.

00:33:00.696 --> 00:33:02.660
[INAUDIBLE] explain the concept.

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:04.780
So how do I do that?

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:07.045
PROFESSOR: So this
is something--

00:33:07.045 --> 00:33:08.670
I don't know how to
do it in Final Cut.

00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:10.110
I know how to do it in Premiere.

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:14.770
So hypothetically in Premiere--
that's a bad frame pause.

00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:19.230
Let's say I want to
pause this frame,

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:22.490
there's a button here that
just says Export Frame.

00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:27.820
I click it and then
what do I want it to be?

00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:30.010
Still Face.

00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:32.280
I just wanted a JPEG, I guess.

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:35.500
And then this box just
means that you import it

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:36.820
into the project automatically.

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:38.695
So no matter where it
saves it-- in this case

00:33:38.695 --> 00:33:44.150
it's saving it in my Premiere
folder-- you click OK

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:47.930
and then it automatically
appears as an image

00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:51.586
in your media browser area.

00:33:51.586 --> 00:33:52.960
And so then if
you want to extend

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.320
this frame, what I
would personally do

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:58.430
is use the Razor tool.

00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:01.120
Cut the clip into two.

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.910
Use the Selection tool and drag
this over so I have some space

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:05.480
to include it.

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:08.810
And then include
the still image.

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:12.010
And then just seal
that gap back up.

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:18.980
So now, instead of just seeing
me talk, I'll talk, I'll talk,

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:22.635
I'll talk, and then the still
frame will happen for however

00:34:22.635 --> 00:34:25.260
many seconds you set it, and you
can adjust the size and timing

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:27.409
of that, and then the
video will resume when

00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:29.290
you're ready for it to do that.

00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:30.915
AUDIENCE: I don't
exactly know what

00:34:30.915 --> 00:34:32.290
the frame rate of
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:34.227
is because it records
both in 24 and 30,

00:34:34.227 --> 00:34:36.143
but if you open the
video up in Quicktime

00:34:36.143 --> 00:34:41.308
and you do Command I, which
is what it was recorded in.

00:34:41.308 --> 00:34:43.116
And I just found that
out by Googling it,

00:34:43.116 --> 00:34:45.551
so don't underestimate
the power of Google.

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:52.770
PROFESSOR: Are there
any other questions

00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:55.977
about animating or
editing or Adobe?

00:34:55.977 --> 00:34:57.435
PROFESSOR: I mean,
we're just going

00:34:57.435 --> 00:34:59.216
to stick around for
the rest of today

00:34:59.216 --> 00:35:02.170
so if you just want to hang
out here and work or you want

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:04.600
to go back to the
classroom and work,

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:07.950
we'll be around to
answer your questions.
