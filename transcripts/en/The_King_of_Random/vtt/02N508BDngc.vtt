00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.840
Hey guys welcome back, thanks for joining us today on the king of random. Not too long ago,

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.969
we showed you how to make a desktop

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:11.669
vortex fountain, something that used to pump in a small cistern of water, pumped it up into a cup in a spiral so that as

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.630
it drained out, it forms sort of a water tornado. Well that was pretty cool, but today

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.119
we're gonna try and suit that up to make a larger,

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.390
full-size vortex fountain and we have a couple of twists

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.359
we're gonna add in as well. The basic idea is the same. This orange bucket we'll be using as our cistern down below.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.840
We have a pump that can move up to 550 gallons of water per hour.

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.659
Instead of the drinking straw we used on the miniature one

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.960
We've got this flexible vinyl hosing. We'll make this drink dispenser the part of our fountain that houses the vortex.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.940
We also have this plastic 16 inch diameter tray

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.560
One of the first things we need to do is to take off all of the excess pieces that come with this drink dispenser.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.220
It's got a lot of cool accessories, but we're not going to use them.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:03.300
Now we also want to remove the spigot here, but after we remove it we do want to keep this thicker rubber seal that's on the outside

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.560
One of the first steps will take is giving ourselves an attachment method for the hose outside of the container that will also angle the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.920
water on the inside of the container. At Ace Hardware,

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.980
I managed to find these plastic pieces that turn at an angle and are smaller on one side than at the other so that they

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:23.320
link together nicely the smaller end also fits perfectly with our three-eighths inch vinyl hose

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.620
What we're going to do is fit the narrow end of one of these elbows through the hole where the spigot was in our drink

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.120
container. We will then attach the other elbow to the first one through the container.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.720
Because the hole is larger than the piece of plastic going through it,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.400
we're also going to take the rubber seal that was on the spigot and use that to seal everything up. Now that may hold water

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.800
a little bit, but we want to make sure it's 100% waterproof

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.100
So we're also going to take our hot glue gun and spread a ring of warm glue around this edge

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.160
And then we'll put this on and press the rubber down into that. That should give us a really nice seal that will never leak

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.860
Now while that's cooling

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.360
let's also drill a hole in the very center of the bottom of our vortex chamber a

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.000
3/8 inch drill bit is smaller than the diameter of the pipe leading into this chamber and our pump should give us enough volume of

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.489
Water that it can keep up with a hole 3/8 inch wide

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.529
With the point of entry and exit for the water

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.179
We need to drill similarly placed holes in our plastic tray. Just a note about this plastic tray.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.800
I found this one at a thrift store for about two bucks

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.360
If you don't happen to have any of these available at your local thrift store, any

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.560
plastic tray about this size should work as long as it has a little bit of a lip on the edge

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.760
This one is 16 inches in diameter. First we'll drill a hole in the very center

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.600
That's where the water will drain down through after it leaves the vortex chamber now the water after it leaves the vortex chamber and is

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.440
Going through this tray. It doesn't need to come through a perfectly sized

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.120
Hole that just barely lets all the water through it can have plenty of space on the sides

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.440
So I'm actually going to use a larger drill bit and just give a hole about an inch wide in the middle of this tray

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.180
When we have the hole in our vortex chamber lined up perfectly with the hole in our plastic tray we can see

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.400
Approximately where we need to drill the second hole that will let the tube come up from the pump to feed water into our tank

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.120
Once again this hole doesn't have to be exactly the same size as the hose it can be a little bit larger

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.060
I'm not gonna stick with the 1-inch. I'm gonna take it down just a little bit

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.220
I've got my three-quarter inch drill bit and that's what I'm gonna use for our second hole in the tray

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.220
We've got two holes drilled into our tray one hole drilled into the center of the bottom of our vortex chamber and of course one

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.060
Spot where the piping is going to take the water up from the pump

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.020
into our vortex

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.380
chamber once our hole fountain is up and running some of the water will be filling out of the vortex chamber and landing on the

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.060
Tray to help it drain faster back into the bucket. We're gonna drill just a few more holes in it

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.040
I do want to make sure all of the holes are set

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.320
fairly far in if they're out near the edges that will actually be wider than where the bucket was and all the water will just

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.320
drain onto the ground

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.700
For these holes I'm going one step smaller and using a 5/8 inch drill bit

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.840
Our plastic tray now has eight holes drilled into it now

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.920
Let's set this aside and work on our pump for a minute

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.440
This pump is designed to be submerged completely underwater as it's working it has a nozzle at the top

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.100
Where all the water will spray out?

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.400
what we need to do is use our hose to connect this nozzle to the

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.760
Input of our vortex tank when our pump is in the bucket you can see we won't actually need all that much hose it will

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.220
Need to connect from about here to here to make sure that we have enough while we do our accurate measurement

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.560
I'm just gonna cut off an extra six inches of it, and then do our measuring from there this 3/8 inch

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.680
Hose is a little bit too small to fit over the nozzle easily

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.250
But I found if you just kind of wiggle it and press it you can actually get it on fairly

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.400
Well as you can see this vinyl tubing really likes to curl itself up, and we want to be pointing basically straight

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.200
So what we're gonna try and do is use a little bit of heat to make it soft enough that we can straighten it out

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.160
And then have it cooled down like that there. We go. That's way better in terms of shape

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.860
We'll just let that cool down a little bit and it'll be a lot straighter

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.520
Alright our hose has now been warmed up reshaped a little bit and cooled down and it's being much more agreeable

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.980
standing mostly straight up

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:14.170
So let's try throwing the pump into the bucket putting the tray on top and running the hose through the hole to see how long

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:19.160
We need to cut this off now see that we want to cut our hose off right about here

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.900
Beautiful

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:36.640
That right into the nozzle hole in the center of our vortex chamber lines up wonderfully with the hole in the tray

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.340
That's just how we want it to look at this point

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.620
I think we are ready to put water in the bucket and give our vortex chamber a test now

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.840
We need to make sure that we have enough water in the buckets what we're going to do is we're going to pour water in

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:54.080
Until it completely covers the pump and then we want to add at least the volume of this container on top of that

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.640
That way no matter. How full this gets our pump will have enough water to keep going

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.020
All right, that's a bucket full of water and since we're at the sink

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.540
Let's just do some testing right here in case it spills anywhere all right here goes

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.480
The see quite a good volume of water comes out of this thing it's a good little pump

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.260
Already got a little bit of a vortex forming in there

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:34.340
And even though the water is draining out the bottom. It's pumping in fast enough that the water level continues to climb

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.060
This whole apparatus is a little bit of a slope right now partly because it's in the sink

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:48.940
which I think has a sloped bottom and also because the power cord from the pump is in between the bucket and

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:55.220
The tray over here, and it's making it tilt on one side that is a whirlpool from top to bottom

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.720
Just what we want to see

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.880
All right, we know. It's working. I'm gonna unplug it and let it drain

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.440
Now of course there's no more water coming in but still draining out the middle

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:16.210
So it just keeps going with the whirlpool as the water level drops all right that worked great now

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:20.240
There are a few changes. I want to make so it works. Even more smoothly one of the first things

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.280
I want to change is I'm going to cut a notch in the top of the bucket so that when the cord fits in that

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.320
Notch the tray can sit flush on the top

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.960
So I'm just going to mark a spot on our bucket where I want the notch to be then I'll get a saw and cut

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.040
That down

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.660
Perfect now our cord can just sit right there and

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.320
Our tray will sit flush on top of that cutting a notch in the bucket is the first modification

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.980
I wanted to do the second is a little bit more colorful

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:51.360
I have here a string of LED strip lighting which can be made to shine in a whole big variety of colors and patterns and

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:56.720
the power system that drives it all the plan is that the strip of LEDs will come in through the side of the tray and

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:02.480
Wrap around the inside of the bottom of our vortex fountain that way we can choose the color of our fountain lights

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:06.610
We'll drill a small hole in the bottom of the tray run the lighting through there

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:08.940
And then we'll use hot glue to seal that off

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.140
There should be

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.500
Plenty, but just to be sure I'll give myself another

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:26.960
Foot and that's where I'll cut it off now these LEDs are designed to be cut every two inches or so with a little mark

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.400
That fits nicely up through where we just drilled a hole, that's good

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:40.640
Alright, so I think the best position is going to be for this box to be vertically up and down next to the bucket

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.060
I'm going to use some tape to secure it in place

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.760
I'm also just gonna tape this piece in place

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.060
I'm leaving a fair amount of slack in our LED line

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:54.780
Because I need to be able to lift the tray a little bit without it. Just immediately disconnecting everything. I've got in there

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:09.960
And yes in case any of you are wondering this lighting system is actually waterproof

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:16.540
It's not good to get any of the control box pieces wet, but that shouldn't be a problem. Let's give our lights another test

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.520
ha

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:23.360
Beautiful lighting right up at the bottom of our vortex chamber just how we want it to

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.440
It's beautiful

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:35.680
Alright, I'm gonna use a little bit more tape and just sort of secure these two power cords

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:40.200
So they're together and near the bottom now our fountain is looking pretty good

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.200
But we still have this bright orange

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.660
bucket and a bunch of exposed wires and cables and stuff

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:51.960
So we don't want that we want it to look a lot more sleek and professional on our tabletop vortex fountain we use popsicle sticks

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:57.180
Glued to the bottom container to make it look a little bit more classy well, that's not gonna work

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.940
So well with our bucket, but I do have an idea that will give us a similar look

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:06.250
These are some bamboo window blinds that I picked up at Home Depot for about $15

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:09.080
I think what I want to do is cut them at just the right height

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:15.790
So they fit right underneath this lip so they go all the way around our bucket and all of our wiring and cables it looks

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:17.240
like the right height

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:20.200
Right about here almost exactly halfway

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:24.380
Between top and the bottom of our blinds here now

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:29.340
I want to cut off the edge of this set of blinds because it's got some hardware that I'm not going to need

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.480
But before I do that

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:36.200
I'm just gonna add a little spot of glue everywhere so that I don't have these other lines of string unravel

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.740
Bad

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:51.140
We got a little bit of splintering on the back, but overall I think that worked quite nicely

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:56.240
All right now. I'm just gonna take our bamboo screen here. I'm gonna wrap it around

00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:01.940
Also, I'm just going to snip a couple of these to let our cords out over on this side of the bucket

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:09.000
This is the IR receiver for controlling our lights, so I also just want to sort of wedge that through in a spot

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:13.840
So we can have it sticking out and able to receive signals from our remote control

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:18.920
We do have some excess bamboo, so I'm gonna seal off the strings using hot glue again, and then cut it off

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.480
There isn't any difficult

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.640
There we go, I think we have ourselves a

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:35.860
Fountain if you remember from the desktop vortex fountain we used a bunch of little pebbles to go around as decoration

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:40.100
I really liked how that looks so I'm gonna do the same thing with a little bit larger of rocks for this one

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:46.820
All right

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:49.780
I have here a power strip that has an on/off switch to it

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.140
So that we can control the pump even when it's plugged in here goes nothing

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.640
Let's get some lights going with it oh

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.120
Yeah all that looks awesome

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.440
Oh

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:13.260
I got leakage I didn't use glue to seal off where the lighting went down

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:18.180
I forgot about that remember when I said, I was gonna use hot glue and seal it off

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:23.540
I need to use hot glue and seal it off all that not really supposed to happen

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.460
Doesn't look like it's dripping think we're good

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:35.100
All right Wow with the lights off this thing looks

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:40.580
Incredible the LED lights at the bottom do an amazing job of just lighting up the entire fountain

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:44.300
There are tiny tiny little bubbles swirling through the water

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:47.360
And I think it does a really good job of lighting those off and it also

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:51.480
Reflects off of the top of the water pretty well so the whole thing looks like it's glowing

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:57.960
All right, let's try this again outside. I do have one more little thing that I've added to this one

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:01.920
I talked about how I really like the look of the tiny little bubbles mixed in with the water

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:06.700
Swirling around because they do a good job of catching light well just to take things another step farther

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:12.440
I actually added a hose going into the bottom that wraps around in a circle with some tiny little holes pricked in it

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:17.280
So I'm gonna add some pressure, and we'll see if we can get some larger bubbles swirling around in the mix with it

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:26.620
There we go now, we've got much larger bubbles swirling around in there

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:31.220
You can see that makes the tornado a little bit less effective as there's gaseous bubbles running around

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:37.860
The overall density of the fluid in the container is lower, so it has a harder time maintaining the tornado now

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.800
There's one other thing I didn't mention

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.720
These aren't oxygen bubbles they're propane

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:47.320
So now we have a colorful

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:55.660
Glowing fire vortex fountain this is one of the coolest things I've ever built look at this. It's colored and

00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:00.100
Vortex and it's on fire. I love this thing

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.820
That looks so good

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:06.120
You could roast marshmallows on a fountain

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.080
What have you ever been able to roast marshmallows on a fountain before I?

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.880
Love it there. You have it guys

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:18.260
Not just a vortex fountain and not just a light-up vortex fountain but a light a for Tex fountain that lights on fire

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:25.040
This is basically the same build as our tabletop vortex fountain. It's just a lot bigger, and we added some lights and some

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:26.830
Propane gas to it

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:30.540
So you can ignite it, but it's a pretty simple build I built this whole thing in just a few hours

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:34.660
And it works out very well like this is something that I definitely want in my house

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:39.040
Maybe not with the fire all the time, but if it's an outdoor fountain then probably with it

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:42.360
Thanks for joining us for this project today, and we'll see you in the next one talk to you then

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:52.020
There it is strobe light sees your effect a little piece of leaf floating around in there. I wanna grab it

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:02.720
Can't spin a basketball.
