JOANNA SMITH: Hey everybody,
and welcome to the Google+

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.940
Platform Office Hours.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.109
Today it's a special
Movember episode.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.540
So why don't we go ahead
and introduce our team.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.930
I'm Joanna Smith, and I'm a
developer programs engineer

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.080
here at Google.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.325
JONATHAN BERI: Jonathan
Beri, I'm a developer

00:00:16.325 --> 00:00:17.970
advocate for Google+.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.150
GUS CLASS: Gus Class,
and I'm a developer

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.600
advocate for Google+.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.330
SILVIANO LUCIANI: Silviano
Luciani, and I'm a developer

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.660
programs engineer for Google+.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.610
JOANNA SMITH: I noticed that
before we even started we

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.030
already had a question
on the YouTube

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.886
page which was, Movember?

00:00:29.886 --> 00:00:32.610
Jonathan, what do you think
you can say about it?

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.480
JONATHAN BERI: So Movember
is once a year, an annual

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.240
fundraiser to raise awareness
for men's health issues;

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.060
prostate cancer, testicular
cancer.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.870
And it starts on November 1.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.160
So guys who grow a mustaches,
they shave their face on the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.140
first, and over the course of
the month they groom their mo

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.310
for people to ask them exactly
what that's about.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.690
And of course, there's also mo
sisters, who are women who

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.330
help support the
cause as well.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.460
And I think last year,
cumulatively, they've raised

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.180
over $300 million for
different charities.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.000
JOANNA SMITH: Pretty
cool, pretty cool.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.440
SILVIANO LUCIANI: And there's
couple of cool contributions

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.480
that we can show from Google.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.930
So the first one is a video made
from Google Australia.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.330
The movement started in
Melbourne, in Australia, 10

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.780
years ago, and this one minute
video is giving a summary of

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.230
what happened in 10 years.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.480
GUS CLASS: All right, let's
watch the video.

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:35.067
MALE SPEAKER: For 10 years
it's been good

00:01:35.067 --> 00:01:36.786
times and great mo's.

00:01:36.786 --> 00:01:38.036
MALE SPEAKER: It's mo time.

00:01:47.097 --> 00:01:48.079
MALE SPEAKER: Hey there.

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:49.329
MALE SPEAKER:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN].

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:53.656
MALE SPEAKER: I lost my
grandfather to prostate

00:01:53.656 --> 00:01:56.470
cancer, and I'm growing this
mo in memory of him.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.570
MALE SPEAKER: I'm a mo mentor.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.320
MALE SPEAKER: Get involved.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.570
MALE SPEAKER: Grow
yourself a mo.

00:02:14.074 --> 00:02:15.324
MALE SPEAKER: It's Metallica.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.140
GUS CLASS: That's
a cool video.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.550
SILVIANO LUCIANI: Pretty
cool, huh?

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:29.750
GUS CLASS: Yeah.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.010
SILVIANO LUCIANI: And another
cool thing is, if you go to

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.450
movembergames.com, you can find
four motion sensing games

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.610
that will help get your
mustache in shape.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:40.560
Can we show one?

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.790
GUS CLASS: Yeah.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.620
So you said motion sensing?

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.880
SILVIANO LUCIANI: Motion
sensing, yeah.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.060
GUS CLASS: Yeah, yeah.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.460
All right, so it looks like
I'm going to have to

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.330
authenticate to allow
the camera.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.860
So does anyone know what
this is using for--

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.020
JONATHAN BERI: Yeah, it's
actually using an HTML5 API

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.160
called getUserMedia.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.600
It's part of a larger
spec called WebRTC.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.490
And it essentially allows you
to get access to the user's

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.050
camera and audio, and do
interesting things with it in

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.640
JavaScript.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.290
So it's a pretty neat
application of that API.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.410
How you doing, Gus?

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.620
SILVIANO LUCIANI:
I'm doing good.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.240
GUS CLASS: Oh, I
got a splendid.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.560
It's really hard to do, and you
can't breathe when you do

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.400
it, so you have to practice.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.850
You have to strengthen
that mo.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.850
SILVIANO LUCIANI: So that was
The Lame Mo, and then you have

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.670
The Fu Manchu, and next week and
the following week there

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.776
will be two other games.

00:03:32.776 --> 00:03:33.140
GUS CLASS: Awesome.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.490
SILVIANO LUCIANI: Another
thing is, if you go to

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.840
us.movember.com you can
find Google networks.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.900
And so you can donate to members
of Google that are

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.030
taking part in Movember.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.160
But also on the site you can
find, maybe, your friends, or

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.450
anyone else that is taking part
and donate something.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.280
JOANNA SMITH: And it's a
pretty good cause, so

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.600
definitely go ahead
and get growing.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.500
It's not too late.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.200
And if you're having a little
trouble, like I am, you can

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.260
always check out
freemustache.com to get a

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.150
little extra help.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.735
All right, so with all of that,
we're going to go ahead

00:04:03.735 --> 00:04:06.310
and begin today's demo, where
we're going to show a console

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.810
starter and then a metro style
starter for all of you C# and

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.770
.NET people out there.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.550
And as always, as we're doing
this, if you have any

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.170
questions feel free to post them
on the Google+ event, or

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.689
on the YouTube page, and we will
be monitoring those to

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:20.110
help answer them.

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:21.829
So Gus, why don't you
take it away.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:22.160
GUS CLASS: Awesome.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.200
So Joanna, thanks
for the intro.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.960
So I've been working hard on a
couple C# starters for all the

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.890
C# developers out there.

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.090
And the first one I'm going to
show is actually a console

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.150
based starter, so it's just real
basic command line, built

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.610
from the Visual Studio default
command line project.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.830
So if you look at what I'm
running here, when I started

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.190
up I've put a break point in.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.370
SILVIANO LUCIANI: Gus, wait.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.770
FEMALE SPEAKER: Can you
zoom out a little bit?

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:53.250
Yeah.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.320
GUS CLASS: Zoom out?

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.720
JOANNA SMITH: Yeah.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.960
GUS CLASS: Are you having
trouble seeing it?

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.030
JOANNA SMITH: Yeah.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.145
GUS CLASS: How about now?

00:04:59.145 --> 00:04:59.450
JOANNA SMITH: That's better.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.810
GUS CLASS: OK.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.490
So we're having weird issues
with my screen, but we'll work

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.890
through it.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.260
So here's the starter.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.510
And I put a break point on
the authentication step.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.100
SILVIANO LUCIANI: Gus, before
going in details into the

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.230
[? OAuth ?], would you like
to give an introduction on

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.920
developing console
applications?

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:17.210
GUS CLASS: Sure.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.980
So developing a console
application, you just start

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.390
with a generic template
project from

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.920
within Visual Studio.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.500
And so when you actually do the
new project dialogue, it

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.260
will allow you to select various
types of projects.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.930
And the command line project,
it's one of

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:35.930
those built in templates.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.320
So it's really easy
to start with.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.990
So if you're interested in
exploring this, I'm running

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.640
this on a virtual machine, and
the virtual machine has

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.170
Windows 8 on it.

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.240
And I've installed
Visual Studio

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.480
onto my virtual machine.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.680
So if you've interested in
doing this, if you have

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.040
Windows already you can go to,
I believe it's msdn.com, and

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.840
you can download a
free evaluation

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.300
copy of Visual Studio.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.370
Or you can download Visual
Studio Express, which is free

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.170
to use as long as you want.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:11.030
SILVIANO LUCIANI: Thank you.

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:12.050
GUS CLASS: Yeah, no problem.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.010
So here's a project starter.

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.810
And what I've done is I've
wrapped a lot of--

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:22.790
there's actually a library
that wraps the Google+

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:26.210
services within C#.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.000
And so what I've done is I've
basically written a wrapper

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.900
for the generated classes that
manages the way that all those

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.300
classes work.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.250
So here is my starter
project running.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:44.710
And when I perform an
authentication step, it'll

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:49.240
actually bring up the Google
authentication dialogue within

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.340
a new window, assuming
everything is OK.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:58.000
And so here's my application
named One, and I just had it

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.740
gain permissions for my user.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:05.400
And when I say Allow Access, the
application will return an

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.470
access token, which then
is passed to Google's

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.700
authentication and C# library.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.420
And then that can be used to
perform authenticated queries.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.585
So I've also implemented search
and activities in

00:07:17.585 --> 00:07:21.480
commons list, but this is
probably not as compelling as

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.340
anything else out there, because
all it is that the

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.910
real gist of this project is
that it's a great and easy way

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.160
to get started with Google+ if
you're already using C#, or if

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.370
you're interested in
doing it with C#.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.070
So let's close that one out,
and here's another project

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:39.910
that I've been working on.

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:43.600
This is a metro starter.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.880
And so for this metro starter,
what I did was I actually

00:07:47.880 --> 00:08:00.170
implemented a number of the API
calls using the C# based

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:05.096
libraries for performing
JSON and REST requests.

00:08:05.096 --> 00:08:05.990
JONATHAN BERI: Gus, can you tell
me a little more about

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:07.360
metro style apps?

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:07.810
GUS CLASS: Sure.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.070
So metro style apps is a new
design philosophy that was

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:12.700
introduced with Windows 8.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:17.210
And there's some pillars
of metro design.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:23.850
And in short, it's very simple,
very flat UI that's

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:29.240
done in a specific way to be
really easy for users and

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.700
developers to create with.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.210
And if developers are following
the metro style

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:36.700
guidelines, then their
applications will be very

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.230
consistent with other
applications that exist in the

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:40.760
new Windows 8 ecosystem.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.280
JOANNA SMITH: So one thing is,
is we just got corrected on

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.580
the Google+ page.

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:47.640
The new terminology is now
modern UI instead of metro UI.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.290
GUS CLASS: Oh, modern UI, OK.

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:50.080
JOANNA SMITH: But let's say
someone hasn't developed with

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.410
the modern UI yet.

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:54.355
How is the best way for them
to get started with that?

00:08:54.355 --> 00:08:57.160
GUS CLASS: The Windows Developer
Center has great

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.510
getting started documentation,
and they cover everything from

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.980
getting Visual Studio up to
writing your first app.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:03.810
JOANNA SMITH: OK, cool

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:07.990
GUS CLASS: Yeah, that one is
msdn.com/windows/apps.

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:09.200
JOANNA SMITH: OK, awesome.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.120
GUS CLASS: So here's
my starter project.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.090
And what I'm doing
here is I've put

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:14.400
another break point in.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.150
Hopefully you guys
can see this OK.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:21.460
And so my break point
is reached.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.900
Try moving this over, maybe
you can see it now.

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:25.600
Better, worse?

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.490
JOANNA SMITH: It's running off
the edge of the screen, but

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:29.060
that's better.

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:35.240
GUS CLASS: So what you can see
is that I'm caching the

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:40.550
refresh token, and I'm using
this refresh token to

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.370
regenerate an access token.

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:45.620
But this is the first time that
I've run the application,

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:50.440
so it's going to use the web
authentication broker to

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.780
generate the access token
and the refresh token

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:55.000
on the first run.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.380
So when I run it, it should
bring up the Google sign in

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:04.830
dialogue as set up through,
here we go, right in the

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:08.450
middle, Windows 8.

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:11.560
And then I can just log in.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.810
Let's see.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:20.350
And after I log in, an
access token will be

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:24.820
returned from the API.

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:27.690
And then that can be used to
perform authenticated calls.

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:29.880
And so what I'm going to be
doing is I'm just going to

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.340
allow it to know who
I am on Google+.

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.920
So the first time an application
code is generated,

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:41.680
and then this can be used to
generate an access token.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.070
JONATHAN BERI: This access token
can be used for other

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:46.500
Google APIs as well, right, if
you pass in the right scopes?

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.300
GUS CLASS: Yes.

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:53.330
So ultimately if there's new
scopes that are added, then

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.720
these scopes can be
used for access.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.970
So that's actually the gist
of how this works.

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:02.920
In my demo app I'm doing the
same thing that I did in the

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.445
console app, where I'm just
using activities API, as well

00:11:06.445 --> 00:11:08.170
as the plus dot MEscope
to retrieve

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:11.600
various data from Google+.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:11.880
JONATHAN BERI: Cool.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:15.260
And things like the fonts and
the grid layout, that all

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.030
comes from the modern
UI system?

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.320
GUS CLASS: Yeah.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:20.170
So if you look at the grid that
appears here, this is

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:21.590
what's called a grid view.

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:25.910
And it allows you to use
templates for rendering those

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:27.160
UI elements.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:33.770
And a number of styles, such as
the animation and the fonts

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:36.570
and stuff are actually pretty
much pre set for you, so that

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:38.140
it's consistent with the
rest of the apps

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.260
that are out there.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:40.580
JONATHAN BERI: Pretty neat.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:42.920
JOANNA SMITH: That's
pretty cool.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.780
Anyone else have some questions,
or should we start

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:48.305
looking at the public
questions?

00:11:48.305 --> 00:11:49.420
JONATHAN BERI: Let's
go to the stream.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:49.760
JOANNA SMITH: OK.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:54.000
So some things that we got in
advance; we had a question

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.650
from someone named Isabella
in a language that I can't

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:57.950
actually determine.

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:00.480
So I'm going to go ahead and
ask if you wouldn't mind

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.630
reposting in either English,
Italian, Spanish, or Klingon.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:05.790
Those are the languages that
we're qualified to really

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:07.940
understand.

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.240
And if you do, we'd love to
answer your question.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:15.170
And then we got a question from
someone named Edward that

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:16.965
says that they keep getting
an Error Page 500.

00:12:16.965 --> 00:12:20.450
But we're going to need more
information, I think, in order

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:23.480
to really get what
your question is.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.710
So the most recent one just came
in a few minutes ago from

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:28.080
the same person, William,
who corrected us on our

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:28.475
terminology.

00:12:28.475 --> 00:12:29.480
JONATHAN BERI: Thank
you William.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.380
JOANNA SMITH: He wants to know
if anyone has been pursuing a

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:35.850
social connector for Google+
for use in Outlook 2013.

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:38.250
And I don't think any of us
are really aware of that.

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:40.780
Correct me if I'm wrong.

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:43.460
GUS CLASS: There's nothing that
I'm aware of for a social

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:45.490
connector for Outlook.

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:46.830
JOANNA SMITH: You can always
check our forum, though.

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:48.900
If you want to really see what
other people are up to, that's

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:50.720
probably the best place for
you to connect with other

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.680
developers for the
Google+ platform.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.720
And really ask your questions
there, and maybe even find

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.500
people to work with.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.990
GUS CLASS: Yeah, and if you have
ideas for ways that we

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:05.200
could be integrating using a
social connector or something,

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.190
we'd love to hear about it.

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:10.212
And we'd also love to hear if
you have things that are

00:13:10.212 --> 00:13:11.570
missing that are preventing
you from being

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:13.280
able to develop that.

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:13.400
JOANNA SMITH: Yeah.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.200
If you ever come across
something that you really

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.080
need, a resource that is holding
you up, definitely go

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.240
ahead and put that into our
issue tracker from the

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:23.860
developers.googl
e.com/plus/support page, I

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:24.620
think is what it is.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.830
And we'll definitely go through
that and try to get

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:29.740
those to the right people, and
hopefully resolve your problem

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:30.990
as soon as we can.

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:35.885
No other questions yet.

00:13:35.885 --> 00:13:38.850
Do you guys have any
questions for Gus?

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:41.750
JONATHAN BERI: So Gus, how easy
would it be to take what

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:44.780
you've done in C# and move
that to the server?

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:45.720
GUS CLASS: Moving to
the server side.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:50.400
So the work that I've done in C#
with the console starter is

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.580
something that could very
easily repurposed into a

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.730
server side flow.

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:58.750
The real key piece is
understanding how to use the

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:03.850
service wrapper that is
generated using Google

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:05.780
discovery documents
and so forth.

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:12.500
Once you've figure that out,
then implementing any native

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:15.670
C# connectors to Google
services is going

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:16.920
to be really easy.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.250
So in the case of metro style,
it's slightly different,

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:25.540
because some of the libraries
that are used for that service

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:29.750
generator are actually replaced
with a super set of

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:32.820
that functionality that's
built into metro style.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:37.900
So for example, parsing JSON and
performing RESTful queries

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:41.850
is much easier in metro than
it was previously.

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:46.140
And so certain libraries have
actually been completely

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:50.120
replaced and pulled from Windows
for these specific

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:50.920
types of apps.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:55.240
So in order to support that, you
have to actually use the

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.200
metro libraries themselves.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.240
And so that's pretty much
what I did in the

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.540
case of my demo app.

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:04.830
And so hopefully in the near
term we'll be able to open

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:06.860
source that so other people can
take advantage of the code

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.620
that I've already created.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:14.320
But yes, the client side flow
could pretty easily be applied

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.320
to a server side flow.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.140
And that's actually going to be
one of the next things that

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:20.896
I will be looking at.

00:15:20.896 --> 00:15:22.730
JONATHAN BERI: So Azure
in the future, maybe?

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:24.576
GUS CLASS: Azure, that's even
further down the line.

00:15:24.576 --> 00:15:27.870
Yes, a complete possibility.

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:30.890
JOANNA SMITH: And one thing to
take note of is that the open

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:32.560
source process at Google
does take a little

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:33.340
while to get through.

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:37.280
So if you are looking to get
started with the modern UI in

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.230
the very near future, you should
always feel free to ask

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:42.630
your questions in our forum or
on our Google+ page, because

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:45.220
we'd love to help you until we
can actually get this code up

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.510
on our site for you to play
with on your own.

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:52.140
So definitely feel free to ask
those questions at any time.

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:56.260
GUS CLASS: Or +mention me
directly, and I'd be happy to

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.470
help you if you have a specific
problem that I may

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:01.390
actually have a code solution
for, anything like that.

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:01.610
I'm always listening.

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:04.160
JOANNA SMITH: And you can always
check out Gus's blog

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.030
and stalk him there.

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.910
GUS CLASS: Yeah.

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:09.430
JOANNA SMITH: He has all kinds
of C# .NET knowledge.

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:09.810
GUS CLASS: Yeah.

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:13.920
I've been blogging about
.NET since beta for

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:14.784
Windows 8, I guess.

00:16:14.784 --> 00:16:17.450
I don't even know.

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:17.600
JOANNA SMITH: All right.

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.822
I'm not noticing any other
questions right now, so I

00:16:19.822 --> 00:16:23.200
think we can go ahead and call
this a nice, short and sweet

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.430
Google developers live
presentation.

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:28.670
But as always, if you post
questions in the next few days

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:30.850
we'll definitely come back
and take a look at them.

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:32.770
And happy Movember, everybody.

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:33.730
GUS CLASS: Embrace the mo.

00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:34.980
Thanks for watching.
