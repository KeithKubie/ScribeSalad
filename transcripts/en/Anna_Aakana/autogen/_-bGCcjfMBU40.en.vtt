00:00:00.261 --> 00:00:01.855
I am an introvert.

00:00:01.855 --> 00:00:04.732
Talking to other people just drains my life force.

00:00:04.732 --> 00:00:06.294
It's not even that I don't like movies,

00:00:06.294 --> 00:00:08.199
it's just that I'm more of a TV person.

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:11.199
I like that the arcs are both longer and shorter,

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:13.414
and you get to spend more time with the characters..

00:00:13.414 --> 00:00:14.700
it's just a better experience.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.422
Cool..story bro..

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.633
But not all introverts are necessarily the same.

00:00:19.633 --> 00:00:20.821
You know, there's different kinds.

00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:21.980
There's the comfort zoner,

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.380
who has an aversion to social situations.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.440
I don't want to.

00:00:25.445 --> 00:00:26.919
Just come to the party.

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:28.321
What if I want to stay home..

00:00:28.321 --> 00:00:29.627
Don't you want to hang out with your friends?

00:00:29.627 --> 00:00:31.169
But I am with my best friends right now,

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:33.041
Lily, Jimmy, Abby, Congress, and Ghost.

00:00:33.041 --> 00:00:34.133
Well tonight,

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.844
you're hanging out with me.

00:00:36.847 --> 00:00:37.506
Whoa..

00:00:37.506 --> 00:00:39.419
(dramatic music)

00:00:39.419 --> 00:00:39.945
What?

00:00:39.945 --> 00:00:41.572
Don't you smell that?

00:00:41.572 --> 00:00:42.722
Smell what?

00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:45.733
Where..where are you going?

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.699
That's my room..

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:50.633
There's the creator, the kind of person 
who has to stay up all night making things

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:53.010
and needs time alone to recharge.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.690
(Beethoven's 5th Symphony)

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.443
(knocking)

00:00:59.443 --> 00:01:00.505
If you have to create to music,

00:01:00.505 --> 00:01:02.535
can you PLEASE put on some Mozart?

00:01:02.535 --> 00:01:05.261
Beethoven's 5th symphony is so overrated.

00:01:05.261 --> 00:01:05.799
Sorry.

00:01:06.321 --> 00:01:07.148
Nice painting.

00:01:07.919 --> 00:01:09.118
Thanks. (giggles)

00:01:09.944 --> 00:01:11.299
Shucks, just stop it..

00:01:11.542 --> 00:01:12.352
The thinker.

00:01:12.352 --> 00:01:15.449
You know, the one who likes to 
read, research, hunker down..

00:01:15.449 --> 00:01:16.025
Tessa?

00:01:16.883 --> 00:01:17.457
Tessa?

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.117
Tessa?

00:01:19.602 --> 00:01:21.649
Tessa? Tessa? Tessa?

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.600
(in unison) Tessa?

00:01:23.602 --> 00:01:24.096
Yeah.

00:01:24.096 --> 00:01:25.096
Hey, have you seen my phone?

00:01:25.096 --> 00:01:25.943
Pff.

00:01:25.943 --> 00:01:27.157
What is a "phone"?

00:01:27.157 --> 00:01:30.450
For a device by any other name 
would still be a calculator,

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.536
an instant messenger, a global messaging system--

00:01:33.536 --> 00:01:35.196
Nevermind, nevermind. I--I don't need a phone.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.640
I'll--I'll be fine. I'll be fine.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.860
And of course, the anxious introvert.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.632
Right? This is the kind of person 
who only likes to throw kickbacks

00:01:42.632 --> 00:01:46.407
and small gatherings, cause too many
unknowns bring about a lot of stress.

00:01:46.407 --> 00:01:47.535
(crickets)

00:01:47.535 --> 00:01:49.042
I thought this was supposed to be a party.

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:52.414
Is it too much for you? I can--I can 
turn down the music or--or..you know..

00:01:52.414 --> 00:01:54.353
So what kind of introvert are you?

00:01:54.353 --> 00:01:56.169
Or are you from the other side..

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:57.791
an extrovert..?

00:01:57.791 --> 00:01:58.321
Hi, I'm Tessa.

00:01:58.321 --> 00:02:01.626
(violent hissing)

00:02:01.626 --> 00:02:02.700
I'm Anna Akana.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.662
Stay awesome Gotham.
