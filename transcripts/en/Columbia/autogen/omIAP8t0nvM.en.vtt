today and where we're going to go as we
 

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:49.060
today and where we're going to go as we
move forward in some of the critical

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:49.070
move forward in some of the critical
 

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:51.040
move forward in some of the critical
aspects and critical challenges that we

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:51.050
aspects and critical challenges that we
 

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:53.560
aspects and critical challenges that we
face as we go but and I think we the

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:53.570
face as we go but and I think we the
 

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:55.660

good news is that we're kind of work I
 

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:57.010
good news is that we're kind of work I
think we're through the worst of this

00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:57.020
think we're through the worst of this
 

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:59.680
think we're through the worst of this
now I think we have seen kind of the

00:11:59.680 --> 00:11:59.690
now I think we have seen kind of the
 

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:01.210
now I think we have seen kind of the
bottom or we're close to the bottom and

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:01.220
bottom or we're close to the bottom and
 

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.210
bottom or we're close to the bottom and
we see things starting to pick up or at

we see things starting to pick up or at
 

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.160
we see things starting to pick up or at
least things on the horizon one of the

least things on the horizon one of the

least things on the horizon one of the
one of the things that we look at that

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:07.670
one of the things that we look at that
 

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:09.460
one of the things that we look at that
we are very troubled though is is the

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:09.470
we are very troubled though is is the
 

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:11.199
we are very troubled though is is the

unemployment rate unemployment rate is
up over from where it was last year

00:12:14.139 --> 00:12:14.149
up over from where it was last year
 

00:12:14.149 --> 00:12:16.960
up over from where it was last year
about three percent higher than it was

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:16.970
about three percent higher than it was
 

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:18.460
about three percent higher than it was
last year and even up a little bit from

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:18.470
last year and even up a little bit from

November unemployment rate Tim seems to

00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:20.959
November unemployment rate Tim seems to
 

00:12:20.959 --> 00:12:22.600
November unemployment rate Tim seems to
be a lagging indicator it tends to be

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:22.610
be a lagging indicator it tends to be
 

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:24.670
be a lagging indicator it tends to be
and is calculated in different ways but

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:24.680
and is calculated in different ways but
 

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.440
and is calculated in different ways but
it you know it's still a very very

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:26.450
it you know it's still a very very
 

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:27.819
it you know it's still a very very
important part of what I think it

00:12:27.819 --> 00:12:27.829
important part of what I think it
 

00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:30.120
important part of what I think it
underlies the overall economic recovery

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:30.130
underlies the overall economic recovery
 

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:32.680
underlies the overall economic recovery
in the nation and certainly here in New

in the nation and certainly here in New
 

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:35.319

York City and I think even though in any

00:12:35.319 --> 00:12:35.329
York City and I think even though in any
 

00:12:35.329 --> 00:12:38.590

job loss is is too much there are some

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:38.600
job loss is is too much there are some
 

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.990
job loss is is too much there are some
encouraging signs today we have job

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:41.000
encouraging signs today we have job
 

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.730
encouraging signs today we have job
losses today that about a hundred and

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:42.740
losses today that about a hundred and
 

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:46.210
losses today that about a hundred and
forty thousand people that's the bad

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:46.220
forty thousand people that's the bad
 

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:47.800
forty thousand people that's the bad
news that the good news is that that's

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:47.810
news that the good news is that that's
 

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:50.319
news that the good news is that that's
about a hundred and thirty thousand less

00:12:50.319 --> 00:12:50.329
about a hundred and thirty thousand less
 

00:12:50.329 --> 00:12:52.540
about a hundred and thirty thousand less
than what we really projected at this

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:52.550
than what we really projected at this
 

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:54.760
than what we really projected at this
stage of the game so while it's been

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:54.770
stage of the game so while it's been
 

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:57.130
stage of the game so while it's been
tumultuous time we actually have seen

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:57.140
tumultuous time we actually have seen
 

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.949
tumultuous time we actually have seen
less job losses than we expected and I

00:12:59.949 --> 00:12:59.959
less job losses than we expected and I
 

00:12:59.959 --> 00:13:02.050
less job losses than we expected and I
think also you look at a couple of

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:02.060
think also you look at a couple of
 

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.220
think also you look at a couple of
different things that have happened but

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:03.230
different things that have happened but
 

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:04.870
different things that have happened but
i think the the arrow program or the

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:04.880
i think the the arrow program or the
 

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.050
i think the the arrow program or the
stimulus package as far as the way we

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:08.060
stimulus package as far as the way we
 

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:09.639

affordable housing out of some of the
 

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:42.470
affordable housing out of some of the
existing supply and to continue to look

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480

talked about this we have a dumbbell
 

00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:01.080
talked about this we have a dumbbell
shaped of a lot of low-wage workers and

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:01.090

this recession hit and basically we're
 

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:15.290
this recession hit and basically we're
going to need a great deal of an

that there is no recession for the
