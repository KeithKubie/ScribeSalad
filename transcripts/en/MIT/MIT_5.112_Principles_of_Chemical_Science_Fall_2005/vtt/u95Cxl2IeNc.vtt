00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.755
We are back here for some more
stimulating discussion of

00:00:19.755 --> 00:00:23.040
chemistry.
And I want to begin today by

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.968
just saying that I find it
particularly ironic that on the

00:00:27.968 --> 00:00:33.242
day that I am all prepared to
speak to you about the molecular

00:00:33.242 --> 00:00:38.083
orbital energy levels of
polyatomic molecules for which I

00:00:38.083 --> 00:00:41.714
am using methane as an
interesting example,

00:00:41.714 --> 00:00:47.561
the boards are screwed up.
The reason for that apparently

00:00:47.561 --> 00:00:52.087
is that this screen came down
and will not go back up.

00:00:52.087 --> 00:00:57.039
And one of the reasons that I
have designed my presentation

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:02.419
technique for you this semester
so heavily around the use of the

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:06.944
blackboard is that last year,
when I taught the class,

00:01:06.944 --> 00:01:11.897
I had a lot of feedback from
students about how the one day

00:01:11.897 --> 00:01:17.362
when we had audiovisual problems
and I couldn't use my PowerPoint

00:01:17.362 --> 00:01:22.485
and instead gave an impromptu
chalk talk, that that was their

00:01:22.485 --> 00:01:25.901
favorite lecture.
Maybe next year we will

00:01:25.901 --> 00:01:31.169
entirely be back to PowerPoint.
I don't know.

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:33.776
We will see.
But, fortunately,

00:01:33.776 --> 00:01:38.992
I did write out my notes this
morning in electronic format,

00:01:38.992 --> 00:01:42.949
so I can make use of them on
the side boards.

00:01:42.949 --> 00:01:47.176
And, in addition,
I want to display for you some

00:01:47.176 --> 00:01:50.683
molecular orbital shapes and
properties.

00:01:50.683 --> 00:01:55.000
And I will do that by starting
out --

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.954
Actually, I would like to
start, if I could,

00:01:56.954 --> 00:01:58.954
with this one.
I will go back to the document

00:01:58.954 --> 00:02:00.000
camera in a moment.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.575
Starting out right where we
left off last time,

00:02:13.575 --> 00:02:18.084
you will recall that we were
looking at diatomic molecules.

00:02:18.084 --> 00:02:22.360
We started out with a seven
orbital problem two lectures

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.692
ago.
We looked at the planar BH

00:02:24.692 --> 00:02:28.890
three molecule.
We had a molecule where the MOs

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.425
were mixing in two dimensions.
And then last time,

00:02:33.425 --> 00:02:37.550
when we looked at homonuclear
and heteronuclear diatomic

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.449
molecules the MOs were,
in fact, mixing in just along

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:45.125
an axis in one dimension.
And so, when we left the

00:02:45.125 --> 00:02:48.875
situation last time,
we had arrived at some kind of

00:02:48.875 --> 00:02:53.300
an understanding of the energy
levels in the carbon monoxide

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.300
molecule.
And these were being developed,

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.724
especially, with reference to
CO being a poisonous molecule,

00:03:00.724 --> 00:03:03.728
--
-- whereas, N two,

00:03:03.728 --> 00:03:07.529
another ten valence electron
diatomic molecule was very,

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:09.188
very inert.
Why was that?

00:03:09.188 --> 00:03:13.474
It turns out that you have the
very electronegative oxygen atom

00:03:13.474 --> 00:03:17.829
on one side of the diagram with
its very low energetically lying

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.838
orbitals mixing with the carbon
orbitals that are higher in

00:03:21.838 --> 00:03:24.396
energy.
And the neat thing about this,

00:03:24.396 --> 00:03:28.129
for the carbon monoxide
molecule, is that it results in

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:32.000
an asymmetry of the molecular
orbitals --

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.962
-- because the coefficients are
not the same on the carbon side

00:03:35.962 --> 00:03:39.796
as they are on the oxygen side
as those atomic orbitals blend

00:03:39.796 --> 00:03:43.823
together into the four sigma and
four pi molecular orbitals that

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:46.187
we have.
We have a total of eight MOs,

00:03:46.187 --> 00:03:49.191
and they distribute
energetically as four energy

00:03:49.191 --> 00:03:52.578
levels in ascending energy that
are sigma in symmetry.

00:03:52.578 --> 00:03:56.030
That is, cylindrically
symmetric about the internuclear

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.266
axis.
And then we had four that were

00:03:58.266 --> 00:03:59.289
pi.
Two energies,

00:03:59.289 --> 00:04:02.612
a pi bonding with four
electrons and a pi antibonding

00:04:02.612 --> 00:04:06.000
with just virtual empty
orbitals.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.831
And because this highest
occupied molecular orbital of

00:04:09.831 --> 00:04:14.096
carbon monoxide is so heavily
concentrated on the carbon end

00:04:14.096 --> 00:04:17.349
of the molecule,
you can essentially view this

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:21.253
as a carbon-based lone pair.
It has this big lobe here,

00:04:21.253 --> 00:04:25.445
through which the carbon can
serve as a nucleophile or as a

00:04:25.445 --> 00:04:30.000
base and bind to something that
has an empty orbital.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.666
And if that something that has
an empty orbital also has a

00:04:34.666 --> 00:04:39.660
filled orbital that matches the
symmetry of the LUMO of carbon

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.409
monoxide, then you get the
possibility for multiple bonding

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:49.239
between the carbon of the CO
molecule and that other entity.

00:04:49.239 --> 00:04:53.415
And we will see that that other
entity may, in fact,

00:04:53.415 --> 00:04:58.000
be a d-block transition
element, such as iron.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.034
And what I wanted to do was to
go ahead and show you that the

00:05:03.034 --> 00:05:06.727
LUMO is an interesting and
unsymmetrical one,

00:05:06.727 --> 00:05:10.000
as well.
Let's take a look at that.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.608
And so, in this picture I have
gone ahead and included a little

00:05:21.608 --> 00:05:24.751
ball and stick diagram
underneath the representation of

00:05:24.751 --> 00:05:26.904
the orbital lobes.
Here is the carbon,

00:05:26.904 --> 00:05:31.219
and the oxygen is colored red.
And you can see that the lobes

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:35.214
on the LUMO, the lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital in

00:05:35.214 --> 00:05:39.357
this system, are also large on
carbon relative to oxygen.

00:05:39.357 --> 00:05:43.205
The same as we had found for
the highest occupied MO.

00:05:43.205 --> 00:05:47.496
What this means is that that
carbon atom in the CO molecule

00:05:47.496 --> 00:05:50.751
is simultaneously a base in the
sigma system.

00:05:50.751 --> 00:05:55.116
And because this is our lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital,

00:05:55.116 --> 00:06:00.000
our carbon atom is actually an
acid in the pi system.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.637
And that makes it
electronically very

00:06:02.637 --> 00:06:06.741
complimentary to d-block
elements, as we will see when we

00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:10.698
get into the chemistry of
elements that do have valence

00:06:10.698 --> 00:06:14.948
d-orbitals in addition to s and
p, coming up in a couple of

00:06:14.948 --> 00:06:17.879
lectures.
And so what can happen is that,

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:21.396
let's say that a carbon
monoxide molecule somehow

00:06:21.396 --> 00:06:24.913
erroneously finds its way into
your blood stream,

00:06:24.913 --> 00:06:29.017
you have there hemoglobin,
the iron atom at the center of

00:06:29.017 --> 00:06:34.000
which acts reversibly to bind
the dioxygen molecule.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.725
But it irreversibly binds to
the carbon monoxide molecule

00:06:37.725 --> 00:06:41.318
because the iron center,
which is sitting at the center

00:06:41.318 --> 00:06:45.177
of a heme unit that I mentioned,
and we will talk about the

00:06:45.177 --> 00:06:49.235
structure of hemoglobin and the
way that it functions a little

00:06:49.235 --> 00:06:51.497
bit later.
But if CO gets in there,

00:06:51.497 --> 00:06:55.290
it binds to the iron through
the HOMO, acting as a base to

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.550
the metal acting as a sigma
acid, and also through

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.808
d-electrons being able to act as
a pi base from the metal binding

00:07:02.808 --> 00:07:07.000
with this LUMO of the carbon
monoxide molecule.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.250
And this LUMO is doubly
degenerate.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.625
That means there are two of
them at the same energy.

00:07:12.625 --> 00:07:16.330
And we will come back to this
issue of orbital degeneracy

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.904
later in today's lecture,
but that electronic asymmetry

00:07:19.904 --> 00:07:24.007
of carbon monoxide and the fact
that the HOMO and LUMO are both

00:07:24.007 --> 00:07:27.845
centered on the carbon end of
the molecule are what make CO

00:07:27.845 --> 00:07:31.816
such an interesting molecule and
such a reactive molecule and

00:07:31.816 --> 00:07:36.410
therefore a poison.
And so now let us please go

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:39.000
back to the document camera.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.315
What I have shown here are the
five platonic solids.

00:07:49.315 --> 00:07:53.084
Actually, I spent a lot of time
over the weekend practicing

00:07:53.084 --> 00:07:56.985
drawing these on the chalkboard
so that I would be able to do

00:07:56.985 --> 00:08:00.957
that very nicely for you.
And here it comes that we do

00:08:00.957 --> 00:08:05.012
not have that option today,
so I will show them to you this

00:08:05.012 --> 00:08:07.459
way.
And the platonic solids are the

00:08:07.459 --> 00:08:11.025
five regular polyhedra.
And that means that they are

00:08:11.025 --> 00:08:13.472
polyhedra that have,
as their faces,

00:08:13.472 --> 00:08:16.199
regular polygons that are all
identical.

00:08:16.199 --> 00:08:20.114
And the reason I am bringing
this up today is that we had

00:08:20.114 --> 00:08:24.169
talked about issues of symmetry
with reference to molecular

00:08:24.169 --> 00:08:27.245
orbital theory.
And these are all very highly

00:08:27.245 --> 00:08:29.972
symmetric shapes,
as you can immediately

00:08:29.972 --> 00:08:34.196
recognize.
The buckyball that we looked at

00:08:34.196 --> 00:08:38.590
earlier is not here because it
has both five-membered rings and

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:42.984
six-membered rings on the faces.
And so it doesn't have all the

00:08:42.984 --> 00:08:46.244
faces identical.
And those that do have all the

00:08:46.244 --> 00:08:49.007
faces identical are the platonic
solids.

00:08:49.007 --> 00:08:52.125
And the complete list of those
is shown here.

00:08:52.125 --> 00:08:55.173
With triangles,
you can put four equilateral

00:08:55.173 --> 00:08:59.000
triangles together to make a
tetrahedron.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.035
There is actually a journal
called Tetrahedron.

00:09:02.035 --> 00:09:05.402
And there is another one called
Tetrahedron Letters.

00:09:05.402 --> 00:09:08.768
And there is another one called
Tetrahedron Reports.

00:09:08.768 --> 00:09:12.464
And the reason is that organic
chemistry is carbon-based,

00:09:12.464 --> 00:09:16.094
and carbon so often gets
involved in forming tetrahedra.

00:09:16.094 --> 00:09:19.988
And so the tetrahedron is a
very important symbol of organic

00:09:19.988 --> 00:09:22.562
chemistry.
And we will get back to that.

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:25.730
And with triangles,
if instead of putting four of

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:28.634
them together,
you put eight of them together

00:09:28.634 --> 00:09:32.000
this way, you get the
octahedron.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.042
And the octahedron is equally
important as a symbol for

00:09:36.042 --> 00:09:39.860
inorganic chemistry.
And the reason for that is that

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:44.128
when we have metal ions in
solution, they often sit at the

00:09:44.128 --> 00:09:48.245
center of a coordination
octahedron in which six ligands

00:09:48.245 --> 00:09:52.288
bind to that metal center.
And we are going to get into

00:09:52.288 --> 00:09:56.406
how that was discovered pretty
shortly by Alfred Werner,

00:09:56.406 --> 00:10:00.000
another Nobel laureate in
chemistry.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.068
And with triangles you can also
make the icosahedron shown here,

00:10:05.068 --> 00:10:08.609
and this has 20 faces.
And the icosahedron is

00:10:08.609 --> 00:10:12.149
important in chemistry.
And certain elements,

00:10:12.149 --> 00:10:16.091
for example boron,
actually have structures in the

00:10:16.091 --> 00:10:20.517
solid state in which the boron
atoms are arranged at the

00:10:20.517 --> 00:10:23.172
vertices of a regular
icosahedron.

00:10:23.172 --> 00:10:28.000
So this is a chemically
important shape as well.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.686
And if you go from triangles to
squares you can,

00:10:31.686 --> 00:10:35.843
of course, make a cube.
And probably the most familiar

00:10:35.843 --> 00:10:39.764
of a platonic solid to us.
And then, if we go up to

00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:43.921
pentagons and put those
together, as you can see here,

00:10:43.921 --> 00:10:47.764
we can put 12 pentagons
together in a regular way,

00:10:47.764 --> 00:10:52.392
that gives rise to what we call
the pentagonal dodecahedron.

00:10:52.392 --> 00:10:57.176
And you can imagine that each
of these vertices could be a C-H

00:10:57.176 --> 00:11:02.062
unit, carbon-hydrogen.
And then each carbon would have

00:11:02.062 --> 00:11:05.986
its valence of four satisfied.
And there would be all single

00:11:05.986 --> 00:11:08.980
bonds at the parameter of this
round molecule.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.840
And, in fact,
that dodecahedron molecule was

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.498
the objective of organic
synthesis for quite a long time

00:11:15.498 --> 00:11:18.957
before it was finally
successfully synthesized by Leo

00:11:18.957 --> 00:11:21.618
Paquette.
You would be surprised with the

00:11:21.618 --> 00:11:24.944
kinds of challenges,
maybe, sometimes that do drive

00:11:24.944 --> 00:11:28.403
chemists to do what they do.
And that is the platonic

00:11:28.403 --> 00:11:32.251
solids.
I am going to be focusing our

00:11:32.251 --> 00:11:36.133
attention on methane.
And, if I could have the side

00:11:36.133 --> 00:11:39.393
board go back to the computer
for a moment,

00:11:39.393 --> 00:11:43.353
that would be great.
These are the notes for today's

00:11:43.353 --> 00:11:48.011
lecture that I wrote up this
morning that you will be able to

00:11:48.011 --> 00:11:51.582
download later today,
or maybe you already can.

00:11:51.582 --> 00:11:53.600
I don't know.
In any event,

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.948
when we approach the methane
problem in molecular orbital

00:11:57.948 --> 00:12:02.451
theory, what we do is recognize
that the tetrahedron can be

00:12:02.451 --> 00:12:06.876
conveniently inscribed into a
cube by placing hydrogens at

00:12:06.876 --> 00:12:12.000
alternating corners of the cube,
as shown here.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.222
And then, when we do that,
the carbon atom of the methane

00:12:16.222 --> 00:12:19.615
molecule lies at the very center
of this cube.

00:12:19.615 --> 00:12:24.138
And this way of arranging the
system in space will help us to

00:12:24.138 --> 00:12:28.511
simplify the problem of the
molecular orbital energy levels

00:12:28.511 --> 00:12:32.434
for the methane molecule.
And we are going to be

00:12:32.434 --> 00:12:35.956
ultimately working toward a
comparison of the molecular

00:12:35.956 --> 00:12:39.347
orbital description of the
methane molecule with that

00:12:39.347 --> 00:12:43.391
afforded by valance bond theory.
Now, some of you approached me

00:12:43.391 --> 00:12:46.586
after lecture last time and
said, what happened to

00:12:46.586 --> 00:12:49.195
hybridization?
And, if you wanted to talk

00:12:49.195 --> 00:12:52.978
about the methane molecule and
the language of valence bond

00:12:52.978 --> 00:12:57.086
theory, you would say that this
carbon atom is sp three

00:12:57.086 --> 00:13:00.934
hybridized in order that it may
form simultaneously four two

00:13:00.934 --> 00:13:04.391
electron bonds between the
central carbon and the four

00:13:04.391 --> 00:13:09.209
peripheral hydrogens.
Well, where hybridization went

00:13:09.209 --> 00:13:12.303
is that it stayed with valence
bond theory.

00:13:12.303 --> 00:13:15.617
Let me reemphasize the
distinction between the

00:13:15.617 --> 00:13:20.184
molecular orbital treatment of
molecule electronic structure as

00:13:20.184 --> 00:13:24.677
contrasted with the valence bond
theory in which hybridization

00:13:24.677 --> 00:13:27.844
plays a role.
It does not play a role in the

00:13:27.844 --> 00:13:31.379
language of MO theory,
so please keep those quite

00:13:31.379 --> 00:13:35.125
distinct.
Now, we need to choose a

00:13:35.125 --> 00:13:38.047
coordinate system for our
problem.

00:13:38.047 --> 00:13:43.273
And I won't spend too much time
discussing how we choose the

00:13:43.273 --> 00:13:47.346
coordinate system,
but what we have done in the

00:13:47.346 --> 00:13:51.243
present case with methane is to
choose the x,

00:13:51.243 --> 00:13:57.000
y, and z axes each to come out
of the faces of the cube.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.319
And we do this because that
choice of coordinate system will

00:14:02.319 --> 00:14:06.196
lead to the equivalence of the
carbons' 2px,

00:14:06.196 --> 00:14:09.172
2py, and 2pz orbitals in 3D
space.

00:14:09.172 --> 00:14:13.229
We could choose a different
coordinate system,

00:14:13.229 --> 00:14:17.377
and that would make the problem
more difficult.

00:14:17.377 --> 00:14:22.967
So, what we have done is chosen
a convenient set of coordinates

00:14:22.967 --> 00:14:27.114
where the x, y,
and z axes each come out of the

00:14:27.114 --> 00:14:31.771
faces of our cube.
Now, we recognize that the

00:14:31.771 --> 00:14:34.496
methane problem,
like the homonuclear and

00:14:34.496 --> 00:14:38.585
heteronuclear diatomic molecule
problems we talked about last

00:14:38.585 --> 00:14:40.833
time, is an eight orbital
problem.

00:14:40.833 --> 00:14:44.989
The diatomics N two and
CO each had ten electrons to go

00:14:44.989 --> 00:14:47.374
into their eight molecular
orbitals.

00:14:47.374 --> 00:14:50.577
And here, with methane,
we have eight electrons,

00:14:50.577 --> 00:14:54.597
four coming in as the valence
orbitals from the carbon atom,

00:14:54.597 --> 00:14:57.731
valence electrons from the
carbon atom, rather,

00:14:57.731 --> 00:15:01.683
and four coming in as the four
valence 1s electrons for the

00:15:01.683 --> 00:15:06.022
four hydrogens.
And our eight orbitals are the

00:15:06.022 --> 00:15:08.584
carbons 2s, 2px,
2py, and 2pz orbitals.

00:15:08.584 --> 00:15:12.561
And we have four more orbitals,
the 1s from each of the four

00:15:12.561 --> 00:15:15.258
hydrogens.
We know how many electrons are

00:15:15.258 --> 00:15:18.966
going to be able to go into our
MO energy level diagram.

00:15:18.966 --> 00:15:22.741
We know how many MOs we are
going to have because we know

00:15:22.741 --> 00:15:26.719
how many valance AOs we have.
And those numbers are equal at

00:15:26.719 --> 00:15:30.301
eight.
The choice of this problem is

00:15:30.301 --> 00:15:35.301
predicated on my desire to show
you how things progress as we go

00:15:35.301 --> 00:15:40.301
from a planar system to a linear
system to now a system that has

00:15:40.301 --> 00:15:45.222
molecular orbitals that stretch
out in three-dimensional space.

00:15:45.222 --> 00:15:49.031
Now, we are going to take the
following approach.

00:15:49.031 --> 00:15:52.682
We are going to say,
how can we generate linear

00:15:52.682 --> 00:15:56.968
combinations of the four
hydrogen 1s orbitals that will

00:15:56.968 --> 00:16:01.412
be so constructed as to match
the nodal properties of the

00:16:01.412 --> 00:16:06.095
carbon atomic orbitals that are
the valence orbitals of that

00:16:06.095 --> 00:16:08.495
carbon?
Okay.

00:16:08.495 --> 00:16:12.954
So that is our goal,
and that is our strategy.

00:16:12.954 --> 00:16:17.315
And let me say also,
that in this tetrahedral

00:16:17.315 --> 00:16:23.459
symmetry, you can recognize that
you cannot distinguish any one

00:16:23.459 --> 00:16:28.513
of the four vertices of a
tetrahedron from the other

00:16:28.513 --> 00:16:31.771
three.
And that is important.

00:16:31.771 --> 00:16:36.361
And that is also true from the
way that we have decided to

00:16:36.361 --> 00:16:40.789
situate the hydrogen nuclei on
this cube relative to our

00:16:40.789 --> 00:16:43.446
coordinate system.
In other words,

00:16:43.446 --> 00:16:47.553
none of these four hydrogens
lie on any of the three

00:16:47.553 --> 00:16:51.096
Cartesian axes.
And their relationship to the

00:16:51.096 --> 00:16:55.363
coordinate system and to the
shape of the cube each is

00:16:55.363 --> 00:17:01.000
indistinguishable from that of
the other three hydrogens.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.972
And that is an important aspect
of the way that we set up the

00:17:04.972 --> 00:17:07.223
problem.
And why do I mention that?

00:17:07.223 --> 00:17:10.997
Because I mentioned that when
constructing MOs in general,

00:17:10.997 --> 00:17:15.102
one of the first things you can
do, if you are going to be able

00:17:15.102 --> 00:17:19.141
to take advantage of symmetry to
help you solve the problem of

00:17:19.141 --> 00:17:23.246
these MO energy levels and how
they are constructed from linear

00:17:23.246 --> 00:17:27.351
combinations of atomic orbitals
is to identify symmetry-related

00:17:27.351 --> 00:17:32.203
sets of atoms in orbitals.
If you are keeping that in

00:17:32.203 --> 00:17:37.372
mind, you will realize that we
are treating all four hydrogens

00:17:37.372 --> 00:17:41.694
together because they are
indistinguishable from one

00:17:41.694 --> 00:17:46.440
another in the tetrahedral shape
of the methane molecule.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:50.677
So, that is important.
If we had a more complicated

00:17:50.677 --> 00:17:55.000
molecule, such as if we were
looking at --

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.597
I get to use a little bit of
board space today.

00:17:58.597 --> 00:18:02.194
Here is a slightly more
complicated hydrocarbon

00:18:02.194 --> 00:18:04.696
molecule.
Here is a slightly more

00:18:04.696 --> 00:18:07.199
complicated hydrocarbon
molecule.

00:18:07.199 --> 00:18:11.734
And in a molecule like this,
this is cyclohexane drawn in a

00:18:11.734 --> 00:18:15.488
chair confirmation.
Sir Derek Barton actually was

00:18:15.488 --> 00:18:19.398
the Nobel laureate who got his
prize for discussing

00:18:19.398 --> 00:18:22.369
conformational aspects of
hydrocarbons.

00:18:22.369 --> 00:18:26.201
We would find that the
hydrogens split up into two

00:18:26.201 --> 00:18:30.084
sets.
They are not all equivalent in

00:18:30.084 --> 00:18:34.322
the cyclohexane molecule in this
frozen out chair confirmation

00:18:34.322 --> 00:18:38.698
because we have one type that is
equatorial and one type that is

00:18:38.698 --> 00:18:42.172
axial on each of these carbons
as we go around this

00:18:42.172 --> 00:18:45.576
six-membered ring.
And so there are different sets

00:18:45.576 --> 00:18:48.286
that you would have to treat
separately.

00:18:48.286 --> 00:18:50.440
But methane is more
symmetrical.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:54.608
And all four hydrogens in the
methane molecule are identical,

00:18:54.608 --> 00:18:58.429
so we are going to treat them
together in developing our

00:18:58.429 --> 00:19:02.691
linear combinations.
And, coming back to this,

00:19:02.691 --> 00:19:06.278
what we are going to do,
once again, to generate these

00:19:06.278 --> 00:19:10.000
things, is to imagine the
central atom atomic orbital as

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.857
growing out in space out to
where the hydrogen nuclei are.

00:19:13.857 --> 00:19:17.781
And then we are going to take
the sign of the wave function

00:19:17.781 --> 00:19:21.977
that we find out there and apply
it to those hydrogens that are

00:19:21.977 --> 00:19:26.105
out there in space in order to
see what our linear combination

00:19:26.105 --> 00:19:29.814
must look like.
If you imagine the carbon 2s

00:19:29.814 --> 00:19:32.535
orbital, which has the same
sign, positive,

00:19:32.535 --> 00:19:35.775
everywhere, and imagine it
growing out to where the

00:19:35.775 --> 00:19:38.173
hydrogens are,
and we are labeling the

00:19:38.173 --> 00:19:40.635
hydrogen A, B,
C, and D, as shown here.

00:19:40.635 --> 00:19:44.264
And we will keep that same
labeling scheme throughout the

00:19:44.264 --> 00:19:47.957
development of this problem.
You would see that the carbon

00:19:47.957 --> 00:19:51.651
2s positive wave function,
as we imagine it growing out to

00:19:51.651 --> 00:19:54.826
where the hydrogens are,
would touch each of these

00:19:54.826 --> 00:19:58.455
hydrogens at the same time.
And, thus, we confer the sign

00:19:58.455 --> 00:20:02.084
positive on all four of the
contributors to this first of

00:20:02.084 --> 00:20:07.452
our linear combinations.
And what that will represent is

00:20:07.452 --> 00:20:12.041
simultaneous bonding of the
carbon 2s orbital with all four

00:20:12.041 --> 00:20:15.443
hydrogens and with the same sign
everywhere.

00:20:15.443 --> 00:20:19.873
And so, we can write down
one-half A plus B plus C plus D,

00:20:19.873 --> 00:20:23.829
where I am using A here to

00:20:23.829 --> 00:20:28.338
represent the hydrogen 1s
orbital associated with hydrogen

00:20:28.338 --> 00:20:32.143
labeled A.
So I have just abbreviated that

00:20:32.143 --> 00:20:33.525
in A.
And, similarly,

00:20:33.525 --> 00:20:37.535
B is the hydrogen 1s orbital
associated with hydrogen B and

00:20:37.535 --> 00:20:39.333
so on.
So, this is a linear

00:20:39.333 --> 00:20:42.306
combination of these four
hydrogen orbitals.

00:20:42.306 --> 00:20:44.933
And it is normalized with a
half, here.

00:20:44.933 --> 00:20:48.459
And we have the same
coefficient on each of the four

00:20:48.459 --> 00:20:52.676
hydrogens, so the size of the
lobe that you would draw at each

00:20:52.676 --> 00:20:55.511
four of these positions would be
the same.

00:20:55.511 --> 00:20:59.627
That is number one.
We have built a linear

00:20:59.627 --> 00:21:03.845
combination based on the nodal
properties of the carbon 2s

00:21:03.845 --> 00:21:06.953
atomic orbital.
And now, let's do two more.

00:21:06.953 --> 00:21:11.393
And we are going to base these
on the nodal properties of the

00:21:11.393 --> 00:21:15.906
central carbon 2px orbital and
the central carbon 2py orbital.

00:21:15.906 --> 00:21:19.976
I am using the same coordinate
system as I started with,

00:21:19.976 --> 00:21:24.120
namely, that the positive
x-axis comes out of the face of

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:28.412
the cube and comes toward us,
and the positive y-axis comes

00:21:28.412 --> 00:21:33.000
out of this face of the cube and
goes that way.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.614
And we will look at z in a
moment.

00:21:35.614 --> 00:21:40.368
That one is going straight up
out of the top face of the cube

00:21:40.368 --> 00:21:44.012
for positive z.
What you can see is that if you

00:21:44.012 --> 00:21:48.687
imagine the carbon 2px atomic
orbital as just growing out to

00:21:48.687 --> 00:21:53.361
where the four hydrogens are,
we will see that the hydrogens

00:21:53.361 --> 00:21:57.798
in positions A and B will
experience the positive lobe of

00:21:57.798 --> 00:22:02.631
the carbon 2px orbital at the
same moment as the two hydrogens

00:22:02.631 --> 00:22:06.910
in back labeled C and D
experience the negative lobe of

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:12.597
the carbon 2px orbital.
And so, we give positive phase

00:22:12.597 --> 00:22:16.060
to A and B and negative phase to
C and D.

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:20.995
And we give them the same
coefficient everywhere such that

00:22:20.995 --> 00:22:25.930
this linear combination is
normalized as one-half A plus B

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:30.000
minus C minus D.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.559
That is our second linear
combination of hydrogen

00:22:33.559 --> 00:22:36.006
orbitals.
And this one has been so

00:22:36.006 --> 00:22:40.233
generated as to match the nodal
property of the carbon 2px

00:22:40.233 --> 00:22:44.459
orbital, the key feature of
which is that it is everywhere

00:22:44.459 --> 00:22:48.686
positive along positive x,
and everywhere along negative x

00:22:48.686 --> 00:22:51.949
it is negative.
And the 2py orbital of carbon

00:22:51.949 --> 00:22:56.546
has the property that everywhere
in the plus y region of space,

00:22:56.546 --> 00:22:59.364
it is positive,
so that C and B will be

00:22:59.364 --> 00:23:05.000
associated with a positive sign
for this linear combination.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.389
And the 2py orbital is negative
everywhere along negative y,

00:23:09.389 --> 00:23:12.291
back here.
And that is where hydrogens A

00:23:12.291 --> 00:23:15.416
and D are located.
So, A and D will carry a

00:23:15.416 --> 00:23:18.764
negative sign for this new
linear combination,

00:23:18.764 --> 00:23:22.485
which is one-half of minus A
plus B plus C minus D.

00:23:22.485 --> 00:23:26.949
This is just one way
of writing down

00:23:26.949 --> 00:23:32.545
the picture that we see here.
And there is only one left to

00:23:32.545 --> 00:23:37.372
be generated from the nodal
properties of the carbon 2pz

00:23:37.372 --> 00:23:42.726
orbital, which has its positive
node oriented along positive z

00:23:42.726 --> 00:23:46.851
and its negative lobe oriented
along negative z,

00:23:46.851 --> 00:23:50.625
and it has the x,y-plane as a
nodal surface.

00:23:50.625 --> 00:23:54.837
And so, therefore,
hydrogens A and C will carry a

00:23:54.837 --> 00:24:00.279
positive sign because they are
oriented and located in the plus

00:24:00.279 --> 00:24:05.219
z region of space.
Whereas, hydrogens B and D are

00:24:05.219 --> 00:24:09.805
located in the negative z region
of space, so they will carry a

00:24:09.805 --> 00:24:13.060
negative sign.
And that one can be normalized

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:16.684
also with a normalization
coefficient of one-half.

00:24:16.684 --> 00:24:19.421
And so it is A minus B plus C
minus D.

00:24:19.421 --> 00:24:23.638
And just don't forget 
that these letters

00:24:23.638 --> 00:24:27.558
refer to the 1s orbitals
associated with the hydrogens

00:24:27.558 --> 00:24:32.539
that are so labeled.
And we started with identifying

00:24:32.539 --> 00:24:37.045
the fact that the four hydrogens
in this problem are all

00:24:37.045 --> 00:24:40.240
equivalent.
And, thus, their 1s orbitals

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:44.008
are all equivalent,
indistinguishable from each

00:24:44.008 --> 00:24:47.858
other with respect to their
spatial orientation.

00:24:47.858 --> 00:24:51.709
And, so we took four atomic
orbitals, and we are

00:24:51.709 --> 00:24:56.214
constructing from them four
linear combinations of those

00:24:56.214 --> 00:25:01.453
four atomic orbitals.
I want to emphasize what I have

00:25:01.453 --> 00:25:04.224
written here,
which is that with the

00:25:04.224 --> 00:25:08.973
coordinate system we have chosen
and in this high tetrahedral

00:25:08.973 --> 00:25:13.564
symmetry, the carbons 2p x,
y and z orbitals are identical.

00:25:13.564 --> 00:25:17.839
And, just like in a carbon atom
floating free in space,

00:25:17.839 --> 00:25:21.717
they are degenerate.
That means they have the same

00:25:21.717 --> 00:25:24.250
energy.
And so we will talk about

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:29.000
orbitals in atoms being
degenerate in a moment.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.023
But we find that the 2p x,
y and z orbitals on that carbon

00:25:33.023 --> 00:25:37.117
are going to have the same
energy, and they are degenerate.

00:25:37.117 --> 00:25:41.000
And the molecular orbitals
constructed from them in this

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.247
tetrahedral system will have the
same property.

00:25:44.247 --> 00:25:47.423
They will be degenerate.
So, something that is

00:25:47.423 --> 00:25:51.376
occasionally associated with
high symmetry is multiple MO

00:25:51.376 --> 00:25:55.274
degeneracy.
Next, knowing what our carbon

00:25:55.274 --> 00:25:59.509
atom atomic orbitals are and
knowing also what our four

00:25:59.509 --> 00:26:03.509
linear combinations are of the
hydrogen 1s orbitals,

00:26:03.509 --> 00:26:07.901
we can now allow them to
interact in ways that are either

00:26:07.901 --> 00:26:11.117
bonding or antibonding.
And they interact,

00:26:11.117 --> 00:26:14.725
of course, according to their
nodal properties.

00:26:14.725 --> 00:26:19.431
Those linear combinations that
have the same nodal properties

00:26:19.431 --> 00:26:23.823
as a particular carbon atom
atomic orbital will lead to a

00:26:23.823 --> 00:26:29.000
bonding interaction and an
antibonding interaction.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.222
And we have an eight orbital
problem, so we better see eight

00:26:33.222 --> 00:26:37.515
energy levels appearing in our
molecular orbital energy level

00:26:37.515 --> 00:26:39.877
diagram for this methane
molecule.

00:26:39.877 --> 00:26:43.812
And, when we go down here,
starting at the lowest energy

00:26:43.812 --> 00:26:46.675
molecular orbital,
we find that it can be

00:26:46.675 --> 00:26:49.966
constructed by adding to the
carbon 2s orbital,

00:26:49.966 --> 00:26:53.044
which is, once again,
spherically symmetric,

00:26:53.044 --> 00:26:57.552
this linear combination that is
A plus B plus C plus D.

00:26:57.552 --> 00:27:00.056
And we can draw this with a

00:27:00.056 --> 00:27:03.563
surface like this,
which envelopes all five of our

00:27:03.563 --> 00:27:08.000
nuclei which has the same sign
everywhere.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.637
And so our lowest lying
molecular orbital,

00:27:10.637 --> 00:27:14.368
our most bonding molecular
orbital, our most stabilized MO,

00:27:14.368 --> 00:27:17.906
which can house a pair of
electrons because it is singly

00:27:17.906 --> 00:27:21.315
degenerate, is one that will
look something like this.

00:27:21.315 --> 00:27:23.567
It envelopes all five of our
nuclei.

00:27:23.567 --> 00:27:26.204
And, effectively,
the pair of electrons is

00:27:26.204 --> 00:27:30.000
associated simultaneously with
all five nuclei.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.724
And the wave function has the
same sign everywhere,

00:27:33.724 --> 00:27:38.119
just like the carbon 2s orbital
from which this is partially

00:27:38.119 --> 00:27:41.471
constructed does.
And then, next we have three

00:27:41.471 --> 00:27:45.643
molecular orbitals that are each
built by forming bonding

00:27:45.643 --> 00:27:48.995
interactions with the carbon's
p-orbitals, px,

00:27:48.995 --> 00:27:53.092
py, and pz with the linear
combination that matches that

00:27:53.092 --> 00:27:56.593
carbon orbital in terms of the
nodal properties.

00:27:56.593 --> 00:28:00.616
And we built them that way so
that becomes particularly

00:28:00.616 --> 00:28:04.923
straightforward.
This one here is coming out,

00:28:04.923 --> 00:28:07.190
the face that points to the
right.

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:11.175
And so you can see that this
one is based on the carbon 2py

00:28:11.175 --> 00:28:13.854
orbital.
And, if that carbon 2py orbital

00:28:13.854 --> 00:28:18.114
makes a bonding interaction with
the linear combination denoted

00:28:18.114 --> 00:28:21.618
as minus A plus B plus 
C minus D,

00:28:21.618 --> 00:28:25.671
the bonding interaction here is
signified by this plus sign.

00:28:25.671 --> 00:28:30.000
So, we have a plus sign here
and a plus sign here.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.656
And, thus, we have a molecular
orbital that has the same nodal

00:28:34.656 --> 00:28:37.633
properties as a carbon 2py
orbital does,

00:28:37.633 --> 00:28:41.984
which means that the x,z-plane
is a nodal surface for this

00:28:41.984 --> 00:28:45.648
molecular orbital.
And what it looks like is kind

00:28:45.648 --> 00:28:49.847
of a two-bladed propeller.
You have a plus phase that is

00:28:49.847 --> 00:28:54.580
distributed, enveloping the two
hydrogens that we labeled B and

00:28:54.580 --> 00:29:00.000
C, along with that positive lobe
of the carbon 2py orbital.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.869
So that you have that forming
one blade of our two-bladed

00:29:04.869 --> 00:29:08.173
propeller.
And the blade with the other

00:29:08.173 --> 00:29:12.608
sign is rotated relative to the
first by 45 degrees.

00:29:12.608 --> 00:29:16.956
Sorry, by 90 degrees,
in fact, and will involve the

00:29:16.956 --> 00:29:21.739
distribution of bonding
character over carbon's negative

00:29:21.739 --> 00:29:26.521
2py lobe interacting with these
two hydrogens back here,

00:29:26.521 --> 00:29:32.127
which are hydrogens A and D.
And so we will visualize these

00:29:32.127 --> 00:29:34.609
in a moment to make that more
clear.

00:29:34.609 --> 00:29:37.659
But these three bonds,
one oriented along x,

00:29:37.659 --> 00:29:41.134
one oriented along y,
and one oriented along z all

00:29:41.134 --> 00:29:44.468
look exactly like this.
They are just rotated 90

00:29:44.468 --> 00:29:47.801
degrees to each other in space,
just like the x,

00:29:47.801 --> 00:29:51.914
y, and z Cartesian axes are.
I have only drawn one of them,

00:29:51.914 --> 00:29:55.744
but we have three of them
because there is a three-fold

00:29:55.744 --> 00:30:00.000
orbital degeneracy in this
molecular orbital.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.330
So, singly degenerate and then
triply degenerate.

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:07.008
And then, as we go up in
energy, we will find that our

00:30:07.008 --> 00:30:10.616
lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital is constructed by

00:30:10.616 --> 00:30:13.114
subtracting.
It is the same as I have

00:30:13.114 --> 00:30:15.542
written here,
but with a minus sign,

00:30:15.542 --> 00:30:19.567
the C 2s subtracting A plus B
plus C plus D.

00:30:19.567 --> 00:30:21.787
A, B, C and D hydrogens all

00:30:21.787 --> 00:30:25.604
have the same sign to their wave
function as each other,

00:30:25.604 --> 00:30:29.697
but they have the opposite sign
as the contribution from the

00:30:29.697 --> 00:30:34.000
carbon 2s orbital to this
molecular orbital.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.886
And what that results in,
as I have tried to indicate

00:30:37.886 --> 00:30:41.922
with some red dashes here,
is that you generate a nodal

00:30:41.922 --> 00:30:46.481
surface in between the carbon
and hydrogen nuclei that will go

00:30:46.481 --> 00:30:50.742
completely around and will
intersect perpendicular to each

00:30:50.742 --> 00:30:54.180
of these carbon-hydrogen
inter-nuclear vectors.

00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:58.664
You have a change of sign as
you are traversing the path from

00:30:58.664 --> 00:31:03.000
carbon to any one of the four
hydrogen nuclei.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.917
And that is what we get by just
reversing the sign relative to

00:31:06.917 --> 00:31:09.422
the bonding counterpart of that
orbital.

00:31:09.422 --> 00:31:11.733
And that makes this one
anti-bonding.

00:31:11.733 --> 00:31:15.137
We will give it an asterisk
here to denote antibonding

00:31:15.137 --> 00:31:17.385
character to this molecular
orbital.

00:31:17.385 --> 00:31:21.174
And now, ascending in energy,
we will find that for each one

00:31:21.174 --> 00:31:25.220
of these orbitals that is bonded
and oriented with respect to x,

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:28.431
y or z in Cartesian space,
we find that there is an

00:31:28.431 --> 00:31:32.923
antibonding counterpart.
Again, what we are doing is

00:31:32.923 --> 00:31:36.557
taking, for example,
carbons 2py and subtracting the

00:31:36.557 --> 00:31:40.191
linear combination that
corresponds to carbon 2py in

00:31:40.191 --> 00:31:42.899
terms of its nodal symmetry
properties.

00:31:42.899 --> 00:31:47.388
We are subtracting minus A plus
B plus C minus D.

00:31:47.388 --> 00:31:49.597
The carbon 2py has the same

00:31:49.597 --> 00:31:53.302
plus, its positive lobe is
oriented along positive y,

00:31:53.302 --> 00:31:57.007
just as it is down here,
but now we have reversed the

00:31:57.007 --> 00:32:02.607
sign of the four hydrogens.
And what this introduces will

00:32:02.607 --> 00:32:07.822
be antibonding nodal surfaces in
between the carbon and the

00:32:07.822 --> 00:32:11.509
hydrogens.
And they are strong antibonding

00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:16.455
interactions because of the good
directional overlap of,

00:32:16.455 --> 00:32:20.771
say, the positive lobe of
carbon's 2py with these

00:32:20.771 --> 00:32:26.346
s-orbital contributions in the
negative from hydrogens C and B,

00:32:26.346 --> 00:32:28.054
here.
And back here,

00:32:28.054 --> 00:32:33.000
A and D rotated,
of course, by 90 degrees.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.213
One of the points that I was
illustrating last time and

00:32:37.213 --> 00:32:41.583
really trying to emphasize in
the context of MO theory is

00:32:41.583 --> 00:32:45.329
that, in general,
we expect orbitals to be higher

00:32:45.329 --> 00:32:48.919
in energy if they have more
internuclear nodes.

00:32:48.919 --> 00:32:53.757
And the energy of the orbitals
is also affected by which atomic

00:32:53.757 --> 00:32:58.439
orbitals are close to the MO in
energy and also by factors of

00:32:58.439 --> 00:33:01.120
overlap.
And normally,

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:04.310
for example,
a sigma bond is typically

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:09.482
associated with greater overlap
than a pi bond because of the

00:33:09.482 --> 00:33:13.879
directionality of the overlap.
And here, you have an

00:33:13.879 --> 00:33:17.672
interesting case,
where this p-orbital is not

00:33:17.672 --> 00:33:23.017
directed right at the hydrogen.
And it is not a pi bond either.

00:33:23.017 --> 00:33:27.844
It is something in between sort
of sigma and a pi type of

00:33:27.844 --> 00:33:32.168
orientation.
It is an oblique interaction of

00:33:32.168 --> 00:33:36.366
the hydrogen 1s wavefunction
with that lobe of the p-orbital.

00:33:36.366 --> 00:33:40.283
But, still, it gives rise to
very good overlap down here,

00:33:40.283 --> 00:33:44.621
and consequently a very strong
antibonding character up here in

00:33:44.621 --> 00:33:47.000
counterpart.
And, from calculation,

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.197
this is the order of the energy
levels that come out of that.

00:33:51.197 --> 00:33:55.534
And so we have only four energy
levels, two of which are triply

00:33:55.534 --> 00:33:59.312
degenerate, so we indeed have
eight wave functions that

00:33:59.312 --> 00:34:04.000
correspond to the molecular
orbitals of this system.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:25.000
Question down here?
Could you say that louder?

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.717
Why did this not have the
one-half?

00:34:26.717 --> 00:34:29.494
The one-half is missing there
because I forgot to put it

00:34:29.494 --> 00:34:32.423
there.
Yes, to be normalized it should

00:34:32.423 --> 00:34:35.237
have a one-half there.
That is right.

00:34:35.237 --> 00:34:39.380
But then there is a further
point that that brings up,

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:43.601
which is the following.
What I am implying here is that

00:34:43.601 --> 00:34:48.134
there are equal amounts of
carbon 2s in the bonding orbital

00:34:48.134 --> 00:34:51.026
and as in the antibonding
counterpart.

00:34:51.026 --> 00:34:55.560
But that need not be the case.
It could be that this is 0.6

00:34:55.560 --> 00:35:01.596
here and that this 0.4 up here.
And that is a greater level of

00:35:01.596 --> 00:35:06.355
detail than I am really
interested in going into for the

00:35:06.355 --> 00:35:09.817
purposes of this problem.
But your point,

00:35:09.817 --> 00:35:13.798
with respect to the
coefficient, is well taken.

00:35:13.798 --> 00:35:16.740
Thanks.
Christine, maybe we can fix

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:20.461
that on the one that gets posted
on the web.

00:35:20.461 --> 00:35:26.000
Let's now look at these things
using our VMD program.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000
Starting from the lowest energy
and we will work our way up.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.159
Which orbital is this?
This is a molecular orbital of

00:35:52.159 --> 00:35:54.000
the methane molecule.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.057
One way you can identify
orbitals is where they are with

00:36:04.057 --> 00:36:06.491
reference to the HOMO or the
LUMO.

00:36:06.491 --> 00:36:09.663
In this case,
the HOMO is triply degenerate.

00:36:09.663 --> 00:36:13.647
And there is one orbital lower
in energy than the HOMO.

00:36:13.647 --> 00:36:17.631
This would be then the HOMO
minus one because it is one

00:36:17.631 --> 00:36:21.540
below the HOMO in energy.
That is the one which is the

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:24.344
carbon 2s, plus A plus B plus C
plus D.

00:36:24.344 --> 00:36:27.000
That is that MO there.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:39.000
Actually, let's go ahead and
take that one away.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000
Sorry about that.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000
Let's see if you can figure out
which one this is.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.571
In order to figure out which
one it is, you need to be able

00:37:18.571 --> 00:37:23.142
to realize where the nuclei are
and where your internuclear

00:37:23.142 --> 00:37:26.216
nodes are, if any.
And, if so, how many.

00:37:26.216 --> 00:37:30.000
This is one of our hydrogen
contributions.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.957
Here is a hydrogen contribution
with opposite sign.

00:37:33.957 --> 00:37:38.627
And there is a piece of our
carbon 2p orbital in the center.

00:37:38.627 --> 00:37:43.456
Now, this is just one of three
identical counterparts that are

00:37:43.456 --> 00:37:47.730
rotated 90 degrees with respect
to each other in space,

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:51.451
so I am not going to show you
all three of them.

00:37:51.451 --> 00:37:55.646
They all look exactly the same.
Is this one bonding or

00:37:55.646 --> 00:38:00.000
antibonding?
Yeah, this one is antibonding.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.589
And it does not have the same
sign on all the hydrogens,

00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:07.440
so it has to be part of our
LUMO, which is triply degenerate

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:09.855
and involves bonding or,
in this case,

00:38:09.855 --> 00:38:13.510
the antibonding between a
carbon 2p orbital with a linear

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:17.426
combination of four hydrogens.
You can see that when you have

00:38:17.426 --> 00:38:20.885
an antibonding orbital,
you are depleting the electron

00:38:20.885 --> 00:38:25.062
density in the space between the
nuclei rather than increasing it

00:38:25.062 --> 00:38:30.520
as you do in a bonding orbital.
Let's go ahead and look at the

00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:34.888
bonding counterpart of this one.
And we will do that.

00:38:34.888 --> 00:38:38.921
And let's delete it.
One thing that you will get,

00:38:38.921 --> 00:38:43.794
if you haven't already gotten
it, is you are going to get a

00:38:43.794 --> 00:38:48.834
link to be able to download all
the files that I used to show

00:38:48.834 --> 00:38:51.859
you molecular orbitals with in
class.

00:38:51.859 --> 00:38:55.975
Because this program I am
using, this VMD program,

00:38:55.975 --> 00:39:01.415
is available on Athena.
And you can also download it

00:39:01.415 --> 00:39:06.159
yourself for free onto your own
computer if you want to.

00:39:06.159 --> 00:39:10.989
And so this is going to give
you the opportunity to study

00:39:10.989 --> 00:39:16.164
these orbitals and rotate them
around at your leisure on your

00:39:16.164 --> 00:39:19.097
desktop.
And now, let's look at the

00:39:19.097 --> 00:39:24.185
bonding counterpart to that
antibonding orbital that we just

00:39:24.185 --> 00:39:27.291
looked at.
This one is the two-bladed

00:39:27.291 --> 00:39:33.019
propeller to which I referred.
And you can see that this

00:39:33.019 --> 00:39:37.382
orbital has the same symmetry
with respect to its nodal

00:39:37.382 --> 00:39:41.906
properties as a carbon 2p
orbital because it has a single

00:39:41.906 --> 00:39:45.299
nodal plane.
And one side all the signs are

00:39:45.299 --> 00:39:49.984
positive, and on the other side
all the signs are reversed.

00:39:49.984 --> 00:39:54.751
And we have a nice piece of
bonding going on there and there

00:39:54.751 --> 00:39:59.275
when we have this oblique
interaction of one of the lobes

00:39:59.275 --> 00:40:04.041
of a p-orbital simultaneously
with two of the hydrogens that

00:40:04.041 --> 00:40:08.000
it sits directly between in
space.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.869
There is one of our triply
degenerate components of our

00:40:13.869 --> 00:40:17.565
highest occupied molecular
orbital.

00:40:17.565 --> 00:40:23.000
And then, there is just one
left to visualize.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.000
All right.
We will delete that one.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.701
We looked at our most symmetric
and most bonding molecular

00:40:53.701 --> 00:40:55.974
orbital.
And now, we are going to go

00:40:55.974 --> 00:40:59.350
ahead and look at the
antibonding counterpart of that

00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:00.000
one.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.155
And so this is clearly a
molecular orbital that is formed

00:41:17.155 --> 00:41:20.197
using some piece of the carbon
2s orbital.

00:41:20.197 --> 00:41:24.279
And you see that you get a
change in sign as you go from

00:41:24.279 --> 00:41:28.805
carbon to each of the hydrogens,
that accordingly the electron

00:41:28.805 --> 00:41:32.738
density is depleted in the
region of space between the

00:41:32.738 --> 00:41:36.377
nuclei.
And that is a characteristic of

00:41:36.377 --> 00:41:39.138
an antibonding orbital.
And this one,

00:41:39.138 --> 00:41:42.666
according to our diagram,
in fact, is the LUMO.

00:41:42.666 --> 00:41:47.268
So, as you will see over here,
that was what we predicted our

00:41:47.268 --> 00:41:51.179
lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital would look like.

00:41:51.179 --> 00:41:54.707
And then, up here,
we had our triply degenerate

00:41:54.707 --> 00:42:00.000
LUMO plus one based on the
carbon 2p orbital interactions.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.103
Now, you can see what these
four types of molecular orbital

00:42:04.103 --> 00:42:06.650
would look like.
And now, you wonder,

00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:10.330
just what kind of prediction
does this make regarding

00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:13.867
experimental observables.
And so let's look at this

00:42:13.867 --> 00:42:15.000
picture.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.000
This diagram contains a number
of interesting features.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.881
It is a diagram that plots
ionization energy here on the

00:42:34.881 --> 00:42:39.497
x-axis against a number of
different molecules on the

00:42:39.497 --> 00:42:42.603
y-axis.
At the top you have simply a

00:42:42.603 --> 00:42:46.242
neon atom.
Neon is our noble gas atom that

00:42:46.242 --> 00:42:50.857
lies just immediately to the
right of fluorine in the

00:42:50.857 --> 00:42:53.875
periodic table.
If anything is more

00:42:53.875 --> 00:43:00.000
electronegative than fluorine,
it would actually be neon.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.414
This inert gas that is
extremely difficult to ionize

00:43:04.414 --> 00:43:09.522
because it holds so tightly onto
all eight of its electrons.

00:43:09.522 --> 00:43:14.716
Does it hold equally tightly
onto all eight of its electrons?

00:43:14.716 --> 00:43:19.304
The answer is no because,
as you scroll across here in

00:43:19.304 --> 00:43:23.373
ionization energy,
you see that its 2p electrons

00:43:23.373 --> 00:43:29.000
ionize here, and its 2s
electrons ionize way over here.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.812
The type of diagram I showed
you last time,

00:43:31.812 --> 00:43:35.159
where the 2s orbital,
as you go across the periodic

00:43:35.159 --> 00:43:38.909
table, decreases in energy
faster than does the set of 2p

00:43:38.909 --> 00:43:42.457
orbitals associated with an
atom, is expressed in this

00:43:42.457 --> 00:43:44.667
diagram here because we have
neon.

00:43:44.667 --> 00:43:47.814
And then we are going across
the periodic table.

00:43:47.814 --> 00:43:51.228
This next molecule is HF,
an eight electron species,

00:43:51.228 --> 00:43:54.308
and H two O,
an eight electron species,

00:43:54.308 --> 00:43:57.656
and then NH three,
ammonia, the other eight

00:43:57.656 --> 00:44:02.209
electron species.
And then over here we get to CH

00:44:02.209 --> 00:44:05.274
four, the molecule
that we have just

00:44:05.274 --> 00:44:08.410
discussed today.
And what is very interesting

00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:12.117
here is that the ionization
energies of the molecular

00:44:12.117 --> 00:44:16.180
orbitals, in the case of the
molecules, and of the atom in

00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:18.603
the case of neon track very
nicely.

00:44:18.603 --> 00:44:22.666
Here is the molecular orbital
that has 2s character of HF,

00:44:22.666 --> 00:44:25.446
of H two O,
of NH three,

00:44:25.446 --> 00:44:29.153
and of CH four.
And it is rising in energy as

00:44:29.153 --> 00:44:34.000
we go from right to left across
the periodic table.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.952
And that is because the carbon
2s orbital is much higher than

00:44:38.952 --> 00:44:41.841
the neon 2s orbital is,
for example.

00:44:41.841 --> 00:44:46.215
And the carbon 2s orbital is
contributing to that most

00:44:46.215 --> 00:44:50.590
bonding of molecular orbitals of
the methane molecule.

00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:55.212
And then there is this manifold
here, that corresponds to

00:44:55.212 --> 00:45:00.000
ionizing an electron out of the
HOMO of methane.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.027
And it is a broadened peak
distribution here because of the

00:45:04.027 --> 00:45:08.194
different vibrational states
that the methane can be found in

00:45:08.194 --> 00:45:11.319
when, in fact,
it experiences an incoming high

00:45:11.319 --> 00:45:15.763
energy photon that is capable of
knocking the electron out of the

00:45:15.763 --> 00:45:17.986
methane molecule and ionizing
it.

00:45:17.986 --> 00:45:20.833
This is called photoelectron
spectroscopy.

00:45:20.833 --> 00:45:24.930
And you will be reading about
it also in the context of your

00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:30.000
problem set because we have a
problem that deals with this.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.479
And I point you to a piece of
your text that covers

00:45:33.479 --> 00:45:37.446
photoelectron spectroscopy.
But the key point here is that

00:45:37.446 --> 00:45:40.856
if you had all your eight
electrons at one energy,

00:45:40.856 --> 00:45:44.684
as valance bond theory might
suggest for a molecule like

00:45:44.684 --> 00:45:49.068
this, you might think you should
only see one peak in the PES of

00:45:49.068 --> 00:45:51.226
methane.
But you see two because

00:45:51.226 --> 00:45:55.471
methane, the molecule has two
molecular orbital energy levels,

00:45:55.471 --> 00:45:57.907
one of them being triply
degenerate.

00:45:57.907 --> 00:45:59.307
See you on Wednesday.
