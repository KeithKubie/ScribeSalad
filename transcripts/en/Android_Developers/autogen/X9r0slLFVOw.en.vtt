so before we get started into this
 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.950
so before we get started into this
week's topic let's talk about the news

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:05.960
week's topic let's talk about the news
 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.009
week's topic let's talk about the news
so really to two pieces of news for

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019
so really to two pieces of news for
 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.129
so really to two pieces of news for
Android developers firstly google play

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139
Android developers firstly google play
 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.230
Android developers firstly google play
services has launched we're really

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240
services has launched we're really
 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.980
services has launched we're really
excited about this it now provides the

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990
excited about this it now provides the
 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.950
excited about this it now provides the
oaths identity management or both if you

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960
oaths identity management or both if you
 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.839
oaths identity management or both if you
provide you all tokens so that you can

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849
provide you all tokens so that you can
 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.390
provide you all tokens so that you can
use a single nice API that abstracts the

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400
use a single nice API that abstracts the
 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.580
use a single nice API that abstracts the
whole our side of things for you across

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590
whole our side of things for you across
 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.790
whole our side of things for you across
all of our Google services and we also

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800
all of our Google services and we also
 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.240
all of our Google services and we also
have the Google+ SDK as part of that so

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250
have the Google+ SDK as part of that so
 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.770
have the Google+ SDK as part of that so
Google Play services is quite

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780
Google Play services is quite
 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.680
Google Play services is quite
interesting because what it is is that

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690
interesting because what it is is that
 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.930
interesting because what it is is that
the component that's actually going to

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940
the component that's actually going to
 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.500
the component that's actually going to
be there on users devices so the as part

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510
be there on users devices so the as part
 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.869
be there on users devices so the as part
of the Google Play Store the google play

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879
of the Google Play Store the google play
 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.549
of the Google Play Store the google play
services component will be installed and

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559
services component will be installed and
 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.470
services component will be installed and
now as developers you can just go ahead

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480
now as developers you can just go ahead
 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.510
now as developers you can just go ahead
and start using that new API so this is

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520
and start using that new API so this is
 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.069
and start using that new API so this is
just the start of something much bigger

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079
just the start of something much bigger
 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.090
just the start of something much bigger
Google Play services will grow and I was

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100
Google Play services will grow and I was
 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.789
Google Play services will grow and I was
two and Google+ are finally here so

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799
two and Google+ are finally here so
 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.770
two and Google+ are finally here so
that's that's really good and the other

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780
that's that's really good and the other
 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.719
that's that's really good and the other
thing I'm really excited about this is

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729
thing I'm really excited about this is
 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.050
thing I'm really excited about this is
that we have a new build system coming

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060
that we have a new build system coming
 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.380
that we have a new build system coming
for the Android developer tools so we

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390
for the Android developer tools so we
 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.149
for the Android developer tools so we
would our team xavier Durocher has put

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159
would our team xavier Durocher has put
 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.630
would our team xavier Durocher has put
up a document or the sort of describes

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640
up a document or the sort of describes
 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.359
up a document or the sort of describes
some of the changes that are coming up

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369
some of the changes that are coming up
 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.670
some of the changes that are coming up
they're not I available in a stable

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680
they're not I available in a stable
 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.469
they're not I available in a stable
release yet but you can certainly go and

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479
release yet but you can certainly go and
 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.149
release yet but you can certainly go and
go and have a look at that document and

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159
go and have a look at that document and
 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.609
go and have a look at that document and
see what kind of changes are coming so

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619
see what kind of changes are coming so
 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.010
see what kind of changes are coming so
yeah this is this is good stuff more

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020
yeah this is this is good stuff more
 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.080
yeah this is this is good stuff more
more tools for developers is always a

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090
more tools for developers is always a
 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.920
more tools for developers is always a
good thing all right so it's tablet week

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930
good thing all right so it's tablet week
 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.490
good thing all right so it's tablet week
so our focus today is to really use the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500
so our focus today is to really use the
 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.350
so our focus today is to really use the
word tablet as much as possible no

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360
word tablet as much as possible no
 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.910
word tablet as much as possible no
that's not true and we we we want to

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920
that's not true and we we we want to
 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.789
that's not true and we we we want to
basically empower developers to build

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799
basically empower developers to build
 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.100
basically empower developers to build
apps that that work well on phones and

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110
apps that that work well on phones and
 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.440
apps that that work well on phones and
tablets so we're actually going to have

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450
tablets so we're actually going to have
 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.679
tablets so we're actually going to have
a series of presentations on a do plus

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689
a series of presentations on a do plus
 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.650
a series of presentations on a do plus
over the coming weeks today's the first

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660
over the coming weeks today's the first
 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.820
over the coming weeks today's the first
one and it's really about the

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830
one and it's really about the
 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.280
one and it's really about the
fundamental building blocks of these

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290
fundamental building blocks of these
 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.000
fundamental building blocks of these
apps and

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010
apps and
 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.979
apps and
and it's really fragments though those

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989
and it's really fragments though those
 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.190
and it's really fragments though those
are the components that you use so today

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200
are the components that you use so today
 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.500
are the components that you use so today
is very much a primer on fragments and

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510
is very much a primer on fragments and
 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.449
is very much a primer on fragments and
so we're going to cover a few things but

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459
so we're going to cover a few things but
 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:24.710
so we're going to cover a few things but
before we do let's talk about some

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720
before we do let's talk about some
 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.690
before we do let's talk about some
fundamental goals that developers would

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700
fundamental goals that developers would
 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.940
fundamental goals that developers would
like to have or we always want to have

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950
like to have or we always want to have
 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.890
like to have or we always want to have
when we build phone and tablet apps

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900
when we build phone and tablet apps
 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.160
when we build phone and tablet apps
firstly we want to have a single app for

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170
firstly we want to have a single app for
 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.979
firstly we want to have a single app for
mob right we don't want to have to

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989
mob right we don't want to have to
 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.860
mob right we don't want to have to
manage a different set of code for a

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870
manage a different set of code for a
 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.020
manage a different set of code for a
phone version for a tablet version or

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030
phone version for a tablet version or
 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.360
phone version for a tablet version or
even for a Google TV version as much as

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370
even for a Google TV version as much as
 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.130
even for a Google TV version as much as
possible we want to maximize our code

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140
possible we want to maximize our code
 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.119
possible we want to maximize our code
reuse and in doing so you kind of want

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129
reuse and in doing so you kind of want
 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.099
reuse and in doing so you kind of want
to have your code you know be quite

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109
to have your code you know be quite
 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:55.039
to have your code you know be quite
decoupled so that you can you can build

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049
decoupled so that you can you can build
 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.500
decoupled so that you can you can build
these reusable components and have them

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510
these reusable components and have them
 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.879
these reusable components and have them
not totally depend on the other

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:58.889
not totally depend on the other
 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:01.610
not totally depend on the other
components being the decoupling is

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620
components being the decoupling is
 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.619
components being the decoupling is
obviously a really good thing in general

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629
obviously a really good thing in general
 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.530
obviously a really good thing in general
software design and finally you want to

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540
software design and finally you want to
 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.819
software design and finally you want to
build these apps such that they're

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829
build these apps such that they're
 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.210
build these apps such that they're
backward compatible Android 3.0 is where

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220
backward compatible Android 3.0 is where
 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.580
backward compatible Android 3.0 is where
or honeycomb is where we first

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590
or honeycomb is where we first
 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.280
or honeycomb is where we first
introduced tablets and prior to that you

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290
introduced tablets and prior to that you
 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.809
introduced tablets and prior to that you
know we had Gingerbread and Froyo now

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819
know we had Gingerbread and Froyo now
 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.129
know we had Gingerbread and Froyo now
gingerbread is still a very popular

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139
gingerbread is still a very popular
 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:21.949
gingerbread is still a very popular
version of the platform so when we talk

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959
version of the platform so when we talk
 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.080
version of the platform so when we talk
about these fragments and utilizing them

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090
about these fragments and utilizing them
 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.640
about these fragments and utilizing them
we want to do it in a way that still

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650
we want to do it in a way that still
 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.559
we want to do it in a way that still
allows our apps to run on these older

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569
allows our apps to run on these older
 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.990
allows our apps to run on these older
versions so we're going to touch touch

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000
versions so we're going to touch touch
 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.699
versions so we're going to touch touch
on that too how do we make sure that

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709
on that too how do we make sure that
 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.199
on that too how do we make sure that
they're backward compatible whilst

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209
they're backward compatible whilst
 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.319
they're backward compatible whilst
keeping all these these goals in mind so

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329
keeping all these these goals in mind so
 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.610
keeping all these these goals in mind so
what are fragments well fragments

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620
what are fragments well fragments
 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.439
what are fragments well fragments
they're really reusable components so

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:42.449
they're really reusable components so
 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:44.750
they're really reusable components so
it's about grouping bits of you you I or

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760
it's about grouping bits of you you I or
 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.960
it's about grouping bits of you you I or
other common functionality so that you

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970
other common functionality so that you
 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.030
other common functionality so that you
can then use it in these standalone

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040
can then use it in these standalone
 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.659
can then use it in these standalone
classes so when we think about taking a

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:53.669
classes so when we think about taking a
 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:55.909
classes so when we think about taking a
nap and making it available on tablets

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919
nap and making it available on tablets
 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:57.920
nap and making it available on tablets
what we want to do is really promote the

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930
what we want to do is really promote the
 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.020
what we want to do is really promote the
idea of that the fact that you should

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030
idea of that the fact that you should
 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.729
idea of that the fact that you should
really rethink your you I don't just

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739
really rethink your you I don't just
 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.619
really rethink your you I don't just
take your phone layout and stretch it

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:03.629
take your phone layout and stretch it
 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:05.180
take your phone layout and stretch it
because that's not really a good

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190
because that's not really a good
 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.149
because that's not really a good
experience and in the majority of cases

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159
experience and in the majority of cases
 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.490
experience and in the majority of cases
stretching out you know a typical list

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500
stretching out you know a typical list
 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.080
stretching out you know a typical list
or something like that on a phone and

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090
or something like that on a phone and
 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.119
or something like that on a phone and
just stretching it out onto a tablet

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129
just stretching it out onto a tablet
 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.770
just stretching it out onto a tablet
doesn't doesn't really result in a good

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780
doesn't doesn't really result in a good
 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.890
doesn't doesn't really result in a good
user experience and uses never sentence

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900
user experience and uses never sentence
 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.430
user experience and uses never sentence
him to appreciate that so in as you can

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440
him to appreciate that so in as you can
 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.870
him to appreciate that so in as you can
see from this diagram here where you

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880
see from this diagram here where you
 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.930
see from this diagram here where you
might have had two activities one and

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940
might have had two activities one and
 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.680
might have had two activities one and
two

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690
two
 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.980
two
what you would do is actually take the

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990
what you would do is actually take the
 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.480
what you would do is actually take the
contents of those activities and put

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490
contents of those activities and put
 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.370
contents of those activities and put
them into fragments then on the phone

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380
them into fragments then on the phone
 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.560
them into fragments then on the phone
you'll be showing one fragment at a time

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570
you'll be showing one fragment at a time
 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.480
you'll be showing one fragment at a time
whereas on the tablet you can show both

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490
whereas on the tablet you can show both
 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.610
whereas on the tablet you can show both
fragments at a time within a single

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620
fragments at a time within a single
 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.340
fragments at a time within a single
activity so the activity is still that

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350
activity so the activity is still that
 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.110
activity so the activity is still that
out of window and you can see it based

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120
out of window and you can see it based
 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.420
out of window and you can see it based
on the blue border you still have

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430
on the blue border you still have
 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.190
on the blue border you still have
activities when you're running on phones

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200
activities when you're running on phones
 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.990
activities when you're running on phones
and tablets and we're not moving away

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000
and tablets and we're not moving away
 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.270
and tablets and we're not moving away
from activities but we're taking out all

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280
from activities but we're taking out all
 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.160
from activities but we're taking out all
of that that code that we had within the

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170
of that that code that we had within the
 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.960
of that that code that we had within the
activity around the user interface and

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970
activity around the user interface and
 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.920
activity around the user interface and
just regrouping it into fragments so

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930
just regrouping it into fragments so
 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.230
just regrouping it into fragments so
what are fragments well fragments are

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240
what are fragments well fragments are
 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.960
what are fragments well fragments are
basically reusable UI components by

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970
basically reusable UI components by
 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.660
basically reusable UI components by
grouping our our contents that we would

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670
grouping our our contents that we would
 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.640
grouping our our contents that we would
have had in an activity it means that we

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650
have had in an activity it means that we
 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.620
have had in an activity it means that we
can take be flexible with these

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630
can take be flexible with these
 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.670
can take be flexible with these
fragments so you know being a fragment

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680
fragments so you know being a fragment
 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.040
fragments so you know being a fragment
isn't just like an include in your

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050
isn't just like an include in your
 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.840
isn't just like an include in your
layout there's actually more to it than

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850
layout there's actually more to it than
 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.540
layout there's actually more to it than
that it actually participates as part of

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550
that it actually participates as part of
 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.700
that it actually participates as part of
the life cycle so fragments actually

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710
the life cycle so fragments actually
 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.530
the life cycle so fragments actually
have a life cycle and they're attached

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540
have a life cycle and they're attached
 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.480
have a life cycle and they're attached
to an activity and that's really

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490
to an activity and that's really
 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:33.980
to an activity and that's really
important because the activity will

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990
important because the activity will
 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.350
important because the activity will
initialize them at key points it'll

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360
initialize them at key points it'll
 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.909
initialize them at key points it'll
populate them and there are some

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919
populate them and there are some
 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:39.770
populate them and there are some
specific overloads that you should be

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780
specific overloads that you should be
 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.050
specific overloads that you should be
aware of fragments can also maintain

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060
aware of fragments can also maintain
 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.890
aware of fragments can also maintain
their own back stack so in you know you

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900
their own back stack so in you know you
 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.620
their own back stack so in you know you
know typical phone app you might go from

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630
know typical phone app you might go from
 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.720
know typical phone app you might go from
one activity to the next to the next but

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:50.730
one activity to the next to the next but
 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.780
one activity to the next to the next but
if you now start reusing these the

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790
if you now start reusing these the
 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.159
if you now start reusing these the
contents of those activities and

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:55.169
contents of those activities and
 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:57.409
contents of those activities and
fragments you might use a single

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419
fragments you might use a single
 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:59.090
fragments you might use a single
activity and just transition from one

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100
activity and just transition from one
 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.340
activity and just transition from one
fragment to the next now when the user

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:01.350
fragment to the next now when the user
 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.409
fragment to the next now when the user
hits the back button you don't want it

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419
hits the back button you don't want it
 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:05.450
hits the back button you don't want it
to go from one activity to the previous

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460
to go from one activity to the previous
 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.400
to go from one activity to the previous
one you want to make sure you you

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:07.410
one you want to make sure you you
 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.080
one you want to make sure you you
navigate backwards through the fragment

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.090
navigate backwards through the fragment
 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.360
navigate backwards through the fragment
stack before you go to the previous

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370
stack before you go to the previous
 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.110
stack before you go to the previous
activity so fragments allow this the

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120
activity so fragments allow this the
 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.130
activity so fragments allow this the
other thing to keep in mind is that

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:16.140
other thing to keep in mind is that
 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.920
other thing to keep in mind is that
fragments don't have to be UI components

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930
fragments don't have to be UI components
 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.320
fragments don't have to be UI components
they can just be background workers that

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330
they can just be background workers that
 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.540
they can just be background workers that
you instantiate and that participate is

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550
you instantiate and that participate is
 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.990
you instantiate and that participate is
part of the life cycle so we have an API

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000
part of the life cycle so we have an API
 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.140
part of the life cycle so we have an API
called fine fragment by tag so typically

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.150
called fine fragment by tag so typically
 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:31.820
called fine fragment by tag so typically
what you'd have is you'd have a fragment

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830
what you'd have is you'd have a fragment
 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.640
what you'd have is you'd have a fragment
that you put in a layout and you do a

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650
that you put in a layout and you do a
 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.940
that you put in a layout and you do a
you know a fine view by ID and grab the

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:37.950
you know a fine view by ID and grab the
 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.590
you know a fine view by ID and grab the
layout and so on and so forth but you

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600
layout and so on and so forth but you
 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.530
layout and so on and so forth but you
can actually instead

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:40.540
can actually instead
 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.510
can actually instead
cope fragments using the fragment

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520
cope fragments using the fragment
 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.630
cope fragments using the fragment
manager you can basically name them or

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:45.640
manager you can basically name them or
 

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.020
manager you can basically name them or
tag them so this fine fragment by tag is

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:49.030
tag them so this fine fragment by tag is
 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.270
tag them so this fine fragment by tag is
a way to basically get a hold of that

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.280
a way to basically get a hold of that
 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.430
a way to basically get a hold of that
fragment at runtime without having to

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440
fragment at runtime without having to
 

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.450
fragment at runtime without having to
rely on things like the view hierarchy

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:56.460
rely on things like the view hierarchy
 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.420
rely on things like the view hierarchy
so let's talk a little bit about

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.430
so let's talk a little bit about
 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.710
so let's talk a little bit about
fragments and activities in general so

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:01.720
fragments and activities in general so
 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.440
fragments and activities in general so
fragments the user interface part is

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:04.450
fragments the user interface part is
 

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.230
fragments the user interface part is
optional typically you know in most

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:07.240
optional typically you know in most
 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.150
optional typically you know in most
circumstances you would use them with a

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:09.160
circumstances you would use them with a
 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.650
circumstances you would use them with a
user interface that they're really for

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:10.660
user interface that they're really for
 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.150
user interface that they're really for
grouping you would use them for grouping

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160
grouping you would use them for grouping
 

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.980
grouping you would use them for grouping
you I but you don't have to whereas with

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:13.990
you I but you don't have to whereas with
 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.020
you I but you don't have to whereas with
an activity it always has a user

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:16.030
an activity it always has a user
 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.270
an activity it always has a user
interface right it's always the the part

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:18.280
interface right it's always the the part
 

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.090
interface right it's always the the part
that the user sees both of them tend to

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:21.100
that the user sees both of them tend to
 

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.070
that the user sees both of them tend to
have lifecycle methods and in fact the

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.080
have lifecycle methods and in fact the
 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.420
have lifecycle methods and in fact the
fragment tends to have a few more

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:24.430
fragment tends to have a few more
 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.300
fragment tends to have a few more
lifecycle methods than the activity and

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:27.310
lifecycle methods than the activity and
 

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.500

use of intense so typically we use

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:47.890
use of intense so typically we use
 

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:51.660
use of intense so typically we use
intense to invoke certain pieces of

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:04.420
activity and we're going to clarify this
 

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.480
activity and we're going to clarify this
later so what we're doing here is first

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:06.490
later so what we're doing here is first
 

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.850

describing what what fragments are going

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:08.860
describing what what fragments are going

to look at now the advantages of using

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:10.390
to look at now the advantages of using
 

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:12.630
to look at now the advantages of using
fragments and then eventually we will

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:12.640
fragments and then eventually we will
 

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.280

fragments so let's look at a typical

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:21.190
fragments so let's look at a typical
 

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:23.250

layer on a phone you know this is the

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:23.260
layer on a phone you know this is the
 

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:24.840
layer on a phone you know this is the

ice cream sandwich and you'll see on the

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:28.270
ice cream sandwich and you'll see on the
 

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:29.910
ice cream sandwich and you'll see on the

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:29.920
on the left hand side you've got to lift
 

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.690
on the left hand side you've got to lift
you with this list view you you have

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:33.700
you with this list view you you have
 

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.130
you with this list view you you have
your list of contacts there and as

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:35.140
your list of contacts there and as
 

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.260
your list of contacts there and as
there's some tabs across the top you can

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:37.270
there's some tabs across the top you can
 

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:39.719
there's some tabs across the top you can
swipe across them and so on you know

00:08:39.719 --> 00:08:39.729
swipe across them and so on you know
 

00:08:39.729 --> 00:08:41.940
swipe across them and so on you know
it's a fairly standard list view touch

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:41.950
it's a fairly standard list view touch
 

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:43.790
it's a fairly standard list view touch

now if we were to click Matthias there

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:47.440
now if we were to click Matthias there
 

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.530
now if we were to click Matthias there
it will take us from the ListView for

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:49.540
it will take us from the ListView for
 

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:52.460
it will take us from the ListView for
that contact and go into the detail view

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:52.470
that contact and go into the detail view
 

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:54.260
that contact and go into the detail view
now

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:54.270
now
 

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:56.780
now
you a traditional phone app may have

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:56.790
you a traditional phone app may have
 

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.180
you a traditional phone app may have
implemented these as activity one for

00:08:59.180 --> 00:08:59.190
implemented these as activity one for
 

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:00.710
implemented these as activity one for
the list view and activity two for the

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:00.720
the list view and activity two for the
 

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.260
the list view and activity two for the
detailed view but if we then reorganize

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:03.270
detailed view but if we then reorganize
 

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.780
detailed view but if we then reorganize
our code such that this list view part

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:05.790
our code such that this list view part
 

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:08.090
our code such that this list view part
of it becomes a fragment and the

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:08.100
of it becomes a fragment and the
 

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.570
of it becomes a fragment and the
detailed view also becomes a fragment

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:10.580
detailed view also becomes a fragment
 

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:13.370
detailed view also becomes a fragment
then what happens is on the phone we

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:13.380
then what happens is on the phone we
 

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.780
then what happens is on the phone we
still we can still present the same

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:14.790
still we can still present the same
 

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.250
still we can still present the same
interface but when we go to something

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:16.260
interface but when we go to something
 

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.470
interface but when we go to something
like the tablet we can show these

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480
like the tablet we can show these
 

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.300
like the tablet we can show these
multiple fragments at the same time

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:20.310
multiple fragments at the same time
 

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.970
multiple fragments at the same time
we're maximizing our code reuse we're

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:22.980
we're maximizing our code reuse we're
 

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:24.950
we're maximizing our code reuse we're
not having to define layouts multiple

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:24.960
not having to define layouts multiple
 

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.320
not having to define layouts multiple
times and even code multiple times or

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:27.330
times and even code multiple times or
 

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.480
times and even code multiple times or
having really complex inheritance

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:29.490
having really complex inheritance
 

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:32.300
having really complex inheritance
hierarchies with fragments we can

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:32.310
hierarchies with fragments we can
 

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:36.230
hierarchies with fragments we can
basically do show multiple pieces of you

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:36.240
basically do show multiple pieces of you
 

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.630
basically do show multiple pieces of you
I at the same time there is some extra

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640
I at the same time there is some extra
 

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.490
I at the same time there is some extra
code that you need to do to distinguish

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:40.500
code that you need to do to distinguish
 

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:41.810
code that you need to do to distinguish
between a phone layout and a tablet

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:41.820
between a phone layout and a tablet
 

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:45.110
between a phone layout and a tablet
layer I'm going to look at that next but

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120
layer I'm going to look at that next but
 

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.940
layer I'm going to look at that next but
the difference is really phenomenal in

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:46.950
the difference is really phenomenal in
 

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:49.400
the difference is really phenomenal in
terms of the the overhead for you and

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:49.410
terms of the the overhead for you and
 

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:52.880
terms of the the overhead for you and
your developers so when it comes to

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:52.890
your developers so when it comes to
 

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:57.110
your developers so when it comes to
defining layouts you might be saying

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120
defining layouts you might be saying
 

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.150
defining layouts you might be saying
well at what point how can I say that

00:09:59.150 --> 00:09:59.160
well at what point how can I say that
 

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.890
well at what point how can I say that
this this layout is going to be for a

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:00.900
this this layout is going to be for a
 

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:04.700
this this layout is going to be for a
phone or a tablet well in our in Eclipse

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:04.710
phone or a tablet well in our in Eclipse
 

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.830
phone or a tablet well in our in Eclipse
when you define your your resource or

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:06.840
when you define your your resource or
 

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.840
when you define your your resource or
your layout directories you can

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:08.850
your layout directories you can
 

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:10.550
your layout directories you can
basically just but you can say it's a

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:10.560
basically just but you can say it's a
 

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.320
basically just but you can say it's a
layout directory which will you know be

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:12.330
layout directory which will you know be
 

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.660
layout directory which will you know be
the default layout that gets used or you

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:14.670
the default layout that gets used or you
 

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.210
the default layout that gets used or you
can have these extra qualifiers so one

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:17.220
can have these extra qualifiers so one
 

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.440
can have these extra qualifiers so one
of the qualifiers is something that we

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:18.450
of the qualifiers is something that we
 

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:20.870
of the qualifiers is something that we
call smallest width and then you can

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880
call smallest width and then you can
 

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.750
call smallest width and then you can
specify number and a DP now smallest

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:23.760
specify number and a DP now smallest
 

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.420
specify number and a DP now smallest
width basically says that regardless of

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:26.430
width basically says that regardless of
 

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:28.010
width basically says that regardless of
whether I'm holding it in portrait or

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:28.020
whether I'm holding it in portrait or
 

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.590
whether I'm holding it in portrait or
landscape view what is the smallest

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:29.600
landscape view what is the smallest
 

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.710
landscape view what is the smallest
dimension on this device now what we've

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:33.720
dimension on this device now what we've
 

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.960
dimension on this device now what we've
done is that we've got some metrics in

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:35.970
done is that we've got some metrics in
 

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:37.970
done is that we've got some metrics in
there that tell you that this is the

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:37.980
there that tell you that this is the
 

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.670
there that tell you that this is the
range of values that will result in a

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:40.680
range of values that will result in a
 

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:44.780
range of values that will result in a
tablet UI or phone UI so if you specify

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:44.790
tablet UI or phone UI so if you specify
 

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:48.800
tablet UI or phone UI so if you specify
smallest width 600 anything that has 600

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:48.810
smallest width 600 anything that has 600
 

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:51.310
smallest width 600 anything that has 600
DPS or greater is considered a tablet

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:51.320
DPS or greater is considered a tablet
 

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.620
DPS or greater is considered a tablet
okay we've in fact added an extra layer

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:54.630
okay we've in fact added an extra layer
 

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:57.200
okay we've in fact added an extra layer
of differentiation there if you specify

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:57.210
of differentiation there if you specify
 

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:00.110
of differentiation there if you specify
600 DP it'll get picked up by 7-inch

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:00.120
600 DP it'll get picked up by 7-inch
 

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.740
600 DP it'll get picked up by 7-inch
tablets if you specify 720 DP it'll

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:03.750
tablets if you specify 720 DP it'll
 

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:05.180
tablets if you specify 720 DP it'll
actually get picked up by 10 inch

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:05.190
actually get picked up by 10 inch
 

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:07.639
actually get picked up by 10 inch
tablets so you may want to have a diff

00:11:07.639 --> 00:11:07.649
tablets so you may want to have a diff
 

00:11:07.649 --> 00:11:09.769
tablets so you may want to have a diff
lay out between your 7-inch tablets and

00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:09.779
lay out between your 7-inch tablets and
 

00:11:09.779 --> 00:11:12.170
lay out between your 7-inch tablets and
your 10-inch tablets and this metric

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:12.180
your 10-inch tablets and this metric
 

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.509
your 10-inch tablets and this metric
here is how you do that and then you'd

00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:14.519
here is how you do that and then you'd
 

00:11:14.519 --> 00:11:16.879
here is how you do that and then you'd
still have a normal layout folder and

00:11:16.879 --> 00:11:16.889
still have a normal layout folder and
 

00:11:16.889 --> 00:11:18.980
still have a normal layout folder and
that normal layout folder is what will

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:18.990
that normal layout folder is what will
 

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:22.280
that normal layout folder is what will
get picked up for phones the 600 DP for

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:22.290
get picked up for phones the 600 DP for
 

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:24.230
get picked up for phones the 600 DP for
7-inch tablets and the 720 DP four

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.240
7-inch tablets and the 720 DP four
 

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.509
7-inch tablets and the 720 DP four
10-inch tablets you don't have to have

00:11:26.509 --> 00:11:26.519
10-inch tablets you don't have to have
 

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:28.850
10-inch tablets you don't have to have
all three there's nothing that sort of

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:28.860
all three there's nothing that sort of
 

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.590
all three there's nothing that sort of
forcing you to do so but our

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:30.600
forcing you to do so but our
 

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.239
forcing you to do so but our
recommendation is at least have to have

00:11:32.239 --> 00:11:32.249
recommendation is at least have to have
 

00:11:32.249 --> 00:11:34.249
recommendation is at least have to have
the default layout folder and then have

00:11:34.249 --> 00:11:34.259
the default layout folder and then have
 

00:11:34.259 --> 00:11:37.850
the default layout folder and then have
the 600 DP for your tablet UI now prior

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:37.860
the 600 DP for your tablet UI now prior
 

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.359
the 600 DP for your tablet UI now prior
to Android 3.2 so really only android

00:11:41.359 --> 00:11:41.369
to Android 3.2 so really only android
 

00:11:41.369 --> 00:11:44.569
to Android 3.2 so really only android
3.0 and 3.1 the only way that you could

00:11:44.569 --> 00:11:44.579
3.0 and 3.1 the only way that you could
 

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:47.449
3.0 and 3.1 the only way that you could
have a tablet layout was to specify a

00:11:47.449 --> 00:11:47.459
have a tablet layout was to specify a
 

00:11:47.459 --> 00:11:50.419
have a tablet layout was to specify a
red large or as sorry that should say

00:11:50.419 --> 00:11:50.429
red large or as sorry that should say
 

00:11:50.429 --> 00:11:53.059
red large or as sorry that should say
layout large and layout extra-large

00:11:53.059 --> 00:11:53.069
layout large and layout extra-large
 

00:11:53.069 --> 00:11:55.579
layout large and layout extra-large
directory now in fact I'm going to just

00:11:55.579 --> 00:11:55.589
directory now in fact I'm going to just
 

00:11:55.589 --> 00:12:02.259
directory now in fact I'm going to just
fix that live right now because I can

00:12:02.259 --> 00:12:02.269
 

00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:05.720
and we're done so it's a layout large

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:05.730
and we're done so it's a layout large
 

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:07.850
and we're done so it's a layout large
and layout extra-large directory because

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:07.860
and layout extra-large directory because
 

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.759
and layout extra-large directory because
prior to Android 3.2 we didn't have that

00:12:10.759 --> 00:12:10.769
prior to Android 3.2 we didn't have that
 

00:12:10.769 --> 00:12:14.689
prior to Android 3.2 we didn't have that
smallest with qualifier so a larger and

00:12:14.689 --> 00:12:14.699
smallest with qualifier so a larger and
 

00:12:14.699 --> 00:12:16.220
smallest with qualifier so a larger and
extra large layout would actually get

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:16.230
extra large layout would actually get
 

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:19.220
extra large layout would actually get
picked up by those devices we no longer

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:19.230
picked up by those devices we no longer
 

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:21.319

recommend that you use large and

00:12:21.319 --> 00:12:21.329
recommend that you use large and
 

00:12:21.329 --> 00:12:23.030
recommend that you use large and
extra-large qualifies because it becomes

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.040
extra-large qualifies because it becomes
 

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.460
extra-large qualifies because it becomes
a little bit of a gray area you know

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:25.470
a little bit of a gray area you know
 

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:28.100
a little bit of a gray area you know
what defines a large large screen is it

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:28.110
what defines a large large screen is it
 

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:30.679
what defines a large large screen is it
a is it a 7-inch tablet like the Nexus 7

a is it a 7-inch tablet like the Nexus 7
 

00:12:30.689 --> 00:12:34.699
a is it a 7-inch tablet like the Nexus 7
or you know it's something like a galaxy

00:12:34.699 --> 00:12:34.709
or you know it's something like a galaxy
 

00:12:34.709 --> 00:12:37.730
or you know it's something like a galaxy
note considered a large screen so rather

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:37.740
note considered a large screen so rather
 

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.220

than having these these generic buckets

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:40.230
than having these these generic buckets
 

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:42.499
than having these these generic buckets
we now use the smallest with qualifying

00:12:42.499 --> 00:12:42.509
we now use the smallest with qualifying
 

00:12:42.509 --> 00:12:46.610
we now use the smallest with qualifying
and you should too so at runtime how

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:46.620
and you should too so at runtime how
 

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:47.900
and you should too so at runtime how
would you tell between whether you're

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:47.910
would you tell between whether you're
 

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:50.030
would you tell between whether you're
running in a phone layout or tablet

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:50.040
running in a phone layout or tablet
 

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.759
running in a phone layout or tablet
layer well it's easy right because in in

your activity you're going to have a

00:12:54.139 --> 00:12:54.149
your activity you're going to have a
 

00:12:54.149 --> 00:12:57.470
your activity you're going to have a
layout that you load and on the phone

00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:57.480
layout that you load and on the phone
 

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.119
layout that you load and on the phone
you would typically only be shown one

00:12:59.119 --> 00:12:59.129
you would typically only be shown one
 

00:12:59.129 --> 00:13:01.429
you would typically only be shown one
fragment at the time right on a tablet

00:13:01.429 --> 00:13:01.439
fragment at the time right on a tablet
 

00:13:01.439 --> 00:13:03.410
fragment at the time right on a tablet
you might show more than one fragment at

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:03.420
you might show more than one fragment at
 

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.689
you might show more than one fragment at
a time so what you can do is use a fine

00:13:05.689 --> 00:13:05.699
a time so what you can do is use a fine
 

00:13:05.699 --> 00:13:10.039
a time so what you can do is use a fine
view by ID API and see if you can find

00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:10.049
view by ID API and see if you can find
 

00:13:10.049 --> 00:13:12.199
view by ID API and see if you can find
both fragments for example and if you

00:13:12.199 --> 00:13:12.209
both fragments for example and if you
 

00:13:12.209 --> 00:13:13.669
both fragments for example and if you
you're only able to find one fragment

00:13:13.669 --> 00:13:13.679
you're only able to find one fragment
 

00:13:13.679 --> 00:13:15.679
you're only able to find one fragment
then you know that you're running on a

00:13:15.679 --> 00:13:15.689
then you know that you're running on a
 

00:13:15.689 --> 00:13:18.319
then you know that you're running on a
phone right if you're able to find both

00:13:18.319 --> 00:13:18.329
phone right if you're able to find both
 

00:13:18.329 --> 00:13:19.549
phone right if you're able to find both
fragments then you know that you're

00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:19.559
fragments then you know that you're
 

00:13:19.559 --> 00:13:21.440
fragments then you know that you're
running in a tablet and so that's that X

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:21.450
running in a tablet and so that's that X
 

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:23.570
running in a tablet and so that's that X
sort of glue code that i was talking to

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:23.580
sort of glue code that i was talking to
 

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.430
sort of glue code that i was talking to
but it really belongs in your activity

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440
but it really belongs in your activity
 

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.830
but it really belongs in your activity
because remember fragments themselves

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:27.840
because remember fragments themselves
 

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.650
because remember fragments themselves
should be standalone reusable components

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:30.660
should be standalone reusable components
 

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:32.060
should be standalone reusable components
that are fairly decoupled from

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:32.070
that are fairly decoupled from
 

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:34.100
that are fairly decoupled from
everything else it's the activity that

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:34.110
everything else it's the activity that
 

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:35.990
everything else it's the activity that
kind of binds the multiple fragments or

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000
kind of binds the multiple fragments or
 

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.970
kind of binds the multiple fragments or
really your layout that binds the

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:37.980
really your layout that binds the
 

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:40.490
really your layout that binds the
multiple fragments together so you can

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:40.500
multiple fragments together so you can
 

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.590
multiple fragments together so you can
just use a trick like that with using

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:42.600
just use a trick like that with using
 

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.240
just use a trick like that with using
fine view by ID and doing a null check

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:44.250
fine view by ID and doing a null check
 

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:49.280
fine view by ID and doing a null check
and uh that should sort you out so we

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:49.290
and uh that should sort you out so we
 

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:51.170
and uh that should sort you out so we
talked about intense before typically

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:51.180
talked about intense before typically
 

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:52.610
talked about intense before typically
what happens is when an intent gets

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:52.620
what happens is when an intent gets
 

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.280
what happens is when an intent gets
fired off your activity gets invoked and

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:55.290
fired off your activity gets invoked and
 

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:58.730
fired off your activity gets invoked and
said hey yes told he isn't in 10 but you

00:13:58.730 --> 00:13:58.740
said hey yes told he isn't in 10 but you
 

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:00.320
said hey yes told he isn't in 10 but you
can't go from an intent directly to a

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:00.330
can't go from an intent directly to a
 

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.150
can't go from an intent directly to a
fragment it still comes through to an

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.160
fragment it still comes through to an
 

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.100
fragment it still comes through to an
activity so you might be wondering well

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:04.110
activity so you might be wondering well
 

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:07.130
activity so you might be wondering well
how do I manage that to how do i get an

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:07.140
how do I manage that to how do i get an
 

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:09.590
how do I manage that to how do i get an
intent to end up invoking a fragment and

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600
intent to end up invoking a fragment and
 

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.180
intent to end up invoking a fragment and
the answer is it has to go through an

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:11.190
the answer is it has to go through an
 

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:12.860
the answer is it has to go through an
activity but let me just show you some

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:12.870
activity but let me just show you some
 

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:16.460
activity but let me just show you some
code that demonstrates how that that

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:16.470
code that demonstrates how that that
 

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:20.600
code that demonstrates how that that
propagation may work ah so let me just

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:20.610
propagation may work ah so let me just
 

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:23.030
propagation may work ah so let me just
highlight the relevant section so here

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.040
highlight the relevant section so here
 

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.010
highlight the relevant section so here
what's happened is where we're in the it

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:25.020
what's happened is where we're in the it
 

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:26.450
what's happened is where we're in the it
could happen in oncreate or it could

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:26.460
could happen in oncreate or it could
 

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.360
could happen in oncreate or it could
happen on on you and 10 and what you do

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:29.370
happen on on you and 10 and what you do
 

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:31.430
happen on on you and 10 and what you do
is basically do a get in can call so

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440
is basically do a get in can call so
 

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.860
is basically do a get in can call so
this code is actually in your activity

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:33.870
this code is actually in your activity
 

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:36.110
this code is actually in your activity
itself right and so we just do a get

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:36.120
itself right and so we just do a get
 

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.180
itself right and so we just do a get
intent we get the action and we're just

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:38.190
intent we get the action and we're just
 

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:41.120
intent we get the action and we're just
comparing whether that the the intent

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:41.130
comparing whether that the the intent
 

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:43.160
comparing whether that the the intent
action matches whatever action it is

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:43.170
action matches whatever action it is
 

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:46.850
action matches whatever action it is
that we're interested in so once we do

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:46.860
that we're interested in so once we do
 

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:48.650
that we're interested in so once we do
that in our activity we can then go okay

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:48.660
that in our activity we can then go okay
 

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.050
that in our activity we can then go okay
I know that it is this action so now I'm

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:51.060
I know that it is this action so now I'm
 

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:55.040
I know that it is this action so now I'm
going to go and get hold of my note list

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:55.050
going to go and get hold of my note list
 

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:57.380
going to go and get hold of my note list
fragment so in this activity there might

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:57.390
fragment so in this activity there might
 

00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:59.420
fragment so in this activity there might
there's probably a list fragment and a

00:14:59.420 --> 00:14:59.430
there's probably a list fragment and a
 

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:01.340
there's probably a list fragment and a
detail fragment so a list of notes and

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:01.350
detail fragment so a list of notes and
 

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.140
detail fragment so a list of notes and
then the detail fragment was probably

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:03.150
then the detail fragment was probably
 

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:06.380
then the detail fragment was probably
the note itself so what we did is we got

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:06.390
the note itself so what we did is we got
 

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:08.300
the note itself so what we did is we got
the intent now we managed to pull the

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:08.310
the intent now we managed to pull the
 

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:10.640
the intent now we managed to pull the
relevant fragment out and then finally

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:10.650
relevant fragment out and then finally
 

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:14.510
relevant fragment out and then finally
we are able to pass in some extra

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:14.520
we are able to pass in some extra
 

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:18.170
we are able to pass in some extra
information or sorry from the intent we

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:18.180
information or sorry from the intent we
 

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.360
information or sorry from the intent we
can get some extra information out as to

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:20.370
can get some extra information out as to
 

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:23.150
can get some extra information out as to
which list item we want to select or or

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:23.160
which list item we want to select or or
 

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.880
which list item we want to select or or
so on and so forth but this is an

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:25.890
so on and so forth but this is an
 

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:28.190
so on and so forth but this is an
example of where in the activity we

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:28.200
example of where in the activity we
 

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.470
example of where in the activity we
received the intent and then we followed

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480
received the intent and then we followed
 

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.730
received the intent and then we followed
that through and passed it through the

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:31.740
that through and passed it through the
 

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:34.340
that through and passed it through the
relevant fragment so we are kind of

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:34.350
relevant fragment so we are kind of
 

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:35.150
relevant fragment so we are kind of
starting to spread

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:35.160
starting to spread
 

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.619
starting to spread
out our code a little bit between

00:15:36.619 --> 00:15:36.629
out our code a little bit between
 

00:15:36.629 --> 00:15:38.329
out our code a little bit between
different classes but that's not

00:15:38.329 --> 00:15:38.339
different classes but that's not
 

00:15:38.339 --> 00:15:43.009
different classes but that's not
necessarily a bad thing either okay so

00:15:43.009 --> 00:15:43.019
necessarily a bad thing either okay so
 

00:15:43.019 --> 00:15:45.079
necessarily a bad thing either okay so
we talked about intent communication but

00:15:45.079 --> 00:15:45.089
we talked about intent communication but
 

00:15:45.089 --> 00:15:46.400
we talked about intent communication but
what about when you've got two fragments

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:46.410
what about when you've got two fragments
 

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:47.990
what about when you've got two fragments
and you want to communicate with one

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000
and you want to communicate with one
 

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.290
and you want to communicate with one
another you could do all sorts of sort

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:51.300
another you could do all sorts of sort
 

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.150
another you could do all sorts of sort
of trickery where you've got fragments

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:53.160
of trickery where you've got fragments
 

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.100
of trickery where you've got fragments
talking to fragments but it's generally

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:55.110
talking to fragments but it's generally
 

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:56.569
talking to fragments but it's generally
not a good thing because then you start

00:15:56.569 --> 00:15:56.579
not a good thing because then you start
 

00:15:56.579 --> 00:15:58.340
not a good thing because then you start
to really closely couple them together

00:15:58.340 --> 00:15:58.350
to really closely couple them together
 

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:00.290
to really closely couple them together
then one fragment needs to know whether

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:00.300
then one fragment needs to know whether
 

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:01.819
then one fragment needs to know whether
the other fragment exists and has been

00:16:01.819 --> 00:16:01.829
the other fragment exists and has been
 

00:16:01.829 --> 00:16:04.189
the other fragment exists and has been
loaded and so on and so forth and then

00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:04.199
loaded and so on and so forth and then
 

00:16:04.199 --> 00:16:06.559
loaded and so on and so forth and then
pass information back and forth instead

00:16:06.559 --> 00:16:06.569
pass information back and forth instead
 

00:16:06.569 --> 00:16:08.540
pass information back and forth instead
what we recommend if you still use the

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:08.550
what we recommend if you still use the
 

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:12.019
what we recommend if you still use the
activity as kind of a proxy so what you

00:16:12.019 --> 00:16:12.029
activity as kind of a proxy so what you
 

00:16:12.029 --> 00:16:14.569
activity as kind of a proxy so what you
would do to achieve fragment of fragment

00:16:14.569 --> 00:16:14.579
would do to achieve fragment of fragment
 

00:16:14.579 --> 00:16:16.850
would do to achieve fragment of fragment
communication is go via the activity so

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:16.860
communication is go via the activity so
 

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.530
communication is go via the activity so
here you'll see that what we recommend

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:18.540
here you'll see that what we recommend
 

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:20.720
here you'll see that what we recommend
is that you define an interface in frame

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:20.730
is that you define an interface in frame
 

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:22.819
is that you define an interface in frame
of one we're calling it in FSA for now

00:16:22.819 --> 00:16:22.829
of one we're calling it in FSA for now
 

00:16:22.829 --> 00:16:25.160
of one we're calling it in FSA for now
and fragment two would having a face be

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:25.170
and fragment two would having a face be
 

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:27.980
and fragment two would having a face be
defined the activity would implement

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:27.990
defined the activity would implement
 

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:31.220
defined the activity would implement
those methods okay and then when those

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:31.230
those methods okay and then when those
 

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:32.749
those methods okay and then when those
methods are being called on those

00:16:32.749 --> 00:16:32.759
methods are being called on those
 

00:16:32.759 --> 00:16:35.030
methods are being called on those
interfaces it would then pass it on to

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040
interfaces it would then pass it on to
 

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.009
interfaces it would then pass it on to
the relevant fragment and it may in fact

00:16:37.009 --> 00:16:37.019
the relevant fragment and it may in fact
 

00:16:37.019 --> 00:16:39.379
the relevant fragment and it may in fact
like on a phone it may actually need to

00:16:39.379 --> 00:16:39.389
like on a phone it may actually need to
 

00:16:39.389 --> 00:16:41.480
like on a phone it may actually need to
instantiate the second fragment because

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:41.490
instantiate the second fragment because
 

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:43.249
instantiate the second fragment because
on a phone that both fragments may not

00:16:43.249 --> 00:16:43.259
on a phone that both fragments may not
 

00:16:43.259 --> 00:16:45.170
on a phone that both fragments may not
have been instantiated because that you

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:45.180
have been instantiated because that you
 

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.150
have been instantiated because that you
know single fragment lay out what loaded

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:47.160
know single fragment lay out what loaded
 

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.100
know single fragment lay out what loaded
so really the activity is that thing

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:49.110
so really the activity is that thing
 

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:51.800
so really the activity is that thing
that's binding it all together right so

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:51.810
that's binding it all together right so
 

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:53.389
that's binding it all together right so
what would happen is that once all of

00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:53.399
what would happen is that once all of
 

00:16:53.399 --> 00:16:55.189
what would happen is that once all of
these the interfaces are defined in the

00:16:55.189 --> 00:16:55.199
these the interfaces are defined in the
 

00:16:55.199 --> 00:16:56.629
these the interfaces are defined in the
activity is implementing them your

00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639
activity is implementing them your
 

00:16:56.639 --> 00:16:58.970
activity is implementing them your
fragments are invoking the activity and

00:16:58.970 --> 00:16:58.980
fragments are invoking the activity and
 

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:01.249
fragments are invoking the activity and
then the activity even turn is calling

00:17:01.249 --> 00:17:01.259
then the activity even turn is calling
 

00:17:01.259 --> 00:17:03.949
then the activity even turn is calling
the fragment so let's look at some code

00:17:03.949 --> 00:17:03.959
the fragment so let's look at some code
 

00:17:03.959 --> 00:17:07.850
the fragment so let's look at some code
that demonstrates that so on attaches a

00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:07.860
that demonstrates that so on attaches a
 

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.789
that demonstrates that so on attaches a
is within a fragment that that's an

00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799
is within a fragment that that's an
 

00:17:10.799 --> 00:17:14.059
is within a fragment that that's an
overload that says sorry an override

00:17:14.059 --> 00:17:14.069
overload that says sorry an override
 

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:17.480
overload that says sorry an override
that says that your fragment has been

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:17.490
that says that your fragment has been
 

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:19.699
that says that your fragment has been
attached to a particular activity and

00:17:19.699 --> 00:17:19.709
attached to a particular activity and
 

00:17:19.709 --> 00:17:21.770
attached to a particular activity and
that's when it gets cold so when we get

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:21.780
that's when it gets cold so when we get
 

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:23.659
that's when it gets cold so when we get
attached when our fragment gets attached

00:17:23.659 --> 00:17:23.669
attached when our fragment gets attached
 

00:17:23.669 --> 00:17:25.819
attached when our fragment gets attached
to an activity we're just storing that

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:25.829
to an activity we're just storing that
 

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:28.100
to an activity we're just storing that
activity is a callback object within the

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:28.110
activity is a callback object within the
 

00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:31.130
activity is a callback object within the
frame when itself okay and you'll notice

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:31.140
frame when itself okay and you'll notice
 

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.649
frame when itself okay and you'll notice
that the the type of that callback

00:17:33.649 --> 00:17:33.659
that the the type of that callback
 

00:17:33.659 --> 00:17:36.230
that the the type of that callback
object is this note list event call back

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240
object is this note list event call back
 

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.539
object is this note list event call back
that's our interface which which is at

00:17:38.539 --> 00:17:38.549
that's our interface which which is at
 

00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:41.539
that's our interface which which is at
the bottom of this this page but we'll

00:17:41.539 --> 00:17:41.549
the bottom of this this page but we'll
 

00:17:41.549 --> 00:17:43.700
the bottom of this this page but we'll
talk about that in a minute but anyway

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:43.710
talk about that in a minute but anyway
 

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:46.279
talk about that in a minute but anyway
we store it as an interface and then on

00:17:46.279 --> 00:17:46.289
we store it as an interface and then on
 

00:17:46.289 --> 00:17:48.770
we store it as an interface and then on
our friend in this on list item

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:48.780
our friend in this on list item
 

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:51.050
our friend in this on list item
click method when we need to go and do

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:51.060
click method when we need to go and do
 

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.790
click method when we need to go and do
something about the fact that the user

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:52.800
something about the fact that the user
 

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:56.660
something about the fact that the user
has selected something we then can do it

00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:56.670
has selected something we then can do it
 

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:59.000
has selected something we then can do it
one of two ways we can just call gate

00:17:59.000 --> 00:17:59.010
one of two ways we can just call gate
 

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:02.210
one of two ways we can just call gate
activity and then go to call the the do

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:02.220
activity and then go to call the the do
 

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.670
activity and then go to call the the do
something method or we can use the

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:04.680
something method or we can use the
 

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.880
something method or we can use the
interface itself which we stored as a

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:07.890
interface itself which we stored as a
 

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:10.160
interface itself which we stored as a
callback object in the honor catch

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:10.170
callback object in the honor catch
 

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:12.980
callback object in the honor catch
method now my personal preference is to

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:12.990
method now my personal preference is to
 

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.710
method now my personal preference is to
use the callback I think it's cleaner

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:15.720
use the callback I think it's cleaner
 

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.530
use the callback I think it's cleaner
we've defined clear interfaces so again

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:18.540
we've defined clear interfaces so again
 

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.380
we've defined clear interfaces so again
we're we're kind of decoupling our code

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:21.390
we're we're kind of decoupling our code
 

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:24.470
we're we're kind of decoupling our code
quite nicely so you'd call call back

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480
quite nicely so you'd call call back
 

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.480
quite nicely so you'd call call back
down on list no clicked and passing the

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:26.490
down on list no clicked and passing the
 

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:29.420
down on list no clicked and passing the
ID now remember we talked about at the

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:29.430
ID now remember we talked about at the
 

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:32.000
ID now remember we talked about at the
start in this honor catch method we

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:32.010
start in this honor catch method we
 

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.220
start in this honor catch method we
stored this callback and we said it had

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:34.230

to implement an interface well that's
what this bit of the bottom is it's the

what this bit of the bottom is it's the
 

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.510
what this bit of the bottom is it's the
interface that this fragment is defining

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:40.520
interface that this fragment is defining
 

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:44.150

communication between fragments don't do

00:18:59.450 --> 00:18:59.460
communication between fragments don't do
 

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.190
communication between fragments don't do
it directly from fragment of fragment

the thing that fragments are attached to

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:08.720
the thing that fragments are attached to
 

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.240
the thing that fragments are attached to
so we talked about some nice things here

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:11.250
so we talked about some nice things here
 

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:12.830
so we talked about some nice things here
but I also mentioned that fragments came

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:12.840
but I also mentioned that fragments came
 

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.230
but I also mentioned that fragments came
into android 3.0 the good news is that

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:15.240
into android 3.0 the good news is that
 

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.780
into android 3.0 the good news is that
we actually introduced fragments in the

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:17.790
we actually introduced fragments in the
 

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:19.730
we actually introduced fragments in the
support library so the support library

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:19.740
support library so the support library
 

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.710
support library so the support library
is a reusable library you may have heard

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:21.720
is a reusable library you may have heard
 

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.560
is a reusable library you may have heard
me mention it before it's really simple

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:24.570
me mention it before it's really simple
 

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:26.210
me mention it before it's really simple
to include in your project and within

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:26.220
to include in your project and within
 

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.980
to include in your project and within
eclipse you just right-click the project

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:27.990
eclipse you just right-click the project
 

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:29.870
eclipse you just right-click the project
go to Android tools and say add support

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:29.880
go to Android tools and say add support
 

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.790
go to Android tools and say add support
library it will go and download the

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:31.800
library it will go and download the
 

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.460
library it will go and download the
latest version include the the jar on

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:34.470
latest version include the the jar on
 

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:36.770
latest version include the the jar on
your project and set up the the build

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:36.780
your project and set up the the build
 

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.450
your project and set up the the build
path for you as well and the namespace

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:38.460
path for you as well and the namespace
 

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.090
path for you as well and the namespace
is then available so we basically put

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:41.100
is then available so we basically put
 

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.770
is then available so we basically put
backward compatible fragments in the

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:42.780
backward compatible fragments in the
 

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:45.650
backward compatible fragments in the
support library now my recommendation to

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:45.660
support library now my recommendation to
 

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:48.560
support library now my recommendation to
developers is use these support

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:48.570
developers is use these support
 

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:50.780
developers is use these support
fragrance from the start anytime you're

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:50.790
fragrance from the start anytime you're
 

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:53.210
fragrance from the start anytime you're
building a new app start with fragments

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:53.220
building a new app start with fragments
 

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:55.880
building a new app start with fragments
think about tablets and phones as

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:55.890
think about tablets and phones as
 

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:59.140
think about tablets and phones as
effectively being first class citizens

00:19:59.140 --> 00:19:59.150
effectively being first class citizens
 

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:02.150
effectively being first class citizens
try not to start with a phone app and

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:02.160
try not to start with a phone app and
 

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.190
try not to start with a phone app and
then you know migrate to a tablet out

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:04.200
then you know migrate to a tablet out
 

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.130
then you know migrate to a tablet out
later you may choose to do the tablet

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:07.140
later you may choose to do the tablet
 

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.350
later you may choose to do the tablet
side of things later on but at least set

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360
side of things later on but at least set
 

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.970
side of things later on but at least set
up the infrastructure and start using

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:10.980
up the infrastructure and start using
 

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:12.710
up the infrastructure and start using
fragments from the very beginning

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720
fragments from the very beginning
 

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:16.310
fragments from the very beginning
because it's a lot easier than to manage

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320
because it's a lot easier than to manage
 

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.440
because it's a lot easier than to manage
a tablet version of your app whereas if

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:18.450
a tablet version of your app whereas if
 

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:20.390
a tablet version of your app whereas if
you don't use fragments and then later

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400
you don't use fragments and then later
 

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.070
you don't use fragments and then later
on you have to go and reorganize all of

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080
on you have to go and reorganize all of
 

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.930
on you have to go and reorganize all of
your activities and so on in fragments

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:23.940
your activities and so on in fragments
 

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:25.820
your activities and so on in fragments
the overhead is a lot more later on

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:25.830
the overhead is a lot more later on
 

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:27.410
the overhead is a lot more later on
because you've got a big chunk of code

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:27.420
because you've got a big chunk of code
 

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:32.960
because you've got a big chunk of code
that you need to refactor so the support

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:32.970
that you need to refactor so the support
 

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:35.000
that you need to refactor so the support
library has fragment and one other

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:35.010
library has fragment and one other
 

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:37.040
library has fragment and one other
really important piece of advice is

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:37.050
really important piece of advice is
 

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:39.650
really important piece of advice is
don't mix and match support fragments

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:39.660
don't mix and match support fragments
 

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:42.050
don't mix and match support fragments
with the native fragments that you'll

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:42.060
with the native fragments that you'll
 

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:44.870
with the native fragments that you'll
find on android 3.0 and upwards they're

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880
find on android 3.0 and upwards they're
 

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.040
find on android 3.0 and upwards they're
different implementations they're

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:46.050
different implementations they're
 

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:47.690
different implementations they're
different classes so you kind of mix and

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:47.700
different classes so you kind of mix and
 

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.460
different classes so you kind of mix and
match a support fragment and a native

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:49.470
match a support fragment and a native
 

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:53.480
match a support fragment and a native
fragment but we are able to achieve

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:53.490
fragment but we are able to achieve
 

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:55.670
fragment but we are able to achieve
backward compatibility and that is how

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:55.680
backward compatibility and that is how
 

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.040
backward compatibility and that is how
all of our internal apps work as well

00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:58.050
all of our internal apps work as well
 

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:00.320
all of our internal apps work as well
you'll notice things like I showed you

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:00.330
you'll notice things like I showed you
 

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.120
you'll notice things like I showed you

fragments anyways so that's backward

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:11.670
fragments anyways so that's backward
 

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:17.120

much as possible you want to prefetch

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760
much as possible you want to prefetch
 

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.760
much as possible you want to prefetch
and and chunk it up if you can do that

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:08.770
and and chunk it up if you can do that
 

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:10.320
and and chunk it up if you can do that
when you're on Wi-Fi that's even better

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:10.330
when you're on Wi-Fi that's even better
 

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:13.790
when you're on Wi-Fi that's even better
but streaming and you know just having a

of data periodically is probably not the
 

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:21.540

best way to do it because it will have a
 

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:23.930
best way to do it because it will have a
significant drain on the user's device

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:23.940
significant drain on the user's device

so yeah prefetching is one really good

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:26.890
so yeah prefetching is one really good
 

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:29.490
so yeah prefetching is one really good

whether you are connected to Wi-Fi or 3G
 

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.900
whether you are connected to Wi-Fi or 3G
is use the connectivity manager and then

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:48.910
is use the connectivity manager and then
 

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:50.580
is use the connectivity manager and then
you know change your behavior

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:50.590
you know change your behavior
 

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:54.240
you know change your behavior
accordingly um and also keep in mind

the users okay with you doing that so if
 

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.610
the users okay with you doing that so if
the user it's a music player you said

better most people are okay with Wi-Fi
but again you need to consider their

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:22.300
but again you need to consider their
 

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:24.259

a communication between devices or is it

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:47.950
a communication between devices or is it
 

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:50.509
a communication between devices or is it
between applications what is the primary

00:25:50.509 --> 00:25:50.519
between applications what is the primary

deference bangalore and i think the

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:04.570
deference bangalore and i think the
 

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:06.090
deference bangalore and i think the
question is coming from there as a

00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:06.100
question is coming from there as a
 

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:07.860
question is coming from there as a
follow-up question so i'll try to answer

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:07.870
follow-up question so i'll try to answer
 

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:11.100
follow-up question so i'll try to answer
this so when we say connectivity the api

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:11.110
this so when we say connectivity the api

it is a communication devices or it's
 

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.629
it is a communication devices or it's

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:39.870
a lot of there's a lot of resources
 

00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:42.650
a lot of there's a lot of resources
available on our developer site to some

00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:42.660
available on our developer site to some
 

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:45.490
available on our developer site to some
of these type shows when comes to

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:45.500
of these type shows when comes to
 

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:49.460
of these type shows when comes to
grabbing information from a URL so you I

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:49.470
grabbing information from a URL so you I
 

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:51.890
grabbing information from a URL so you I
show you what you would need is Internet

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:51.900
show you what you would need is Internet
 

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:53.750
show you what you would need is Internet
formation on your application first

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760
formation on your application first
 

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:56.030
formation on your application first
thing and then you could use a standard

00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:56.040
thing and then you could use a standard
 

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:59.510
thing and then you could use a standard
Java URL connection hey guys which would

00:30:59.510 --> 00:30:59.520
Java URL connection hey guys which would
 

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:00.940
Java URL connection hey guys which would
allow you to connect

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:00.950
allow you to connect
 

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:03.430
allow you to connect
host and you could set the appropriate

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440
host and you could set the appropriate
 

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.769
host and you could set the appropriate
headers or authentication scheme using

00:31:05.769 --> 00:31:05.779
headers or authentication scheme using
 

00:31:05.779 --> 00:31:08.019
headers or authentication scheme using
you are in connection and then download

00:31:08.019 --> 00:31:08.029
you are in connection and then download
 

00:31:08.029 --> 00:31:11.680
you are in connection and then download
the data by as an HTTP response so

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:11.690
the data by as an HTTP response so
 

00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:14.980
the data by as an HTTP response so
that's that's for doing it and one thing

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:14.990
that's that's for doing it and one thing
 

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:17.950
that's that's for doing it and one thing
to note here is that anybody gingerbread

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:17.960
to note here is that anybody gingerbread
 

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.909
to note here is that anybody gingerbread
we recommend that default HTTP fine

00:31:20.909 --> 00:31:20.919
we recommend that default HTTP fine
 

00:31:20.919 --> 00:31:22.840
we recommend that default HTTP fine
unfortunately Brad we recommend using

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:22.850
unfortunately Brad we recommend using
 

00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:25.600
unfortunately Brad we recommend using
URL connection because the there were

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:25.610
URL connection because the there were
 

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:27.310
URL connection because the there were
some issues with your introduction like

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:27.320
some issues with your introduction like
 

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:29.409
some issues with your introduction like
the fortune your pet so if you are

00:31:29.409 --> 00:31:29.419
the fortune your pet so if you are
 

00:31:29.419 --> 00:31:31.570

building an app that's meant to be

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:31.580
building an app that's meant to be
 

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:33.940
building an app that's meant to be
compatible across the entire range of

00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:33.950
compatible across the entire range of
 

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:36.159
compatible across the entire range of
devices and it should be you should

00:31:36.159 --> 00:31:36.169
devices and it should be you should
 

00:31:36.169 --> 00:31:38.820
devices and it should be you should
consider that fact so if you look at the

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:38.830
consider that fact so if you look at the
 

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:41.049
consider that fact so if you look at the
during run time you could people look at

00:31:41.049 --> 00:31:41.059
during run time you could people look at
 

00:31:41.059 --> 00:31:42.850
during run time you could people look at
the build of the OS and then choose to

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:42.860
the build of the OS and then choose to
 

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:44.889
the build of the OS and then choose to
use a different line to get the data so

00:31:44.889 --> 00:31:44.899
use a different line to get the data so
 

00:31:44.899 --> 00:31:49.750
use a different line to get the data so
that's key for HTTP client feedback I'm

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:49.760
that's key for HTTP client feedback I'm
 

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.279
that's key for HTTP client feedback I'm
put any more resources you would like to

00:31:51.279 --> 00:31:51.289
put any more resources you would like to
 

00:31:51.289 --> 00:31:55.570
put any more resources you would like to

Chandler had written a nice little

00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:57.260
Chandler had written a nice little
 

00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:02.139
Chandler had written a nice little
library to fetch information from from

00:32:02.139 --> 00:32:02.149
library to fetch information from from
 

00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:04.810
library to fetch information from from
the net basically passing the URL and

00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:04.820
the net basically passing the URL and
 

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:07.840
the net basically passing the URL and
you know it just sort of abstracted a

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:07.850
you know it just sort of abstracted a
 

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:10.180
you know it just sort of abstracted a
lot of the detail for you so good yeah

00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:10.190
lot of the detail for you so good yeah
 

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:12.129
lot of the detail for you so good yeah
yeah look up David Chandler on Google+

00:32:12.129 --> 00:32:12.139
yeah look up David Chandler on Google+
 

00:32:12.139 --> 00:32:13.899
yeah look up David Chandler on Google+
and he's got a really nice library that

00:32:13.899 --> 00:32:13.909
and he's got a really nice library that
 

00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:20.230
and he's got a really nice library that
you could use I can I can take this one

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:20.240
you could use I can I can take this one
 

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.930
you could use I can I can take this one
could you please describe the best

00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:22.940
could you please describe the best
 

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:25.240
could you please describe the best
strategy for working with fragments and

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:25.250
strategy for working with fragments and
 

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:28.600
strategy for working with fragments and
loaders in a map activity any plans of

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:28.610
loaders in a map activity any plans of
 

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:30.820
loaders in a map activity any plans of
supporting fragments in a map activity

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:30.830
supporting fragments in a map activity
 

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:34.960
supporting fragments in a map activity
um so the honest you're honest truth is

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:34.970
um so the honest you're honest truth is
 

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:37.600
um so the honest you're honest truth is
it's it's pretty difficult right you can

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:37.610
it's it's pretty difficult right you can
 

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:43.930
it's it's pretty difficult right you can
use the map activity is is something

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:43.940
use the map activity is is something
 

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:45.899
use the map activity is is something
that we sort of released fairly early on

00:32:45.899 --> 00:32:45.909
that we sort of released fairly early on
 

00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:49.360
that we sort of released fairly early on
and it obviously provides the map

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:49.370
and it obviously provides the map
 

00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:52.629
and it obviously provides the map
component part of it but it's not a

00:32:52.629 --> 00:32:52.639
component part of it but it's not a
 

00:32:52.639 --> 00:32:54.669
component part of it but it's not a
traditional activity you can't what what

00:32:54.669 --> 00:32:54.679
traditional activity you can't what what
 

00:32:54.679 --> 00:32:56.259
traditional activity you can't what what
you need is a fragment activity from the

00:32:56.259 --> 00:32:56.269
you need is a fragment activity from the
 

00:32:56.269 --> 00:32:57.460
you need is a fragment activity from the
support library if you want to use

00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:57.470
support library if you want to use
 

00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:59.529
support library if you want to use
fragments so in some ways map activity

00:32:59.529 --> 00:32:59.539
fragments so in some ways map activity
 

00:32:59.539 --> 00:33:02.340
fragments so in some ways map activity
and fragment activities are kind of

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:02.350
and fragment activities are kind of
 

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:07.570
and fragment activities are kind of
divergent from one another so it's I've

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:07.580
divergent from one another so it's I've
 

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:09.610
divergent from one another so it's I've
seen developers do it with all sorts of

00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:09.620
seen developers do it with all sorts of
 

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:12.549
seen developers do it with all sorts of
tricks and hacks but I also know that

00:33:12.549 --> 00:33:12.559
tricks and hacks but I also know that
 

00:33:12.559 --> 00:33:14.250
tricks and hacks but I also know that
there's been

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:14.260
there's been
 

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:16.170
there's been
some complications in having to do it

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:16.180
some complications in having to do it
 

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:19.860
some complications in having to do it
that way we would love to be able to

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:19.870
that way we would love to be able to
 

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:22.260
that way we would love to be able to
just use maps in a fragment but there

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:22.270
just use maps in a fragment but there
 

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:24.330
just use maps in a fragment but there
you know we haven't we as in Google have

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:24.340
you know we haven't we as in Google have
 

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:26.490
you know we haven't we as in Google have
it published anything yet it's actually

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:26.500
it published anything yet it's actually
 

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:29.070
it published anything yet it's actually
a fairly common request that we get and

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:29.080
a fairly common request that we get and
 

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.440
a fairly common request that we get and
so we are we're definitely looking into

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:31.450
so we are we're definitely looking into
 

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:33.180
so we are we're definitely looking into
it but we don't have anything to

00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:33.190
it but we don't have anything to
 

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:37.080
it but we don't have anything to
announce from a map fragment point of

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:37.090
announce from a map fragment point of
 

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:42.570
announce from a map fragment point of
view so I yeah I think that was the last

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:42.580
view so I yeah I think that was the last
 

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:46.500
view so I yeah I think that was the last
question oh there's any other question

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:46.510
question oh there's any other question
 

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:49.740
question oh there's any other question
on the on the on a thread which it

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:49.750
on the on the on a thread which it
 

00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:56.790
on the on the on a thread which it
doesn't seem to be and it does anyone

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:56.800
doesn't seem to be and it does anyone
 

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.640
doesn't seem to be and it does anyone
live have any other questions before we

00:33:58.640 --> 00:33:58.650
live have any other questions before we
 

00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:01.110
live have any other questions before we
or should we wrap up is the other

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:01.120
or should we wrap up is the other
 

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:05.520
or should we wrap up is the other
question so I think Valis Abu from

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:05.530
question so I think Valis Abu from
 

00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:07.320
question so I think Valis Abu from
Bangalore who asked the connectivity API

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:07.330
Bangalore who asked the connectivity API
 

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:09.990
Bangalore who asked the connectivity API
question about the hand of here so if

00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:10.000
question about the hand of here so if
 

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.370
question about the hand of here so if
you have any other follow-up questions

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:11.380
you have any other follow-up questions
 

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:16.110
you have any other follow-up questions
for us was like all right well it

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:16.120
for us was like all right well it
 

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:19.020
for us was like all right well it
doesn't look like it maybe he's shy but

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:19.030
doesn't look like it maybe he's shy but
 

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:20.760
doesn't look like it maybe he's shy but
or maybe he just doesn't have any

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:20.770
or maybe he just doesn't have any
 

00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:23.580
or maybe he just doesn't have any
follow-up questions so on that note I

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:23.590
follow-up questions so on that note I
 

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:25.530
follow-up questions so on that note I
guess we'll head off thank you for
