00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of Congress
in Washington, D.C.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.050 position:56%
&gt;&gt; What is the legacy that you would
like to leave behind as an author?

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.260
&gt;&gt; Well, I think -- I guess
number one would be value history.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:36.290 position:75%
I do what I do, and I try to make history come
alive because I believe history makes you whole,

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.760
and I believe -- you know
it's that saying sankofa.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.450
I think some people translate
it "go back and pick it up."

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:49.530 position:75%
In Brooklyn, Reverend Johnny Ray Youngblood, his
translation is "The way out is back through."

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.000 position:59%
So I feel for all people unless you
know your history, unless you go back,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.120 position:56%
you won't really come through whole.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.000
When I was a kid -- see I
got like flashcard history.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.620
It was like black people slaves
and then there was no more slavery

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.950 position:56%
and then black people were ignorant.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.280
It was like reconstruction was
a time where it was horrible

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.320
because some black men had
power and they messed up.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:24.370 position:73%
It was like there was nothing for me but shame,
violence, and knowing that I come from people

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.970
who weren't slaves, when I was
a kid I was kind of ashamed.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.140
I was kind of embarrassed.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.840 position:67%
But through the work I've done I've learnt,
oh my God, I have nothing to be ashamed of.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.870
I've been able to sort of do the
math and realize then say, "Wow."

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.340
Let's say -- take my grandfather.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.620
He was a laborer in North Carolina.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.450 position:61%
If he was making -- I'm making 25 cents
a week or a day or whatever it was

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.700 position:67%
and a white guy doing the same work, a
laborer was making 50 cents, I said, "Well,

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.920 position:61%
then my grandfather had to be a genius
to raise his family on half the money,"

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:05.180 position:63%
because both men had to buy cornmeal and
fatback or whatever for their families.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.180
So that takes a genius to do that.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:13.510 position:73%
Also I started to realize that, okay, if I come
from enslaved people and Jim Crowed people,

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.630 position:69%
they must have been kind of smart to produce
me because I don't see my accomplishments,

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.480 position:73%
you know, the writing the books and the
[inaudible] and the Princeton and the Columbia,

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.450
I don't think that's just about me.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.100
I think that says a lot about
the people I come from.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.450
So I think, "My goodness.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.030 position:63%
Can you imagine if my grandfather had
my opportunities what he could have done

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.670
or my great grandfather?"

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.480 position:72%
So I've found it's been my experience that
there was -- I say there is power in the past.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.160 position:67%
When you know the history, you are stronger

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:49.450 position:63%
and just not your own ethnic racial
history, but the history of the country.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.150
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
