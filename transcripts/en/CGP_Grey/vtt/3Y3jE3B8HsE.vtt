00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.540
Queen Lion of the Animal Kingdom is displeased.
She recently introduced elections for the

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.410
office of king using the first post the post
voting system.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.570
While her Realm started out as a healthy democracy
with many parties running candidates for king,

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.740
it quickly devolved into two party rule, with
the citizens not liking either one but trapped

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.040
within the system because of a problem called
the spoiler effect.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.239
However, one of Queen Lion’s subjects from
a distant land, Wallaby, has a solution: The

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:26.160
Alternative Vote.
What’s the difference?

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.320
To find out, lets follow one voter on election
day, Red Squirrel, under both systems.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.520
There are five candidates running for king,
two members of the big parties Gorilla and

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.050
Leopard and three other candidates, Turtle,
Owl and Tiger.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.220
Under first-past-the-post Red Squirrel gets
a ballot where he picks just one candidate.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.860
Red Squirrel Really likes Turtle and even
campaigned for him. However he knows that

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.780
his new neighbor, Grey Squirrel, is voting
Gorilla.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.570
And what, starts to wonder Red Squirrel, about
all the other animals? Who are they going

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.690
to vote for?
The debates on Animal News Network only had

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.500
the big parties, so Red Squirrel thinks it’s
going to be a close race between Gorilla and

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.680
Leopard.
While he’s indifferent toward Gorilla he

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.220
is deathly afraid of Leopard.
Because he can only pick a single candidate,

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.280
he gives his one vote to Gorilla in hopes
of preventing Leopard from becoming king.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.560
This is strategic voting, and it’s a necessity
under First Past the Post.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.591
But now it’s time to look at the Alternative
Vote, which wallaby explains to Red Squirrel.

00:01:17.591 --> 00:01:22.450
Instead of picking one and only one candidate,
he can rank them in order of his most favorite

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.010
to his least.
He goes into the voting both and gets the

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.049
same ballot as before, but now puts Turtle
as his first choice, Owl as his second and

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.851
Gorilla, third.
He dislikes Leopard and Tiger equally so he

00:01:32.851 --> 00:01:35.530
stops filling in his ballot and drops it in
the box.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.460
At this point, Red Squirrel doesn’t care
exactly what happens, he has other things

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.390
on his mind and heads off. But you, dear citizen,
want to know how the votes are counted so

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.450
here goes:
Turtle, beloved though he is with some of

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.720
the citizenry, comes in last place with only
5% and he is eliminated from the race.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.140
Because the voters ranked their candidates
in order, we can know what would have happened

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.430
if Turtle didn’t run.
Without Turtle, voters like Red Squirrel,

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.060
would have picked Owl instead, so their votes
are transferred to her as though Turtle was

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.560
never in the race at all.
This is why Alternative Vote is sometimes

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.220
called Instant Runoff Voting. It’s able
to simulate a bunch of elections where the

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.690
least popular candidate is eliminated after
each round without all the time and expense

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.819
it would take to run a bunch of campaigns,
one after another.

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.919
The Alternative Vote method keeps eliminated
the least popular candidate until someone

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:21.909
either wins a majority or is the only one
left.

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:26.540
As no one has a majority yet, the next lowest
candidate, Tiger, is eliminated. Tiger voters

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.209
listed leopard as their second choice, so
she gets Tiger’s votes.

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.930
In the last round, Gorilla is eliminated.
Gorilla voters listed Owl as their second

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.559
choice, so Owl gets those votes, wins a majority,
so is crowed king.

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:42.121
The alternative vote is a better system because
it produces winners that a larger number of

00:02:42.121 --> 00:02:45.439
voters agree on.
While the Alternative Vote does have flaws

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:49.430
it’s important to note that any problem
AV has, first past the post shares.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.169
They’re both susceptible to gerrymandering,
they aren’t proportional systems, they can’t

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:58.620
guarantee a Condorcet winner (which math geeks
hate but there isn’t time to explain here),

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.529
and over time they both trend toward two main
parties.

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:05.239
That being said, Alternative Vote has a huge
advantage that first past the post lacks and

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.249
makes it a mathematically superior method:
no spoiler effect!

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:14.031
Imagine this election: the two big candidates
are running, Gorilla and Leopard, and Leopard

00:03:14.031 --> 00:03:19.349
looks set to win 55% to 45%. But then a third
party candidate, Tiger, enters.

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:23.430
Tiger manages to convince 15% of the Leopard
voters to back him. Now the results are:

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.829
Under first past the post, gorilla now wins
even though a majority of the voters didn’t

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.989
want him.
Under the Alternative Vote, because all Tiger

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.040
voters put Leopard as second choice, Leopard
still wins because a majority of the citizens

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.559
of the animal kingdom would rather have her
in charge than gorilla.

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:42.939
With AV citizens can help support and grow
smaller parties that they agree without worrying

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:45.669
they’ll put someone they don’t like into
office.

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:49.839
After examining the differences, Queen Lion
decrees that the Alternative Vote is to be

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:55.299
the rule of the land for electing the king
and everyone is happier. …well almost everyone.

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:02.819
The two big parties can’t be complacent
and need to campaign harder for their votes.

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.849
This has been The Alternative Vote Explained
by me C. G. P. Grey.

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:06.809
Thank you very much for watching.
