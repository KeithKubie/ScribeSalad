1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.420
I love those little things cause they give you,
you know what,
that's a good dose.

2
00:00:03.421 --> 00:00:07.020
Before you go on stage,
just a little,
a little quick.
Yeah.
Just a little woo.

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.610
Just a little pick me up.
Yes.

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.810
Yup.
What is your pre show ritual?
Do you have one?

5
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.870
No,
no.
I I I like to have like,
like you said,
two puffs a week.

6
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.830
Two puffs,
little bit,
a little puffs or deep tracks.
No little puff.

7
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.570
You know Dave got me back on blunts real.
Yeah,
I know.
I was like,

8
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.130
well you able to blank when I first walked in I was like,
Yo Joe,
slow the El Man.

9
00:00:35.131 --> 00:00:38.920
We get it.
You're cool mother fucker.

10
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.140
That's how we use most of the time now when,
uh,

11
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.270
Charlie Murphy got me on them the first time and then um,
I got,

12
00:00:48.271 --> 00:00:48.751
I was like,

13
00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:52.650
this is an interesting experience to be high and then nicotine high at the same

14
00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:57.390
time.
The two t two of them together are unique.
Right.
It's a different feeling.

15
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.530
And then I didn't do it again for a long time until,
uh,

16
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.010
I smoked with Dave and John Mayer name drop that were,

17
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.450
were both smoking that stuff.
It's nice guy.
Yeah,
he's a dog.
He's a very,

18
00:01:09.451 --> 00:01:13.980
very nice guy.
Like,
um,
these vapors shifted like squirt off,

19
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.080
squared out,
smells,
smells and shit.
Oh,
like aroma therapy.
Yes ma'am.

20
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.240
Does this mother fucker just y'all I'm telling you,

21
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.190
you gotta Watch out cause he'll just,

22
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.970
you can tell when he got his enrollment therapy thinking is because he's just

23
00:01:26.971 --> 00:01:29.910
doing like this.
Right.
And then he'll just come by and be like,

24
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.900
so how's everything right.
And then it's probably real though.
It's real.

25
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.820
But he's supposed to give me one of the motherfucking machine and my wand.
Yeah,

26
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.640
if you have one.
I'm like,
I liked the role he had.
Like it was,
um,
like Labradors,

27
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.800
something.
He was like,
it was a crazy color,
crazy way.
He was like,

28
00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:51.060
just Kim just doing like this
wizard of that.

29
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.710
What's that smell that you gotta be careful.
Oh,
but truly,
truly equals hippies,

30
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.950
right?
Is it a petroleum oil?

31
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.730
It's like a type of oil that like people were wearing like a lot of hipsters

32
00:02:02.731 --> 00:02:06.450
were wearing.
Right,
isn't it?
Is it a hipster thing or a hippie?
More hippie.

33
00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:07.284
Hippie.
Hippie.

34
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.620
Supposed to do just a stinky oil people put on a spit chew here I have some

35
00:02:13.381 --> 00:02:16.740
lotion.
I don't have a Whitney like organic,

36
00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:21.570
which some magical elements.
That's pretty good.
Magical elements.
Yeah.
Yeah.

37
00:02:21.571 --> 00:02:25.440
It so what does John Mayer trying to do with this aroma therapy wand is waving

38
00:02:25.441 --> 00:02:29.190
around everywhere.
She's just once sinuses to be open man.

39
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.810
I think he cares about people breathing.
That's considerate,
you know,

40
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.350
but he was,
when he has it,
he's like a different person.

41
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.410
I mean it's like he flight like this powerful and he brings it around people

42
00:02:43.411 --> 00:02:44.101
that had been drinking.

43
00:02:44.101 --> 00:02:48.210
So now you've got to mix the smell of fucking rum and his got damn lavender

44
00:02:48.211 --> 00:02:52.140
machine and he only has one machine.
So once he gets you addicted to it,

45
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.910
you got to chase him.
And he's a little too handsome.

46
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.890
I don't even care about that part.

47
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.670
I just don't want him to have speed chasing him for smells.

48
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.640
Cause the last two times I've seen him,
I was like,
John,
man,

49
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.750
what's up with the fucking um,
vapor thing?
He was like,
you like that,

50
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:14.230
don't you like he's got like a pimp.
He wants to hold it back from you.

51
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.100
I'm gonna find out who makes it.
Let me get my home.
You should get your home.
Yup.

52
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.930
Maybe I can get them to sponsor my new podcast.

53
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.220
I bet they would do it too soon to,
so I like it.

54
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.840
It's boring.
Born right here.
