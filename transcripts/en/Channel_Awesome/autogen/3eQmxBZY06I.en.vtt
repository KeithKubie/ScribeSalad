stock CGI battle not now here's what I
was gonna ask because I noticed this

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:04.380
was gonna ask because I noticed this
 

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.050
was gonna ask because I noticed this
early on especially because we saw the

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:06.060
early on especially because we saw the
 

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:08.750
early on especially because we saw the
lego movie - after this lego movie - is

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:08.760
lego movie - after this lego movie - is
 

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.190
lego movie - after this lego movie - is
very fast it's just like the first one

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:10.200
very fast it's just like the first one
 

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.540
very fast it's just like the first one
where the action is super quick and they

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:11.550
where the action is super quick and they
 

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.000
where the action is super quick and they
throw a lot at you this one it almost

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:14.010
throw a lot at you this one it almost
 

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.680
throw a lot at you this one it almost
seemed like it's impressive because they

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:15.690
seemed like it's impressive because they
 

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:17.420
seemed like it's impressive because they
try to shoot it in one shot and it's

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:17.430
try to shoot it in one shot and it's
 

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:19.160
try to shoot it in one shot and it's
definitely well put together but it

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:19.170
definitely well put together but it
 

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:21.860
definitely well put together but it
seems slower compared to other animated

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:21.870
seems slower compared to other animated
 

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:23.930
seems slower compared to other animated
films and what I'm wondering is if you

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:23.940
films and what I'm wondering is if you
 

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:25.910
films and what I'm wondering is if you
got the same idea I did did they slow it

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:25.920
got the same idea I did did they slow it
 

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.160
got the same idea I did did they slow it
down to make it feel like well these are

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:28.170
down to make it feel like well these are
 

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:30.470
down to make it feel like well these are
characters with actual weight and when

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480
characters with actual weight and when
 

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.790
characters with actual weight and when
they jump you want to feel like they're

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:31.800
they jump you want to feel like they're
 

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.040
they jump you want to feel like they're
actually jump absolutely which is why I

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:34.050
actually jump absolutely which is why I
 

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:35.870
actually jump absolutely which is why I
liked the zoom I think more than like

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:35.880
liked the zoom I think more than like
 

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:36.830
liked the zoom I think more than like

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:44.010
like I felt way more invested in this
 

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:45.500
like I felt way more invested in this
movie and the way they were trying to

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:45.510
movie and the way they were trying to
 

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:48.800
movie and the way they were trying to
grow these characters I didn't it was

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:48.810
grow these characters I didn't it was
 

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:50.420
grow these characters I didn't it was
very hiccup centric in the second one

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:50.430
