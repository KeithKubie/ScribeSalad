00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.700
The DC Extended Universe hasn't exactly blown
comic book movie fans away to date.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.460
Man of Steel, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice
and Suicide Squad all underwhelmed on the

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.280
whole - and something needs to be done to
vamp the franchise up.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.590
The introduction of the Justice League and
the Green Lantern Corps will undoubtedly help

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.060
to do that, with the first Justice League
movie hitting theatres in 2017, a sequel following

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.800
in 2019, and a Green Lantern Corps movie in
2020.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.380
At least one member of the new Green Lantern
Corps will no doubt end up joining the Justice

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.010
League - and DC and Warner Brothers will want
to make sure they get the actors right, after

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.730
the Ryan Reynolds version flopped so badly
in 2011.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.110
So, based on the assumption that the main
Green Lantern of the DCEU will either be John

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.629
Stewart or Hal Jordan, both of which have
been rumoured, let's take a look of some potentially

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.370
suitable candidates to portray them.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.550
Here are ten amazing actors who could play
Green Lantern in the DCEU Justice League.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.329
Nathan Fillion (Hal Jordan)
Now, the Ryan Reynolds depiction of Hal Jordan

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.250
back in 2011 might have led you to believe
that Hal Jordan is... well... like Ryan Reynolds

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.680
- but he really isn't.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.500
In the comic books, Jordan is certainly quite
reckless through his absolute lack of fear

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.430
towards anything, but he's not the cocky moron
with the childish sense of humour that Reynolds

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.520
portrayed him as.He's a fearless leader with
willpower in droves - something Firefly actor

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.560
Nathan Fillion could portray effortlessly;
heck, that's exactly what his Firely character

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.100
Malcolm Reynolds was all about.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.610
Moreover, Fillion has voiced Jordan superbly
in a number of DC animated features and it

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.970
would be awesome to see him reprise that role
in live action.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.600
Tyrese Gibson (John Stewart)
One of the most regularly-linked actors to

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.810
the role of John Stewart in the DCEU is Tyrese
Gibson - and with good reason.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.510
Gibson would make a great John Stewart, having
demonstrated the kind of regimented behaviour

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.689
required of the veteran U.S. Marine in his
role as Chief Master Sergeant Robert Epps

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:50.840
in the Transformers franchise, and the reckless
fearlessness of a Green Lantern in his role

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.580
as Roman Pearce in the Fast and Furious franchise.The
only issue with Gibson is his age.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.009
John Stewart is an extremely experienced man
in his mid-forties and Tyrese Gibson is a

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.700
fairly youthful-looking 37, making him the
youngest actor to potentially portray the

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.570
character on this list - but don't rule him
out.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.800
Ben McKenzie (Hal Jordan)
Although he's far from being the best-known

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.730
actor on this list, staunch DC fans will already
be extremely familiar with Ben McKenzie, as

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.290
he has portrayed a young version of James
Gordon in the television series Gotham since

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.300
2014.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.209
The show has received generally positive reviews
- even if it is a little tedious at times

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.420
- but McKenzie has undoubtedly been the best
thing about it, which bodes well for his future.He'd

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.210
make a great Hal Jordan and his portrayal
of Gordon epitomises why.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.350
Gotham's version of the character is a no-nonsense,
fearless, determined young cop whose persona

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.350
would carry over to that of a galaxy-defending
Green Lantern quite effortlessly.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.360
Michael Jai White (John Stewart)
The all-action Michael Jai White would undoubtedly

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.120
be able to portray John Stewart.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.129
At 48, he's the right age for the role and
would be ideal as a supporting actor in the

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.349
live action Justice League.

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.769
He's no stranger to superhero movies, having
previously appeared in two Toxic Avenger outings,

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.930
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret
of the Ooze, The Dark Knight and, most notably,

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.129
as the titular character in Spawn.Spawn was
a terrible movie, but Jai White wasn't to

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.489
blame for that - he actually came out of it
looking okay.

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.209
His no-nonsense persona and willingness to
get his hands dirty would enable him to portray

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.989
a kick-ass version of Stewart, with exactly
the right look for the character to boot.

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.760
Brett Dalton (Hal Jordan)
Although he's 33, Brett Dalton hasn't been

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.709
acting all that long and hasn't had too many
high-profile roles, but his most prominent

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.370
and well-known role is enough to prove that
he'd actually be a pretty decent outsider

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.900
option for the role of Hal Jordan in the DCEU.Dalton
played Agent Grant Ward in ABC's Agents of

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.900
S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.879
- a role that increased in its complexity
until, ultimately, he became the villain known

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:36.879
as Hive.

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:40.390
As Ward, he conveyed the required organised
and controlled behaviour of a member of the

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.530
Green Lantern Corps and, as Hive he conveyed
the stern ruthlessness that is often required

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.530
of them too.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.579
He has the right look and the acting chops
to give an excellent portrayal of Hal Jordan

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.330
- although his Marvel links might make that
difficult.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.200
Terrence Howard (John Stewart)
Simply put, Terrence Howard would make a fantastic

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.200
John Stewart.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.629
He's the right age and undoubtedly has the
acting ability, having been nominated for

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.379
the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role
in 2005's Hustle &amp; Flow.

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:08.620
Moreover, he has proven himself in a role
fairly similar to that of John Stewart.Howard

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.190
played Colonel James "Rhodey" Rhodes in the
first Iron Man movie - Rhodey being a veteran

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.890
of the U.S. army who became a superhero, just
like Stewart did - before being replaced by

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.579
Don Cheadle thereafter.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.000
Howard's treatment by Marvel was reported
to be quite bad, so it would really be a show

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.300
of defiance if he was to appear as an iconic
DC hero on screen.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.050
Matt Damon (Hal Jordan)
Matt Damon is obviously a fantastic actor.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.330
Ben Affleck's buddy has earned three Academy
Award nominations over the years, as well

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.880
as winning one for writing the Good Will Hunting
screenplay, and has proven that he can play

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.920
a variety of very different roles.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.950
He has the "all-action" thing down - as proven
in the Bourne movies - and would make a fantastic

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.230
Hal Jordan.Damon has been strongly linked
with roles in the DCEU ever since Affleck

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.000
was cast as Batman in the franchise - but
the roles in question have generally been

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.890
Robin, Nightwing and Green Arrow - and seeing
him cast as Jordan and fighting alongside

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.220
Affleck's Batman in the Justice League movies
would be fantastic.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.660
Idris Elba (John Stewart)
Idris Elba has been mentioned in the same

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.700
breath as John Stewart for a long time, and
with good reason - he'd make an absolutely

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.690
fantastic live action version of the character.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.410
A number of his past roles make him perfect
for the role - most notably his role as the

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.600
no-nonsense DCI John Luther in the BBC series
Luther.He also has great experience in comic

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.720
book movies, having appeared in The Losers,
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance and, most

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.360
notably, three movies in the Marvel Cinematic
Universe as Heimdall - a role in which he

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.530
also protects the galaxy from evil threats,
like Stewart does.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.380
Elba is currently tied up in his MCU role,
so acting in a DC movie could prove difficult,

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.570
but he really doesn't enjoy working for Marvel
Studios, so he'd surely jump at the chance

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.430
to cross the DC/Marvel divide as soon as possible.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.570
Matt Smith (Hal Jordan)
This might seem like something of an "out

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.760
there" idea, but British actor Matt Smith
could make an extremely interesting Hal Jordan.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.820
Having already portrayed the galaxy-protecting
Doctor in the iconic BBC television series

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:57.240
Doctor Who, he also more recently proved that
he can do action in 2015's Terminator Genisys,

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.240
in which he portrayed the physical embodiment
of Skynet.The Doctor Who role alone proves

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.290
that Smith can do almost anything as an actor.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.890
He had to convey a vast range of emotions
and traits as the Doctor; from being playful,

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.710
curious, creative and eccentric to being angry,
determined, wilful and downright brutal, and

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:16.510
it would be awesome to see the classically-trained
actor defending the galaxy once more as part

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.190
of the DCEU Justice League.

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.030
Denzel Washington (John Stewart)
Although he's the oldest actor on this list

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.550
at 61, Denzel Washington looks considerably
younger than that - like he's in his mid-forties

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.340
- and he would make a fantastic John Stewart.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.770
Washington's talent is unquestionable - he's
been nominated for six Academy Awards and

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.500
won two - and he can turn his acting hand
to anything.He has, in fact, been linked to

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.200
the Stewart role in the press over the past
couple of years, and it's easy to see why.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.590
He's played army veterans in movies like Crimson
Tide, Virtuosity, Courage Under Fire and The

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.610
Manchurian Candidate, and generally tough
guys in the likes of The Hurricane, American

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.410
Gangster and The Equalizer - he'd pull the
John Stewart role off with ease and would

00:06:53.410 --> 00:07:10.640
add some real experience 
to the DCEU Justice League.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.480
