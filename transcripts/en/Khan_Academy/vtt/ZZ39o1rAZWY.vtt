00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:02.045
- [Voiceover] So I've got a rocket here.

00:00:02.045 --> 00:00:05.377
And this rocket is going
to launch a projectile,

00:00:05.377 --> 00:00:07.424
maybe it's a rock of some kind,

00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:10.641
with the velocity of
ten meters per second.

00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:13.340
And the direction of that velocity

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.239
is going to be be 30 degrees,

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:17.856
30 degrees upwards from the horizontal.

00:00:17.856 --> 00:00:20.347
Or the angle between the
direction of the launch

00:00:20.347 --> 00:00:22.777
and horizontal is 30 degrees.

00:00:22.777 --> 00:00:24.221
And what we want to
figure out in this video

00:00:24.221 --> 00:00:26.798
is how far does the rock travel?

00:00:26.798 --> 00:00:29.678
We want to figure out how,

00:00:29.678 --> 00:00:31.595
how far does it travel?

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:34.109
Does it travel?

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:37.529
And to simplify this problem,

00:00:37.529 --> 00:00:38.362
what we're gonna do is

00:00:38.362 --> 00:00:40.484
we're gonna break down
this velocity vector

00:00:40.484 --> 00:00:43.309
into its vertical and
horizontal components.

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:44.888
We're going to use a vertical component,

00:00:44.888 --> 00:00:46.513
so let me just draw it visually.

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:47.976
So this velocity vector can be

00:00:47.976 --> 00:00:50.458
broken down into its vertical

00:00:50.458 --> 00:00:52.958
and its horizontal components.

00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:56.120
And its horizontal components.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.233
So we're gonna get some
vertical component,

00:00:58.233 --> 00:01:01.356
some amount of velocity
in the upwards direction,

00:01:01.356 --> 00:01:02.261
and we can figure,

00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:04.223
we can use that to figure out

00:01:04.223 --> 00:01:06.813
how long will this rock stay in the air.

00:01:06.813 --> 00:01:07.776
Because it doesn't matter

00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:09.580
what its horizontal component is.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.855
Its vertical component is gonna determine

00:01:11.855 --> 00:01:14.142
how quickly it decelerates due to gravity

00:01:14.142 --> 00:01:15.884
and then re-accelerated, and essentially

00:01:15.884 --> 00:01:18.049
how long it's going to be the air.

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.626
And once we figure out
how long it's in the air,

00:01:20.626 --> 00:01:22.971
we can multiply it by,

00:01:22.971 --> 00:01:24.320
we can multiply it by the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.923
horizontal component of the velocity,

00:01:26.923 --> 00:01:29.338
and that will tell us how far it travels.

00:01:29.338 --> 00:01:30.883
And, once again, the assumption

00:01:30.883 --> 00:01:31.962
that were making this videos

00:01:31.962 --> 00:01:34.679
is that air resistance is negligible.

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:37.837
Obviously, if there was
significant air resistance,

00:01:37.837 --> 00:01:40.634
this horizontal velocity
would not stay constant

00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:42.144
while it's traveling through the air.

00:01:42.144 --> 00:01:43.452
But we're going to assume that it does,

00:01:43.452 --> 00:01:44.925
that this does not change,

00:01:44.925 --> 00:01:45.758
that it is negligible.

00:01:45.758 --> 00:01:47.562
We can assume that were
doing this experiment

00:01:47.562 --> 00:01:49.278
on the moon if we wanted to have a,

00:01:49.278 --> 00:01:51.245
if we wanted to view it in purer terms.

00:01:51.245 --> 00:01:53.114
But let's solve the problem.

00:01:53.114 --> 00:01:54.113
So the first that we want to do

00:01:54.113 --> 00:01:57.247
is we wanna break down
this velocity vector.

00:01:57.247 --> 00:01:59.105
We want to break down this velocity vector

00:01:59.105 --> 00:02:02.031
that has a magnitude of
ten meters per second.

00:02:02.031 --> 00:02:05.815
And has an angle of 30
degrees with the horizontal.

00:02:05.815 --> 00:02:08.149
We want to break it down it
with x- and y-components,

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.750
or its horizontal and vertical components.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.307
so that's its horizontal,

00:02:13.307 --> 00:02:14.742
let me draw a little bit better,

00:02:14.742 --> 00:02:16.808
that's its horizontal component,

00:02:16.808 --> 00:02:19.502
and that its vertical
component looks like this.

00:02:19.502 --> 00:02:21.662
This is its vertical component.

00:02:21.662 --> 00:02:24.074
So let's do the vertical component first.

00:02:24.074 --> 00:02:26.082
So how do we figure out
the vertical component

00:02:26.082 --> 00:02:29.483
given that we know the
hypotenuse of this right triangle

00:02:29.483 --> 00:02:31.469
and we know this angle right over here.

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:34.325
And the angle, and the side,
this vertical component,

00:02:34.325 --> 00:02:36.147
or the length of that vertical component,

00:02:36.147 --> 00:02:37.703
or the magnitude of it,

00:02:37.703 --> 00:02:40.245
is opposite the angle.

00:02:40.245 --> 00:02:41.743
So we want to figure out the opposite.

00:02:41.743 --> 00:02:44.471
We have to hypotenuse, so once again

00:02:44.471 --> 00:02:46.221
we write down so-cah,

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.191
so-ca-toh-ah.

00:02:49.191 --> 00:02:52.338
Sin is opposite over hypotenuse.

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:54.521
So we know that the sin,

00:02:54.521 --> 00:02:56.354
the sin of 30 degrees,

00:02:57.424 --> 00:02:59.513
the sin of 30 degrees,

00:02:59.513 --> 00:03:02.045
is going to be equal to the magnitude

00:03:02.045 --> 00:03:04.181
of our vertical component.

00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:07.750
So this is the magnitude of velocity,

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.193
I'll say the velocity in the y direction.

00:03:10.193 --> 00:03:11.480
That's the vertical direction,

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.546
y is the upwards direction.

00:03:13.546 --> 00:03:17.505
Is equal to the magnitude of our velocity

00:03:17.505 --> 00:03:20.710
of the velocity in the y direction.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.984
Divided by the magnitude
of the hypotenuse,

00:03:24.984 --> 00:03:26.935
or the magnitude of our original vector.

00:03:26.935 --> 00:03:29.970
Divided by ten meters per second.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.803
Ten meters per second.

00:03:32.931 --> 00:03:34.710
And then, to solve for this quantity

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:35.924
right over here,

00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:38.165
we multiply both sides by 10.

00:03:38.165 --> 00:03:41.076
And you get 10, sin of 30.

00:03:41.076 --> 00:03:42.909
10, sin of 30 degrees.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.314
10 sin of 30 degrees is going to be

00:03:47.314 --> 00:03:50.221
equal to the magnitude of our,

00:03:50.221 --> 00:03:53.425
the magnitude of our vertical component.

00:03:53.425 --> 00:03:56.397
And so what is the sin of 30 degrees?

00:03:56.397 --> 00:03:58.344
And this, you might have memorized this

00:03:58.344 --> 00:04:00.096
from your basic trigonometry class.

00:04:00.096 --> 00:04:01.993
You can get the calculator
out if you want,

00:04:01.993 --> 00:04:04.037
but sin of 30 degrees is
pretty straightforward.

00:04:04.037 --> 00:04:06.858
It is 1/2. So sin of 30 degrees,

00:04:06.858 --> 00:04:09.262
use a calculator if you
don't remember that, or

00:04:09.262 --> 00:04:10.214
you remember it now so

00:04:10.214 --> 00:04:12.261
sin of 30 degrees is 1/2.

00:04:12.261 --> 00:04:14.186
And so 10 times 1/2

00:04:14.186 --> 00:04:16.508
is going to be five.

00:04:16.508 --> 00:04:17.785
So, and I forgot the units there,

00:04:17.785 --> 00:04:19.729
so it's five meters per second.

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:21.893
Is equal to the magnitude,

00:04:21.893 --> 00:04:25.876
is equal to the magnitude
of our vertical component.

00:04:25.876 --> 00:04:27.396
Let me get that in the right color.

00:04:27.396 --> 00:04:31.417
It's equal to the magnitude
of our vertical component.

00:04:31.417 --> 00:04:32.392
So what does that do?

00:04:32.392 --> 00:04:33.225
What we're,

00:04:33.225 --> 00:04:35.973
this projectile, because
vertical component

00:04:35.973 --> 00:04:37.529
is five meters per second,

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:40.153
it will stay in the air
the same amount of time

00:04:40.153 --> 00:04:42.351
as anything that has a vertical

00:04:42.351 --> 00:04:44.014
component of five meters per second.

00:04:44.014 --> 00:04:47.459
If you threw a rock or
projectile straight up

00:04:47.459 --> 00:04:50.397
at a velocity five meters per second,

00:04:50.397 --> 00:04:52.124
that rocket projectile will stay

00:04:52.124 --> 00:04:54.462
up in the air as long as this one here

00:04:54.462 --> 00:04:56.946
because they have the
same vertical component.

00:04:56.946 --> 00:05:00.070
So let's think about how
long it will stay in the air.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.567
Since were dealing with a situation

00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:03.448
where we're starting in the ground

00:05:03.448 --> 00:05:04.946
and we're also finishing

00:05:04.946 --> 00:05:06.652
at the same elevation,

00:05:06.652 --> 00:05:09.067
and were assuming the air
resistance is negligible,

00:05:09.067 --> 00:05:10.983
we can do a little bit
of a simplification here.

00:05:10.983 --> 00:05:12.144
Although I'll do another version where

00:05:12.144 --> 00:05:13.440
we're doing the more complicated,

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.137
but I guess the way that
applies to more situations.

00:05:17.137 --> 00:05:18.220
We could say,

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.394
we could say "well what is our

00:05:19.394 --> 00:05:21.469
"change in velocity here?"

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:23.431
So if we think about just
the vertical velocity,

00:05:23.431 --> 00:05:25.114
our initial velocity,

00:05:25.114 --> 00:05:26.368
let me write it this way.

00:05:26.368 --> 00:05:29.050
Our initial velocity, and we're talking,

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.471
let me label all of this.

00:05:30.471 --> 00:05:32.062
So we're talking only in the vertical.

00:05:32.062 --> 00:05:33.385
Let me do all the vertical stuff

00:05:33.385 --> 00:05:34.660
that we wrote in blue.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.655
So vertical, were dealing
with the vertical here.

00:05:37.655 --> 00:05:40.755
So our initial velocity,
in the vertical direction,

00:05:40.755 --> 00:05:42.833
our initial velocity in
the vertical direction

00:05:42.833 --> 00:05:45.655
is going to be five meters per second.

00:05:45.655 --> 00:05:47.803
Is going to be five meters per second.

00:05:47.803 --> 00:05:50.625
And we're going to use
a convention, that up,

00:05:50.625 --> 00:05:55.259
that up is positive and
that down is negative.

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:57.697
And now what is going to
be our final velocity?

00:05:57.697 --> 00:05:59.055
We're going to be going up

00:05:59.055 --> 00:06:01.017
and would be decelerated by gravity,

00:06:01.017 --> 00:06:02.887
We're gonna be stationary at some point.

00:06:02.887 --> 00:06:05.661
And then were to start
accelerating back down.

00:06:05.661 --> 00:06:08.599
And, if we assume that air
resistance is negligible,

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:11.478
when we get back to ground level,

00:06:11.478 --> 00:06:13.776
we will have the same
magnitude of velocity

00:06:13.776 --> 00:06:15.983
but will be going in
the opposite direction.

00:06:15.983 --> 00:06:17.237
So our final velocity, remember,

00:06:17.237 --> 00:06:18.096
we're just talking about the

00:06:18.096 --> 00:06:19.911
vertical component right now.

00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:21.461
We haven't even thought
about the horizontal.

00:06:21.461 --> 00:06:22.585
We're just trying to figure out

00:06:22.585 --> 00:06:25.603
how long does this thing stay in the air?

00:06:25.603 --> 00:06:29.121
So its final velocity is
going to be negative five.

00:06:29.121 --> 00:06:30.886
Negative five

00:06:30.886 --> 00:06:32.069
meters per second.

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:33.219
And this is initial velocity,

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:35.704
the final velocity is going
to be looking like that.

00:06:35.704 --> 00:06:38.305
Same magnitude, just in
the opposite direction.

00:06:38.305 --> 00:06:39.825
So what's our change in velocity

00:06:39.825 --> 00:06:41.381
in the vertical direction?

00:06:41.381 --> 00:06:45.189
Change in velocity, in
the vertical direction,

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:47.397
or in the y-direction, is going to be

00:06:47.397 --> 00:06:51.994
our final velocity, negative
five meters per second,

00:06:51.994 --> 00:06:53.550
minus our initial velocity,

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.895
minus five meters per second,

00:06:55.895 --> 00:06:58.710
which is equal to negative 10

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.646
meters per second.

00:07:00.646 --> 00:07:02.692
So how do we use this information

00:07:02.692 --> 00:07:05.051
to figure out how long it's in the air?

00:07:05.051 --> 00:07:06.340
Well we know!

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.055
We know that our vertical, our change

00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:13.840
our change in our, in
our vertical velocity,

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.918
is going to be the same thing

00:07:15.918 --> 00:07:17.518
or it's equal to

00:07:17.518 --> 00:07:19.135
our acceleration

00:07:19.135 --> 00:07:20.842
in the vertical direction

00:07:20.842 --> 00:07:22.911
times the change in time.

00:07:22.911 --> 00:07:25.767
Times the amount of time that passes by.

00:07:25.767 --> 00:07:28.663
What's our acceleration
in the vertical direction?

00:07:28.663 --> 00:07:30.602
What's the acceleration due to gravity,

00:07:30.602 --> 00:07:32.204
or acceleration that gravity,

00:07:32.204 --> 00:07:35.446
that the force of gravity
has an object in freefall?

00:07:35.446 --> 00:07:37.281
and so this, right here, is going to be

00:07:37.281 --> 00:07:41.321
negative 9.8 meters per second squared.

00:07:41.321 --> 00:07:42.609
So this quantity over here is

00:07:42.609 --> 00:07:44.084
negative 10 meters per second,

00:07:44.084 --> 00:07:45.048
we figured that out,

00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:47.079
that's gonna be the change in velocity.

00:07:47.079 --> 00:07:49.889
Negative 10 meters per second

00:07:49.889 --> 00:07:51.607
is going to be equal to

00:07:51.607 --> 00:07:53.267
negative 9.8,

00:07:53.267 --> 00:07:56.286
negative 9.8 meters per second squared

00:07:56.286 --> 00:07:58.922
times our change in time.

00:07:58.922 --> 00:08:00.584
So to figure out the total amount of time

00:08:00.584 --> 00:08:01.479
that we are the air,

00:08:01.479 --> 00:08:03.701
we just divide both sides by

00:08:03.701 --> 00:08:06.932
negative 9.8 meters per second squared.

00:08:06.932 --> 00:08:08.219
So we get,

00:08:08.219 --> 00:08:09.052
lets just do that,

00:08:09.052 --> 00:08:11.297
I wanna do that in the same color.

00:08:11.297 --> 00:08:12.850
So I do it in,

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:14.174
that's not, well, that close enough.

00:08:14.174 --> 00:08:16.269
So we get negative 9.8

00:08:16.269 --> 00:08:18.731
meters per second squared.

00:08:18.731 --> 00:08:22.085
Negative 9.8 meters per second squared.

00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:23.247
That cancels out,

00:08:23.247 --> 00:08:25.325
and I get my change in time.

00:08:25.325 --> 00:08:26.625
And I'll just get the calculator.

00:08:26.625 --> 00:08:28.123
I have a negative divided by a negative

00:08:28.123 --> 00:08:29.365
so that's a positive, which is good,

00:08:29.365 --> 00:08:31.246
because we want to go in positive time.

00:08:31.246 --> 00:08:32.930
We assume that the elapsed time

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:34.462
is a positive one.

00:08:34.462 --> 00:08:35.420
And so what we get?

00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:37.933
If I get my calculator out,

00:08:37.933 --> 00:08:39.471
I get my calculator out.

00:08:39.471 --> 00:08:41.342
I have, this is the same thing as

00:08:41.342 --> 00:08:43.789
positive 10 divided by 9.8.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:45.372
10, divided by 9.8.

00:08:47.148 --> 00:08:48.315
Gives me 1.02.

00:08:49.923 --> 00:08:51.756
I'll just round to two digits

00:08:51.756 --> 00:08:53.289
right over there.

00:08:53.289 --> 00:08:55.706
So that gives me 1.02 seconds

00:08:58.119 --> 00:08:59.767
So our change in time,

00:08:59.767 --> 00:09:03.012
so this right over here is 1.02.

00:09:03.012 --> 00:09:05.538
So our change in time,

00:09:05.538 --> 00:09:09.033
delta t, I'm using lowercase now but

00:09:09.033 --> 00:09:10.810
I can make this all lower case.

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:12.143
Is equal to 1.02

00:09:13.617 --> 00:09:14.700
1.02 seconds.

00:09:16.571 --> 00:09:18.297
Now how do we use this information

00:09:18.297 --> 00:09:21.990
to figure out how far this thing travels?

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:23.802
Well if we assume that it retains

00:09:23.802 --> 00:09:27.064
its horizontal component of
its velocity the whole time,

00:09:27.064 --> 00:09:29.189
we just assume we can this multiply that

00:09:29.189 --> 00:09:30.825
times our change in time

00:09:30.825 --> 00:09:32.799
and we'll get the total displacement

00:09:32.799 --> 00:09:35.665
in the horizontal direction.

00:09:35.665 --> 00:09:36.826
So to do that, we need to figure out

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:38.104
this horizontal component,

00:09:38.104 --> 00:09:38.937
which we didn't do yet.

00:09:38.937 --> 00:09:41.933
So this is the component of our velocity

00:09:41.933 --> 00:09:44.646
in the x direction, or
the horizontal direction.

00:09:44.646 --> 00:09:48.181
Once again, we break out a
little bit of trigonometry.

00:09:48.181 --> 00:09:51.037
This side is adjacent to the angle,

00:09:51.037 --> 00:09:54.049
so the adjacent over hypotenuse
is the cosine of the angle.

00:09:54.049 --> 00:09:57.009
Cosine of an angle is
adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:09:57.009 --> 00:09:58.426
So we get cosine.

00:10:00.132 --> 00:10:02.594
Cosine of 30 degrees,

00:10:02.594 --> 00:10:04.114
I just want to make sure
I color-code it right,

00:10:04.114 --> 00:10:07.215
cosine of 30 degrees is equal to

00:10:07.215 --> 00:10:08.982
the adjacent side.

00:10:08.982 --> 00:10:10.723
Is equal to the adjacent side,

00:10:10.723 --> 00:10:14.362
which is the magnitude of
our horizontal component,

00:10:14.362 --> 00:10:17.722
is equal to the adjacent
side over the hypotenuse.

00:10:17.722 --> 00:10:19.889
Over 10 meters per second.

00:10:21.194 --> 00:10:23.817
multiply both sides by
10 meters per second,

00:10:23.817 --> 00:10:27.776
you get the magnitude
of our adjacent side,

00:10:27.776 --> 00:10:29.553
color transitioning is difficult,

00:10:29.553 --> 00:10:32.617
the magnitude of our adjacent side

00:10:32.617 --> 00:10:35.079
is equal to 10 meters per second.

00:10:35.079 --> 00:10:37.206
Is equal to 10 meters per second.

00:10:37.206 --> 00:10:38.751
Times the cosine,

00:10:38.751 --> 00:10:41.334
times the cosine of 30 degrees.

00:10:42.711 --> 00:10:44.187
And you might not remember

00:10:44.187 --> 00:10:45.568
the cosine of 30 degrees,

00:10:45.568 --> 00:10:47.252
you can use a calculator for this.

00:10:47.252 --> 00:10:49.063
Or you can just, if you do remember it,

00:10:49.063 --> 00:10:50.428
you know that it's the square root

00:10:50.428 --> 00:10:52.530
of three over two.

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:54.921
Square root of three over two.

00:10:54.921 --> 00:10:56.848
So to figure out the actual component,

00:10:56.848 --> 00:10:58.787
I'll stop to get a
calculator out if I want,

00:10:58.787 --> 00:10:59.732
well I don't have to use it,

00:10:59.732 --> 00:11:00.885
do it just yet,

00:11:00.885 --> 00:11:01.974
because I have 10 times

00:11:01.974 --> 00:11:03.797
the square root of three over two.

00:11:03.797 --> 00:11:05.933
Which is going to be 10
divided by two is five.

00:11:05.933 --> 00:11:07.998
So it's going to be five
times the square root of

00:11:07.998 --> 00:11:10.687
three meters per second.

00:11:10.687 --> 00:11:12.539
So if I wanna figure out

00:11:12.539 --> 00:11:14.906
the entire horizontal displacement,

00:11:14.906 --> 00:11:16.508
so let's think about it this way,

00:11:16.508 --> 00:11:19.051
the horizontal displacement,

00:11:19.051 --> 00:11:19.884
that's what we get for it,

00:11:19.884 --> 00:11:20.879
we're trying to figure out,

00:11:20.879 --> 00:11:23.555
the horizontal displacement,

00:11:23.555 --> 00:11:25.183
a S for displacement,

00:11:25.183 --> 00:11:28.481
is going to be equal
to the average velocity

00:11:28.481 --> 00:11:32.244
in the x direction, or
the horizontal direction.

00:11:32.244 --> 00:11:33.787
And that's just going to be this five

00:11:33.787 --> 00:11:35.174
square root of three meters per second

00:11:35.174 --> 00:11:36.840
because it doesn't change.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.245
So it's gonna be five,

00:11:38.245 --> 00:11:40.513
I don't want to do that same color,

00:11:40.513 --> 00:11:45.355
is going to be the five square
roots of 3 meters per second

00:11:45.355 --> 00:11:46.899
times the change in time,

00:11:46.899 --> 00:11:49.244
times how long it is in the air.

00:11:49.244 --> 00:11:52.402
And we figure that out! Its 1.02 seconds.

00:11:52.402 --> 00:11:53.985
Times 1.02 seconds.

00:11:55.297 --> 00:11:57.205
The seconds cancel out with seconds,

00:11:57.205 --> 00:11:58.503
and we'll get that answers in meters,

00:11:58.503 --> 00:12:01.909
and now we get our calculator
out to figure it out.

00:12:01.909 --> 00:12:06.292
so we have five time the
square root of three,

00:12:06.292 --> 00:12:07.209
times 1.02.

00:12:09.812 --> 00:12:11.812
It gives us 8.83 meters,

00:12:13.059 --> 00:12:13.892
just to round it.

00:12:13.892 --> 00:12:16.281
So this is going to be equal to,

00:12:16.281 --> 00:12:18.698
this is going to be equal to,

00:12:19.636 --> 00:12:21.603
this is going to be oh, sorry.

00:12:21.603 --> 00:12:24.478
this is going to be equal to 8.8,

00:12:24.478 --> 00:12:25.708
is that the number I got?

00:12:25.708 --> 00:12:26.541
8.83,

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:28.710
8.83 meters.

00:12:29.883 --> 00:12:30.815
And we're done.

00:12:30.815 --> 00:12:32.731
And the next video, I'm gonna try to,

00:12:32.731 --> 00:12:36.572
I'll show you another way
of solving for this delta t.

00:12:36.572 --> 00:12:37.405
To show you, really, that there's

00:12:37.405 --> 00:12:39.101
multiple ways to solve this.

00:12:39.101 --> 00:12:40.269
It's a little bit more complicated

00:12:40.269 --> 00:12:42.284
but it's also a little bit more powerful

00:12:42.284 --> 00:12:45.860
if we don't start and end
at the same elevation.
