00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.969
So, so far, you've learned
that thinking responsively,

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:07.680
means thinking about the user
experience for every device.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.250
&gt;From the small screen,
all the way up to the largest.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.720
&gt;&gt; And inputs too.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.760
Buttons need to be big.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.310
&gt;&gt; But responsive design,
goes beyond optimizing single elements.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.590
Now in lesson three and

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.700
four, you'll be taking a step
back to design page layout.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.970
Which means you'll need to think about,
what information you're presenting to

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.140
your user, and how you want elements
to be arranged on the page.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.260
Picking the right design pattern can
be more of an art than a science, so

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.430
you'll have a chance to try
a few different design patterns,

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.160
as this lesson progresses.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.790
&gt;&gt; And by the end of the next lesson,

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.950
lesson four, you'll take what you've
learned about responsive design

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.090
patterns to layout the project
in a way that looks great.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.040
No matter how users find your site.
