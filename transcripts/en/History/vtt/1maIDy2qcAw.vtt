00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.130
Let's show 'em in the
carriage house here.

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:02.770
There's a few good
items in there.

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:03.900
Yes, definitely.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.730
Whoa!

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:05.730
Whoa.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.370
- You have a high-wheel bicycle?
- Yes.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.070
MIKE WOLFE: Usually you
see them at an estate sale

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.170
or an auction or an
antique bicycle meet.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.170
I mean, this is one
that's just hanging

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.930
on the wall in an old shed.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.470
It's probably a 52-inch.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.830
How often do you see
something like that?

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:19.800
Can I take this off the wall?

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.000
Yes, you can take it off.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.430
MIKE WOLFE: There's some
parts and pieces missing,

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.170
but overall it's incredible.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.230
WOMAN: We didn't know much
about high-wheel bicycle.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.070
MIKE WOLFE: When I first
started collecting this stuff,

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.800
the only thing that
you could learn

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.600
would be from books or
talking to other collectors.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.430
There was no internet back then.
- Back then.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.970
- Correct.
- Yeah.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.000
Correct.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.200
WOMAN: David found
it, brought at home.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.570
I tried to get up, but I
couldn't reach the pedals,

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.030
so I held it for him
while he climbed up.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.330
He got on it and he
started to go down.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.100
MIKE WOLFE: Oh he did?

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.670
WOMAN: And he says, uh oh.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.800
And all of a sudden,
the whole front

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.100
went just like slow
motion right over

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.170
and landed right
out in the grass

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.270
and just crashed
into the ground.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.300
And I go, oh my gosh.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.300
MIKE WOLFE: It looks
like Colombia to me.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.500
Colombia was made by
a company called Pope.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.100
At one time, Pope was
the largest bicycle

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.770
manufacturer in the world.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.730
They also made motorcycles
and they made electric cars.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.270
90% of the time, if you
find a high-wheel bike,

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.530
it's made by Pope.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.770
That doesn't take away the
excitement of finding one

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.130
hanging on the wall in a shed.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.070
So you can see that the
rim here has been repaired.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.400
It was broken.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.130
See the rivets here, and they
added this section to it.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.970
Anything this old is
going to have issues.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.970
All of this seat hardware,
this is all wrong.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.930
Someone has drilled
a hole in here

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.670
to put a modern seat on it.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.200
There's been an amateur
restoration done to this bike.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.430
This would have had more
of a coil spring on it.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.400
The seat hardware
is not correct.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.130
The handlebars are not correct,
they're just pieces of pipe.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.530
There's no grips
on the end of 'em.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.670
It's missing the pedals.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.100
The rear wheel,
the axle is gone.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.630
It's missing the brake hardware.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.000
It would of had what
they call a spoon brake.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.330
There would've
been a lever here,

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.670
and then there would
of been a spoon that

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.470
went down and hit that tire.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.200
It doesn't actually
stop you, and you never

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.170
really wanted to grab it
fast anyway cause then

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.670
you would of went like this.
- Bye bye.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.330
MIKE WOLFE: There's a lot
of stuff that's missing.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.000
You've got the bone,
you've got the fork,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.430
a front wheel and a rear wheel.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.830
The most important
pieces are there.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.730
Depending on the
restoration, the bike

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.530
could bring as much as $5,000.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.130
That restoration would probably
cost you $3,500 to $4,000.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.130
Here's what I'd do to it.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.430
I got a guy that
works on high-wheels.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.530
I would just have him put it
together so you can ride it.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.530
Once it's rideable, then
it's worth more money.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.170
There's a group
called the Wheel Men.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.830
Their sole purpose is to
promote antique bikes,

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.100
and to get them
back on the road.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.100
The Wheel Men are
an organization

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.570
that's devoted to the
preservation and restoration

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.200
of these bicycle.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.870
Do you want me to make
you an offer on it?

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:04.470
Sure.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.300
$1,800.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.270
$2,200.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.230
MIKE WOLFE: If you could ride
this bicycle in the condition

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.200
that it's in, meaning the
handlebars are replaced,

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.730
the pedals are put
on it, the seat

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.270
hardware is addressed, the
tires, all of that stuff,

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.170
it'd be worth $2,800.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.230
If someone's going to buy it
to ride it, that's one thing.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.400
That's the kind of person
I would want to sell it to.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.330
If someone's going to buy
it to hang it on a wall,

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.530
I wouldn't sell
it to that person,

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.330
because they make
they reproduce them

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.400
and they can hang a
reproduction on the wall.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.130
OK.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.430
$1,900.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.870
I'm taking into consideration
the cost of repairs,

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.630
finding those rare
parts, and just

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.970
getting the bike up and running
again so you can ride it.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.330
That is the true value.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.200
Sounds good.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.670
- We're doing $1,900?
- Yeah.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.030
Am I double-shaking?

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.500
Thank you for saving it.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.770
Thank you for saving it.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:58.900
- It's a good piece.
- Awesome!

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.130
We don't come across
these every day either.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.200
WOMAN: No.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.800
MIKE WOLFE: Something
this old, unusual,

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.430
unique, and different, to
have it hanging on the wall

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.170
for that many years, how often
do you see something like that?

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.400
To have that experience gives
you hope that this stuff

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.300
is still out there.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.700
This one was still there.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.700
Maybe there's another
one somewhere else.
