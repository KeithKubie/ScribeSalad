 Hey guys, and welcome
to the, oh, goddamn.

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:02.602 line:92%
  (laughing)

00:00:02.635 --> 00:00:03.536 line:92%
   No, start over.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.638
  Gonna go from a 10
 to a four, gaywise.

00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:09.442 line:92%
  (electronic music)

00:00:09.475 --> 00:00:11.277
  Hey guys and welcome
 to The Other Show,

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.412
  my name is Chris
  Kelly, and this is

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:14.113 line:92%
   Sarah Schneider

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:15.348
   And we are the creators
  and executive producers

00:00:15.381 --> 00:00:16.416 line:92%
of The Other Two and we are here

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:18.518 line:92%
talking about the pilot episode

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:19.786 line:92%
  Episode One.

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:21.754
  Yeah with Brooke and
 Cary, Helene and Drew.

00:00:21.787 --> 00:00:22.588 line:92%
 Hello, hello!

00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:23.689 line:92%
  Hi you guys.

00:00:23.722 --> 00:00:25.525 line:92%
 Hello, Hello.

00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:27.427
 Oh my God, Mom I
 broke up with Lance!

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.261 line:92%
 What?!

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:29.796 line:92%
  Yes, two weeks ago.

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.364 line:92%
  Oh, honey.

00:00:31.397 --> 00:00:32.532 line:92%
 Are you doing okay?

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:35.301
   Yes, I'm great, I'm way
  better than I was before.

00:00:35.334 --> 00:00:36.402 line:92%
  No offense Lance.

00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:37.370 line:92%
 What?

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:39.572
  We always said that
 Carey felt like us

00:00:39.605 --> 00:00:42.708
 in our twenties, and Brooke
 feels like us currently,

00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:43.643 line:92%
  when we're wasted.

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:45.378 line:92%
  (laughing)

00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:47.413
  The alarming part is that
 is how I talk normally sober,

00:00:47.446 --> 00:00:49.449
so it's really, thanks
a lot what a compliment.

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:52.118
  I feel like while we were
 shooting you were like,

00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:55.321
 "This is who I am, I feel
 embarrassed that I am her."

00:00:55.354 --> 00:00:57.190
 No, truly I would read
scripts and be like,

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:59.826
  "Oh, I think you wrote
  this because I overshare.

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:03.429
 I'm so sorry," and
 it's just constantly

00:01:03.462 --> 00:01:05.198 line:92%
 being projected at me.

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:06.599
  Hi, I'm Carey
 Dubek and I'm reading

00:01:06.632 --> 00:01:09.669
 for the role of man at
 party who smells fart.

00:01:11.403 --> 00:01:13.639
  I guess people have only
 seen the pilot at this point,

00:01:13.672 --> 00:01:16.175
 but I will say that it gets
 rough and tough for you.

00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:17.410 line:92%
  Yeah, it gets really tough.

00:01:17.443 --> 00:01:19.378
  I'd say you go on
 fun journeys and you,

00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:21.280
  as an actor, get
  humiliated at every turn.

00:01:21.313 --> 00:01:22.315 line:92%
  Is that accurate?

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:23.483 line:92%
 Yeah, that's accurate.

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:25.685
  There's something about
  my face that reads as sad.

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:27.487 line:92%
 It's like this makes sense.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.654
   We'd have conversations
  where we were like,

00:01:28.687 --> 00:01:30.323 line:92%
"ooh, he cried in the last one,

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:31.257
 so he probably shouldn't
 cry for at least two more.".

00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:33.726
 Yeah, halfway through
filming I was like,

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.728 line:92%
 "oh, I'm not doing comedy."

00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:37.730 line:92%
  (laughing)

00:01:37.763 --> 00:01:39.465 line:92%
  No, you are.

00:01:39.498 --> 00:01:40.800
 It's a fun comedy on Comedy
 Central, Thursdays at 10:30.

00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:42.668 line:92%
  (laughing)

00:01:42.701 --> 00:01:44.137 line:92%
 Yeah.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.805
  I have seen one
 dick in four years.

00:01:45.838 --> 00:01:49.709 line:92%
This summer, Imma see 50 dicks.

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:50.543 line:92%
  Eww.

00:01:50.576 --> 00:01:53.713 line:92%
  No, it's empowering.

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:56.282
  Well, I had been dating
 someone for a very long time,

00:01:56.315 --> 00:01:59.385
and so, and then after
that relationship ended,

00:01:59.418 --> 00:02:01.320
 I didn't go on a
 quest to see 50 dicks,

00:02:01.353 --> 00:02:04.891
 but I was kind of like, I
 am reborn, let's hang, let's

00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:07.593
 party, and got to two, and
 then I married the second one.

00:02:07.626 --> 00:02:09.195 line:92%
  (laughing)

00:02:09.228 --> 00:02:10.363
 And that was, she said
that on her wedding...

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:11.464 line:92%
  That was my vows.

00:02:11.497 --> 00:02:12.365 line:92%
  Those were her vows.

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:13.399 line:92%
  That was beautiful.

00:02:13.432 --> 00:02:14.567 line:92%
  Thank you.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.302 line:92%
  Hi honey!

00:02:16.335 --> 00:02:18.771
   My embarrassing thing is
  I worked at a restaurant,

00:02:18.804 --> 00:02:20.406
an Italian restaurant
on the Upper West side,

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:24.510
  and it was me and there
  was one other gay waiter.

00:02:24.543 --> 00:02:27.680
  And one night my boss
  literally pulled me aside

00:02:27.713 --> 00:02:29.348
 and was like can you
 go get the other one.

00:02:29.381 --> 00:02:31.717
  I wanted you both
 to know last night,

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.488
 at my home, my wife and I
 watched Brokeback Mountain.

00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:36.956 line:92%
 Uh oh.

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.391 line:92%
  I didn't like it.

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:40.226 line:92%
  But, I watched it.

00:02:42.494 --> 00:02:43.930 line:92%
  Thank you.

00:02:43.963 --> 00:02:45.965
 Is it bad that I sort
of think about that

00:02:45.998 --> 00:02:48.768 line:92%
and I'm like oh, sweet?

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:50.469 line:92%
 It was sweet adjacent.

00:02:50.502 --> 00:02:53.206
  Is he gonna be
 like, legit famous?

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.308 line:92%
  No, there's no way.

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:56.509 line:92%
   Yeah, no, right?

00:02:56.542 --> 00:02:57.977
 I mean how big
 could he really get?

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.680 line:92%
(dramatic music)

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.285
 Well there's the other
three in my family.

00:03:06.318 --> 00:03:07.787
 My sisters auditioned
 for this show called

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.657
 American Juniors, which was
 a spinoff of American Idol.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:12.959
 The year after
 Kelly Clarkson won,

00:03:12.992 --> 00:03:14.760
 and one of them
 made it on the show.

00:03:14.793 --> 00:03:16.429 line:92%
 Yeah.

00:03:16.462 --> 00:03:18.531
   And they flew our whole
  redneck family to L.A.

00:03:18.564 --> 00:03:20.633
 And as soon as I got there,
 I like went to Melrose

00:03:20.666 --> 00:03:23.869
  and I bought a white
  belt and a Von Dutch hat.

00:03:23.902 --> 00:03:25.638
  So you were like
 I'm gonna be on TV,

00:03:25.671 --> 00:03:27.506
 get me to a store
 to buy a white belt.

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:28.440 line:92%
   Exactly.

00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:30.710
  And we sat on the
  side of the stage,

00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:32.878
 and then they would like
 cut to us and they'd be like

00:03:32.911 --> 00:03:34.280 line:92%
 Tarvers, what do you think?

00:03:34.313 --> 00:03:35.381 line:92%
 And we'd be like we love it.

00:03:35.414 --> 00:03:39.485
   But did people start
  knowing you from the show,

00:03:39.518 --> 00:03:40.686
  'cause you were always
  to the side of the stage?

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:42.588
  Well, yeah you're
 over to the side

00:03:42.621 --> 00:03:45.491
  and like, when you
  leave the studio,

00:03:45.524 --> 00:03:47.893
 people would be like
 Caitlin's brother!

00:03:47.926 --> 00:03:49.028 line:92%
 That's great.

00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:51.597
 And I was like
 basically at the time,

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.532
 I was like you can
 do nothing and people

00:03:53.565 --> 00:03:55.034 line:92%
 will sort of scream your name?

00:03:55.067 --> 00:03:56.235 line:92%
 I love Los Angeles.

00:03:56.268 --> 00:03:59.572
 Oh yeah, so did that made
your brain be like I love this.

00:03:59.605 --> 00:04:00.506 line:92%
  Yeah

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.941
   You weren't embarrassed
  or like oh no?

00:04:01.974 --> 00:04:03.876
  The cool parts of
 Carey where he's like

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:06.479
 I don't want this, I'm better
 than this, I did not have.

00:04:06.512 --> 00:04:09.515
 It was like oh
 man, I don't know I

00:04:09.548 --> 00:04:11.384
 guess maybe I could
 be Ryan Seacrest?

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:12.585 line:92%
  (laughing)

00:04:12.618 --> 00:04:14.453 line:92%
 Oh that was what you learned.

00:04:14.486 --> 00:04:15.655 line:92%
 Interesting.

00:04:15.688 --> 00:04:16.589 line:92%
 Please let's cut this.

00:04:16.622 --> 00:04:17.523 line:92%
  You aren't quite there yet.

00:04:17.556 --> 00:04:18.457 line:92%
  (laughing)

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:19.859 line:92%
  I didn't wanna be Seacrest,

00:04:19.892 --> 00:04:21.861
 but he was from
 Georgia and I was like

00:04:21.894 --> 00:04:23.496 line:92%
look what Seacrest did!

00:04:24.963 --> 00:04:27.566 line:0%
   Buckle up girls, there's
  a sexy new singer in town,

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:28.434 line:92%
and guess what?

00:04:28.467 --> 00:04:30.002 line:0%
  He just turned 13!

00:04:30.035 --> 00:04:33.539
 Case Walker, who plays
Chase, who plays the pop phenom

00:04:33.572 --> 00:04:34.907 line:92%
 is not here, but I guess let's

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:35.908 line:92%
talk about him behind his back.

00:04:35.941 --> 00:04:37.076 line:92%
  Yeah, let's do that.

00:04:37.109 --> 00:04:38.678
 That is a whole other
part of this show,

00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:42.048
 which is us four, in
 comparison to that.

00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:42.882 line:92%
  (laughing)

00:04:42.915 --> 00:04:44.550 line:92%
 Yeah.

00:04:44.583 --> 00:04:46.619
  To like a young, right
 out the gate, I'm talented,

00:04:46.652 --> 00:04:47.920
 know what I like, know
 what I do, know what

00:04:47.953 --> 00:04:49.655
  my brand is, know
  what my deal is.

00:04:49.688 --> 00:04:50.489 line:92%
  Yeah

00:04:50.522 --> 00:04:51.657 line:92%
  That's Case.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:52.725 line:92%
 We found him on the internet.

00:04:52.758 --> 00:04:56.896
 We found him on Musical.ly,
 which is like an app

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:57.930 line:92%
  (laughing)

00:04:57.963 --> 00:04:59.598 line:92%
 You can do it.

00:04:59.631 --> 00:05:00.800
  I can't even start talking
 about it, I don't know.

00:05:00.833 --> 00:05:02.635 line:92%
 I was there at some audition.

00:05:02.668 --> 00:05:03.536
  We brought you guys
 to the call backs.

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:04.570 line:92%
 Yeah.

00:05:04.603 --> 00:05:05.638 line:92%
  Oh my God.

00:05:05.671 --> 00:05:07.573
   He came in and was just
  like, they were like,

00:05:07.606 --> 00:05:08.440
  "Case, what have you been
  up to?", and he was like,

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:10.109
 "I've just been
 rising and grinding."

00:05:10.142 --> 00:05:11.677
   Oh, he said the
  grind never stops.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:12.945 line:92%
 The grind never stops.

00:05:12.978 --> 00:05:14.580
  He's like, ya know,
 the grind never stops.

00:05:14.613 --> 00:05:16.782
 Which is what I think
Ken Marino Streeter says

00:05:16.815 --> 00:05:19.418
 in the pilot, and then
 we have people say

00:05:19.451 --> 00:05:21.654
so many things that
Case says in real life.

00:05:21.687 --> 00:05:23.923
 We're like, 'Can we
 use this literally?'

00:05:23.956 --> 00:05:24.791 line:92%
 Yeah.

00:05:25.858 --> 00:05:27.059 line:92%
  I love this.

00:05:27.092 --> 00:05:28.193
  How do we wrap this
 up, what do we say?

00:05:28.227 --> 00:05:29.695
   Seacrest would know how
  to wrap this up, though.

00:05:29.728 --> 00:05:30.863 line:92%
 Yeah.

00:05:30.896 --> 00:05:32.098
  Do it Drew,
 here's your chance!

00:05:32.131 --> 00:05:33.699
  Be Seacreast, get
  us out of here.

00:05:33.732 --> 00:05:35.835
   Alright, guys
  well there it was.

00:05:35.868 --> 00:05:37.403 line:92%
  (laughing)

00:05:37.436 --> 00:05:38.671 line:92%
  That's it.

00:05:38.704 --> 00:05:41.674
  There it was, you
 loved it, it's fun.

00:05:41.707 --> 00:05:46.713
 And make sure to tune
 in later for House.

00:05:47.579 --> 00:05:48.481 line:92%
   That's good, that works.

00:05:48.514 --> 00:05:49.115 line:92%
  (laughing)

00:05:49.148 --> 00:05:49.982 line:92%
  Speaking of current.

00:05:50.015 --> 00:05:51.617 line:92%
  (laughing)

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.018 line:92%
  House is still on.

00:05:53.051 --> 00:05:53.919 line:92%
 Right?

00:05:53.952 --> 00:05:54.954 line:92%
  (electronic music)
