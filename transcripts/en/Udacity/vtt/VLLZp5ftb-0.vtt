00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.710
You might decide at some point that
you want to drop out of a class for

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:04.970
which you're registered.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.620
There are two times
that you can do this.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.830
One is in registration,
either in phase one or phase two.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.670
During this time, you can add and
drop classes whenever you want.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.110
&gt;From the home screen, click Add or Drop
Classes to get back to your schedule.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.170
Then, under the Action column, click
the menu for the class you want to drop.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.110
Then click Delete.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.450
Then click Submit Changes.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.560
When the screen refreshes, I'll see that
I'm no longer registered for that class.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.040
&gt;&gt; After registration ends,

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.160
you can still drop a class
until the withdrawal deadline.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.050
However, if you're withdrawing
after registration closes,

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.130
you'll receive a w on your
transcript for that class.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.790
To withdraw from a class,
go to the same Add or

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.070
Drop Classes link that
we clicked earlier.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.150
After registration closes,
you'll no longer see this delete option.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.730
Instead, you'll see a Withdraw option.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.890
Click that, and then click Submit
Changes to withdraw from the class.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.730
As long as you drop before
the registration deadline is over,

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.080
the drop will not be
noted on your transcript.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.500
That means that until the end of the
first week of class, you can join and

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.130
leave whatever class you want.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.410
After the end of
the first week of class,

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.560
withdrawing from a class will
get you a w on your transcript.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.590
To check the withdrawal deadline,
visit the registrar's website.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.520
The withdrawal deadline is
typically a little over

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.560
half way through the semester.
