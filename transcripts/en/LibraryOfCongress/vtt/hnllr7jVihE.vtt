&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Welcome.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.380
My name is Steve Winick, and I'm
here at the Library of Congress,

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.840
where I am interviewing
Bobby McMillon

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.230
for the American
Folklife Center.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.380
Bobby McMillon is,
among other things,

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.470
a recipient of the North
Carolina Folk Heritage Award.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.870
He is a singer and a folklore
expert, and we're going

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.850
to be talking about
his life in folklore

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.930
in North Carolina and elsewhere.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.150
So, Bobby, it's really
good to have you here.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.450
Thanks for coming.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.520
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: It's
nice to be here today.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.820
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So,
why don't we start

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.120
with you just telling
us a little bit

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.420
about where you're from?

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.890
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: Well,
I was born in Lenoir,

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.310
North Carolina, in
Caldwell County.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:01.120
My father grew up in the Cosby
section of east Tennessee,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.030
just across the Smoky Mountain--
into the Smoky Mountains,

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.160
across the state line.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.370
And, my mother grew
up in Mitchell

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.690
and Yancey Counties
in North Carolina.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.980
And, through a series
of happenings,

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.540
they met in Lenoir,
my parents did.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.790
And, I was born there.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.120
And so, my father grew
up in the Smokies,

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.230
my mother in the
Blue Ridge, and then,

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.490
Lenoir was a furniture town.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.580
And so, lots of people--

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.800
well, we had neighbors that
had been there for generations

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.750
in Caldwell County,
but we also--

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.100
there were people that came out
of northwestern North Carolina,

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.410
to work in the shops, we called
them, the furniture factories.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.450
From east Tennessee as well

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.770
as [inaudible], those
counties there.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.190
It was sort of like
a melting pot.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.450
And, my mother's
parents, my grandmother

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.670
and grandfather Woodey [assumed
spelling] had a great influence

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.790
on my early life.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.490
I was always close to them, and
my grandfather, he ran a store,

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.060
a grocery store, on
the Wilkesboro Road

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.800
between Lenoir and
the county line.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:34.050
And, he had come there in '49.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.410
One of his brother-in-laws
had worked

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.030
for the Broyhill family,
the furniture makers.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:49.190
And, one of the brothers of the
owners of the furniture company

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.320
that run the sawmill end
of it, had a apple house

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.700
that he wanted my grandfather
to turn into a store.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.490
And, that's how he wound

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.860
up in Caldwell County
from Mitchell County.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.160
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Alright.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.860
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: And so,
I grew up around them a lot.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.600
But, my grandfather kept
his home in the mountains.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.310
He had-- well, he had two
houses up there, actually.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.380
One that he built for
his oldest daughter.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.450
They didn't live in it long.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.690
But, the other one is the home
that my mother grew up in.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.680
And, he kept them after
he went to Lenoir.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.680
So, as a child, I would spend a
lot of time up there with them,

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.940
when they'd go [inaudible] home.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.310
And, one of my mother's
two sisters married a man

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.580
in Yancey County,
across the river

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.810
from where my mother grew up,
and raised her family there.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.440
And, I had three boy cousins
that I grew up around.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:59.010
And, their daddy's mom and
dad used to tell us tales.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.200
[laughs] They were both
born in the late 1800s,

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.920
and they had a lot
of stories to tell.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.970
A lot of witch tales, and
haint tales, and booger tales.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.520
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So, that
was your first experience

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.820
with stories, was [inaudible].

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.420
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: With stories,
was listening to that family,

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.950
as well as my parents and my
aunts and uncles would tell

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.400
about things that
had happened to them.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.020
They'd be bear tales, and
stories about mountain lions,

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.620
which in our part of the country
we always called painters rather

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:34.920
than panthers.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.020
[laughs] And, usually
they were black painters.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.200
And, they're still
being seen down there.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.580
[laughs] Although
the word out on the--

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.380
from the Forest Service is
that there aren't any, but.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.710
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: But, the
stories are still there.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.230
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: The
stories are still there.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.220
And, my youngest brother just
saw one a couple of weeks ago.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.520
[laughs]

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.820
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yes?

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.120
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon:
On his property.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.420
But anyway, that's
beside the point.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:08.820
I loved to hear those
stories as a child.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.710
And, when I was about--

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.890
well, from my father's side
there were a lot of stories

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.520
about blockading, or
moonshining, in east Tennessee,

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.860
the Cosby section, had one
of the biggest reputations

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.540
of making moonshine
of any of the areas.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.350
I know every place like
Wilkes in North Carolina,

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:37.550
and different counties had their
famous spots for making liquor,

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.770
but Cosby was one of them.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.290
And, that's where they
invented the submarine still.

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:45.590
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Alright.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.110
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: And, it
would only let a little bit

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.690
of the smoke out
from underground.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.500
It was underground, you see.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.600
And, if the moon was shining, it
would shine on that little puff

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.060
of smoke, and they called
it silver cloud liquor.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.360
[laughs]

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.660
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Nice.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.960
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: So, I got
a lot of stories from them.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:12.650
And, as I grew a little older,
I asked my grandfather--

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.720
at his home, he had a
Victrola talking machine,

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.130
and a lot of old records.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.100
And, I would play those.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.120
And, I asked him one time
who did he like the best

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.940
of those singers when he
was, you know, a younger man

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.560
and lived up there
in Mitchell County.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.810
He said, well, he guessed
the Chuck Wagon Gang,

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.810
and the Carter Family
was about his favorite.

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:43.500
And so, since I was real close
to him, I began to pay attention

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.000
to what they were singing.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.580
And, it really appealed
to me as well.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.920
But, little bit after
that, I began to notice

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.470
that there were certain
songs in the community

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.080
that people were singing that
were similar to those records

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.870
that my grandfather had,

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.890
but some of them would
have different tunes,

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.220
and different verses.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:10.180
Or, maybe more verses,
or even less.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.660
And so, I got curious about it.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:18.190
And, I loved to hear them sing.

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:26.050
And so, I began to
write down songs

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.300
that were known in my family.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:32.580
My dad's oldest brother married
a girl in his home community

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.310
at Cosby, in Tennessee.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:38.140
And, her mother, I always
knew her as Mamaw Phillips.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:42.890
She was not a blood grandmother,
but she was my first cousin's.

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:46.180
But, I always knew her as Mamaw.

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:51.720
She was a singer, and she loved
for me to come and get her

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.270
to sing, and me to sing
with her too, sometime.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:08:00.980
And, she taught me, at least 100
of the old songs that she grew

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:05.090
up with in the Smoky
Mountains in the early 1900s,

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:07.610
and well, throughout her life.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:10.250
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So, you sing
some of those songs today?

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:13.480
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: Some of
those songs I sing today.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:20.450
When I was 16, my English
teacher at high school,

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:23.220
her family went to church
where my grandfather preached.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.780
He was a Primitive
Baptist elder,

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.310
and I had grown up
in that church.

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:33.850
And, she knew that I liked old
music, and she had taken a class

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:36.460
at Appalachian under
Doctor Cratis Williams.

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:37.760
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yes.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.060
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: And,

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.730
she thought that it would
be interesting if I met him.

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:46.820
And so, she made an appointment
and took me up there, to Boone.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:51.040
And, I showed him what
I had written down.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.730
And, he said, you know,
in order to document it,

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:56.090
he wrote it out in the book.

00:08:56.090 --> 00:09:00.750
Showed me how to put down
who I'd learned from,

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.660
something about them
and their age.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.020
And, he said someday
that'll mean more

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.320
to you than you think--

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.620
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Sure.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:08.920
&gt;&gt; -- that it will.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.250
And, I thought, well, you know,
that's just something I like.

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:16.530
I didn't really have any
ambition about getting

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:20.030
in public, or doing
anything like that more.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:22.940
That it was just
interesting to me.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:28.500
Of course, I never did feel
like I was a good singer,

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:32.760
but somebody had to learn them.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.080
[laughs] And, I seemed
to be nominated

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.080
in that neck of the woods.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.980
So, I just, I kept at it.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:46.710
And, I would write down all the
songs that Mamaw Phillips and--

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:50.170
as it turned out, a woman that
we had-- her and her husband--

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:52.590
we had rented a home from them

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:55.320
when I was just about
3 years old.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.850
She used to sing and play music.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:00.290
And, after I got old
enough to know something

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:01.960
about the folk music, I found

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.420
out that she knew
the old ballads, too.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:11.380
And, her family were
blockaders when she was a girl.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:14.750
When the old folks made the
liquor up on the Brushy Mountain

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:18.740
in eastern Caldwell County,
her and her sisters would watch

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.040
out for the revenue men.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.960
And, they'd pass the time of day
singing those old love songs.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.260
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: And,
what was her name?

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.560
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: Aunt Lou
Brookshire [assumed spelling].

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.860
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Lou Brookshire.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.360
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: She was
a [inaudible] before she

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.290
ever married.

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:34.640
And, she taught me a
number of the old songs.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.170
Some of them were folk songs.

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:38.330
Some of them were Child ballads.

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:43.620
And, she was a great
one to talk to.

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:47.010
Her brother, as a matter of
fact, had written some songs

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:50.360
about some murders in
the Caldwell County area,

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.120
and about one time an episode

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.940
of getting caught
for making liquor.

00:10:54.940 --> 00:11:00.200
And, it was printed in the
North Carolina Folklore.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.330
And, I told her about
that, and she said, What?

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.100
And, she told her
brother about it.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:09.360
And, he wrote and told them that
he was the author of that song.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.860
And, they sent him a copy
of the book that it was in.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:14.160
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick:
Oh, that's great.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.460
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: But, anyway,

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:23.240
a few years after I'd met Doctor
Williams, or maybe a couple

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:29.320
of years, there was a senior
citizens' group in Lenoir

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.030
that invited him to come
and speak to their group.

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:34.730
And, he had another
appointment at that time,

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.850
and he referred them to me.

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:41.100
And so, that was the first time
I actually got up in public

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.560
and sang anything, you know.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.140
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: And, how
old you were [inaudible]?

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:48.750
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon:
I was about 18.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:54.260
[laughs] And-- but, the odd
thing was once I got up there,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.500
it didn't bother me to sing.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.400
The people didn't-- it didn't
frighten me or anything.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:03.000
It was preparing beforehand
that made me nervous.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.300
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:08.670
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: And so,
that started me singing once

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:12.430
in a while for a
group like that.

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:19.470
And then, about-- and, all this
time I was still learning songs

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:22.230
from a lot of the old people.

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:25.220
One of the-- Mister Broyhill,

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:28.850
his son operated the
sawmills they had

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:31.490
for the Broyhill people.

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:33.260
And, he loved old music.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:37.530
And, one of his workers was
a man named Ralph Ellison

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:38.830
[assumed spelling].

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:40.130
And, they called him Smiley

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:42.400
because he didn't
have any teeth.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.400
[laughs] And, he brought him
down to my grandpa's one time.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.440
And, he had a banjo
there and a guitar.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:52.760
And, he was playing some
Earl Scruggs something.

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:57.050
And, I asked him if he didn't
know any of the older songs.

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:59.980
And, he said, oh, you're wanting
something like Little Birdie.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:02.720
And, I said, well, that'd work.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.630
He pulled the finger picks off,

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:09.860
and went to playing
that the old way.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:15.860
And then, I forgot just what
I asked him, but he said,

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.160
you mean you're wanting
something

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.940
like Lord Daniel, aren't you?

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:23.100
And, I said, yes,
that'd be fine.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:27.320
And, he played Lord Daniel, and
The House Carpenter, and two

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.400
or three of them on the banjo.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:34.580
And, that began a lifelong
acquaintance with his family.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:42.180
His daddy was a, what Doctor
Williams called a mountain--

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:45.480
I can't think of the term.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.800
A ballad rhymer.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.420
He'd write ballads about
things that happened

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:51.920
up in Watauga County,

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:56.080
in the area near Meat
Camp, called Potterstown.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.830
He was related to
all those people.

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:02.560
And, one of the songs that he
had written about his cousin,

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.710
Merchant Potter [assumed
spelling], who was killed

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:08.410
by [inaudible] Brown,
his cousin,

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:12.140
Uncle Bill Ellison [assumed
spelling] wrote the song,

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:15.920
and he give a copy of it
to his cousin, Jim Brown,

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.220
who added a verse to it.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.180
Then, he gave it to a
[inaudible] man, who turned it

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:23.990
in to the Watauga
Democrat, which printed it

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:26.160
in the paper at Boone.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.140
And then, that's how the Brown
Collection got ahold of that.

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:34.060
And, they printed it in the
North Carolina Folklore.

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:38.920
So-- but Uncle Bill Ellison,

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.690
if I could have known
him 20 years earlier,

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:45.400
I could have had a stack
of songs that thick.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.250
He really knew, you know--

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:50.510
but he was toward
the end of his life,

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:53.230
and couldn't catch
his breath real well.

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:55.810
A lot of the old ballad
singers, they'd want you

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:57.620
to beg them to sing, anyway.

00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.180
They'd say, oh, I
can't sing today.

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:00.480
I got a cold.

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.140
Or, you know, my throat's
real sore this morning.

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:06.190
Sort of like mine is now.

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:08.680
But, they really just
want you to keep onto them

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.770
until they'd sing for you.

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:12.070
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:13.370
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: And so--

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:14.670
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So,
you got good at that.

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:15.970
Keep on asking-- and, yes.

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:17.270
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: Yes.

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:18.570
That's right.

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:22.580
And so-- and, he knew
a lot of the story--

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:27.040
the Potters were a pretty
wild bunch back in those days,

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.980
and a lot of killings had
happened in the family.

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:34.330
And, he knew the details,
and told me those.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:44.810
Well, it was about '72 or three

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:49.700
that I had [inaudible]
Caldwell Community College,

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:55.560
and needed to work more than
I needed to go to school,

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.850
so I took me a job

00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:02.080
at a wholesale grocery
store in Lenoir.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.410
And, they had me
driving a truck.

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:07.800
And, I just got fed up
with doing it one day.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.630
I just quit.

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:10.930
Don't know what struck me

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:13.900
that particular day
to quit, but I did.

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.460
And, that night, one of my
two best friends called me

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:19.550
and said my uncle, T.R.
Burne [assumed spelling]

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:25.620
who was the only obstetrician
in Wilkesboro at that time,

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:29.100
wants to go to Union
Grove, and said if you'd go,

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:37.720
he'd be on call, but he'd let
you drive his Corvette [laughs]

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.390
for the weekend.

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:42.150
And so, I said I
guess I could go.

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:47.100
And then, while I was down
there, I met a lot of people

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:51.170
that I would become
friends with over the years.

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:53.540
[inaudible] from Madison County,

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:55.060
and Betty Smith [assumed
spelling],

00:16:55.060 --> 00:17:00.130
and there was a couple
there that was from Cosby

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:04.040
that caught my interest.

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:06.580
Their name was Jean and Lee
Shelton [assumed spelling].

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:08.150
And, they had a dulcimer shop.

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:12.650
And, they also ran the Folk
Festival of the Smokies.

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:18.480
And, they had a-- they were
selling recorders and dulcimers

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:23.130
at the-- it was at the
fiddler's grove section--

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:27.610
they'd already broken the
Fiddlers' Convention up.

00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:31.890
And, [inaudible] ran
the Fiddlers' Grove.

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:35.370
And, I introduced myself
to them, and told them

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:38.870
that I knew a number
of songs that I learned

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:41.780
from Crosby, where they lived.

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:46.180
And, Jean was the daughter
of a famous bootlegger

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.130
from up there [inaudible].

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:52.500
He was still in prison
at the time I met her.

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:53.800
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Wow.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.370
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: Him and his
brother had robbed the Charlotte

00:17:55.370 --> 00:18:00.310
mail train in the '30s, and
was put away for about ever.

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:08.730
But, anyway, she said that
if you'll come and join us

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:12.090
to prepare for our
folk festival on Cosby,

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.820
said I'll introduce
you to Janette Carter

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:18.050
of the old Carter Family.

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:22.350
And so, that's about all the
persuading I needed for that.

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:26.600
And, she was wanting to learn
some of the songs that I knew.

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:31.160
And so, while I was down
there, I met Janette Carter.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:35.420
And, Janette invited me
to come to where she lived

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:40.320
in Maces Springs, Virginia and
see where her daddy was born.

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:47.440
We started a, well, the rest
of her life, I knew Janette.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:51.510
I was with her when she first
started her music-making

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:53.470
down at her daddy's store.

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:59.620
Then they built the Fold up
there, the Carter Family Fold.

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:03.200
But, just a little
while after that,

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.510
my friend Cody Lowe
[assumed spelling],

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:08.290
whose uncle had invited
me to Union Grove,

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:13.610
because of my interest in old
music, he needed an elective,

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:17.710
and he was taking
[inaudible] at UNC.

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:23.160
So, he took Doctor Daniel
Patterson's folk song class.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.900
And, he said, you ought
to come down here,

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.120
and go with me to class one day.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:32.170
I said, well, I'd like to go to
see him anyway, because I'd go

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:34.510
in the library and
look at the books.

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:36.980
And, go to the Intimate
Bookshop, and Record Bar,

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:41.910
and have a good vacation
away from home.

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:44.450
So, I went and sat
in on his class.

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:46.700
And, when it was
over, he took me back

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:48.170
to meet Doctor Patterson.

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:53.210
And, he said, well, what's
some of the songs you know?

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:58.060
And, he told me later he was
expecting me to sing something

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.320
like May I Sleep in Your
Barn Tonight, Mister?

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:04.200
Or, some of the songs that were
popular, you know, in the '20s.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.500
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:08.000
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: Thirties,
maybe, from recordings.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.240
And, I sang him a version

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:16.100
of Mellinger Henry [assumed
spelling] called it Home,

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:17.400
Dearie, Home.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:21.750
It was a bawdy song that I'd
learned from Mamaw Phillips.

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:24.340
And then, I sang him
The House Carpenter.

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:26.990
And, his eyes started
getting bigger.

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:31.750
And, before the day was
over, we'd become friends.

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:35.630
[laughs] And, he took me to
[inaudible] and showed me the--

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:38.930
gave me a private showing
of John Cohen's film

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:41.140
of End of an Old Song.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.440
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.740
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon:
Is that right?

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.040
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yes.

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.340
The Dillard Chandler film.

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:47.640
Yes.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.940
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: Yes.

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:50.240
And, I said, well,
wait a minute.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.930
He said-- the word was out that
Dillard was dead, and I said,

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:56.120
no, I don't think he's dead.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.430
I think he's still living.

00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:07.870
But anyway, from-- one of Dan's
students was a boy named George

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:12.260
Holt, who became the first
director of the Folklife Office

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:15.510
at the North Carolina
Arts Council.

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:20.020
And, another student, I think,
[inaudible] say Allen Tullos,

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:22.570
who came to work
for the Smithsonian.

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:25.240
He was in that class.

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.920
I met him that day.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:31.940
I think Kip Lornell was in
that-- I don't know why,

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.240
everything just fell together.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.410
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So, you met a
lot of folklorists all at once.

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:38.710
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: Yes.

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:41.590
Yes. And so, it was
about a year later

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:44.400
that George Holt called
me, and wanted me to come

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.490
to the first Folklife
festival they had at Durham.

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:49.370
And then, I went
to the second one.

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:52.170
I think it was at
[inaudible], maybe.

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:54.880
No. I'm not sure.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:22:00.830
But, anyway, it was just
a couple of years later

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:06.250
until Allen called on me, and
scouted me and a bunch of them

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:09.060
from Madison County to go

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:12.280
to the Smithsonian
for the bicentennial.

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:19.920
And, in a lot of words,
that's sort of what, you know,

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.740
got me started in this.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:23.110
Through George's efforts,

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:26.550
I applied for the
visiting artist program

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:29.050
and the artist in
residence program.

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:31.550
And, I worked in
the schools trying

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:36.090
to awaken the children's
awareness of their own culture

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:40.050
and what their parents
might [inaudible] at home.

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:42.790
And then, I worked in
the community colleges

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:44.750
for four or five years.

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:48.460
And, that was just a little
summary of my-- [laughs]

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:51.030
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Well, I think
some of the interesting things

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:54.540
that you mentioned, one,
the fact that you got

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:57.210
into the songs a little bit
though first hearing some

00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:00.130
of those old records,
and recognizing

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:02.780
that in your community,
there were songs

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:04.490
that were similar to those.

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:08.260
And, I think, that's a way that
a lot of people who aren't part

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.960
of your community get
interested in those songs, too.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.940
And then, they go
looking for them.

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:17.540
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: You know,
I thought when I was a child

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:21.050
that songs were composed
to be recorded.

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:22.350
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:26.870
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: And, that's
what threw me off for a time.

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:31.300
And then, by accident,
when I was about 14 or 15,

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.280
I was in the library and came

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.520
across the Frank
Brown collection

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:38.770
of North Carolina Folklore,
and I saw all these songs

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:42.120
that I was hearing
in the country,

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:43.750
and they were different
versions.

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:45.980
And, some of them were
longer, and shorter.

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.650
And, that answered my question.

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:52.050
And, from that point
on, I was hooked.

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:57.790
But, the best part of all of it
was getting to know the people,

00:23:57.790 --> 00:24:01.230
and sitting on their
porches and talking to them.

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:03.290
And, listening at them sing.

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:06.610
One of my third cousins
taught me the first

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:09.480
of the old Child ballads
that I ever heard.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.890
Fair Ellinor and the Brown Girl.

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:15.590
I was at his house.

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:18.600
My daddy had bought
me a tape recorder,

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.670
and his wife was singing
some songs that she knew

00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:25.530
from the '20s and '30s, and
he was shaving in the house.

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:27.650
About that time I heard
something about lords

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:30.340
and ladies, and I said,
Nate [assumed spelling],

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:31.640
where did you learn that?

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.890
He said, Pap sang it for me.

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:37.690
And, he knew the
whole ballad of it.

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:41.220
It was like that you
could-- from that point on,

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:46.840
it was always like it
brought the past to real life.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:51.320
It was like I could go down the
road, and go around the bend,

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:54.240
and see somebody on
a milk-white steed,

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.500
or a castle sitting there.

00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:00.620
And, I mean, these people
that were singing them,

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:03.610
had no connection
with the old country.

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:06.040
But yet, they were
singing what had come

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.340
by word of mouth to them.

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:08.640
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yes.

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.940
That was the connection.

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:11.770
Yes. Yes. So, I mean, but
that also opens an interesting

00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:15.190
question, which is, within the
community, there were all kinds

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:17.670
of different songs, including
those really old ones

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:20.610
that had references
to Britain and Europe,

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:22.170
and steeds and castles.

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:24.760
But then, other things
like Tom Dooley.

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:28.400
And then, the ones that even you
met the people who wrote them.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.960
Were you aware that there
were different kinds

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.830
of songs like that originally?

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:35.820
Or, did it-- was that
something you gradually learned?

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:40.930
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: Well, see
everybody that sang back then,

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:44.260
they might sing Barbara
Allen, and then turn around

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:47.600
and sing George Jones's
The Window Up Above.

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.900
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yes.

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.200
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: And so,

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.390
I just realized it was
just what they had learned.

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:57.860
And, as I began to look
more into the, like,

00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:00.440
into the Brown Collection
and others--

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:04.040
Cecil Sharp, I soon
discovered him,

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.450
and knew how he went about it.

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:10.930
I knew that there were
different versions.

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:13.030
I mean, there were
the American songs,

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:15.990
as well as the European songs.

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:18.680
And, it was all just
a part of it.

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.250
They didn't differentiate.

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:21.550
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:22.910
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: Between one.

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:29.520
And, another thing, one of my--
when I went to school as a boy,

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:32.670
I lived not far from
the Wilkes County line.

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:36.830
And, a number of my
playmates in school,

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:39.790
and some of the older
people that I knew

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:43.690
in the community was related
to the characters from--

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:45.860
that were related to Tom Dooley.

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:50.680
And then, my grandmother told
me the story of Frankie Silvers,

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:56.330
who was hanged for cutting
her husband's, I mean,

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:58.860
chopping his body up one night.

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:02.410
And, she was the only woman
that, to my knowledge,

00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:07.270
that was ever legally
hanged in North Carolina.

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:11.940
And then, from a great-aunt
of mine, I learned the tune

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:14.610
from it, and then Lou
Brookshire that I knew

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:17.060
in Caldwell County
knew a different tune,

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:19.480
but she knew the same words.

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.780
And--

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:22.710
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: And, that was
Frankie and Charlie Silver?

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:24.730
Do you have a family
connection to them?

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:26.030
I thought I read somewhere--

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:27.670
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: Charles
Silver's daddy was the brother

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:29.430
to my great-great-great-great-
grandfather.

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:30.730
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Alright.

00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:32.790
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: And, only
in the last couple of years,

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:36.220
I knew that Charles' mother
died when he was born,

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:40.150
and his daddy married and
had a big family after that.

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:46.510
But, his mother was
my grandmother's

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:52.970
great-grandfather's
great-grandmother's sister.

00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:54.270
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: OK.

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:55.570
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: So,
I was kin to Charles

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:57.810
through my grandmother
and my grandfather.

00:27:57.810 --> 00:27:59.110
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:02.430
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: And-- but,
I heard the story as a child.

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:04.770
My grandmother didn't
know that connection.

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:07.890
I just dug it out, you know,
looking through genealogy,

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:12.250
and finding out the
facts of the case.

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:16.960
But, I could see that from
my grandfather's house

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:20.260
in Mitchell County, I could
look out the back window,

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:24.630
and see where the ranch
ran into the river,

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:29.090
where Frankie was supposed to
have walked, and punched holes

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:30.830
in the ice to make people think

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:34.300
that her husband
had fallen through.

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:37.840
Then up the road a little
ways were some rocks

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:41.650
where she was supposed to have
hidden his lights, the lungs,

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:45.520
and the guts, and parts that
don't burn easily, under a rock.

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:47.670
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:48.970
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: But--

00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:50.690
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Well,
that'll get you believing

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:52.700
in the haint stories,
too, right?

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:54.440
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon:
Oh, I was afraid to go

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.740
out of doors [inaudible].

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:58.670
We didn't have a
bathroom in the house.

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:05.140
And so, at night, until bedtime,
you had to go off the porch.

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:07.000
And, I was afraid to go outside,

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.570
because I thought I'd see her
spirit coming around the road

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:14.260
with red eyes, and a
bloody axe in her hand.

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:15.560
[laughs]

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:16.860
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So, that was
part of the story they told?

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:19.820
That is scary.

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:21.620
And, I guess that's the song

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:23.590
that you're mostly
associated with.

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:26.860
Partly because of Dan
Patterson's book that was

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:28.310
about you and your
connection to [inaudible].

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:29.610
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: Yes.

00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:33.100
He was interested in my
version of the story,

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:35.540
and dug all of that out.

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:36.840
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yes.

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:38.150
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon:
Put that together.

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:39.520
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So, another
thing that you've done,

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:42.060
you've talked about it a little
bit, is your own collecting.

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:44.160
You've visited with
people, with--

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:47.680
I mean, you've done all the
work that we're doing here.

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:50.410
Oral histories, and
folklore collection.

00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:53.230
What was that like, begin a
community member who also went

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:54.690
out with a tape recorder
[inaudible]?

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:57.460
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: It was fun.

00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:06.210
[laughs] Up until I was in about
the 11th grade in high school,

00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:10.260
my dad went and bought me
a small handheld RCA tape

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:12.040
recorder, would hold
a 5-inch reel.

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:16.790
Would run either by
electricity or batteries.

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:18.620
But, up until then,
I just learned them

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:21.080
like everybody else did.

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:22.380
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Sure.

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:23.680
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon:
By hearing them,

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.980
and trying to remember
the tunes.

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:26.280
And, I would write
down the words.

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:30.290
Well, then I got that, and then,

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:33.320
I would get them
to sing the tunes.

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:37.150
And then, a lot of the
stories, like my great uncle,

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:42.080
my mother's brother-in-law's
father,

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:45.590
that told me the old
haint tales and stuff,

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:49.870
I knew he'd be self-conscious
if he knew I was recording him.

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:52.500
And, in his house, he
had a big coal stove

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.260
in the middle of
the living room.

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:58.380
And, his chair was over yonder
on the other side of it,

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:00.890
and he'd sit and smoke his pipe.

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:03.840
And, there was a couch on
this side of the stove.

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.580
So, I would sit facing him,

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:10.330
and I'd have my tape recorder
beside me, and I'd turn it on

00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:12.810
and record him telling
all those old--

00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:16.640
he had some great old stories,
about things that happened

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:19.980
in the Caldwell County,
Tennessee, Mitchell County,

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:25.180
North Carolina, area in
the 1800s, and 1900s.

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:29.410
And, those old ghost stories.

00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:33.890
And, what I would do, I
knew that it'd be obvious

00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:35.710
that I had something in my hand.

00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:40.130
I'd record a couple of Carter
Family songs when I'd go in,

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:42.190
and I'd play the
Carter Family music,

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:44.960
because I knew they'd love that.

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.260
And, they did.

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:49.320
And then, when I turned that
off, I'd just turn it on

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:52.670
and let it records
while I talked to him.

00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:54.080
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: See, we
wouldn't be able to do that,

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:56.510
but when it's your own family--

00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:57.810
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: Yes.

00:31:57.810 --> 00:31:59.110
Yes.

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:00.410
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick:
You take liberties.

00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:01.710
Yes.

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:03.010
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: I
seldom ever done it.

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:04.310
When I was getting
music, only one time,

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:08.210
Aunt Lou Brookshire one time,
she wasn't quite ready to sing

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:11.860
or something, or she didn't
quite have the tune set

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:16.160
in her mind, and she
said, you've got that on,

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:18.470
and wanted me to turn
it off for a minute.

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:21.690
But then, after she got going,
she let me turn it back on.

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:22.990
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick:
She was OK with it?

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:24.290
Yes.

00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:25.590
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: Yes,
but most of the people,

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:29.930
when I was recording the
songs, that didn't bother them.

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:31.230
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:32.530
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: To run it.

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:34.830
And, you know, I didn't--

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:44.520
It was always such a personal
thing, I really didn't--

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:48.010
you know, in books I might have
been a little more academic,

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:51.670
because I was looking to find
out where all this came from.

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:55.010
But, as far as actually
going out and hearing it,

00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:58.180
and singing it, and sharing
songs with the people,

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:02.170
it was like I was more of
a family-type atmosphere.

00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:06.180
And so, I had to
distinguish that.

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:10.240
I got to thinking one
day that it was odd

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:15.960
that in Caldwell County I knew
the story Tom Dooley well.

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:21.100
And, Cliff Broyhill
that introduced me

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:25.500
to the Ellison family, also
introduced me to an old man

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:29.160
who was born in the 1880s,
who was the grandson of one

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:32.590
of the Dooley women that
lived in Tom Dooley's days,

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:34.970
and he knew a version
of it that wasn't

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:38.440
like the Kingston Trio's at all.

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:44.060
And, he told me the whole story.

00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:50.890
And-- but also, the
songs that I learnt--

00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:53.810
the families that I knew
real well, the Potters,

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:57.360
all lived on the border of
the Ashe and Watauga County.

00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:00.780
And, my mother's people
lived from the southern part

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:05.340
of Avery County all through
Mitchell and Yancey County.

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:11.020
And then, I became just,
almost a member of the family

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:12.320
of the Wallins [assumed
spelling]

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:16.020
over in Sodom, in
Madison County.

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:20.530
And, knew them, well, from
back in those days until now.

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:25.970
And then, my daddy grew up
one county from Madison,

00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:28.600
the next door county
in Tennessee.

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:30.390
And so, I was really lucky.

00:34:30.390 --> 00:34:34.500
And then, also, my
father growing

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:38.150
up in the Primitive Baptist
church, they always sang

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:41.970
from the shape notes,
hymnals after they had books

00:34:41.970 --> 00:34:44.620
that had the notes in.

00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:50.050
And, I noticed early on
that many of the tunes was

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:53.880
in a real similar style to
the way they sang at church.

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:59.170
They were often in a minor
key, and when anybody was--

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:03.050
not many of the people
could read the notes,

00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:05.100
although they had
singing schools.

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:12.680
But, the style would be very
similar to the ballad singing.

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:15.230
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: And, did people
ever sing those church songs

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:16.530
at home as well?

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:18.330
Like, sing some of
the religious songs?

00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:19.630
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: Right.

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:27.700
Mamaw Phillips who grew up there
on Cosby, she taught me a number

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:32.080
of the songs that she
learned growing up.

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:36.070
She'd sing-- one was
called The Old Churchyard.

00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:37.370
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yes.

00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:38.960
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon:
An old, old song.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:41.420
And, I always loved
that because it had

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:45.340
such a haunting tune to it.

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:49.410
And then, when she was a
young girl, she would go

00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:52.580
to [inaudible] meeting,
they had other kind

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:55.170
of Baptist churches
over there too.

00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:58.860
And, Methodist, and you know.

00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:01.500
And, she taught me one.

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:07.370
[singing] I do believe without
a doubt Christians has a right

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:08.670
to shout.

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:09.970
I'm happy.

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:12.030
I'm happy.

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:16.760
Oh, my the Lord continue
with me.

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:20.120
And, she learned those
at [inaudible] meetings.

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:23.720
And When the Last
Trumpet Shall Sound.

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.020
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:27.140
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: They
were all lumped together,

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:30.700
the meeting house songs
as she called them.

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:33.730
And, they always
called them love songs,

00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:38.330
everywhere that I lived
and went to up in there.

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:40.820
They were always,
always love songs,

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:42.720
unless they were religious.

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:45.260
And then, they were
called meeting house songs.

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:47.760
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So, the
old ballads, as well as the,

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.940
sort of, Tom Dooley-style
ballads, those were all,

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:51.240
kind of, called love songs?

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:52.590
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: They
were love songs, right?

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:54.970
Well, if you had them
written down, now,

00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:57.790
then they were called ballads.

00:36:57.790 --> 00:36:59.090
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Ballads.

00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:00.390
Right.

00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:01.690
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon:
Or, song ballads.

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:02.990
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:04.290
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: But,
church house songs,

00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:06.480
or meeting house songs were the
only differentiation they had

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.120
between the two.

00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:13.180
But, Tom Dooley was a love song
was just like The Great Titanic.

00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:14.480
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yes, yes.

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:15.780
Or Fair Ellindor.

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:17.080
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: Yes, right.

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:18.380
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Alright.

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:20.590
So, let's talk a little

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:23.640
about the North Carolina
Heritage Award.

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:28.970
How'd you find out that
they'd selected you for that?

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:33.630
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon:
That was in, I guess,

00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:35.210
you're asking me something now.

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:38.320
My short-term memory
[inaudible] used to be.

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:41.990
I can tell you hundreds
of songs,

00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:47.290
but trying to remember what
happened on certain times.

00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:53.340
Yes, in 2000, through
an acquaintance

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:55.740
with Sheila Kay Adams,

00:37:55.740 --> 00:38:02.020
a man from New York named Jerry
Epstein had me to go to England.

00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:05.630
He made appointments
at different folk clubs

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:08.150
for a month over there.

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:15.050
And so, I got to go to
England, and Wales, and Ireland.

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:17.520
And, later that year,
they called me.

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:19.250
I don't know who.

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:23.540
It might have been
Wayne Martin, who is--

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:25.710
well, he's over the
Arts Council now,

00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:28.650
rather than the Folklife
Center, I guess.

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:30.330
I believe he's the
one that called

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:36.080
and told me they had picked
me to be one of the recipients

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:39.420
of the North Carolina
Folk Heritage Award.

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:43.010
And, he said, by the way,
you'll also be the youngest

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:48.120
that we've ever selected.

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:51.670
I said, you thought I was
going to die, didn't you?

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:56.530
[laughs] Wanted to give it to
me before I kicked the bucket.

00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:57.830
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:00.850
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: But, I think
it was Wayne that called me

00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:02.920
and told me about that.

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:04.220
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Great.

00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:06.290
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: That
was really enjoyable.

00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:08.840
It's funny, that was
a really good year.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:12.840
I got that award, got to
go to England, and then,

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:17.500
a woman named Sara
Grey was in charge

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:22.920
of the Pinewood-- what's it?

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.270
The Pinewoods--

00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:26.380
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick:
Pinewoods folk music camp.

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:29.670
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: Camp, yes,
at Plymouth, Massachusetts.

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:35.640
And, they were having bunches
over from England and Ireland.

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:39.340
And, she invited me and
my sister-in-law to go up,

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:42.070
and be there that week.

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:44.610
So, it was real eventful year.

00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:45.910
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yes.

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:47.210
Sounds great.

00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:50.290
One other thing to ask about.

00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:53.260
We did mention your
connection to Daniel Patterson,

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:57.450
Doctor Patterson, but he's
also-- he wrote a book,

00:39:57.450 --> 00:39:59.850
essentially about you,
and about your connection

00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:01.150
to the Frankie Silver ballad.

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:02.460
So, how did that develop?

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:04.610
How did you get to be so close,

00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:07.570
and to talk to him
so much about that?

00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:12.020
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: Well,
Doctor Patterson and I,

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:15.740
after our first meeting,
I always stayed in touch.

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:19.110
And, he would have me come
occasionally for his classes.

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:23.280
He would get little
grants to have me come

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:25.400
and do some work for UNC.

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:31.930
And, of course, he was in
connection with Wayne Martin

00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:37.520
and George Holt,
and all of those.

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:41.830
And that was one of the first
songs that I had ever sung

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:44.770
for him, and told him
that story, maybe at one

00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:46.560
of his classes, I guess it was.

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:49.840
And, he used to have
home parties sometimes,

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.140
and I'd come to that.

00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:59.210
And, he began to think that
that might make a good premise

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:00.610
for a book.

00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:03.720
And, I told him, my
mother told me a story.

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:07.450
I never heard it when I was real
little, but my mother told me

00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:11.790
that she said, you know up
there where Frankie's cabin was,

00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:17.370
after the old cabin fell in,
there was another one built

00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:19.710
where the fireplace was.

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:24.090
And, it had begun to fall
in by the time I came along.

00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:29.300
And, Momma said that one time
we were all-- went for a walk,

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:32.600
and just walked up the holler
where that had happened,

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:38.120
and she said that there
was-- I can't remember now--

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:40.550
might have been a
crabapple tree.

00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:42.810
There was a tree
that grew up there.

00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:48.880
And, she said she always
heard that if you got into it,

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:51.650
you couldn't get
out without help.

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:56.160
And, she said-- I must have been
about two or three year old--

00:41:56.160 --> 00:42:00.120
she said, sure enough I
went right up to that tree,

00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:02.600
and I couldn't get
out to save my life.

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:05.540
I probably got tangled
up in it, I don't know.

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:09.250
But, she had to get me out.

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:14.490
And, Dan thought that that would
make a great title for the book,

00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:19.020
so he called it A Tree
Accurst: Bobby McMillon

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:21.720
and stories of Frankie Silver.

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:24.740
And, my grandmother's uncle,

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:28.460
Ladd Hughes [assumed spelling]
told the story a little

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:31.670
different than most everybody
around there ever had.

00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:35.660
He said that her
father, Frankie's father,

00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:38.710
ate supper with them, the
night Charlie got killed.

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:42.530
And, when he got done eating,
he said, I think I'll lay down.

00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:45.580
And, she told him
she'd laid a sheepskin

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:47.520
in front of the fireplace.

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:51.710
Thought he'd want to play with
the baby until he got sleepy.

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:54.470
And, when he went to
sleep, her daddy said,

00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:56.690
now's your time, Frankie.

00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:58.560
Now's your time.

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:01.520
And so, she went
and got the axe.

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:02.820
She'd done sharpened it.

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:06.320
I'd forgot, through
cutting up the wood.

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:10.680
And, she'd rare back
at him, to hit him.

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:12.360
He was laying on his back.

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:15.650
Said every time she would,
he'd smile at her in his sleep.

00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:16.950
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Wow.

00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:18.900
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: And, she
done that about three times.

00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:21.680
And, every time she'd give
up and wouldn't do it.

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:23.390
She said, I can't kill him, Dad.

00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:27.190
Said, he's smiling
at me in his sleep.

00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:32.840
And, her daddy said if you
don't kill him, I'll kill you.

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:36.970
And, finally he talked her
into taking a whack at him.

00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:39.280
And, she give him one
lick to the head, and run

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:40.580
and jumped in the bed.

00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:43.160
And, her daddy, they said
that he cut his head off

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:46.330
with such force, that the
head bounced to the rafters

00:43:46.330 --> 00:43:47.890
and blood went everywhere.

00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:52.000
But, he chopped him up, and
done the rest [inaudible] put

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.240
on his boots, went
down to the river.

00:43:56.240 --> 00:44:03.550
And, that was never in any of
the official stories about that.

00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:10.540
But, Charles's father, who
lived in the old log cabin,

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:12.700
which is still there,
by the way,

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:16.210
and still able to be lived in.

00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:19.040
It's like, the best log
house he was ever in.

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:24.070
When I was a kid,
the man, the Silvers,

00:44:24.070 --> 00:44:27.570
that had [inaudible] it,

00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:32.000
his wife was my grandmother's
first cousin.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.190
And, Will Silvers told
my grandfather Woodey

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:39.290
that he believed that the reason
that Charles was killed was

00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:42.520
that her people wanted
to go West.

00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:45.780
And, that they needed
Charles to get his daddy

00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:49.960
to give him his portion of the
property so they could turn it

00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:52.350
into traveling goods you know.

00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:55.770
People thinks in old age
they just hopped on a horse,

00:44:55.770 --> 00:44:58.260
or took off walking,
or something.

00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:00.920
But, everything had to
be provisioned back then.

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:02.220
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Sure.

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:03.520
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon:
Just like now.

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:04.820
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: It was worse.

00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:06.120
You couldn't stop
for-- at a store.

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:08.100
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: That's right.

00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:09.400
That's right.

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.330
And, Charles wouldn't do it.

00:45:11.330 --> 00:45:12.630
He just wouldn't do it.

00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:15.550
And, they said that it was
through anger over that

00:45:15.550 --> 00:45:20.280
that he was-- believed that
that's what killed him, Charles.

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:21.580
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Interesting.

00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:22.880
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: But, she
wouldn't tell on her daddy.

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:24.180
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yes.

00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:25.830
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: And
so, she was hanged.

00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:27.250
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: That's
a whole other story

00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:29.340
from what the song
usually tells.

00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:30.720
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: Right.

00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:36.170
She made a confession, but
the confession was lost.

00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:37.470
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:38.770
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon:
That she made.

00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:41.210
And then, on the scaffold,
she started to speak,

00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:43.670
but her father was in
the crowd, and said,

00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:45.800
Die with it in you, Frankie.

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:48.020
Die with it in you.

00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:49.880
She wouldn't tell.

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:52.120
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So, are you
going to sing that ballad

00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:53.540
for us later when
we do the concert?

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:54.840
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon:
I probably will.

00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:56.140
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Alright.

00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:57.440
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: Yes.

00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:59.590
If I've got any voice left.

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:00.890
[laughs]

00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:02.190
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Sounds good.

00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:03.490
Well, we will let
you rest your voice.

00:46:03.490 --> 00:46:04.790
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: [inaudible]

00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:06.090
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: And,
we will just thank you

00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:07.440
for this wonderful interview,
and for telling us some

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:09.290
of your stories,
and your own story.

00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:10.590
The story of your own life.

00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:11.890
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon:
Well, thank you.

00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:13.190
I appreciate you.

00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:14.490
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Thank you
so much, Bobby McMillon.

00:46:14.490 --> 00:46:15.790
&gt;&gt; Bobby McMillon: Yes, sir.

00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:17.090
Thanks.
