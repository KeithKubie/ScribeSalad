what we want to is I try to replicate

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070
what we want to is I try to replicate
 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.200
what we want to is I try to replicate
what an along with them will do in the

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210
what an along with them will do in the
 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.900
what an along with them will do in the
wild so that then that is what they will

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910
wild so that then that is what they will
 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:39.980
wild so that then that is what they will
learn during the process of

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:39.990
learn during the process of
 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.770
learn during the process of
rehabilitation and once the orangutans

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780
rehabilitation and once the orangutans
 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.200
rehabilitation and once the orangutans
are ready so meaning that they have

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210
are ready so meaning that they have
 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.520
are ready so meaning that they have
learned the skills that they need to

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530
learned the skills that they need to
 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.920
learned the skills that they need to
survive in a world then then we decide

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930
survive in a world then then we decide
 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:01:18.990
survive in a world then then we decide
to take them to the wild

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000
 
 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.630
 
the biggest challenge for us how to stop

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640
the biggest challenge for us how to stop
 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.520
the biggest challenge for us how to stop
the deforestation until we don't do

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530
the deforestation until we don't do
 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.740
the deforestation until we don't do
something to stop this massive

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750
something to stop this massive
 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.110
something to stop this massive
deforestation it's possible that we

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.120
deforestation it's possible that we
 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.080
deforestation it's possible that we
won't be able to save the species

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090
won't be able to save the species
 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.149
won't be able to save the species
