00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The problem with debugging being time consuming and all

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
actually translates into money and effort on a large scale.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
A commonly cited figure in the literature is that in any software project,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
at least 50% of the effort is spent on test and debugging.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This number can even go up to 75%.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
According to study made in 2002, software bugs are costing the US economy

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.000
only $59.5 billion a year and improvements in testing and debugging could reduce

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
this cost of software bugs by a $30 billion or $22 billion a year.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The main problem with debugging, however, is not that it takes time.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The worst thing that it is a such process whose length is unpredictable.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
It can take anything between a few minutes, a few hours, and sometimes even days and weeks.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Even if you don't know how much time it's going to take, be sure to use the systematic process,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
which gradually gets you towards the cause of the problem, but even if you never know

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
how much time a bug will take, it's a bit of a blessing

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
to use a process which gradually gets you towards its cause.
