00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.910
ELIZABETH ANCARANA: Well, it's
great to see everybody talking

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.440
and getting to know each other.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.330
And it's a lot of energy,
positive energy in the room.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.990
It's really great to see.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.660
So now we'd like to start
our next faculty panel.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.670
We have three
tenured faculty who

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.540
are going to give some
good advice on navigating

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.520
your professional
path as a scholar.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.270
So I'd like to
introduce them now.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.670
They'll each speak again
for about 10 minutes,

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.750
and then we'll open it up
to questions and discussion.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.810
So I'll start with
Julie Buckler, who

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.260
is a professor of Slavic
and comparative literature

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.280
in the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.450
She also currently holds
a half-time position

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.320
as the humanities director
of academic ventures

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.230
at the Radcliffe Institute
for Advanced Study.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.760
Julie received her doctorate
in Slavic from Harvard

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.590
and has spent her academic
career here, appointed

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.980
as a junior professor,
assistant professor in 1996

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.530
and awarded tenure
by the faculty

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.750
of Arts and Sciences in 2003.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.710
She works on the literature,
performing arts, cultural life,

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.680
and urban environments
of Russia,

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.360
with a focus on the imperial
period and its legacies.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.867
For the past
several years, Julie

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:18.200
has also been a central member
of the steering committee

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.630
of the humanities
project, which works

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.150
to foster arts and
humanities initiatives that

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.390
build intellectual
community and integrate

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.200
the humanities
into urban studies

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.050
more broadly as it is
practiced in the fields

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.850
of urban planning,
design, architecture,

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.920
the social sciences,
and public policy.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.330
We have Darren Higgins, who
is a professor of microbiology

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.430
and immunobiology at
the medical school.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.480
He holds a PhD in
microbiology and immunology

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.810
from the University of
Michigan Medical School

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.140
and completed his
postdoctoral studies

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.400
at the University of
Pennsylvania School of Medicine

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.380
and the University of
California at Berkeley.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.325
Darren came to the
Harvard Medical school

00:01:58.325 --> 00:02:01.030
as an assistant
professor in 1999

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.080
and was promoted to professor
with tenure in 2009.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.440
His laboratory currently
focuses on understanding

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.840
fundamental host pathogen
interactions that

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.860
lead to virulence
in the development

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.520
of protective immunity
to intracellular

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.540
bacterial pathogens.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.620
He's also the inventor
on several patents

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.010
and co-founded and serves
on the Scientific Advisory

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.530
Board of Genocea
Biosciences, Inc.,

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.060
a company that commercializes
key breakthroughs in vaccine

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.820
discovery and development
with a focus on intracellular

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.070
pathogens.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.040
And we have a Devah Pager, who
is a professor of sociology

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.800
in the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.890
and a professor of public
policy at the Kennedy School.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.510
She's also the Susan S.
and Kenneth L. Wallach

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.450
Professor at the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.380
and the director of the
Harvard Multi-Disciplinary

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.150
Program in Inequality
and Social Policy Devah

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.860
holds a PhD from the University
of Wisconsin at Madison

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.040
and was a Fulbright
Fellow in Paris,

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.190
studying changes in crime policy
and patterns of immigration

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.380
and ethnic tension in
contemporary France.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.140
Her research focuses on
institutions affecting

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.860
racial stratification,
including education,

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.130
labor markets, and the
criminal justice system.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.880
Her field experiments
investigate

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.630
racial and economic consequences
of large-scale imprisonment

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.450
and discrimination against
minorities and ex-offenders

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.442
in contemporary
US labor markets.

00:03:27.442 --> 00:03:28.900
So again, welcome
to our panelists.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.140
And maybe we start with
Julie for some sound advice.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.020
JULIE BUCKLER: Can you hear me?

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.790
Yes?

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.050
Well, welcome.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.190
Welcome to Harvard.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.510
I hope you'll be happy here and
this place will be good to you.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.970
I've been here for
a really long time.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.900
I've been on the faculty
since 1996, as Elizabeth said.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.710
I was hired as a freshly minted
PhD, the ink on my degree

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.380
not even dry, no postdoc,
nothing, just dived right in.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.430
And I was tenured in 2003.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:15.320
And my tenure, I think,
came at the beginning,

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.360
in the early years of a big
wave of internal promotions

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.330
such that there's
quite a cohort of us

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.520
now who are tenured from within
by support of departments

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.350
and mentored by colleagues
and given sound advice.

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.360
And I'm very grateful to
those who had helped me.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.070
I'd like to share with you some
wisdom that I have acquired

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.980
in my now 19 years
on the faculty

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.970
here, both as a junior person
and as a tenured person.

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.520
And also, now being 12
years out from tenure,

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.480
I feel like I've learned
a few things about what

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.300
it's like to be senior.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.930
And I know that this
audience consists mostly

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.000
of junior tenure-track faculty
but that there are also

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.020
some senior hires here.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.220
And welcome.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.000
And so I'm going to offer
some advice to both groups

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.120
since I now have some
thoughts on that.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:20.430
So for junior faculty, now,
of course, everything I say

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.540
comes from my experience
in the humanities.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.920
So I apologize if some of
it isn't pertinent to people

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.950
in other fields.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.420
In the humanities,
the old standard,

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.480
the old gold standard
was two books by tenure.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.390
And that's a lot in a
seven-year junior appointment.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.169
But I did it, because--

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:43.252
SPEAKER 1: You're choking.

00:05:43.252 --> 00:05:45.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.980
JULIE BUCKLER: And then I had to
get over my post-tenure stress

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.400
syndrome.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.290
I did it because
it had to be done.

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.230
It was made very
clear to me that that

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.390
was what it was going to
cost me to be considered

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.540
for promotion, to be considered
seriously for promotion.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.790
I think the standards
are more flexible

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.610
and more broadly defined now.

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.120
And I think that's
very positive.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.910
I kind of would have
liked not to have written

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.930
my second book in such a rush.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.120
But that's OK.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.750
At least I wrote it.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.830
So my advice is this
to junior faculty.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.100
The junior appointment
seems like it's

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.220
going to be very long, but
it's actually very short.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.900
And it's really important
to get control of your time.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.380
And it's really important
to have a master plan.

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.774
Sit down and really
give some thought

00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:41.440
to what you would
like to be able to put

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.400
on the table the year
you come up for review.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.580
And then really think about
how you're going to get there.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.040
But most of the things that
you want to have to show,

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.070
you're going to
build up in stages.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:56.710
And so you need to
plan the staging,

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.470
plan the multiple talks, the
course, the new acquaintances,

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.400
the collaborators,
et cetera, that

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.460
are going to lead you
to the publications

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.030
that you want to have.

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:09.930
Harvard is renewing itself very
much in the area of teaching.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.610
We have the Harvard Initiative
for Learning and Teaching.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:16.190
We have HarvardX, and really
good and innovative teaching

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:21.060
is highly valued here now, as
is significant service, program

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:25.580
building and other ways of
really serving what we do.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.990
That said, your
publication record

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.970
is still the most important
thing in your dossier.

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.820
And so it's very
important that you don't

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.440
let it get lost in the shuffle.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.260
So look for the
synergies, and then be

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.220
very conscious
about the decisions

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.920
you make regarding the
projects you invest in deeply,

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.290
having educated
yourself about the view

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:49.740
that Harvard tends to
take on these things.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:54.700
So in my field, for example,
doing an extensive translation

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.150
of poems by a particular
poet with a long scholarly

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:01.980
introduction is certainly
a worthy project but one

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:03.750
that most people
would probably think

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.710
was better done after
you were tenured.

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:11.530
And you may decide to go ahead
and do that translation project

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:15.540
anyway as a junior person, but
you should at least understand

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:16.900
the choice that you're making.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.530
And you might get tenure,
too, but just-- so

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:24.840
let your senior colleagues tell
you what the expectations are,

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.720
and make your own decisions
based on your own priorities.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.669
January is now a huge boon.

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:37.669
The academic calendar
changed a few years ago,

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:41.140
and now January for faculty
is heaven, pretty much.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.330
Fall semester is over, spring
semester hasn't started,

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.650
and you can kind of lay low
and really get some work done.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:50.500
It never used to be possible to
get any of your own work done

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.300
during the academic
year, I mean, except

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.680
for little bits and pieces.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.600
So I'm just a
proponent of getting

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.260
your tools set in
order, whatever you use,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:05.040
bibliographic management,
presentation software.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.900
Be proactive and
entrepreneurial.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.640
Organize things
yourself so that you

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.870
can be on the panels
you want to be on.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:17.550
Apply for a Radcliffe
exploratory seminar,

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:21.280
run a talk series at one of
the centers with a colleague.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.040
All of these can be
done collaboratively,

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.440
but they're all good ways to
extend your reach at Harvard

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.530
without overextending yourself.

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:34.610
And so my best piece of
advice is do get out there.

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:37.550
See if you can get an
interesting service

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:38.610
assignment or two.

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:40.620
I was on the freshman
seminar committee

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:44.550
when the freshman seminar
program expanded a lot,

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:47.460
and it was a wonderful
committee assignment,

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.310
because I got to see these
really wonderful proposals

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.380
and syllabi from all
across the university.

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:56.080
And I learned a lot,
and I thought a lot,

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.630
and we had great discussions.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:01.250
And I was just very happy that I
agreed to be on that committee.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:04.400
And so you can't allow yourself
to be completely bunkered

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.560
in your own department.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.180
It won't be good for you here.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:11.580
But you also can't be
running around all the time

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:14.260
and never sitting down and
getting down to business.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:18.490
And for teaching preparation,
I recommend top-down planning.

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:21.130
It took me years to
figure out that the best

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:24.220
way to prepare to teach was
not to read everything and take

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.530
an enormous number
of pages of notes

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:30.030
so that I would feel I
had mastery of the topic

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:31.620
and then come into class.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.830
Much better to do top-down
planning, really thinking

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:36.310
about what you
want to accomplish

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:39.160
during each class,
what the goals are,

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.970
and kind of filling
in that way, top down.

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:44.140
That way you don't
waste a minute,

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.520
and you don't need to be
your own best student,

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.320
if you know what I mean.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.730
So that's my best advice
for junior people.

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:54.240
Keep your head down,
but not too much.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.490
Make a plan.

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:58.120
Really make a plan
and keep track of it.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.660
Keep yourself honest.

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:04.170
Use all the tricks they talk
about in business books on how

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:05.850
to be more effective.

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:09.610
Don't look at email for certain
hours of the day, reserve

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:12.730
one day a week to stay home
and work on your own stuff

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:15.610
if you can, et cetera.

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:18.600
My advice for senior faculty
is somewhat different.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.550
When you're tenured, you will
accrue a pretty heavy service

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:28.520
load, because that's who can
do a lot of the work-- task

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:35.060
forces, promotion reviews,
searches, chairing departments.

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.250
The list goes on and on.

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:37.750
And it's important.

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:40.000
And when you get
tenure, you kind of

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.340
owe it to Harvard to
pitch in on that stuff.

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:46.610
But you can also get
buried by the work.

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:51.410
So I've found that collaborative
projects have worked really

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:54.090
well for me during this
stage in my career,

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:57.300
because they allow me to invest
in projects I really care about

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.640
and to advance
them because I have

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.720
partners who are helping me.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.860
That's working
really well for me.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.500
I'm also really interested
in nontraditional forms

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:09.484
of scholarly output,
like websites,

00:12:09.484 --> 00:12:12.290
and I'm especially
enamored right now

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:16.140
for a virtual exhibition
software tool called Omeka.

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.820
It's kind of a
repository, and it

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:22.530
allows students to do more
than write traditional papers.

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:26.180
It allows them to do more
with design and presentation

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.330
and to incorporate
different media.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.980
I find it's more
engaging for students.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:34.140
And I also find that it's
a nice and tempting format

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:37.540
for my own scholarly production
but not something I would have

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:40.160
attempted as a junior person.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.570
So when you're
senior, you have to be

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:45.120
kind of cagey about
finding ways to advance

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.340
your projects while also
doing the things you're

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.530
supposed to do.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:56.480
And other people swear
by writing groups,

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.730
by having trusted peers
who read their work,

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:05.000
by setting up networks,
connections, commitments

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.780
that are going to support you
in getting your own work done.

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:11.810
You can't just wait for, live
for your next sabbatical.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:15.280
You can be making small
deposits in your piggy bank

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.600
for the four years leading
up to a sabbatical.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.700
That's what I've done.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.890
And just keep
socking stuff away.

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:24.120
Keep buying books.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.610
Keep files of things.

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:32.050
Give the same talk several
times but in different venues

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:34.000
or from a different perspective.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.140
I mean, things take such
a long time to develop,

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:41.490
so allow that space
for it to happen.

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:43.840
So that's my best advice.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:48.710
Those are my hard-won truths.

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:51.310
I think you can really
thrive and prosper here,

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:54.640
but you have to make the
institution work for you.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.320
Because it is a very
fast-paced, and there's

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.170
just an enormous
amount going on.

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:01.470
You have to stay grounded.

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:03.430
So best of luck.

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:05.776
And I mean that
sincerely, not ironically.

00:14:05.776 --> 00:14:06.276
Thank you.

00:14:06.276 --> 00:14:08.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:09.944 --> 00:14:11.610
DARREN HIGGINS: I'll
pick up from there.

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:13.290
And I unfortunately
didn't get a chance

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:14.760
to see the previous
session, but I

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.260
think a lot of things that
all the panelists will say

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.490
will resonate and
cross boundaries.

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:22.380
So I'm at the medical school.

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:25.750
And as the intro said, I'm
starting my 17th year here.

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:31.850
And unlike the humanities, I
do very little formal teaching.

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:34.780
I was hired to come and
set up a research lab

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:37.780
and basically have productive,
scholarly work in terms

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:40.959
of papers, in terms of
research development.

00:14:40.959 --> 00:14:42.500
And that was sort
of my primary goal.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.910
I also came at a time,
which is, I think, less

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:48.230
of a kinder, gentler time.

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:49.590
And it certainly has changed.

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:51.256
And I just want to
say at the beginning,

00:14:51.256 --> 00:14:54.400
I have one theme throughout
the 10 minutes I'll speak,

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.810
and that's basically,
don't work in a bubble.

00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:59.420
Don't work in a vacuum.

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.390
And I'll try to interject kind
of some practical strategies

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:05.679
of how to actually do that and
follow from what Julie said.

00:15:05.679 --> 00:15:08.220
And I remember when I first came
here as assistant professor,

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:11.670
I was like, OK, go in
and get your lab set up,

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:15.260
and go get your R01
grants, and just go to it.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.180
And I remember sitting about
three months after I showed

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:21.370
up back in 1999, and
I thought to myself,

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:26.130
I could die in my office today.

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:27.446
Nobody would know.

00:15:27.446 --> 00:15:29.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:30.160
Nobody would care--

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:36.370
--until the smell permeated
far enough down the hallway

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:39.330
that someone said, go
figure out what's going on.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.980
And I remember I had this
candy dish in my office,

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:43.870
so when people came
it was like, hey,

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:46.790
do you want to sit and
have a talk and talk to me?

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:47.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:48.815
And usually it was
someone saying,

00:15:48.815 --> 00:15:50.690
oh, we heard you had
this piece of equipment.

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:51.440
You don't have it.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.910
Goodbye.

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:55.650
And so I realized at that point
that working in the bubble

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:58.190
and trying to do everything on
your own isn't going to work.

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:00.192
And I said, well, how
do I get out of this?

00:16:00.192 --> 00:16:01.650
And one of the
things I'll cross to

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:03.150
is people talk about mentorship.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:06.980
And I really think you have
to develop multiple mentors

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:10.410
and think of your career as if
you were the general contractor

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:11.650
of your career.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:14.060
And you don't have to do
everything perfectly, but find

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:16.180
the people that do
things really well

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:19.480
and lock onto those individuals
to get good, sage advice.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.730
I remember I called my
graduate mentor, who

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:24.740
was a very engaging
person, who is now

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:28.127
a dean at Michigan State.

00:16:28.127 --> 00:16:29.710
And he says, well,
what you need to do

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:32.250
is just engage the other
faculty, get out there,

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:35.440
and I know you a little bit,
so just go ask them to lunch.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:38.080
Because everyone has to eat.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.650
And do something
to break the ice.

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:41.630
And I remember I asked all
my senior faculty to lunch,

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:42.520
and I was very nervous.

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:43.480
And I spoke to people.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.100
Mostly I told him about
what I did a little bit.

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:46.960
I'm doing this.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.130
OK, great.

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:50.750
And about two months later,
a student comes to my office

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:54.214
and says, oh, I want to talk to
you about rotating in your lab.

00:16:54.214 --> 00:16:55.880
I went to one of your
senior colleagues,

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.730
who is very well renowned,
they don't have space,

00:16:57.730 --> 00:16:59.396
and they said I should
come talk to you.

00:16:59.396 --> 00:17:01.260
And I realized
that person did me

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:05.720
a favor, informed this person
about what I was doing.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.810
They could use their
legacy to say, hey, here's

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:10.450
someone who you might
want to talk to.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:13.300
That person was my first
graduate student, that student,

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.130
and was the first author
of the first paper

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:16.200
and helped me get
my first grant.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.260
And things took off from there.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.843
So I realized very quickly you
have to come out of the office,

00:17:19.843 --> 00:17:22.660
you have to engage
at different levels.

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:24.160
The other thing
to do that I think

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.930
is very important,
as Julie says,

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:30.120
to keep stock of what
your expectations are,

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:31.740
how you're going
to be evaluated,

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:33.410
how you're going to
be promoted, and get

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:36.320
this sort of general-contractor
group of people.

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.900
So I noticed that there's
faculty in my department

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:43.580
who are phenomenal authors,
their papers are always

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:45.680
in the top journals, and
so I kind of went to them

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.005
and said, well, could
you read my paper

00:17:48.005 --> 00:17:49.480
and give me some advice?

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.840
And they would say,
the science is fine,

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:54.260
but the presentation
needs some work

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.210
in terms of how you
have to project it

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:59.040
to individuals so they
can understand it better.

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.600
And then I realized
something, that I

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:05.710
am the best person to explain
to other people what I do

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:08.730
and why it's important and
why you should promote me,

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:10.530
why you should keep me around.

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:13.650
But if I cannot explain that
in a way that you understand,

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:15.546
I'm doing myself a disservice.

00:18:15.546 --> 00:18:16.920
So one of the
things someone told

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:20.460
me is they said, write your
own recommendation letter.

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.620
And that's a hard thing to do.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:25.666
But when your department chair
or someone comes and says,

00:18:25.666 --> 00:18:27.290
we want to put this
person up for this,

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:29.016
or you want to apply
for this, and they

00:18:29.016 --> 00:18:30.640
say I have to write
this recommendation

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:33.940
letter for this new assistant
professor in my department--

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.330
who did we hire again?

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:38.920
What is this person doing?

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:40.740
What have they done in
the last few months?

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:43.622
And you need to be able to say
exactly why that's important.

00:18:43.622 --> 00:18:45.080
And so what you
might want to do is

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.070
find a colleague who has
had experience with that.

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:47.860
And there's one
thing Julie says--

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:49.620
as you become a
senior person, you

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:51.660
sit on promotion and
evaluation committees.

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:52.861
You have this experience.

00:18:52.861 --> 00:18:54.360
Find out who in
your department does

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.830
that, because it's someone, and
say, OK, what do I need to do?

00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:58.830
Where am I going?

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:00.538
How can I actually
get to this direction?

00:19:00.538 --> 00:19:02.990
And that's advice, too, about
not working in the bubble.

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:07.260
One thing I would say,
too, in terms of your time,

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:11.350
in my opinion really
as a Harvard professor,

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:17.550
other than air, water, and food,
your most precious commodity

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:19.190
is time.

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:20.520
It's a limited resource.

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.180
There's only so many
hours in the day,

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.275
so many days in the
week, and everyone

00:19:24.275 --> 00:19:26.340
is going to be
jockeying for your time.

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:28.700
And I'll come back to
how to reserve your time.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.950
So I think that what you
want to get in the process of

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:33.500
is sort of getting a schedule
in terms of what time

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:35.130
you can allot to
specific things.

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:37.130
And one thing I want to
say now and come back to

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:39.175
is the work-life,
home-life balance.

00:19:39.175 --> 00:19:40.550
Many of the
assistant professors,

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:41.970
you may or may not
have a partner,

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:43.430
you may or may not have kids.

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:47.770
At some point during the next
decade that may change for you.

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:50.471
And it's very important for
you to kind of set aside time.

00:19:50.471 --> 00:19:50.970
And for

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:53.220
And for me, for example-- I
was talking this morning--

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:55.350
I'm a single dad
of twin daughters,

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:56.990
and I have a set amount of time.

00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:58.170
I have a schedule.

00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:01.120
Everyone in my life
knows my schedule.

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:04.580
They know that Mondays
and Tuesday nights,

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:07.610
I'm free to stay late,
I'm free to work with you.

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:09.420
Wednesdays and Thursdays
I'm with my kids.

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:10.120
Don't call me.

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.950
I'm not going to call you back.

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:14.350
If it's an emergency,
you can text me something

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:17.040
or send me something, but
this is my allotted time.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:20.010
And I think that once everyone
can understand that and say,

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:21.630
hey, this is when
I'm available, they

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:23.342
will respect those boundaries.

00:20:23.342 --> 00:20:24.800
The other thing I
want to say, too,

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.350
about not working in a bubble is
at some point during your time

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:31.200
here, you will have a crisis.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.420
That is life.

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:36.710
Whether it is a death in
the family or an illness

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:42.430
or basically an accident or
someone you know or something

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:43.950
or your house burns
down, there will

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:46.280
be something that
will take you away

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:47.930
from your focus on
the work that you

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:49.750
will have to go and deal with.

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.760
And I think it's very important
that you recognize that that

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.830
will happen and to be very
honest to the people around you

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:58.180
and let people know what's
going on in your life.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:59.570
You don't have to
be an open book

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:01.920
and tell everyone
all your business.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.300
But what I found is I
went through a few crises

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:07.260
and issues I had to deal
with, and by my department

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:08.960
chair and my business
administrator

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.380
and people knowing
in general this

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:15.055
was going on, behind the scenes
they kind of kept things away.

00:21:15.055 --> 00:21:16.930
I was talking this
morning-- I noticed that I

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:18.460
wasn't getting as many emails.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:21.350
I wasn't getting as many people
asking me to do something.

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:22.200
Julie knows this.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.200
As one of the few
African-American

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.950
tenured faculty
members at Harvard,

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:28.860
I get asked to do
stuff all the time.

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:31.100
And suddenly people
weren't asking me as much.

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:33.780
And that was a
blessing, because people

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:36.200
knew what was going on
in my life, and again,

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.880
not working in the bubble.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:44.610
Also with the promotion
side, one practical thing

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:47.090
that I would tell
everyone to do is at least

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:51.530
every quarter, every three
months, update your CV.

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:54.080
Because what's going to happen
is that next year some time

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.890
someone will say, hey, we
want to put you up for this,

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:57.560
or this is going
on, and then you

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:00.190
have to sit down and think
about what am I actually doing.

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:02.135
So just every time you
have a calendar-- well,

00:22:02.135 --> 00:22:05.180
I gave this talk, I did this,
I'm writing this article,

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:07.290
I'm writing this
book-- update your CV.

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:09.640
And if you have
nothing to put on it,

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.900
if you have nothing on your
calendar that is coming up,

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:16.110
that's a sign that, hey,
I need to kind of get out

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:18.280
of the bubble and go talk
some other individuals.

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.820
One strategy for
researchers is that one

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:22.580
of the criteria that
you're promoted by

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:25.270
is your recognition
in the field.

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:27.480
That comes from various
ways-- publications,

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.020
presentation, promotions.

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:31.670
You may have to do
some self-promotion.

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:34.540
So for example, some of the
colleagues here at Harvard

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.930
are probably world-renown
in the fields that they do.

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:40.000
You might go and say, hey,
if you're on this journal,

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.020
I would be willing to be
on the editorial board

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:43.311
for this journal at some point.

00:22:43.311 --> 00:22:44.410
Please consider me.

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:46.730
If you are basically putting
this conference together

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:49.870
in three years, you should come
look at the work that I'm doing

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:52.050
and just consider me for
giving this presentation.

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:54.950
Those little things of just
saying, hey, I'm available,

00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:56.610
will often very much help you.

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:59.270
Because we're all very busy,
and at the last minute someone

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:01.780
says, I need to do this.

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:05.980
Back when you had cover
pictures on journals,

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:09.040
one of the colleagues in
my department was the cover

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:13.270
editor for the journal and then
basically came to me and said,

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:15.980
I saw that you had an
article in this issue,

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:17.580
and you didn't tell me.

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:20.190
Give me something so we
can put on the cover.

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:21.930
Oh, OK.

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:23.510
That networking aspect works.

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:25.669
So I think that you
want to be aware of what

00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:27.960
your colleagues are doing
just in general, because they

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.210
can avail you.

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:31.530
The last thing I'll say
is about the tenure.

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:35.500
When I first came here, someone
said, getting tenure means

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.880
being able to say no,
that now I've arrived

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.120
and now I can tell people no.

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:41.610
And I think that's not the case.

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:44.210
I think getting promotion,
getting to tenure,

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:46.120
having a successful
career means being

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:50.640
able to say no to protect your
time to allow you to accomplish

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:51.730
what you want to do.

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:53.354
So how do you do that?

00:23:53.354 --> 00:23:55.270
One of the things about
the general contractor

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:58.010
is to identify people
that can help you.

00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:01.420
And you have to identify someone
that can help you say no.

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:03.550
So for example, for me it
was my department chair.

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:06.190
I was asked to do this, I'm
trying to protect my time,

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:08.148
I have a colleague who's
a senior colleague who

00:24:08.148 --> 00:24:10.420
I don't want to offend,
trying to do a collaboration

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:11.290
with them.

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:12.920
So I went to my
department chair,

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.650
and he says, of course you
don't need to be doing this.

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:17.400
So I said, well, can
I send people to you?

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.327
He said sure.

00:24:18.327 --> 00:24:20.160
So when someone came
to me and said, Darren,

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.118
we want you to do this.

00:24:21.118 --> 00:24:23.440
I go, my department
chair says I can't.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.390
You should go talk to
my department chair.

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:27.015
He says, no, he's
not going to do this.

00:24:27.015 --> 00:24:29.130
If you have a problem,
you can speak to me.

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:30.320
Problem goes away.

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:34.051
So I think, again, you want kind
of identify the areas that you

00:24:34.051 --> 00:24:35.800
want to get to, how
you want to get those,

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:39.420
and who can help you get
to those particular areas.

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:42.264
So I'll stop there, and
we can re-address anything

00:24:42.264 --> 00:24:43.430
during the question portion.

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:45.950
But that's kind of my
general sage advice.

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:47.660
And I hope that
applies to everyone

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:51.120
here in terms of what school,
what department, researcher,

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:51.760
teacher.

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.324
But I think those could be
very helpful along your path

00:24:54.324 --> 00:24:54.990
here to Harvard.

00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:58.100
And welcome, and I wish
you continued success

00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.570
and that we'll be
colleagues for a long time.

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:03.490
And I have to say if this is
the first and last time you ever

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:05.570
see me, that's your problem.

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:06.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:08.430
I'm now one of
those people, right?

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:10.760
We're now one of these
people that you can seek out

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.950
for sage advice, right?

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:14.610
Add that to your list now.

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:17.145
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:17.145 --> 00:25:18.450
DEVAH PAGER: awesome.

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:19.040
Hi, everyone.

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.152
I'm Devah Pager.

00:25:20.152 --> 00:25:21.970
So I've just been
here two years now.

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:24.160
I'm a relative
newbie on this panel.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.100
Prior to coming to
Harvard, I spent nine years

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.670
at Princeton and before that
two years at Northwestern.

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:30.830
So I have some
comparative perspective.

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:32.360
So some of the
comments I'll offer

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.140
will be Harvard-specific
and some more universal

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:39.300
to how to make this
professional life work.

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:41.590
So my first piece of
advice-- I think most of you

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:43.560
are probably just
starting your first jobs

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:44.680
in your first semesters.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.632
Is that right?

00:25:46.632 --> 00:25:48.590
How many of you are here
in your first semester

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:50.176
of your first job?

00:25:50.176 --> 00:25:52.360
Oh, just a small
fraction of you.

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:54.600
So others of you have
been here for a while now

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:55.510
or are starting-- OK.

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:57.460
Anyway, well, welcome
to all of you,

00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:58.640
wherever you're coming from.

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.056
I would say if you
have moved here

00:26:00.056 --> 00:26:01.520
from somewhere
else, whether this

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:07.130
is your first job or
your second or nth job,

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:10.760
I would plan on your first
semester being a time

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:13.250
for you to enjoy and
settle in and not

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:14.920
plan to really
get any work done,

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.930
especially if you're
teaching this semester.

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:20.200
I think the first semester
is really a time for you

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:24.190
to be settling in, learning
where the coffee maker is,

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:25.700
signing up for your
gym membership,

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:28.720
keeping your classes
running smoothly,

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.820
figuring out where
you are in the world,

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:32.720
and don't put too much
pressure on yourself.

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:36.700
In a way, the tenure clock is
short, but in another sense,

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.070
you need to take a semester
to really settle in.

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:41.480
So give yourself that time.

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:46.650
My advice for the first year
or for the early periods

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:48.760
of your time here
is to really spend

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.630
some time finding a community.

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:53.750
And keep in mind that that
community may very well

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:55.236
be outside your department.

00:26:55.236 --> 00:26:57.360
I'm talking about an
intellectual community as well

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.780
as a social community.

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:02.450
Harvard is a large
and diverse campus.

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:07.200
It's full of centers and
institutes and departments

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.980
with all kinds of
opportunities to meet folks.

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:13.260
And this is an opportunity,
especially early on,

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:16.810
to really sample from that
diversity of opportunities.

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:20.840
I think one huge benefit of
turning your life upside down

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:22.590
to move somewhere
new is that you

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:25.710
don't have the same things
that tie you down and get

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:28.240
you stuck in routines
and in a particular rut.

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:31.607
So while you're kind of
unsettled and freewheeling,

00:27:31.607 --> 00:27:34.190
take this as an opportunity to
sample from all kinds of things

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:38.470
that you wouldn't
ordinarily select into.

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:40.860
If that means going to talks
in different departments,

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.800
going to the university
events like this one,

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.130
signing up for
recreational activities,

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:48.489
meeting people from across
campus, I think all of those

00:27:48.489 --> 00:27:51.030
really enrich your networks and
will make your time here more

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:52.820
profitable.

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:56.250
When I first got to Northwestern
as a new assistant professor,

00:27:56.250 --> 00:28:00.890
all faculty were required to
attend an all-day pedagogy

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:04.060
workshop that was put on
by the teaching center.

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:07.620
This ended up being a completely
worthless waste of time

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:08.860
in terms of the content.

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:12.840
It was just full of really
boring and useless information,

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:13.615
unfortunately.

00:28:13.615 --> 00:28:15.990
I think those kinds of workshops
could be done very well.

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:17.281
I hope they do them better now.

00:28:17.281 --> 00:28:20.390
But the content ended up
being fairly worthless.

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:25.165
But at this workshop, I
met two faculty members,

00:28:25.165 --> 00:28:27.040
one who was a new
professor in the psychology

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:29.039
department, another new
professor in the history

00:28:29.039 --> 00:28:31.670
department, who became
two of my closest friends

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:34.080
and remain so to this day.

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.880
They were close intellectual
colleagues, as well as friends,

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.430
and that was really enriching.

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:42.760
So there's a silver lining
to spending days sitting

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:45.368
and listening to boring
panels-- no offense.

00:28:45.368 --> 00:28:46.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:49.090
And there can be
really terrific things

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:51.100
that come out of those events.

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:54.972
So really spend some time early
on developing those networks.

00:28:54.972 --> 00:28:56.430
To echo something
that Darren said,

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:59.180
I think you also want to think
about developing community

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:00.750
within your department as well.

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:04.670
And I think cultivating mentors
is a really important part

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:06.620
of that community.

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:11.140
I think most new faculty,
when they enter a department,

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:15.089
some people really take the time
and say, I want to get coffee

00:29:15.089 --> 00:29:16.130
or I want to go to lunch.

00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:18.710
But the truth is that most
people, especially when they've

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:21.020
been in their rut
and in their routine

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:23.134
and are busy with a
million commitments,

00:29:23.134 --> 00:29:25.550
they are thinking to themselves
in the back of their mind,

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:27.800
oh, I'd really like to get
to know this person better,

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.910
but they just never are able
to stop and take a moment

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:32.340
and reach out and find a time.

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:34.780
So you should take
that initiative.

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:37.090
And every semester,
make sure that there

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:39.710
are at least one or two faculty
members in your department

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:40.970
that you're reaching
out to and say,

00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:42.000
hey, do you want to get lunch?

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.083
Do you want to get coffee?

00:29:43.083 --> 00:29:44.833
And cultivate some of
those relationships.

00:29:44.833 --> 00:29:46.541
Because your colleagues
really, really do

00:29:46.541 --> 00:29:49.130
want to get to know you, even
though they're just caught up

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:52.630
in their own little bubble.

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:55.160
My third piece of advice
is to learn to say no.

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.530
And more specifically,
I'd say just

00:29:57.530 --> 00:30:00.980
say no more often than
you're saying yes.

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:04.050
That's kind of my general
rule, I think, especially

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:05.340
for junior faculty.

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:07.230
Now, of course you want
to be a good citizen,

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:08.979
you want to be a member
of your community,

00:30:08.979 --> 00:30:12.240
and your colleagues will notice
that you are contributing

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.900
and that you're
pitching in, and they

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:15.670
will appreciate that for sure.

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:17.290
But you can't do
everything, and you

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:20.070
won't get tenure just for
being a good committee member.

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:22.769
So figure out where you
can make a contribution

00:30:22.769 --> 00:30:23.560
to your department.

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:25.393
Figure out where you
can make a contribution

00:30:25.393 --> 00:30:26.500
to your university.

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.990
And do those jobs
really, really well.

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:31.810
But don't get penalized
for doing those jobs well

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:33.940
by getting roped
into participating

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:35.330
on 15 other committees.

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:38.130
So just plan strategically
with your time.

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:40.960
And that goes for professional
activities as well.

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:41.910
So let's face it.

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:44.640
We have awesome jobs,
and we get to do

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.650
all kinds of things
that for the most part

00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:48.690
are really, really enjoyable.

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:52.430
So I love giving talks
in different departments.

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:54.410
I really like going
to conferences.

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:56.860
I like speaking to
non-academic audiences.

00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:58.420
I like meeting
with policymakers.

00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:00.610
I like meeting with
student groups.

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:04.080
I like being included in
special edited volumes.

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.550
There are all kinds of things
that are parts of our jobs

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:08.540
that we really, really enjoy.

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:10.040
But we can't do all of them.

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.540
So how do you figure out what
to do and what not to do?

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:15.380
Well, I have a really, really
great litmus test for you.

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:17.460
So you have to
think to yourself,

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:18.960
when you get asked
to do something,

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:21.997
if you would be willing to
do it next week, you probably

00:31:21.997 --> 00:31:22.580
want to do it.

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.640
If you wouldn't be willing
to do it next week,

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.240
don't do it at all.

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.050
So here's my
thinking behind that.

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:30.980
Academics get asked to do
things six months in advance,

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:34.720
12 months in advance, like well
beyond any reasonable sense

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:37.230
of having a time horizon
or what that feels like.

00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:41.680
And the temptation is to think,
oh, yeah, six months from now,

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.800
my docket will be clear.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.370
Like now is the busy time.

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:46.500
This is the crunch time.

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.980
But once I get past
these next few deadlines,

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:51.310
things will really clear out.

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:54.070
But the truth is, what
you are experiencing now,

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:56.910
that's how you feel next
spring and the following fall

00:31:56.910 --> 00:31:58.830
and the year after
that and every semester

00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:00.360
until you retire.

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.220
So if you're too
busy to do it now,

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.830
the chances are you'll be too
busy to do it a year from now.

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:06.330
So there are things
that I get asked

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:08.950
to do that if I had
to do them next week,

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:10.450
there's no way that
I would say yes.

00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:12.550
And sometimes I get
roped into doing things

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:14.807
because I've been asked a
year and a half in advance,

00:32:14.807 --> 00:32:16.640
and then I get to the
point where I actually

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:19.210
have to turn in the chapter
or attend the conference,

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:21.390
and I'm thinking, what
the heck was I thinking?

00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:22.947
I really don't want to do this.

00:32:22.947 --> 00:32:25.030
And there are other things
that when they come up,

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:27.030
like I really want to be
a part of those things,

00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:29.700
and I would clear my schedule to
do them if they were coming up

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:31.210
much more quickly.

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:32.760
So if you wouldn't
want to do it now,

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:35.190
you probably won't want to
be doing it a year from now.

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:37.780
Say no.

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:42.210
OK, last few pieces of advice--
delegate and ask for help.

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:45.620
I think this is consistent with
the general contractor model.

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:48.172
Harvard has a lot
of bureaucracy.

00:32:48.172 --> 00:32:50.130
It's probably the most
bureaucratic institution

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:51.715
that I've ever been a part of.

00:32:51.715 --> 00:32:52.445
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:52.445 --> 00:32:57.020
But in my experience,
staff, from the level

00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:59.460
of administrative assistants
all the way up to deans,

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:01.790
are exceptionally
highly qualified

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:03.680
and really, really
good at their jobs

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:05.409
and committed to
doing their jobs well.

00:33:05.409 --> 00:33:06.950
And they're there,
for the most part,

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:08.840
to help you do your work better.

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.220
So take advantage of that.

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:13.240
Figure out what those resources
are and how they can help you.

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:15.490
There are people that can
help you with data analysis.

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:17.420
There are people that can
help you filing your receipts,

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:19.419
with sending out your
letters of recommendation,

00:33:19.419 --> 00:33:21.350
with maintaining
your bibliographies,

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:23.810
with setting up and
maintaining your website.

00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:25.350
There's all kinds
of staff out there

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:27.900
that can help you
do your job better.

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:30.660
Sometimes it takes more effort
to ask someone else to do it

00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:33.160
than just to do it yourself,
but that's only the first time.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:34.659
So if there's
anything that you plan

00:33:34.659 --> 00:33:37.220
to be doing more than once
even, if it's only once a year,

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:41.062
find someone else to help
you do it and delegate.

00:33:41.062 --> 00:33:42.520
And then the last
thing I would say

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:46.330
is keep in mind that everyone
feels like an impostor

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:48.500
at least some of the time.

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:51.340
Your colleagues did not make
a mistake in hiring you.

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:55.000
Unless you are Michael LaCour
and made up all of your data,

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.590
there were some very good
reasons that your colleagues

00:33:57.590 --> 00:34:00.610
chose you out of what was an
enormous pool of applicants,

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:01.750
I am sure.

00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:04.310
So keep in mind what you
love about your work,

00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:07.555
and your colleagues are
going to love it as well.

00:34:07.555 --> 00:34:08.805
ELIZABETH ANCARANA: Thank you.

00:34:08.805 --> 00:34:11.619
DEVAH PAGER: Yeah.

00:34:11.619 --> 00:34:13.500
OK.

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:16.020
So interesting to
hear from all of you.

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:16.520
Questions?

00:34:25.047 --> 00:34:27.130
SPEAKER 2: Sorry this is
a negative, sad question.

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:27.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:31.850
But in your experiences, what
are the characteristics--

00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:35.520
unscientific observation, fine--
of the people who didn't get

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:36.239
promoted?

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:37.739
We've heard a lot
of the good things

00:34:37.739 --> 00:34:39.114
that we should be
doing, but then

00:34:39.114 --> 00:34:40.409
like what about the pitfalls?

00:34:40.409 --> 00:34:41.992
SPEAKER 3: You ask
negative questions.

00:34:41.992 --> 00:34:42.647
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:42.647 --> 00:34:43.480
SPEAKER 2: Oh, yeah.

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.063
My first one was
really negative, too.

00:34:45.063 --> 00:34:50.158
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:50.158 --> 00:34:51.949
JULIE BUCKLER: I can
speak to that briefly.

00:34:51.949 --> 00:34:54.190
And then I'm sure my
two colleagues also

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:56.400
have something to say.

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.350
In my remarks, I
talked about taking

00:34:58.350 --> 00:35:01.040
control of your master plan.

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.310
I mean, obviously it's
not a rigid thing,

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:07.010
but the people I've seen
who haven't gotten tenure

00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:09.110
have been a bit
hapless about it.

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:13.340
Many times they're brilliant,
but they didn't really

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:18.040
take control over their
process of doing the work

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.460
and bringing it to completion.

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:25.390
And so often they were
just too slow to produce

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:28.790
work that could then get
a response in the world,

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:33.410
and so Harvard didn't have the
information it wanted in order

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:35.320
to make that judgment.

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:40.700
The fact that we don't
have tenured associate

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:45.800
rank it means that
you have to look

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:49.527
like a good prospect
as a full professor

00:35:49.527 --> 00:35:51.110
at the end of your
junior appointment.

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:52.820
And that's a really tall order.

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:57.210
And you just cannot get there
without really deliberately

00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:58.190
making it happen.

00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:59.389
So that's my advice.

00:35:59.389 --> 00:36:00.930
DARREN HIGGINS:
Yeah, I think for me,

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:03.390
I think it's a
multitude of reasons.

00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:05.530
But really, it can come
down to a few things.

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:07.760
One is I think the people
I've seen who haven't been

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:11.540
successful are people who
didn't say no and just got

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:14.940
too distracted and too diluted
in terms of what they were

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:19.100
doing and also maybe had a
different perception of how

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:22.500
they were going to be evaluated
and what that criteria were.

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.630
So for example, in
my particular field,

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:28.351
the scholarly production,
your publications,

00:36:28.351 --> 00:36:30.850
how people perceive you in the
field, and your research work

00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:31.700
was very important.

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:33.470
They've changed the
tracks now in terms

00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:35.010
of teaching, et
cetera, but you've

00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:36.530
had people who said,
well, I've done

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:38.655
all these other things,
all these other committees,

00:36:38.655 --> 00:36:41.170
et cetera, but then when you
look at the promotion criteria,

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:43.670
someone says, that that
didn't really count.

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:45.700
One thing now that they
do is, for example,

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:49.300
the actual letter that
gets sent to the people who

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:52.930
will write your review
of you is available.

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:55.106
That is a specific,
worded letter.

00:36:55.106 --> 00:36:56.730
So if you look at
that, it's very clear

00:36:56.730 --> 00:37:01.320
what those criteria are in terms
of how you will be evaluated.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:02.870
The question is
how you get there.

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:05.050
And the last thing I think,
as we all talked about,

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:07.790
is people who didn't
take advantage of saying,

00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:11.530
let's go get some assistance
to help me get to this point

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:14.610
and find people who
say, OK, this is an area

00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:16.650
that you need to work with.

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:18.360
You may want to get
some more, et cetera,

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:21.750
you may want to do some
more outside work here,

00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:23.150
you may have more focus on this.

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:25.220
So let's come up with a
plan on how to do that.

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:27.780
So really it's this
thing I call PPEP,

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:32.110
which is Perceived, Planned,
and Executed to Perfection.

00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:35.390
So if you don't perceive
what the challenge is,

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:37.670
how you're gonna get it
and then plan for it,

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:39.190
then you can't execute it.

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:42.090
But if you do that, then it's
not going to be a problem.

00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:43.900
And another thing I'll
add, too, is tenure

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:45.820
is not the end-all, be-all.

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:49.560
I've seen a lot of people who
leave this institution well

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:52.620
before that time
frame because they've

00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:56.780
been so successful in other
places they get sucked away.

00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:59.390
And that's not a
bad place to be.

00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:02.500
I've seen people leave and go
to industry because they've

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:03.610
taken that work that way.

00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:05.580
I've seen people leave
and go to other aspects,

00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:07.010
go start companies,
go do things,

00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:09.910
and they've used the time
here to develop that.

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:11.559
So I would just add that thing.

00:38:11.559 --> 00:38:12.850
That's not the end-all, be-all.

00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:14.516
All if you're enjoying
what you're doing

00:38:14.516 --> 00:38:20.102
and happy and productive, then
that's the best place to be.

00:38:20.102 --> 00:38:22.060
DEVAH PAGER: Yeah, I
would echo those comments.

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:24.320
And I think the
faculty that I have

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:27.620
seen that have not been
successful have been folks that

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:36.000
have diverted their attention
to other activities that maybe

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.454
gave them more immediate
reinforcement but weren't

00:38:38.454 --> 00:38:40.870
the kind of scholarly production
that they needed in order

00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:42.750
to pass that 10-year bar.

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:50.330
And I think sometimes it's like
the process of writing articles

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:53.580
or books is a long one, and
there's very little feedback,

00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:58.310
and you really have to
be extremely patient

00:38:58.310 --> 00:39:00.570
and endure a lot
of criticism, where

00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:02.522
other things, other
parts of our lives,

00:39:02.522 --> 00:39:04.480
even teaching, for example,
where we're getting

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.790
immediate feedback and
where we're feeling

00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:09.410
like the interaction with the
students is really stimulating

00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:11.220
and that is
fantastic-- and being

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:12.640
able to combine
an active teaching

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:15.822
and research life is the
ideal, but in some cases,

00:39:15.822 --> 00:39:17.530
you shift the balance
to the thing that's

00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:20.180
giving you the most
immediate gratification.

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:25.160
I'll also say that in
addition to the fact

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:27.320
that some people do
leave prior to tenure

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:29.480
and find other things
to do, my sense

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:34.160
is that not getting tenure
at places like Harvard

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:40.270
has a very different impact from
being at other universities.

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:42.910
And so everyone I've seen
both at Princeton and Harvard

00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:45.930
who have not gotten tenure have
gotten great jobs at Research

00:39:45.930 --> 00:39:48.220
1 universities elsewhere.

00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:51.670
So in that sense, this isn't
the only place in the universe

00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:53.410
to do good work.

00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:54.368
[LAUGHING]

00:39:54.368 --> 00:39:55.805
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:03.269 --> 00:40:04.810
SPEAKER 4: I just
wanted to follow up

00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:06.640
on the comment from
both Julie and Devah

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:15.010
about the adjectives "slow" or
"fast" scholarly productivity

00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:18.720
and sort of generally the
nature of productivity.

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:21.090
I would love to hear you
talk a bit-- of course,

00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:26.920
it would be sort of
discipline-specific about what

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:30.240
really counts as good
productivity and what doesn't.

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.320
Because sometimes
people can think

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:35.600
they're doing the right thing,
and it might not, in fact,

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:38.210
be the best investment
of their energy,

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:40.680
even if they're
intelligently not getting

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:44.400
on 17,000 committees
or not getting

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.580
around to doing their work.

00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:48.600
So can you say something
about the sort of temptation

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:50.480
to do the wrong
kind of productivity

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:53.990
and the best ways of
judging where your best

00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:56.947
input for your energy is?

00:40:56.947 --> 00:40:58.780
DARREN HIGGINS: I'll
make a comment to that.

00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:03.650
And I think that the best
indicator of future success

00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:05.490
is prior success.

00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:07.740
And that's a real
issue that you bring up

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:09.780
in terms of doing something
that you may really

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:12.780
want to do that gives you
a lot of gratification

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:15.390
but may not be the best
direction that you might want

00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:17.510
to go in terms of
your evaluation

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:19.240
for promotion, et cetera.

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:21.820
And so that's where
I think having people

00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:25.640
who are in your mentor checkbox
who have sat on the committees

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:28.700
and been involved in the
evaluation process, who

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:32.140
can look at what you do-- and
they'll ask you point blank,

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:34.400
where are you going with this?

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:38.450
Where do you see this
beginning, middle, ed?

00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:40.810
What do you hope
to get out of this?

00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:43.170
And when are you going to
get something out of it?

00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:45.295
And if someone says, well,
this is something that's

00:41:45.295 --> 00:41:46.900
going to be seven
years from now,

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:49.570
and they say, well, you're going
to be evaluated for associate

00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:53.920
in five years, this is not where
you want to invest your time.

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:56.710
So I think it's really
getting the benefit of people

00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:58.700
who can sit down and
tell you point blank.

00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:00.200
You don't want to
surround yourself

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:04.560
with warm fuzzies-- that's
great, that's fantastic,

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.400
go do it, yes, yes, yes.

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:08.095
You also don't want
to surround yourself

00:42:08.095 --> 00:42:10.220
with people who are just,
oh, that will never work,

00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:11.020
don't do it.

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:14.130
You want to find people who
are very pragmatic who can then

00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:16.750
evaluate and say,
well, if you do want

00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:19.250
to do this here are
the things that you

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:21.250
need to be concerned about.

00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:24.410
And then ask yourself, am I
willing to actually do that?

00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:26.150
And if the answer
is yes, then you

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:28.920
might want to take that
chance to go and do that.

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:30.610
And if the answer
is no, then that's

00:42:30.610 --> 00:42:33.270
a good way to steer you
away from those aspects.

00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:39.430
JULIE BUCKLER: Well, I said be
conscious about your decisions.

00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:42.330
And by that I mean be informed.

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:45.960
Because it is really such
a challenging balance,

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:49.630
and frankly, it continues to
be challenging at every career

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:52.470
stage now, in my
experience, which

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:56.110
is to say that you have to
push really hard to move things

00:42:56.110 --> 00:42:57.640
forward and make them happen.

00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:00.000
And especially as a
junior person here,

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.490
you really have to work
hard to deliver the goods.

00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:07.060
But on the other hand, you
have to live your life.

00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:08.940
You do have to
find some balance,

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:11.400
and you can't turn
yourself inside out.

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:15.910
And many of us have other
commitments of various kinds

00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:17.340
that are important
to us, or there

00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:20.390
are things we also need to
do for our mental health.

00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:23.140
So it's really quite tricky.

00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:25.030
I mean, it's something
I guess you decide

00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:28.480
on a daily basis, which
is why I also advocate

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:31.360
the use of a master plan
so that you can be doing

00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:33.060
short- and long-term planning.

00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:36.130
And it's a marathon, basically.

00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:40.670
You need to be able
to sustain your pace.

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:43.260
And you need to be able to last.

00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:44.920
[LAUGHING]

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:47.680
DEVAH PAGER: So I just say
that in the social sciences,

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:50.360
we tend to work on
multiple projects at once.

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:52.680
But the danger is that
it's a much, much more fun

00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:55.460
to start new things than it
is to finish older things.

00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:58.430
And I think that's a temptation
that needs to be resisted.

00:43:58.430 --> 00:44:00.060
So whenever you
start a new project,

00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:02.018
you have to be really,
really thoughtful about,

00:44:02.018 --> 00:44:03.820
is this the thing
that I'm really

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:05.210
going to commit
to going forward,

00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:07.790
or is this just going to
distract me from the work

00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:09.650
that I already have ongoing?

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:12.520
And I feel really
strongly about the idea

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:15.270
that there is no such thing
as a quick and dirty project.

00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:17.950
So there's often the
temptation to think, oh,

00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:19.420
this new issue
came up, or I just

00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:20.470
found this new source of data.

00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:22.200
I'm going to do this
quick and dirty analysis,

00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:24.033
and it's just going to
take me a week or so,

00:44:24.033 --> 00:44:26.790
and then I'll write it up, and
it just be a little side piece.

00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:29.950
In my experience,
those projects end

00:44:29.950 --> 00:44:32.100
up taking just as
long as the projects

00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:35.020
that I feel like are really
big and important, or can,

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:38.620
and so keep in mind that
there is no such thing

00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:41.130
as that quick energy project.

00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:45.390
And I just wanted to say for
me when I'm evaluating files,

00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:50.150
I feel like a smaller number of
really important, high quality

00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:53.630
pieces is worth so much
more than a long CV

00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:55.170
of mediocre pieces.

00:44:55.170 --> 00:45:00.490
And so I would invest more
in every single project

00:45:00.490 --> 00:45:02.200
or publication
rather than trying

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:06.697
to just stuff your CV full
of less meaningful entries.

00:45:06.697 --> 00:45:08.530
JULIE BUCKLER: I just
want to add something.

00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:12.380
There was an earlier question
about how to describe people

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:14.160
who were not successful here.

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:16.670
And I am thinking of
a particular example

00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:20.660
of a person who was kind of a
writing and publishing machine,

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:23.390
endlessly producing and
publish-- it's actually not

00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:26.640
that difficult to place
things and get them published.

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:30.620
But then it's out there, and
the work was kind of shallow.

00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:35.700
And now that I'm not
under that same pressure,

00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:38.460
I actually publish
pretty slowly,

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:40.400
because I really
don't want my work

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:44.020
to be published unless I
feel it's my very best work.

00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:50.650
And so that's another one of
those tensions and paradoxes

00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:52.400
about the appointment
at Harvard,

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:55.940
that they do want to
see some quantity,

00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:59.330
but you can't be obsessed with
quantity, because it will lead

00:45:59.330 --> 00:46:00.600
you in the wrong direction.

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:03.221
I really agree completely
with what you said.

00:46:09.441 --> 00:46:11.440
ELIZABETH ANCARANA: Other
questions or comments?

00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:23.250
SPEAKER 5: What do you
do when you get rejected?

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:28.950
JULIE BUCKLER: You mean like
something for publication, or--

00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:31.372
SPEAKER 5: A book manuscript,
a paper, a grant proposal.

00:46:31.372 --> 00:46:33.330
It's going to happen to
everybody in this room.

00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:35.340
And it's one of the
most awful things

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:38.480
to happen to a faculty member.

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:39.980
DARREN HIGGINS:
That's an evolution.

00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:40.980
It's funny you say that.

00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:44.010
First off, rejection
is part of it,

00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:48.395
because everyone has an
opinion, and their opinion

00:46:48.395 --> 00:46:50.670
is not going to necessarily
be in tune with yours.

00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:52.920
And so in terms of the
rejection, that's a part of it.

00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:57.460
My question would be, how
many times did I get rejected?

00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:01.460
So for me, the average time that
somebody submits an R1 grant,

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:04.780
and I think it's like four
times before it gets in.

00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:07.040
Nowadays, publications,
they get it

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:09.550
rejected at least once
or twice, because people

00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:10.730
want to see more.

00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:13.290
And so I think you have
to kind of look it as,

00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:15.840
what's the rationale
and the reason?

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:18.020
And so for me, rejection
is this is part of it.

00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:21.220
Did you put something that
was-- as Julie was just saying,

00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:22.540
was it your best effort?

00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:23.490
Was it not shallow?

00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:25.820
Was it very well crafted?

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:26.320
Great.

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:28.790
If someone rejects it,
why did they reject it?

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:30.040
And I give you three examples.

00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.170
So sometimes you may
get it rejected because

00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:35.600
of the wrong reasons, which
is a competitor saw it,

00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:39.420
and they just don't want it
out there for certain reasons.

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:41.500
If it's a publication,
I have a habit now

00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:44.920
of what I do is I just
go right to the editors.

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:47.540
And I'll call the person-- and
they love this-- and I'll say,

00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:48.980
well, the paper got rejected.

00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:50.750
Here are the
reasons why, this is

00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:55.170
what I'm willing to
do to improve it,

00:47:55.170 --> 00:47:58.460
This is what I think
is completely off base.

00:47:58.460 --> 00:47:59.720
What do you think?

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:02.360
And they'll say, oh,
OK, no we can't do that.

00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:02.860
Great.

00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:04.360
I'm going to send
it someplace else.

00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:06.060
Often times, they
will agree with you,

00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:08.393
and they say, well, the
reviewer asked you for something

00:48:08.393 --> 00:48:10.220
that really is not reasonable.

00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:12.580
That's five more years of work.

00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:13.870
That's not really reasonable.

00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:15.870
So if you don't agree,
I'm not going to do that,

00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:17.245
and this is what
I'm going to do.

00:48:17.245 --> 00:48:19.560
So the benefit of that is
now when it goes back, we've

00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:21.800
addressed all the potential
things so it doesn't get

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:22.630
rejected again.

00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:24.530
So it's minimizing
the rejection.

00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:27.660
In terms of grant
processes, as I said,

00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:30.490
it's many, many times
it will get rejected.

00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:33.400
You certainly have a
smaller [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:35.434
larger amount of times
you can send it in.

00:48:35.434 --> 00:48:36.850
The question I
would say is, well,

00:48:36.850 --> 00:48:39.320
did you go get the
appropriate advice to see what

00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:40.800
are the reasons why?

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:42.669
Is it not scientifically sound?

00:48:42.669 --> 00:48:44.460
And sometimes someone
will say, this really

00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:45.480
isn't scientifically sound.

00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:46.320
We don't think
it's going to work.

00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:47.903
At that point, you
may say, I may have

00:48:47.903 --> 00:48:50.140
to go to a different direction.

00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:51.880
So my answer to that
is really, what's

00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:54.430
the reason for the rejection?

00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:56.402
And is it based on
something that's grounded?

00:48:56.402 --> 00:48:57.610
And what can I do about that?

00:48:57.610 --> 00:49:01.445
But rejection is
just part of it.

00:49:01.445 --> 00:49:02.820
DEVAH PAGER: Yeah,
you definitely

00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:03.861
can't take it personally.

00:49:03.861 --> 00:49:06.630
There is so much randomness
in the review process,

00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:10.230
in every review process.

00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:12.800
And some of my
favorite papers have

00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:14.890
gotten rejected by one
of the top journals

00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:17.600
and then accepted by the other
top journal in my discipline.

00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:21.120
And the reviews just read
the paper very differently.

00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:24.860
So I definitely wouldn't take
it personally, and in some cases

00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:27.594
I would just turn around
and send it right back out.

00:49:27.594 --> 00:49:29.760
There are other cases where
you get the reviews back

00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:31.070
and you realize, you know what?

00:49:31.070 --> 00:49:33.500
I didn't communicate
that idea effectively,

00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:36.484
and at least for this
subset of readers

00:49:36.484 --> 00:49:38.650
who are coming from a
different perspective from me,

00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:41.540
they need a different set
of evidence or arguments

00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:42.790
that's going to convince them.

00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:48.415
And then I try to make it
better and get out there again.

00:49:48.415 --> 00:49:50.040
JULIE BUCKLER: It's
a learning process.

00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:53.380
It seems like whenever I try
to move into something new,

00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:56.570
my first attempts
are not successful.

00:49:56.570 --> 00:50:00.190
And then I try to figure
it out from there.

00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:04.570
But it is disconcerting
to realize that, yes, you

00:50:04.570 --> 00:50:07.860
can submit an article to one
of your field's top journals

00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:12.050
and have it rejected even though
you're tenured at Harvard.

00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:13.430
And it can happen.

00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:15.000
It does happen regularly.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:15.930
So I don't know.

00:50:15.930 --> 00:50:21.174
I think thickening your hide a
little bit is good, is helpful.

00:50:21.174 --> 00:50:22.590
DARREN HIGGINS:
One thing I'll add

00:50:22.590 --> 00:50:26.150
to that is using whatever
the rejection was

00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:28.650
for future information.

00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:30.830
So for example,
in my field there

00:50:30.830 --> 00:50:34.110
are certain study sections
of the evaluation panels

00:50:34.110 --> 00:50:36.090
that just don't
like certain things.

00:50:36.090 --> 00:50:37.800
And I had this
experiment one time,

00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:39.530
which was a great experiment.

00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:41.690
I couldn't have
designed it any better.

00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:45.830
I submitted a grant in response
to a request for applications,

00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:48.840
and they had so many
requests that they said,

00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:50.830
we're going to extend
the time for evaluation.

00:50:50.830 --> 00:50:54.570
We're going to give 25 grants,
and we have 600 applications.

00:50:54.570 --> 00:50:55.770
So we have to extend it.

00:50:55.770 --> 00:50:58.230
And they said, so we're
going to suspect this rule,

00:50:58.230 --> 00:51:02.380
and you can now submit
the exact same grant

00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:06.450
at the same time as this one
to a different study section

00:51:06.450 --> 00:51:07.709
and just change the name.

00:51:07.709 --> 00:51:10.000
Because we think there's
going to be some great grants,

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.125
but we don't want you
waiting around for six months

00:51:12.125 --> 00:51:14.310
to get one of these
25 when you could just

00:51:14.310 --> 00:51:16.560
go to a regular study section
and probably get it now.

00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:17.220
So I said, OK.

00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:19.080
So I just changed the
name and submitted it.

00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:21.330
So when I submitted it to
the regular studies section,

00:51:21.330 --> 00:51:23.710
it was triaged-- boom--
wasn't even reviewed.

00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:25.000
This is horrible.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:25.930
It will never work.

00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:26.790
It's not innovative.

00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:27.440
It's not creative.

00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:29.315
We don't understand why
he's submitting this.

00:51:29.315 --> 00:51:33.070
But I got one of those 25
grants from the first one.

00:51:33.070 --> 00:51:36.310
And it was the exact same grant.

00:51:36.310 --> 00:51:40.560
And what I realized was that
that grant for that study

00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:45.330
section that they asked for for
this specific thing was perfect

00:51:45.330 --> 00:51:46.810
but for the general
sort of thing

00:51:46.810 --> 00:51:48.520
really wasn't as appreciated.

00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:51.270
So from now on, whenever I
submit something, I would say,

00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:52.540
it needs to be here.

00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:56.020
It has to get here, it has to
get in this particular review

00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:56.900
panel.

00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:59.350
And what I didn't realize
in, and one of my mentors

00:51:59.350 --> 00:52:02.830
told me here, was that you have
a right when you submit grants

00:52:02.830 --> 00:52:04.710
to have your grant
reviewed in the most

00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:06.450
favorable circumstances.

00:52:06.450 --> 00:52:09.380
So if it gets sent to a study
section you don't want it in,

00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:12.320
you can call up and
say, please move it.

00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:14.260
And I didn't realize
that, and I had a grant.

00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:15.732
It got rejected, another one.

00:52:15.732 --> 00:52:17.940
I called up, and I said,
this is not the right place.

00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:20.550
They sent it to the other
one, and it got funded.

00:52:20.550 --> 00:52:23.780
So a lot of it is just the
context of who's seeing it,

00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:24.950
who's looking at it.

00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:26.700
And I just want to add
this one point now,

00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:29.640
because this is one of
the best pieces of advice

00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:32.880
that I ever got as
a faculty member

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:34.745
at Harvard in the last 17 years.

00:52:34.745 --> 00:52:36.370
And I have to credit
my colleague Steve

00:52:36.370 --> 00:52:37.700
Lory who told me this.

00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:40.600
And he asked me, he said,
how is your stuff going

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:42.220
to get reviewed?

00:52:42.220 --> 00:52:44.330
Do you understand how it's
going to get reviewed?

00:52:44.330 --> 00:52:45.880
And I said, well,
of course I do.

00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:47.760
They get it, it goes
at this study section,

00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:50.260
it goes to this panel, it goes
here, it goes here, great.

00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:50.840
He goes, no.

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:51.960
You don't you know.

00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:53.060
It's not going to get
reviewed that way.

00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:54.600
What's going to
happen is there's

00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:58.520
going to be somebody who's
tired, who's working all day,

00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:00.630
who just had a fight
with their spouse,

00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:02.690
whose kid got in
trouble with school,

00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:04.480
whose dog got into
the neighbor's yard

00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:06.040
and messed it up,
who's mother-in-law

00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:08.220
is coming and crashed the car.

00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:11.170
And they're going away
for some other meeting,

00:53:11.170 --> 00:53:12.920
and they have this
limited window of time,

00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:15.140
and they pull out your
paper, your grant,

00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:17.700
to read it on the
plane while they're

00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:20.340
going to wherever they're
going to before they come back

00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:22.600
to everything that's
going on in their life.

00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:25.690
So your stuff is going to
get reviewed under the worst

00:53:25.690 --> 00:53:28.610
possible circumstances.

00:53:28.610 --> 00:53:31.200
So you need to make
sure you understand that

00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:32.950
and make sure
everything is clear.

00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:35.950
And he just gave the sage
advice of, if I read this page

00:53:35.950 --> 00:53:39.290
and I stopped, and then
I picked it back up again

00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:41.680
and I looked at it,
what's most important?

00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:42.900
Put that in highlight.

00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:44.480
Do this.

00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:47.620
Every time you start a new
section, repeat the same thing.

00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:50.560
If I'm having a conversation and
I interrupt your conversation,

00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:53.087
I come back, OK, catch
me up to where I am.

00:53:53.087 --> 00:53:54.670
That's how it's going
to get reviewed.

00:53:54.670 --> 00:53:56.850
So it's these little
sort of pieces of things

00:53:56.850 --> 00:54:00.250
and understanding the realities
of the process which I

00:54:00.250 --> 00:54:01.750
think will be very beneficial.

00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:03.950
And that's the thing,
because it takes time,

00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:06.630
as Julie said, to
understand the realities.

00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:10.187
But once you understand that, I
think it becomes more tenable.

00:54:10.187 --> 00:54:11.770
Because now whenever
I write anything,

00:54:11.770 --> 00:54:14.180
I assume this is going
to be read by somebody

00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:18.260
on a plane in the worst
possible lighting with the kid

00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:20.270
behind him kicking in the seat.

00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:23.546
Because I have reviewed
things in that same way.

00:54:23.546 --> 00:54:25.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:31.070 --> 00:54:32.846
SPEAKER 6: Hi.

00:54:32.846 --> 00:54:34.800
So let's say you're
in a field which

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:37.740
is very ideologically
polarized with a lot

00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:40.225
of political controversy.

00:54:40.225 --> 00:54:41.933
Let's say your work
can be controversial.

00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:47.060
And that will affect,
of course, reviews.

00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:49.320
That will affect
what people are going

00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:53.729
to say when they send things
out for tenure and stuff.

00:54:53.729 --> 00:54:56.020
How would you navigate that,
sort of knowing in advance

00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:57.686
that this is the kind
of field you're in

00:54:57.686 --> 00:55:00.200
and there are sort of
big ideological stakes,

00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:03.700
there are going to be divides
and angry opponents, things

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:05.030
like that?

00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:09.440
How do you navigate
that in terms of tenure?

00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:12.740
DEVAH PAGER: So every field and
every department are different.

00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:17.480
My advice would be to keep in
mind that affect can overcome

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:19.890
ideology, and you
shouldn't automatically

00:55:19.890 --> 00:55:23.560
assume that whatever factions
exist in your department

00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:26.270
are immediately going
to be imposed on you.

00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:28.130
And so you may have
natural allies,

00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:30.950
and you may fit in better
with one set of senior faculty

00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:32.120
than another.

00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:35.800
But you shouldn't give up
on cultivating relationships

00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:38.960
and contact with the
wider pool of faculty,

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:42.060
because if people see you
as a human being, not just

00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:43.914
a member of this
warring faction,

00:55:43.914 --> 00:55:46.330
I think they're going to be
more invested in understanding

00:55:46.330 --> 00:55:48.190
your work and seeing
its contribution

00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:51.650
and seeing it in light of
its full scholarly potential

00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:55.390
rather than just seeing you as
one part of an opposing army.

00:55:55.390 --> 00:55:57.920
So, yeah, that
would be my advice.

00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:00.830
JULIE BUCKLER: I think it's
absolutely right that you find

00:56:00.830 --> 00:56:04.310
allies in strange
places and at its best,

00:56:04.310 --> 00:56:07.930
people practice here this kind
of culture of civility, where

00:56:07.930 --> 00:56:10.800
you sit around a table at a
department meeting talking

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:13.460
about a search or some
intellectual issue.

00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:15.700
And there are real
differences in views,

00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:18.630
and people really care
a lot about the outcome,

00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:21.840
and it's quite a
challenge to remain civil

00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:25.550
and to keep things
from getting heated

00:56:25.550 --> 00:56:27.920
and to stand your ground.

00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:32.470
But when it works, it's
such a beautiful system.

00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:36.000
You'll see it in operation in
your department and program.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:43.060
And it's such an
invaluable skill.

00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:46.870
It's never a good idea to send
an email when you're annoyed,

00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:50.370
to snap one off--
always a bad idea.

00:56:50.370 --> 00:56:52.240
And it's always a
bad idea to snap

00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:53.610
at a colleague in a meeting.

00:56:53.610 --> 00:56:58.064
And you just really have
to have good self-control.

00:56:58.064 --> 00:56:59.480
DARREN HIGGINS:
Yeah, I think just

00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:02.040
to echo the two things
is the word ally.

00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:03.750
I think if you're
going into a field

00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:07.000
where there's a lot of political
issue, a lot of contention,

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.210
the question is, who are
the most prominent people

00:57:10.210 --> 00:57:13.530
that may have some sensitivities
to what you're doing

00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:16.384
and how you can actually
change it or direct it?

00:57:16.384 --> 00:57:17.800
That gets to the
thing I mentioned

00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:20.357
about writing your own
recommendation letter in terms

00:57:20.357 --> 00:57:22.690
of being able to clearly
articulate what you're bringing

00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:25.000
to the table that no
one else is and how

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:26.550
your view may be productive.

00:57:26.550 --> 00:57:29.160
And just focus on the focus
on the positive aspect.

00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:32.980
Here is something that may
be able to unify and get

00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:36.090
past some of the contention that
you're having and you're having

00:57:36.090 --> 00:57:37.624
to come to a unified agreement.

00:57:37.624 --> 00:57:39.290
And this is how I'm
going to approach it

00:57:39.290 --> 00:57:40.498
and how I'm going to do that.

00:57:40.498 --> 00:57:43.900
And I think as starting someone
new, that actually a benefit.

00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:45.290
My own personal
experience, there

00:57:45.290 --> 00:57:47.230
was a little bit
of warring factions

00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:49.340
in my group between
the Americans

00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:51.540
and the French and the Germans.

00:57:51.540 --> 00:57:54.269
And then this Canadian scientist
came in and collaborated

00:57:54.269 --> 00:57:55.310
with all of us secretly--

00:57:55.310 --> 00:57:56.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:56.940 --> 00:58:00.460
--and then published his
paper with everybody on it

00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:02.641
that we then realized, like wow.

00:58:02.641 --> 00:58:04.890
And then we said, this was
someone who came completely

00:58:04.890 --> 00:58:08.320
from a different field, who
really changed our thinking

00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:11.600
and was able to overcome
this sort of entrenched

00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:12.840
political squabble.

00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:15.586
And we realized, yeah, this
person did us a service.

00:58:15.586 --> 00:58:17.210
So I think if you
can position yourself

00:58:17.210 --> 00:58:19.430
in that way, that's
a way to overcome

00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:23.212
that initial angst of moving
into a direction that way.

00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:29.570
ELIZABETH ANCARANA: Well, that
was really very informative.

00:58:29.570 --> 00:58:33.992
Thank you to our three
panelists for joining us today.

00:58:33.992 --> 00:58:39.500
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:42.494
And now Judy will provide
some closing remarks.

00:58:48.284 --> 00:58:49.450
JUDITH D. SINGER: Thank you.

00:58:49.450 --> 00:58:51.830
Well, actually, thank
you all for being here.

00:58:51.830 --> 00:58:55.500
It means a lot of us to
see all these new faces

00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:58.950
and to think about what
the faculty of the future

00:58:58.950 --> 00:59:00.520
of Harvard is going to be like.

00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:03.500
And also thank our
colleagues here

00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:05.440
for taking the time and
our prior colleagues

00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:08.316
for taking the time.

00:59:08.316 --> 00:59:10.690
Essentially I just want people
to get to know each other.

00:59:10.690 --> 00:59:14.050
So I think we're going
to provide a break time.

00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:15.780
But you have heard
some themes here

00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:17.920
that I just want
to reiterate-- some

00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:20.436
of the phrases of
having a master

00:59:20.436 --> 00:59:22.310
or being the general
contractor of your life.

00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:24.250
I always say have a
mission statement.

00:59:24.250 --> 00:59:28.930
And part of that
is being strategic.

00:59:28.930 --> 00:59:29.960
Time is short.

00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:32.160
And so I think a lot
of the questions,

00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:34.320
a lot of the comments
were about ways

00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:38.590
in which people try to be
strategic about their time

00:59:38.590 --> 00:59:41.850
and their energy
and their resources.

00:59:41.850 --> 00:59:45.730
Another part is, learning
to say "I don't know"

00:59:45.730 --> 00:59:48.690
is one of the hardest things
for a Harvard faculty member

00:59:48.690 --> 00:59:50.120
to say.

00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:52.950
Because we selected you.

00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:54.342
We expect you know everything.

00:59:54.342 --> 00:59:55.300
And you know something?

00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:56.050
You don't.

00:59:56.050 --> 00:59:57.812
And so whether it's
learning to say

00:59:57.812 --> 00:59:59.770
"I don't know" to a
student, when it's learning

00:59:59.770 --> 01:00:01.790
to say "I don't
know" to a colleague,

01:00:01.790 --> 01:00:04.320
when it's learning to say "I
don't know" to a colleague.

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:05.590
"Can you give me some advice?"

01:00:05.590 --> 01:00:09.620
And then never only
ask one person.

01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:11.107
Because if you only
ask one person,

01:00:11.107 --> 01:00:13.190
you'll be convinced that
that person just gave you

01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:14.630
the right answer.

01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:17.410
And chances are
that person didn't.

01:00:17.410 --> 01:00:20.900
So learning how to ask
questions is something that

01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:23.246
has come up time and a time.

01:00:23.246 --> 01:00:24.870
And reaching outside
of your boundaries

01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:28.120
is something that we're
very interested in.

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:30.560
I've had the pleasure reading
most of your dossiers.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:34.190
So a lot of the work that's
done by the people in this room

01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:36.330
increasingly is
interdisciplinary.

01:00:36.330 --> 01:00:38.490
And so learning how
to cross boundaries,

01:00:38.490 --> 01:00:41.510
but also being strategic and
not crossing so many boundaries

01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:43.980
that you're splat
on the floor and you

01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:45.880
haven't done the kinds
of strategic things

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:48.130
that you need to be successful.

01:00:48.130 --> 01:00:50.035
And if the success
leads to tenure, great.

01:00:50.035 --> 01:00:52.160
If it doesn't, at least
you'll be true to yourself.

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:56.940
And so being successful and
strategic and time management--

01:00:56.940 --> 01:00:58.779
I think several people
said that's probably

01:00:58.779 --> 01:00:59.820
the most important thing.

01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:01.810
Learning to say no is
about time management.

01:01:01.810 --> 01:01:04.890
Being proactive is
about time management.

01:01:04.890 --> 01:01:06.764
Instead of waiting to
see what committees

01:01:06.764 --> 01:01:09.180
you're asked to be on, think
about what the two things you

01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:10.860
want to do are, go
to your department

01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:12.760
chair or your
academic dean and say,

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:14.460
these are the things
that interest me.

01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:15.850
They're perfectly
happy to figure out

01:01:15.850 --> 01:01:16.850
how to work around that.

01:01:16.850 --> 01:01:19.800
So instead of just waiting
for things to happen,

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:23.680
being proactive and having
that align with your mission

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:27.895
becomes another way to think
about being successful here.

01:01:27.895 --> 01:01:29.270
I'm going to close
it out by just

01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:30.910
saying there are going to
be a lot of other events

01:01:30.910 --> 01:01:31.489
the semester.

01:01:31.489 --> 01:01:33.530
Some of them you've already
gotten e-mails about.

01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:35.600
We have an event at
the Houghton Library

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:36.830
at the end of the month.

01:01:36.830 --> 01:01:40.230
The Houghton library is a jewel
box on the Harvard campus.

01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:42.514
It's the rare book collection.

01:01:42.514 --> 01:01:44.430
[INAUDIBLE] Menand from
the English department

01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:45.650
is going to be giving a talk.

01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:47.274
You're going to be
able to go and touch

01:01:47.274 --> 01:01:48.760
Emily Dickinson's desk.

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:53.110
And you can pick out books,
first editions, notes

01:01:53.110 --> 01:01:54.900
by various authors.

01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:56.820
You can think about
your favorite author

01:01:56.820 --> 01:02:00.070
and go find the papers that
he or she might have given.

01:02:00.070 --> 01:02:01.510
So I encourage you to join us.

01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:03.093
There will also be
a publishing event,

01:02:03.093 --> 01:02:06.490
where we're inviting editors
from Harvard and MIT Press.

01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:08.346
And we've got a book agent.

01:02:08.346 --> 01:02:10.470
So if you're interested,
if you're in a book field,

01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:13.230
learning about the book world--
even if you're not yet there,

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:15.040
it just sort of
gives you an idea

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:18.150
about it issues involved
in book publishing.

01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:22.370
On the fun side, we've got
bank of tickets for the ART

01:02:22.370 --> 01:02:24.260
in December.

01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:26.254
We hold a reception
at the ed school,

01:02:26.254 --> 01:02:28.670
which is right across from the
American Repertory Theater.

01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:31.270
So I encourage you
to join us for that.

01:02:31.270 --> 01:02:34.315
I hold lunches for tenure-track
faculty during the year.

01:02:34.315 --> 01:02:36.190
So we've got a whole
bunch of things planned.

01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:37.860
We often do things
on social media,

01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:40.190
on op-ed writing about
getting your voice out there.

01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:42.360
So we're always
looking for ideas.

01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:44.036
So if you have any
idea about something

01:02:44.036 --> 01:02:45.660
you'd like to learn
more about, chances

01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:47.240
are you're not the only person.

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:49.190
Let Elizabeth-- Elizabeth
there conveniently

01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:51.650
have the same name--
or me know, and we'd

01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:56.010
be happy to steal your idea and
magnify it for other people.

01:02:56.010 --> 01:02:57.680
So why don't I stop here?

01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:59.204
We have a reception upstairs.

01:02:59.204 --> 01:03:00.620
You can go check
your email and do

01:03:00.620 --> 01:03:01.828
all of those kinds of things.

01:03:01.828 --> 01:03:04.400
Hang out in the lobby,
or just hang out here.

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:06.290
Or come up to the
reception to meet.

01:03:06.290 --> 01:03:07.974
We have about another
30 or 40 people

01:03:07.974 --> 01:03:09.390
coming from across
the university.

01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:12.260
So I just want to say thank
you very much for joining us.

01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:14.870
And I look forward to meeting
every one of you and talk.

01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:17.980
My goal is to know every
Harvard faculty member.

01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:21.440
I'm actually not bad
at it at this point.

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:23.410
So I look forward to
talking to all of you.

01:03:23.410 --> 01:03:24.390
And thank you.

01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:25.940
[APPLAUSE]
