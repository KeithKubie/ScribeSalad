00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.460
I'm really looking forward to this project today

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.580
because in this video, we get to play with sand

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.460
Now, back when I made my first Mini Metal Foundry,

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.240
and used it to melt down soda cans,

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.960
I was looking for the most convenient and easy ways to cast that metal.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.800
You've seen the Styrofoam casting method, where we make the object out of Styrofoam,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.320
and bury it in a bucket of sand,

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.080
but the problem is, the Styrofoam object always gets destroyed.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.520
I followed up by trying to make some Plaster molds,

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.920
but we found that the Plaster cracks, so in this video,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.420
we're trying a method I've actually wanted to try for years, and that's Green Sand casting.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.800
Now, a lot of you watching have probably seen videos on Green Sand casting,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.980
or maybe even tried it yourself,

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.840
but because of all my projects, experiments, and productions,

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.880
I haven't found the time to play with it myself.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.300
So that's what we're doing today.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.860
The purpose of this video, is to make some high quality Green Sand for metal casting.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.340
Let's get started!

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.240
Now, the materials we are going to be using for making our sand are very simple,

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.460
I just went down to the local Home Depot, and picked up this 50 lb bag of Play Sand,

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.380
that was only about $3.50

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.120
Then I went down to Walmart, and picked up this bag of Unscented Kitty Litter for about a $1.50.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.760
Aside from those, we're just gonna need a scale, and a spray bottle of water.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.440
When it comes to casting your metals, the finer the material is that you cast into,

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.100
the cleaner your result is going to be.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.980
So we really want the finest sand, and finest clay that we can get.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.620
Unfortunately, with Play Sand like this, you can see that it's not that fine.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.960
And the Kitty Litter we got is Bentonite Clay, but you can see it comes in all kinds of clumps.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.780
So the first thing we need to do to prepare our materials, is screen our sand and crush our Kitty Litter.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.640
Now, while I was down at the super-center, I picked up a couple of different options in strainers,

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.400
and while I would love to use the larger one, because it would be quicker,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.220
if you look at the mesh here, you can see the holes are a little bit wider.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.480
That's going to allow larger grains of sand to fall through, and what we really want,

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.920
is a fine mesh, like this 3-inch strainer.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.120
If you look at the mesh of this, you can see that only very fine grains of sand are going to be able to get through,

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.680
and that's really what we want, even though it's going to take a lot longer.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.680
so first step grab some sand, grab your strainer

00:01:46.580 --> 00:02:17.360
get sifting

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.700
hey guys I am back from straining my
sound and check out what I've done here

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.660
I actually used both sets of strainers I
use a larger one first to speed up the

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.140
process and get the big chunks out then
I took the strain pieces of sand and ran

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.400
it through this 3-inch strainer to get
even finer sand and here are our results

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.070
when we pour these four samples we've
collected out on a plate you can really

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.370
see the difference this first pile here
is the regular sand that's straight from

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.910
the bag the pile over here on the far
right is the stuff we strained off using

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.570
our larger strainer the next pile is the
stuff we strained off using the 3-inch

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.900
strainer this last pile here is the
stuff that was left over and you can see

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.740
it's extremely fine sand everything else
has been filtered off and only the

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.530
smallest particles remain and you can
definitely see that when you compare it

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.500
to the other piles now depending on the
mesh of your strainers you could

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.770
actually get your sand so fine it would
almost be like a powder but of course

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.740
you're going to have to invest some time
into the process now I found an even

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.950
quicker and easier way to get this done
is just go down to your local pet store

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.910
and pick up a bag of aquarium sand this
stuff is already super fine and really

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.480
well sifted it's gonna cost you about $8
a bag but that's well worth your time

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.290
in fact these particles of sand are so
small it's even finer than the stuff we

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.590
just made ourselves but I'm going to put
both of them to the test now the next

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.170
step is to pulverize our kitty litter
and we could do that in a couple of

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.350
different ways we could pour it into a
blender and grind it up or we could just

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.450
stick it in a freezer bag and pound it
with a mallet

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.209
in either case once we've got it all
crushed up we are going to need to

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.390
filter that but we're not going to need
to do nearly as much when we mix these

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.140
things together we're going to use a
ratio of about 95% sand and only 5 to

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.940
10% clay so we're not going to need much

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.300
the stuff that comes out of blender is
really really fine it's almost like

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.300
powder but remember this stuff is going
to wreck your blades so make sure it's a

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:29.180
blender you don't care too much about so
here we are guys we've got our clay

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.930
pulverized and sifted to a point where
it has a consistency of powdered sugar

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.740
over here we have our hand sifted sand
and over here we have our aquarium sand

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.460
so now all we have to do is mix them
together in a ratio of about 95% sand

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.740
and 5 to 10 percent clay and we're going
to measure them by weight using a scale

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.650
so update guys I went ahead and measured
out all the different ingredients here

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.400
we've got our aquarium stand and we've
got our hand sifted sand here I've got

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.140
475 grams in each of these cups now to
make this a ninety five five ratio I

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.950
also measured out 25 grams of clay into
each of these cups what we have to do

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.080
now is pour in the clay and mix these up
thoroughly there are a lot of different

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.020
ways you can mix this stuff together you
could throw it in a blender stir it with

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.230
a stick or even just grab a couple of
cups and pour it back a few times until

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.910
everything looks thoroughly constituted
so here we are we've got our two sample

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.000
size batches thoroughly mixed and ready
to go all that's left to do now is add a

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.300
little water now the key to make you
really good green sand is we want it to

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.660
be moist but we do not want it to be wet
I think the easiest way to do this is

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.930
just pick our sand and gently spread it
out on something like a plate to expose

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.440
more surface area then using a spray
water bottle we'll adjust the nozzle so

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.310
it has a fine spray and we'll just
gently miss the top of the sand when you

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.100
spray a little water you're going to
notice the sand changes color when it

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.530
does you want to go ahead and just
thoroughly mix that in until all the

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.860
color disappears go ahead and keep doing
this until your sand gets the

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.860
consistency where you think would be
great for making sand castles

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.890
now I've sprayed a fair amount of water
here to the point where the sand doesn't

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.890
change color anymore and I mixed it
thoroughly but you can see when I grab a

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.970
handful now and squeeze it when I let it
go it just cracks and crumbles apart and

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.300
that probably means we don't have enough
clay so at this point we can start

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.480
mixing together a little bit more clay
and mix it in thoroughly until it gets

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:21.129
the port where we can squeeze it firmly
and have it all hold together

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:25.190
quick update guys I went ahead and added
more clay powder to this mixture and now

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.090
it's somewhere between 15 to 20 percent
of the total composition and now the

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.419
stand has reached the consistency where
if I grab it and squeeze it in my hand

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:35.930
you can see it leaves a little clump and
if we take that clump it's nice and firm

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.930
but if we give it a little snap it
breaks cleanly right down the center

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.919
I believe that's what we're looking for
the recipe I had was 5 percent clay but

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:46.280
it seems 15 to 20 percent clay works a
little bit better with the place and

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.720
that I'm using here let's see how that
compares to the aquarium's end so check

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.569
this out guys I've just mixed up our
aquarium sand and this time I only use

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:57.919
10% clay but if we do a stop check you
can see a balls-up in my hand just as

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:01.099
nicely as we'd hope it would and if we
crack it down the center we got a nice

00:07:01.099 --> 00:07:05.509
clean break I think this stuff is done
with 10 percent clay and I think it's

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:08.810
attributed to the moisture content it's
a very fine balance though because you

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.349
don't want this stuff dripping wet so
guys it looks like our green sand

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:16.880
experiment was a success in both the
aquarium sand and the place and the only

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.759
real difference I've noticed between the
two is how much time you want to spend

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:24.530
sifting it out okay let's recap we start
off our experiment today with a full bag

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.500
of place sand and family we could use
different sized strainers to get the

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.669
finest sand possible next we crushed up
some unscented kitty litter bentonite

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:35.599
clay until it was a fine powder to match
the mesh of our sand we mix them

00:07:35.599 --> 00:07:39.680
together in a ratio of 95% sand
5% clay and found that that wasn't

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.190
enough to make them stick together so we
added more clay until it was closer to

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:47.389
15% the clay seems to be the glue that
holds the whole composition together and

00:07:47.389 --> 00:07:50.900
the water is the ingredient that
activates it so we added a mist of water

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:54.259
one squirt at a time until the sand
reached a consistency where we could

00:07:54.259 --> 00:07:57.919
squeeze it in our hand and form a clump
that would hold its shape we could tell

00:07:57.919 --> 00:08:00.830
the sound was ready by holding the clump
between two fingers and giving the

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:04.340
little tug a clean break right down the
center indicates the sand is ready to

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.759
use so now that we've got our two sample
batches I think from here on out I'm

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:11.630
using aquarium sand because it's a lot
quicker and more convenient to use so

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:15.740
how is our freshly made green sand going
to hold up to actual metal casting well

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.380
I'm going to make up a whole big batch
of this stuff store it in an airtight

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:21.440
container and we'll test it tomorrow
