[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.660
KAREN: I'd like to
welcome Julia Turshen.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.800
She's a longtime friend of mine,
and she's a writer and recipe

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.920
developer.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.500
In addition to her
newly-published solo effort,

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.600
"Small Victories,"
Julia has coauthored

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.370
such bestselling cookbooks
as "Spain: A Culinary Road

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.810
Trip with Mario
Batali," "It's All Good"

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.690
with Gwenyth Paltrow, as
well as "Mastering Mistakes

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.020
in the Kitchen," "The Kimchi
Chronicles," "Hot Bread

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.240
Kitchen," "The
Fat Radish Kitchen

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.369
Diaries," and "Buvette."

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.650
She also hosted the first two
seasons of "Radio Cherry Bomb,"

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.090
which is a podcast.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.359
And Julia is famous for
using simple techniques

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:43.400
to demonstrate how small
victories in the kitchen

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.570
can help you become
a confident cook.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.860
So we are very excited to
have her here at Google

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.890
to show us all how it's done.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.640
With that, I'll hand
it over to Julia.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.750
JULIA TURSHEN: Thanks, Karen.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.730
Thank you.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.534
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:56.534 --> 00:00:58.700
I think Karen left out--
she said we're old friends,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.770
but Karen's my oldest friend.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.670
We met in the third grade, and
we've been friends ever since.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.740
So this is just great to
be here in its full circle.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.450
And I'm just so happy
to meet all of you.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.550
So I have this new
book, "Small Victories,"

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.980
which I think you're all
gonna get a copy at the end.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:14.976
It came out yesterday.

00:01:14.976 --> 00:01:16.100
I'm super excited about it.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.780
This is my first
time talking about it

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.472
in front of anyone but a
mirror, so this is awesome.

00:01:22.472 --> 00:01:24.680
So I thought I'd tell you
a little bit about the book

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.230
and a little bit about the
recipe that I'll demonstrate.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.390
And then we can eat
some of the recipe,

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.170
and I would love to answer any
questions you guys might have.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.350
So my first question
is how-- see,

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.230
if I worked at Google, I don't
think I would maybe ever cook,

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.040
because you guys have
such amazing food.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.449
But how many of
you cook at home?

00:01:42.449 --> 00:01:43.240
Oh, that's awesome.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.907
OK, cool.

00:01:43.907 --> 00:01:45.990
OK, so I'm talking to home
cooks, so that's great.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.520
So "Small Victories,"
the title is

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.090
the same as just the whole
concept of the cookbook.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.134
And it's basically
approaching food sort

00:01:53.134 --> 00:01:54.800
of thinking about
small victories, which

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.550
I think of as like
tips or techniques that

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.970
make cooking really
approachable,

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.770
really let you be,
like, an intuitive cook,

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.520
and just make it really fun.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.980
And so every recipe
in the book is

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.600
introduced by, like,
a small victory, which

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.920
is this tip or
technique, and then

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.440
every recipe is followed by a
bunch of spin-offs, which are,

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.350
like, variations.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.134
So once you know the
tip or technique,

00:02:13.134 --> 00:02:15.550
you can make the thing, but
you can also make x, y, and z.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.133
So it's sort of
thinking about cooking

00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:18.620
in this very
exponential way, which

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.027
I feel like is kind of-- to me,
there's some sort of synthesis

00:02:22.027 --> 00:02:23.610
with everything you
guys do at Google,

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.110
and it's like this
one thing, but it

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.430
can be so many other things.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.380
So I was gonna demonstrate the
turkey and ricotta meatballs

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.604
today, which are--
honestly, I feel

00:02:32.604 --> 00:02:34.520
like choosing a favorite
recipe from the book,

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.250
it's like asking someone to
choose their favorite kid

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.890
or something.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:37.848
Like, I just-- I can't.

00:02:37.848 --> 00:02:39.350
But this might be it.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.715
And they're especially
special to me

00:02:41.715 --> 00:02:43.090
because they were
the first thing

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.300
I made for my wife, Grace.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.980
And she had told me about--
she had just recently, right

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.574
before we met, she
had eaten these--

00:02:49.574 --> 00:02:50.990
I think they were
veal and ricotta

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.970
meatballs at a restaurant.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:52.870
She said they were so great.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.790
And I was like, oh my god,
like, I love this girl,

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:55.590
I want to impress her.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.610
So I was like, I'm gonna
try to make something.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.860
And so I the first
thing I ever brought

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.470
to her apartment, which became
our apartment, was my pot.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.040
So that's what I brought over.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.760
And I made her these meatballs.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.790
And anyway, we got
married really soon after.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.620
So I feel like-- I don't promise
lifelong love or marriage,

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.870
but it worked for me, so
I highly recommend it.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.710
So we-- I mean, whatever.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.760
Like, it can't hurt, right?

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.620
So the sort of small victories
in this recipe are a few.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.640
One is that I-- the
meatballs are really simple

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.390
and they don't take
that many ingredients.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.530
And I'm gonna combine
turkey with ricotta

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.930
because, as my
mother-in-law recently

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.190
said to me, because she made
these, turkey, let's face it,

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.050
is always dry.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.540
But it's a nice sort of
leaner, healthier option.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.490
And I think adding
ricotta to it makes

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.730
them just not dry and
really sort of succulent

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.710
in this great way, and in a
way that sort of beef and pork

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.390
can be that turkey isn't always.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.220
And it also happens to make the
meatballs totally gluten-free,

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.220
if it's important to you or
the people you're cooking for,

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.680
because you can-- by
adding the ricotta,

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.263
you can skip the
eggs and bread crumbs

00:04:00.263 --> 00:04:02.590
that are normally in meatballs,
which is kind of nice.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.040
And then I just pack them
with a bunch of herbs.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.637
So we're gonna make them, and
then the simplest tomato sauce.

00:04:07.637 --> 00:04:09.970
And the other small victory
is that I bake the meatballs

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.330
instead of pan-frying
them because it's just

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.156
so much easier.

00:04:13.156 --> 00:04:14.030
It's a lot less mess.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.490
You're not, like, cleaning
up, like, a spattered stovetop

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:17.662
and everything.

00:04:17.662 --> 00:04:19.370
So those are some of
the small victories.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.440
And then in the
book, you'll see you

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.460
can turn-- once you know
how to make these meatballs,

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.043
you can take those
techniques and make

00:04:24.043 --> 00:04:25.080
so many different kinds.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.182
So actually my wife Grace runs
amazing website, Design Sponge.

00:04:28.182 --> 00:04:30.640
And this week, I'm doing all
these posts on lunchbox meals.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.670
So yesterday, we did,
like, a turkey merguez

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.020
meatball with, like, cumin and
harissa and flavors like that.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.089
So if you change the
ingredients or change the sauce,

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:40.880
you can really have
this whole other thing.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:41.970
So it's just great.

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.261
So I'm gonna start mixing them.

00:04:43.261 --> 00:04:46.740
But then I was hoping maybe
to get a couple of volunteers

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:47.700
to help me roll them.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.158
But first, I'm
gonna wash my hands.

00:04:49.158 --> 00:04:51.870
But if there's anyone who might
be interested in rolling them,

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.095
you can also-- there's sinks
there, or you can use this one.

00:04:55.095 --> 00:04:58.133
We've got some
gloves if you'd like.

00:04:58.133 --> 00:05:00.086
But I'll just walk
you through them,

00:05:00.086 --> 00:05:01.210
because they're super easy.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.940
I also love
meatballs because you

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.440
can make a huge batch
of them and keep

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.080
them going for a while.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.410
And all the recipes
in the book-- I'm

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.895
just gonna throw
that right there.

00:05:11.895 --> 00:05:13.770
All the recipes in the
book for the most part

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.900
just serve four people,
but this one I purposely

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.385
did a double batch because
I always make extra,

00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:21.010
so I figured most
people would want to,

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.426
because who doesn't
want meatballs

00:05:22.426 --> 00:05:24.500
in the fridge at any point.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.460
So it starts with
just ground turkey.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.280
I definitely prefer
dark meat for this,

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.960
just because it's got a
lot more fat and moisture

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.340
and those things that just
make them taste really good.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.330
And then we have ricotta
cheese, which is just

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.540
whole milk ricotta cheese.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.850
So I'm just gonna add that.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.370
And then it really
helps if you have

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.920
someone like Marion, who's
gonna chop up everything for you

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.420
first.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.510
It makes it super easy.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.380
I highly recommend that.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.020
And then we're gonna do-- this
is just chopped fresh parsley.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.850
And I love it because it
gives them a lot of flavor,

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.300
but also color, and they
look nice and fresh.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.137
This is chopped basil.

00:06:01.137 --> 00:06:01.720
Add all of it?

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.090
Yeah.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.340
OK.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.131
It's all portioned.

00:06:03.131 --> 00:06:04.431
Awesome.

00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:05.680
I have to take you everywhere.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.977
I'm so excited.

00:06:07.977 --> 00:06:09.560
And then this is
some grated Parmesan,

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.190
which I'm putting in them, and
will also put on them later,

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.400
because it just-- Parmesan
makes everything better,

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.450
so why not put it in and on
top, because life is short,

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.530
and it should be full of cheese.

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:23.240
And some chopped fresh garlic.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.610
Same thing.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.860
And some salt.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.090
So I just washed my
hands for probably, like,

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.400
the fifth time
today, and I think

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.090
hands are the best
tool for this job,

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.381
so I just mix it with my hands.

00:06:36.381 --> 00:06:38.130
But if you're kind
of like, I'm not

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.390
so into touching,
like, raw meat,

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:45.290
you can totally just do this
with one big mixing spoon.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:46.772
And that is literally it.

00:06:46.772 --> 00:06:48.980
Like, that's all you need
to do to make this mixture.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.880
And then we're just
gonna roll them into-- I

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.670
like to do kind of, like,
golf ball-sized meatball-- hi,

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:54.420
Jenny Posen.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.670
How are you?

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.160
And-- but you can make
them really, like, small,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.750
like little polpettini, or
you can make larger ones,

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.354
like a big softball-sized
meatball, if you want.

00:07:06.354 --> 00:07:08.270
I guess that gets you
into meatloaf territory,

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.120
but there's nothing
wrong with that.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.170
So as you can see, they
have a lot of-- you know,

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:15.840
they're sort of as
green as they are pink.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.430
And I just-- I love having
that many fresh herbs.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:22.500
And anyway, so is anyone
interested in rolling?

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.000
Yeah.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.550
Oh, awesome.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:23.980
Amazing.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.355
OK, this is gonna
go really fast.

00:07:25.355 --> 00:07:28.040
So if you guys want
to come up here,

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.790
one thing that Marion
took out, which I love,

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.160
is that ice cream scoop.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:38.504
And that means you can get
really evenly-sized meatballs,

00:07:38.504 --> 00:07:40.121
which is awesome.

00:07:40.121 --> 00:07:41.870
But you can also just
kind of freeform it.

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.730
They don't have to be,
like, super perfect.

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:47.240
I'm a big fan of food that's,
like, not totally perfect.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.000
I really just-- I
love homemade stuff

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.480
just in general, and in theory.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.740
So anyway, so if you
guys want to help me out,

00:07:54.740 --> 00:08:00.720
we can use this, or just, you
know, do it about that size.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.760
Yeah, go for it.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.450
And--

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:02.880
AUDIENCE: Just go
right in there?

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.171
JULIA TURSHEN: Yeah, go for it.

00:08:04.171 --> 00:08:06.110
And we'll roll them
out and put them here.

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:06.610
Yeah.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.692
You can use that if you like.

00:08:09.692 --> 00:08:11.650
And maybe while you guys
are rolling those out,

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:13.120
I'm gonna walk you
through the tomato sauce

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.536
that, after we
bake the meatballs,

00:08:14.536 --> 00:08:16.280
they're gonna just
simmer in the sauce.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.965
You can also-- like, my really
close friend Larry, he has,

00:08:20.965 --> 00:08:22.840
like-- I hope he doesn't
mind me saying this.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.340
He's got, like, bad acid
reflux kind of stuff.

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.020
Like, a lot of people have that.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:26.950
So you can skip the sauce.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:28.580
You can just bake the meatballs,
eat them on their own.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:29.570
They're delicious.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:31.250
There's a lot of flexibility.

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.000
I really feel like
recipes, like, they

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.094
tend to be sort of
seen as and treated

00:08:35.094 --> 00:08:36.510
as kind of
prescriptions, like you

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:37.929
have to do this exact thing.

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:40.544
And I totally
don't believe that.

00:08:40.544 --> 00:08:42.169
I feel like you can
make them anything.

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:44.120
It's your kitchen,
it's your meal.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.919
Make it work for
whatever your needs are.

00:08:45.919 --> 00:08:48.460
But I love tomato sauce, and I
think they're delicious in it,

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:49.600
so we're gonna make this.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.024
And it's honestly like-- just--
it'll take, like, 10 seconds.

00:08:53.024 --> 00:08:54.690
And don't blink,
because you'll miss it,

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:55.880
because it's super simple.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.640
So I'm just gonna turn this on.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.780
Did I do it right?

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:01.581
Oh, no.

00:09:01.581 --> 00:09:02.080
Yeah.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:02.870
OK, great.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:07.540
And then all it is is a
little bit of olive oil.

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.870
And then this is
perfectly sliced garlic,

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:12.340
because I didn't slice it.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:13.930
And once this gets
a little bit hot,

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:15.930
I'm gonna add this, and the
oil kind of like-- I always

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.670
think of it, it kind of,
like, blooms the garlic.

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:20.260
It starts to sizzle, and it
just gets all that great flavor.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.080
So I'm gonna let it get
hot so it can do that,

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.871
and then we're gonna
add-- these are canned

00:09:23.871 --> 00:09:27.320
whole tomatoes, which I like to
crush before just so you don't

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.940
get, like, a huge tomato.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.981
But if you like
really smooth sauce,

00:09:30.981 --> 00:09:32.480
you could run them
through a blender

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.720
or use, like, an immersion
blender, a food mill.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.700
You know, whatever
device you have.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.420
But I kind of like,
again, like the sort

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:39.910
of imperfect perfect meatballs.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:41.520
Like, I like a little bit
of texture in the sauce,

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.010
so I like to just crush them
with a hand-- with my hands

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:45.517
and put them in a big bowl.

00:09:45.517 --> 00:09:47.850
And that's-- I don't know if
any of you have kids or are

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:50.240
thinking about it or are
on your way like Karen,

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.881
but it's a really great
job for kids to do,

00:09:52.881 --> 00:09:55.380
like to get in a big bowl of
tomatoes and, like, crush them.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.090
It feels like, oh my god,
I get to make a mess.

00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:58.860
And-- but like, it's
for a good purpose.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:09:59.818
So that's always great.

00:09:59.818 --> 00:10:02.920
So this seems nice and hot.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:06.584
This is way better
than my stove at home.

00:10:06.584 --> 00:10:07.750
So I just added that garlic.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:11.040
And I think you guys
can see-- I'm not sure.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.070
But I'll face it this way.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:15.270
When I add garlic
to oil in a pan,

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:18.630
I always kind of tilt the
pot so that the garlic

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:21.215
can kind of, like, fry in it.

00:10:21.215 --> 00:10:23.090
And obviously, if you
had a ton of olive oil,

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:24.040
you wouldn't need to do that.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.123
But this way, you don't
have to add, like, so much

00:10:26.123 --> 00:10:27.360
fat to what you're making.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.150
So just kind of get it till
it's, like, really nice

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:29.800
and fragrant.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.780
And this, to me, is just
the best smell in the world.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.622
I don't think there's really
much better than that.

00:10:35.622 --> 00:10:36.580
Oh my god, they did it.

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:37.150
That's amazing.

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:37.650
OK.

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:39.830
So we're gonna add the tomatoes.

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:42.170
And just maybe not wear, like,
your favorite white shirt

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:42.878
when you do this.

00:10:42.878 --> 00:10:44.890
That's my only advice.

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:47.770
And those go in.

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:51.380
And I am just gonna
add a bit of salt.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:55.360
And tomatoes definitely
love salt, so don't be shy.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.209
And basically, this
comes to a boil.

00:10:58.209 --> 00:10:59.750
And once it does
that, I'm gonna turn

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:00.875
the heat down a little bit.

00:11:00.875 --> 00:11:02.150
And that is tomato sauce.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:04.624
So tomato sauce is something
a lot of people buy in a jar.

00:11:04.624 --> 00:11:07.290
It usually is, like, filled with
sugar and preservatives and all

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:08.080
this stuff.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.760
Fine if you like those
things, but if you don't, it's

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.009
really-- like to me, this
is the most delicious sauce.

00:11:12.009 --> 00:11:13.300
And it's really that easy.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.610
And this is something that
you can make a big batch of.

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:17.290
It freezes really well.

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:19.560
If you're into,
like, DIY stuff, you

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.160
can buy great tomatoes
right now at the farmers

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.730
market in New York, peel
them, make your own sort

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:26.640
of canned tomatoes.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:27.420
But, that's it.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.850
And it's as simple as that.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:30.300
So these are gonna
go in the oven.

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:31.180
And that's how they'll cook.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:32.810
I love those-- who
made the little one?

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:34.450
It's so cute.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:35.566
That's great.

00:11:35.566 --> 00:11:37.940
The only thing I'm gonna do
before I put them in the oven

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.981
is just drizzle them with
a little bit more olive

00:11:39.981 --> 00:11:43.150
oil on top, because basically
fat helps things brown.

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:44.480
Also makes things delicious.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.790
So a little olive oil will help.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.450
And there's-- I
forgot to mention,

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:51.550
there's olive oil rubbed on a
piece of parchment on this pan,

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:53.400
which again will just
help them release.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.140
Basically anything that makes
your life easier in the kitchen

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.540
is great by me.

00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:59.190
So that's the purpose of that.

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:01.050
It also makes cleanup
easier, because you

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:04.550
don't have, like, that burned,
like, turkey stuff on the pan

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:06.190
once it's done.

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:07.785
So, a little drizzle.

00:12:10.416 --> 00:12:11.790
And then we're
gonna roast these.

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:13.248
And then once
they're cooked, we'll

00:12:13.248 --> 00:12:16.303
pop them in the tomato sauce.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:24.110
OK.

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:24.770
Awesome.

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:26.103
So I'm gonna stick them in here.

00:12:26.103 --> 00:12:31.080
I think we're at 425, which
is I feel like a temperature

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.100
I tend to do a lot of things at.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:41.940
And we're gonna cook them for--
I can't remember how long.

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.220
I think like 20, 25 minutes.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:44.553
But you just sort of check them.

00:12:44.553 --> 00:12:47.269
I'm gonna check this to see what
I told you, because-- let's see

00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.810
if I'm right.

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:48.310
Oh, yeah.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:49.120
About 25 minutes.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.190
That's good.

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.290
And-- but I'll probably
check them around 20.

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:55.609
And since we have two
trays, in 10 minutes,

00:12:55.609 --> 00:12:57.900
I'm just gonna flip them,
just so they cook really nice

00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.010
and evenly.

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:00.690
And then we'll pop them in here.

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:02.697
And those are turkey
and ricotta balls.

00:13:02.697 --> 00:13:04.280
And they're one of
my favorite things.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.363
And I hope you enjoy them.

00:13:05.363 --> 00:13:07.860
And so that you don't have
to wait for 20 minutes,

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.230
we have some already cooked.

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:12.719
And they're bubbling
away right by Deborah.

00:13:12.719 --> 00:13:14.510
And we also have some
pasta, because I just

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:17.760
feel like there's nothing better
than meatballs on spaghetti.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.160
But these are also
something that

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:22.460
like-- I love, like, a big
bowl of, like, something

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:25.704
like really garlicky,
broccoli rabe

00:13:25.704 --> 00:13:26.870
next to a pile of meatballs.

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:27.920
It's like a little
healthier, it's

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.660
a little lighter
if you're trying

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:30.890
to avoid things like carbs.

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:32.410
But if you're not,
then you can just

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:36.570
eat this all to yourself, which
is what I would love to do.

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:40.356
And they're also really
delicious on polenta or rice.

00:13:40.356 --> 00:13:41.730
Anything that's
gonna help absorb

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:44.310
that sauce is really, like,
gonna be your friend here.

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:47.160
Maybe like a piece of garlicky
toast or something like that.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.524
But I really feel like if
you know how to make these,

00:13:49.524 --> 00:13:51.940
you just like-- it means you
have this really great, like,

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:54.074
home-cooked thing in your
fridge waiting for you

00:13:54.074 --> 00:13:55.240
when you get home from work.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.780
You guys all work,
like, super hard.

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:58.420
You work at one of
the busiest places.

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.836
And I feel like taking the
time to make something homemade

00:14:00.836 --> 00:14:03.776
just-- it's a really-- I think
it's a sort of like empowering

00:14:03.776 --> 00:14:05.150
thing to do, and
it's like-- it's

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:08.670
a nice kind of self-care moment,
or great for your family.

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:10.210
So those are the meatballs.

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:12.760
So I would love-- maybe we
could have people try them,

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.020
if that works out.

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.790
And-- oh yeah, and
I would love to know

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:22.160
if you have any questions about
meatballs, cookbooks, anything.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:22.830
Yeah, please.

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:23.506
Yeah.

00:14:23.506 --> 00:14:24.904
AUDIENCE: The tomato sauce--

00:14:24.904 --> 00:14:25.695
JULIA TURSHEN: Mhm.

00:14:25.695 --> 00:14:27.700
AUDIENCE: --it was-- oh.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.600
The tomato sauce, when
you ad made it before,

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.657
like you kind of
crushed it beforehand.

00:14:32.657 --> 00:14:33.490
JULIA TURSHEN: Yeah.

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:35.073
AUDIENCE: Did you
add anything special

00:14:35.073 --> 00:14:36.670
to that, like any herbs or--

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:36.990
JULIA TURSHEN: Nothing.

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:38.220
AUDIENCE: --do all
the herbs going into--

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:38.510
JULIA TURSHEN: Exactly.

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:38.980
AUDIENCE: --the meatball itself?

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:40.355
JULIA TURSHEN:
Into the meatball.

00:14:40.355 --> 00:14:42.720
Sometimes I like to,
like-- that moment when

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.840
you add the tomatoes to the
hot sort of garlicky oil,

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.620
sometimes I like to throw,
like, one or two whole sprigs

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:49.400
of fresh basil.

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:50.000
Just the whole thing.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.458
Like, you don't
even take them off.

00:14:51.458 --> 00:14:53.180
And just let it cook
as the sauce cooks.

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:54.596
And then I pull
it out at the end,

00:14:54.596 --> 00:14:56.664
and it gives like a
really nice flavor.

00:14:56.664 --> 00:14:58.580
But you can-- I mean,
if you want other herbs,

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:00.350
like, you could put,
like, finely-chopped thyme

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:00.880
or rosemary.

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.786
Any of those kinds
of, like, woody herbs.

00:15:02.786 --> 00:15:05.285
And this sauce also can go in
a lot of different directions.

00:15:05.285 --> 00:15:08.130
Like if I'm making-- like
those sort of North African

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:10.250
meatballs I was talking
about, like with the cumin

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:13.047
and stuff, sometimes I'll put
a cinnamon stick in the oil,

00:15:13.047 --> 00:15:14.130
and then add the tomatoes.

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:15.720
And it, like-- it's
one ingredient,

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.511
but it makes it this
whole different thing.

00:15:17.511 --> 00:15:20.010
And it just gives it this whole
new, like, layer of flavor.

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:21.620
So that's a really
nice thing to do.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.860
But this is kind of
like the baseline.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.930
And then you can go anywhere.

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:26.790
AUDIENCE: And sorry, I
have one more question.

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:27.420
JULIA TURSHEN: Yeah, please.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:27.921
Yeah, yeah.

00:15:27.921 --> 00:15:29.420
AUDIENCE: So if
you're not going to,

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.880
like, kind of professionally
can it, jar it, afterwards--

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:32.060
JULIA TURSHEN: Yeah.

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:33.226
Don't need to do that, yeah.

00:15:33.226 --> 00:15:35.410
AUDIENCE: How long
would that stay good?

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:37.090
JULIA TURSHEN: I would say it
would stay good for definitely

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:38.590
at least like a
week in the fridge.

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:41.173
And if you don't want to do the
canning and jarring and stuff,

00:15:41.173 --> 00:15:45.830
I highly recommend just putting
it like in a quart-size Ziploc

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:48.550
or-- you know, whatever brand
of plastic bag you like.

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:50.340
And then freeze it.

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:53.580
And when I do-- I do that with
soups a lot, and tomato sauce.

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:55.390
And I put it in
the bag, and then I

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:56.941
lay it flat in the freezer.

00:15:56.941 --> 00:15:58.690
And then once it's
frozen, you can kind of

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:01.290
stack them up and
make, like, files.

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:03.222
So you can have your,
like, super sauce filing

00:16:03.222 --> 00:16:04.180
cabinet in the freezer.

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:05.680
It takes up, like,
a lot less space,

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:08.290
which is a premium in New York.

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:10.130
And it just makes
it really easy also.

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:11.840
You can do it in a
smaller-sized bag,

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.400
and then you can pull
out-- like if you're just

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.660
cooking for yourself or just
one or two other people,

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.580
like, you don't have to defrost,
like, this huge thing just

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:18.705
to get, like, a little bit.

00:16:18.705 --> 00:16:19.220
So, yeah.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:19.970
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:20.320
Thanks.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.160
JULIA TURSHEN: Yeah, of course.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:21.790
Thank you.

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:27.800
KAREN: For those of us
who don't cook a lot--

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.721
JULIA TURSHEN: Come over.

00:16:29.721 --> 00:16:31.822
KAREN: What do you
recommend starting with?

00:16:31.822 --> 00:16:33.530
What are some good
recipes to begin with?

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:34.490
JULIA TURSHEN: That's
a great question.

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:36.640
I think this is a really
good recipe mostly just

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.300
because they're delicious
and they're, like,

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.591
pretty easy to make, and you
can make such a big batch,

00:16:40.591 --> 00:16:42.630
as I was talking about.

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:44.291
I think I may have--
oh no, it's on.

00:16:44.291 --> 00:16:44.790
Sorry.

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:47.230
There's also-- it really
depends on what you like to eat.

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:50.340
I think if you-- you know,
if you enjoy chicken,

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:52.700
there's a roast chicken in
"Small Victories," which

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:53.640
is kind of like--
there's a roast

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.973
chicken in every cookbook, I
know, but this one I really

00:16:55.973 --> 00:16:58.010
believe in so much
because it sort of teaches

00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:00.260
you all these great techniques
that aren't techniques,

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:01.252
they're just easy.

00:17:01.252 --> 00:17:03.210
Like, I'm thinking about
taking the chicken out

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:05.300
so it's at room temperature
before it goes in the oven,

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.591
so you're not putting this
ice-cold thing in a hot oven

00:17:07.591 --> 00:17:09.409
and, like, why
isn't this cooking.

00:17:09.409 --> 00:17:11.200
So it's like doing a
simple thing like that

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.859
will make a big difference.

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:14.359
It's got a really
nice mix of, like,

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:16.869
salt and rosemary
and lemon and garlic

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:19.119
and just all the things you
want with a roast chicken.

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:20.480
So that's a really
great place to start.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.200
And I feel like
roasting a chicken is

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.800
kind of like-- I feel like if
you can do that in the kitchen

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.175
to get started, it makes you
feel like you can kind of do

00:17:27.175 --> 00:17:27.882
anything.

00:17:27.882 --> 00:17:29.340
But if you're
vegetarian, obviously

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.690
don't roast the chicken,
because that would probably

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:34.150
make you really bummed out.

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:35.760
So yeah, it really
totally depends

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:36.760
on what you want to eat.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.840
But I would say those two are
my favorite starting points.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:47.340
Hey.

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:48.340
AUDIENCE: You brought
it up before--

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:49.470
JULIA TURSHEN: Yeah.

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:50.678
AUDIENCE: Space is a premium.

00:17:50.678 --> 00:17:53.732
So my kitchen is about 1/30
the size of this countertop.

00:17:53.732 --> 00:17:57.194
Do you have any small victories
or strategies or tools--

00:17:57.194 --> 00:17:58.194
JULIA TURSHEN: For sure.

00:17:58.194 --> 00:17:59.646
AUDIENCE: --for really,
really tiny spaces.

00:17:59.646 --> 00:18:00.614
JULIA TURSHEN: Yeah.

00:18:00.614 --> 00:18:02.672
I-- so I now live
in upstate New York.

00:18:02.672 --> 00:18:04.380
We kind of live in
the middle of nowhere.

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:07.350
And I now have a big kitchen.

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:10.220
But prior to that, I lived in
a series of studio apartments

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.550
in New York, and very
rarely had a counter,

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:15.850
you know-- like this, to
me, is a lot of space.

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:18.390
I didn't have that
for a long time.

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:20.250
But I have worked on
cookbooks and I've

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:23.370
tested cookbooks in apartments
with that kind of counter.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:26.895
So I've done a lot of cooking
in really small spaces.

00:18:26.895 --> 00:18:27.770
I think a few things.

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:31.500
One, a folding table
is an awesome thing.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.310
And I have set up
many in-- you know,

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:35.960
whatever space is
near my kitchen

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.811
when I'm doing a lot
of cooking, because I

00:18:37.811 --> 00:18:40.060
think you don't really need
much more space than this.

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:42.960
Like, you can't chop much
more than this at a time.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.440
But my problem was always
like, oh, I cut up these onions

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.434
or whatever, I'm putting
them in a bowl to use,

00:18:47.434 --> 00:18:48.850
and then where do
I put that bowl.

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:50.975
So like having that extra
space somewhere-- the top

00:18:50.975 --> 00:18:53.200
of the fridge is a really
nice spot for that.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.940
But I think having
a small space really

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:56.290
forces you to be organized.

00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:58.230
And to me, cooking
in New York was

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:00.634
all about kind of shopping
for just what I needed

00:19:00.634 --> 00:19:02.300
for that specific
thing, and not getting

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:06.190
overwhelmed with so much
on the counter or anything.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:09.290
And I think the other
thing is like-- I mean,

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:10.460
I love a blender.

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:12.944
I love, you know, I love
a gadget here or there,

00:19:12.944 --> 00:19:15.110
but I really don't think
they're all that necessary.

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:17.260
I honestly think if you
have a few good mixing

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:18.930
bowls and a pot
and a good knife,

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:20.220
like, you can make anything.

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.950
And like, I don't think
you need that many gadgets

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:25.880
or electronics, like,
on the kitchen counter.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.360
So that would be my advice,
is just to kind of pare down.

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:29.740
And you can make a lot.

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:33.650
Any other questions?

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:35.316
AUDIENCE: Can you
tell us more about how

00:19:35.316 --> 00:19:36.400
you got into this field?

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.630
JULIA TURSHEN: Sure, yeah.

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:41.675
So I have cooked since, like,
well before I can remember.

00:19:41.675 --> 00:19:43.800
I can't-- I like truly
can't remember a time when I

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:44.425
wasn't cooking.

00:19:44.425 --> 00:19:48.349
When I met Karen, when we were
eight, I was already into food.

00:19:48.349 --> 00:19:49.640
And I had just always loved it.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.470
It's been my passion.

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:53.690
And the thing I've also
really loved is writing,

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:55.530
and I always loved
English classes.

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:57.840
And my parents both
worked in publishing,

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.380
so it always felt very
familiar and comfortable to me

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:02.600
to be near magazines
and books and sort

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:06.160
of printed matter, which
is fascinating to be here

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.470
at Google.

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:11.100
But I always loved
combining my love of food

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.000
with my love of writing.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.910
And at whatever age
when you start writing,

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:17.451
like, book reports, like middle
school, that kind of-- like I

00:20:17.451 --> 00:20:19.099
wrote about, like,
what Huck Finn ate.

00:20:19.099 --> 00:20:20.390
Like, it was always about food.

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:22.077
I was always writing about food.

00:20:22.077 --> 00:20:24.410
And then I went to college
in New York on the Upper West

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:24.600
Side.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.350
I went to Barnard.

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:27.120
And being in New
York, as you all know,

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.870
kind of gives you this
sort of entry point

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:30.630
to lots of things
that you might not

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:31.924
have access to in other places.

00:20:31.924 --> 00:20:34.340
So I started interning-- I was
an intern at "Food and Wine

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:35.290
Magazine" for a year.

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:38.070
I worked for this great
guy who produces food

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.740
shows for public television.

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:42.860
I just kind of got my
foot in as many food doors

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.380
as I could, and then
worked really hard to stay

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:47.660
on the other side
of those doors.

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.490
And the guy who produced
all the public television

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:52.927
shows, he worked on that show
"Spain-- On the Road Again."

00:20:52.927 --> 00:20:54.760
And you mentioned the
first book I worked on

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.260
was called "Spain:
A Culinary Road

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:59.262
Trip," which was the
companion book to that show.

00:20:59.262 --> 00:21:00.970
And so that was really
my starting point.

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:03.060
And then it was kind of
one thing led to another

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:06.880
and my-- I feel like the best
way I can describe my career

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.380
is that I've never
written a resume.

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.090
It's all word of mouth.

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:12.470
It's all sort of
personal relationships.

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:14.500
And to me, that's kind
of the spirit of food.

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.000
It's, like, about sharing, you
know, just these great things

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:17.880
with other people.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:21.290
So that's been that,
and it's a fun road.

00:21:24.331 --> 00:21:24.830
Hey.

00:21:28.007 --> 00:21:29.840
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
meeting your wife

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.614
through a meatball recipe.

00:21:31.614 --> 00:21:33.977
Do you have any other
fun date night recipes--

00:21:33.977 --> 00:21:34.810
JULIA TURSHEN: Sure.

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:35.800
AUDIENCE: --that kind
of get you excited?

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:36.633
JULIA TURSHEN: Yeah.

00:21:36.633 --> 00:21:39.030
I think-- that's so funny.

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:40.530
So I'm trying to think.

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:42.440
Like, I think one
really great thing to do

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:45.680
is to cook together, if both
you and the person you are,

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:49.986
you know, having a romance
with enjoy cooking.

00:21:49.986 --> 00:21:52.360
That can be really fun, to
just kind of have an activity.

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.510
And then you're-- like, you're
making something together.

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:55.520
And that's really nice.

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.395
And it's nice to sit
down and be like, oh, we

00:21:57.395 --> 00:22:00.432
both, like, invested this
time into doing that.

00:22:00.432 --> 00:22:02.820
You know, you can both
roll out the meatballs.

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:04.080
Like, whatever works.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.470
And-- but also, if
the person you're with

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:09.800
doesn't enjoy cooking, it
really can be such a gift

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:10.990
to cook for someone.

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:12.490
Or if you don't
really like cooking,

00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:14.370
you can just kind
of, like, gently push

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:17.524
a cookbook toward their
way and make a suggestion.

00:22:17.524 --> 00:22:18.690
And maybe they like cooking.

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:21.110
Because I think cooking is just
the best way to show someone

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:22.234
you really care about them.

00:22:22.234 --> 00:22:25.026
It's been my means of
doing that my whole life.

00:22:25.026 --> 00:22:25.900
And it can be simple.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:28.400
It can be, like, a sandwich that
someone takes to the office.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.010
Like, I really believe cooking
doesn't have to be over the top

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:34.110
to be just meaningful,
by any means.

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:35.610
So some good things
to make at home,

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:37.151
there's a recipe in
"Small Victories"

00:22:37.151 --> 00:22:39.882
for-- if you like fish,
it's a really easy recipe.

00:22:39.882 --> 00:22:42.090
And it's basically you take
a sheet pan, like the one

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:45.580
we had the meatballs
on, and you put either

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:47.770
chopped tomatoes or cherry
tomatoes, a little garlic

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:50.170
and oil, roast it, and make
this kind of roasted tomato,

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:51.330
like, base.

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:54.250
And then you put some, like--
I use flounder in the book,

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:57.991
but any kind of flat, thin fish
that will cook sort of quickly.

00:22:57.991 --> 00:22:59.990
And you put that on top
of the roasted tomatoes.

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:01.300
You put, like, a little
bit of olive oil.

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:03.320
And I put some olives,
because I love them,

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.610
but you can leave them out.

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:06.619
And you just put that
back in the oven.

00:23:06.619 --> 00:23:07.910
And it takes, like, 10 minutes.

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:09.750
And it's like this--
it's really like-- it's

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:11.970
kind of like a really elegant
dish, but it's so easy.

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:14.360
And it's like you're not
dealing with, like, searing fish

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:16.390
in a hot pan and
it's gonna overcook

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:18.770
and it's gonna make your
apartment smell like a seafood

00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:21.230
restaurant for a week.

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:23.470
There's also another fish
that's wrapped in parchment

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:24.690
and has something
called chermoula,

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:26.970
which is the sort of North
African kind of-- sort

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:27.637
of like a pesto.

00:23:27.637 --> 00:23:29.053
It's got, like,
cilantro and cumin

00:23:29.053 --> 00:23:30.180
and those kinds of flavors.

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.040
That's really nice
because, again, you're

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:37.440
not dealing with, like, smoky
fish stuff in a small space.

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.069
And those two are, like, pretty
quick to put together, and kind

00:23:40.069 --> 00:23:42.360
of just like a little bit
elevate-- like, I don't know,

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.680
making fish at home always feels
like a little special to me.

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.096
And so I feel like
for a date kind

00:23:46.096 --> 00:23:47.440
of thing, that would be great.

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.601
And if you don't like
fish, I just-- I really

00:23:49.601 --> 00:23:51.100
always go back to
the roast chicken.

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:54.614
I just think it's
the best thing.

00:23:54.614 --> 00:23:56.762
AUDIENCE: So I'll ask one more.

00:23:56.762 --> 00:23:57.345
So, favorites.

00:23:57.345 --> 00:23:59.996
Because, like, I suppose you
don't always eat your own food,

00:23:59.996 --> 00:24:02.370
so do you have any favorite
restaurants in New York City?

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:03.608
JULIA TURSHEN: Sure, yeah.

00:24:03.608 --> 00:24:04.850
Yeah.

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:08.660
My friend Mario Batali, who I
know is coming to do an event,

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.091
I think, at some point?

00:24:10.091 --> 00:24:12.340
He has a line that I love,
which is his favorite thing

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:14.240
to eat is anything
anyone else makes.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:17.310
So I totally get that.

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:21.190
My-- now that I don't live in
the city, when I-- it's sort of

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:22.965
helped me feel very
clear about the places

00:24:22.965 --> 00:24:25.590
I do love to come to, because my
time here is much more limited

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:26.400
than it used to be.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.820
And honestly, the
three restaurants

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.550
I love more than anything
are very close by.

00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:35.750
They're Buvette, Via Corota,
and I Sodi, and Buvette.

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:37.750
Full disclosure, I worked
on the "Buvette" book,

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:41.540
so I'm totally biased,
but so happily biased.

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:43.180
And Jody Williams runs Buvette.

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:43.764
She's amazing.

00:24:43.764 --> 00:24:45.680
She's one of the funniest
people in the world.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:46.620
She's so talented.

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:49.040
It's a little-- if you
haven't been there, it's tiny.

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.400
It's nothing like Google.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.230
It's this big.

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:54.320
And it's basically like
stepping into, like,

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.460
a little slice of Paris.

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:56.470
It's really special.

00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:58.829
It's like a very sort
of-- you feel transported,

00:24:58.829 --> 00:25:00.620
which is I think one
of the best things you

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:02.080
can feel in a restaurant.

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.564
And you can go there any
time of day, which is great.

00:25:04.564 --> 00:25:06.980
So you can get, like, a little
breakfast or just a coffee,

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.706
you can have a full
meal if you want.

00:25:08.706 --> 00:25:10.080
I just think it's
really special.

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:14.310
And then Jody's partner
in life and business

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:17.700
runs I Sodi, which I think-- I
hate to tell a big group this,

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:19.400
because it's already
hard to get into,

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.000
but I think it's the best
restaurant in New York.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.708
It's the most amazing
Italian restaurant.

00:25:22.708 --> 00:25:23.940
It's on Christopher Street.

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:26.577
And then together they run
Via Corota on Grove Street.

00:25:26.577 --> 00:25:29.160
And I just think they put their
heart into everything they do,

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:32.464
and they just kind of embody
the spirit of hospitality.

00:25:32.464 --> 00:25:34.130
They really make you
feel taken care of.

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:35.750
And their food is
just delicious.

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:38.245
So those are my three go-tos.

00:25:38.245 --> 00:25:40.036
And you can go to all
of them in one night,

00:25:40.036 --> 00:25:41.920
because they're all right there.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.510
Yeah.

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:46.832
Any other questions?

00:25:46.832 --> 00:25:48.290
What do you think
of the meatballs?

00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:48.830
Good?

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:49.240
Yeah?

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:49.650
Awesome.

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:50.010
OK.

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:50.509
Cool.

00:25:50.509 --> 00:25:51.749
That's great to hear.

00:25:51.749 --> 00:25:52.290
That's great.

00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:58.130
I have a good Google story.

00:25:58.130 --> 00:25:59.410
Is it OK if I tell that?

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:01.880
Because I was thinking
about coming here and ways--

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:03.296
because I was
talking about, like,

00:26:03.296 --> 00:26:05.699
loving print so
much, but also, like,

00:26:05.699 --> 00:26:07.990
Google has really changed my
life as a cookbook author.

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:09.220
I'm not just saying that.

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:12.210
And one of the ways I was
thinking that has happened

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:14.770
is-- I'm really bad
with time, but I

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:16.640
guess a couple years
ago I was working on,

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:20.370
and maybe it came out a year
or two ago, a book called

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:22.440
"The Hot Bread
Kitchen" cookbook.

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:25.540
And Hot Bread Kitchen is
this amazing organization.

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:27.290
It's like a workforce
development program.

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:28.165
It's based in Harlem.

00:26:28.165 --> 00:26:30.965
They sell at the farmers'
markets and Whole Foods in New

00:26:30.965 --> 00:26:32.090
York, all different places.

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:33.040
They supply some restaurants.

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:34.039
It's a wholesale bakery.

00:26:34.039 --> 00:26:36.600
But it's completely
employed by sort

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.470
of immigrant and
low-income women.

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:40.670
And they get
on-the-job training.

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:43.320
They also get business classes,
English as second language

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.100
classes, all that
kind of amazing staff.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.110
And they're basically
graduated from the program

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:50.620
to go on to take management
positions in other bakeries

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:54.090
and sort of cooking
places in New York,

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:56.540
or start their own
businesses, which is awesome.

00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:59.630
And when I was-- and oh, the
other great part about it

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:02.430
is they-- everything they
make is inspired by the women,

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:04.070
or recipes are
contributed by them.

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:06.890
So they have the most sort of
eclectic, interesting, amazing

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:07.840
roster of things.

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:10.564
So they make, like, the best
Jewish challah and bialys,

00:27:10.564 --> 00:27:12.480
but they also make, like,
incredible tortillas

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.500
and Moroccan flatbreads.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:15.910
Like it's-- they're amazing.

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:17.830
So when I was
working on that book,

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:20.710
it was sort of me communicating
with all these different women

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:22.670
trying to get their
recipes written,

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:24.460
trying to get all
these stories down.

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:27.860
And there was definitely, at
certain points, a real language

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:28.470
barrier.

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:30.070
And it's kind of
amazing how much

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:32.490
you can communicate with food
without actually talking.

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:33.960
So that was, like, interesting.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.660
But I, like, could not
have done that book

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:37.760
without Google Translate.

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.257
And I am so grateful for it.

00:27:39.257 --> 00:27:41.090
And to me, it was such
an interesting moment

00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:43.722
of, like, wow, this, like--
this is making this so possible.

00:27:43.722 --> 00:27:45.430
And it was so clear
to me in that moment.

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:46.930
And when I was on
my way here today,

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:50.230
I was just thinking, that would
be a good story to tell here.

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:52.810
So thank you, whoever
works on Translate.

00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:54.520
Oh my god, that's amazing.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:57.000
I feel like this
is good if you run.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.500
I mean, like, I've heard about
carbo loading and stuff, so.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:03.791
Anyway, any other questions?

00:28:03.791 --> 00:28:04.290
Hey.

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:05.640
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for coming, by the way.

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:06.306
This is amazing.

00:28:06.306 --> 00:28:08.310
JULIA TURSHEN: Oh, I'm
so glad you liked it.

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:10.185
AUDIENCE: I was interested--
you've obviously

00:28:10.185 --> 00:28:13.050
worked with a lot of
really famous chefs.

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:15.524
Who's-- who would be somebody
that you haven't worked with

00:28:15.524 --> 00:28:17.690
yet that you'd be really
interested in collaborating

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:18.560
with in the future?

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.700
JULIA TURSHEN: That's
a great question.

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:23.810
I-- gotta think about
this for a second.

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:28.099
There's a few that come to mind,
and they're both in the south.

00:28:28.099 --> 00:28:29.890
And my wife Grace who
we were talking about

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:32.510
is from Virginia, so there's
part of me that, like, feels

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:33.920
very drawn towards the south.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.220
Maybe it's from that.

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:38.070
But one does not need
my help whatsoever.

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:39.330
And her name is Vivian Howard.

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:40.645
She has a PBS show.

00:28:40.645 --> 00:28:43.020
She has her own book, I think
it's coming out in October.

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:44.190
It's amazing.

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:45.860
I got to see a little
sneak peek of it.

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:47.790
But I think her
approach to food is

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:50.950
just-- it's so from the heart.

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:53.170
And she's just such
a talented chef

00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:55.540
on top of that sort of really
deep, emotional connection

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:56.040
to food.

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.609
So I guess maybe I wouldn't
want to work with her,

00:28:58.609 --> 00:29:00.150
because I don't
think she needs that.

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:03.470
But I guess I would just like
to spend more time with her.

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:06.937
And the other is this great
guy who I don't really know,

00:29:06.937 --> 00:29:08.270
but I had one conversation with.

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:13.130
And his name is Ed Mitchell, and
he is based in North Carolina.

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:16.520
And I don't know if any
of you read or watched

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:20.590
the I guess Netflix version
maybe of Michael Pollan's

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:21.860
"Cooked."

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:24.860
And he-- Michael spent a lot
of time with Ed Mitchell.

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:30.050
And Ed Mitchell does whole
hog BBQ, which is hard to say,

00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:30.830
in North Carolina.

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:33.490
And he learned from his
father and his grandfather,

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:34.580
and it's passed down.

00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.850
And he just-- I feel like he
has so many amazing stories

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:38.910
to tell.

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:41.380
And I think those
stories are so important,

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:43.050
and I think a cookbook
is a great place

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:45.230
to store those kinds
of stories, and a way

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:47.330
to just be able to
interact with them, too.

00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:49.329
Because not only do you
get to tell them-- like,

00:29:49.329 --> 00:29:51.410
I got to tell you about,
like, oh I met Grace

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:53.560
and I fell in love and I made
her meatballs, but also like,

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.143
here, you can make
the meatballs, too.

00:29:55.143 --> 00:29:57.560
So I feel like Ed has these
really incredible stories that

00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:59.470
are just so much
about his family,

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:02.012
but also kind of the
history of America.

00:30:02.012 --> 00:30:04.590
And it's-- they're
important, so I think--

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:06.222
I hope those get written down.

00:30:06.222 --> 00:30:07.290
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:08.581
JULIA TURSHEN: Yeah, of course.

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:10.990
Hey.

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:18.750
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:21.252
Do you have any food that
you hate working with,

00:30:21.252 --> 00:30:22.960
or any ingredients
you hate working with,

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:25.780
but you know they're
fan favorites so you

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:27.250
have to work with them anyway?

00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:28.500
JULIA TURSHEN: Great question.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:35.090
I really like-- I feel like I
don't really dislike any food.

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:36.914
And Grace was poking
fun at me yesterday

00:30:36.914 --> 00:30:39.080
because I-- I can't even
remember what I was eating,

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:40.180
and I was like, oh,
god, I love this,

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:41.040
this is the best
thing I ever had.

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.970
And she's like, you say
that about everything.

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:44.300
[LAUGHS] everything?

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:45.657
Is the best thing you ever had.

00:30:45.657 --> 00:30:47.490
So I really-- there's
not much I don't like.

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:49.520
But I guess-- I
feel like the thing

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:52.370
I do try to avoid and try
to avoid using in recipes,

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:55.930
but also just eating, is
just, like, super processed

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:59.125
food, just things like I
don't really understand.

00:30:59.125 --> 00:31:01.500
And I definitely have a soft
spot for, like, a Cool Ranch

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.860
Dorito or something
like that, but like-- I

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:06.340
feel like those are the kinds
of products I try not to use.

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:10.170
And also, it just comes
from-- I feel very strongly

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:12.190
about writing recipes
that anyone can replicate,

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:13.231
no matter where they are.

00:31:13.231 --> 00:31:15.540
And asking for a very
particular brand of something

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.040
is something I
always try not to do,

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:19.540
unless I really have a
reason for doing that.

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:21.880
And if I do, I'll always give
you, like, a substitution,

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.450
because-- just because-- you
know, it's hard in New York,

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:26.740
because you can find anything,
but in a lot of places,

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:27.240
you can't.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:27.810
So.

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:30.018
But I would say anything
like super, super processed.

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:37.710
Any other questions?

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:39.078
No?

00:31:39.078 --> 00:31:40.450
Cook.

00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:42.270
Well, this was super fun.

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:44.440
And I hope you guys
try the meatballs

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.240
and maybe try some variations.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.790
And I guess the
only thing I forgot

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:51.430
to mention is my sort of
fantasy with "Small Victories"

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:54.010
and offering all the variations
and riffs on the recipes

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:55.960
is I can't wait to
see what people make,

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:58.460
but like-- you know, it's
inspired by the recipe,

00:31:58.460 --> 00:31:59.470
but isn't the recipe.

00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:02.160
Like, I just-- I
feel like I put-- I

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:05.145
tried to be as creative as I
possibly could, but I think

00:32:05.145 --> 00:32:06.520
there's something
about cookbooks

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:08.280
and how people
participate with them

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:09.495
and try them on their
own that makes it

00:32:09.495 --> 00:32:10.920
this kind of
collaborative thing.

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:13.790
So if you have any other
ideas for meatball riffs,

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:14.723
I'd love to know them.

00:32:14.723 --> 00:32:16.431
AUDIENCE: Is there a
hashtag or anything?

00:32:16.431 --> 00:32:20.120
JULIA TURSHEN: Oh,
hashtag-- hashtag?

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.728
Smallvictoriescookbook.

00:32:21.728 --> 00:32:23.030
And that's it.

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:23.900
Cool.

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:25.240
Thank you all so much.

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:25.930
Thank you.

00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:28.080
[APPLAUSE]
