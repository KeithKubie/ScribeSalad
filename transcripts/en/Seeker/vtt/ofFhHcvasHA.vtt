00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.880
Scientists in Georgia think they might've
figured out how all life started on Earth.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.220
Yeah, we're about to get real.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.820
Strap in.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:17.349
Anthony for DNews and if there's one question
we all want the answer to it's "Where did

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:18.839
we come from?"

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:23.399
Researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology
think they've figured out a crucial component

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:24.399
of the answer.

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:28.990
So, about 3.5 billion years ago, the earth
was a lifeless, oxygen free environment.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.320
At some point,
bacteria formed and started converting all

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.399
the carbon dioxide and methane and ammonia
and turning it into oxygen.

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:39.989
But we've never been sure where that bacteria
came from.

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.809
Earth's oceans at the time were filled with
all kinds of minerals, including iron.

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.381
If you've ever heard the term "primordial
soup," that's what we're talking about, earth's

00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:49.850
original atmosphere and mineral-filled ocean.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.690
So the idea is that in the soup were all the
things you need to make RNA- the RNA interacted

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.320
with something, some sort of chemical reaction
or spark or something, and started creating

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.850
that bacteria- and all life on earth.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.159
There have always been a couple problems with
that theory- the first is that RNA isn't really

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.090
capable of making life on its own.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.960
Your DNA has all the instructions for making
you and the ability to transfer that information.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.500
RNA basically acts as a messenger, taking
the instructions from your DNA and using them

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.500
to make proteins.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.210
Without DNA and protein-based enzymes, RNA
doesn't survive.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.100
The second is that there was nothing in the
environment that anyone could find that would

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.360
jumpstart the ability to create life.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.310
One theory is that lightning did it- another
is an impact from space.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.869
But here's what the team in Georgia found-
If they recreated the primordial soup in a

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.659
chamber, RNA changed- it behaved differently
in an environment without oxygen.

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.950
It was almost like it reactivated a function
it hadn't used in billions of years.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.450
It shape-shifted and all of a sudden became
an instruction-carrier, kind of like DNA - and

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.079
when they teamed it up with that iron from
the soup, it performed a single-electron transfer.

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.859
That means that it jumpstarted the reactions
needed for photosynthesis and respiration.

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:10.130
RNA together with iron created the basis for
an eating, breathing thing.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.130
BOOM.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.130
LIFE ON EARTH.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.250
Bacteria forms, oxygen is transferred into
the atmosphere, and 3.5 billion years later

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.910
we're all reblogging sloth gifs on tumblr.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.330
Now, there are still holes in this theory.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.610
If you asked "Hey, where did that RNA come
from in the beginning of the world," you're

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:26.860
asking the right question.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.010
All the components of RNA were in the soup,
but they're not components that like to bond

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.890
easily- though there have been some successes
in making it happen in a lab.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:35.940
How crazy is that!

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.030
RNA, this molecule that we thought was so
simple, that we thought we knew everything

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.680
about, was way more adaptive than we thought.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.510
Maybe there's a way to create it that we haven't
thought of, and then we'll be even closer

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.020
to figuring out where we came from.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.700
The origin of all life!

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.700
So rad.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.340
