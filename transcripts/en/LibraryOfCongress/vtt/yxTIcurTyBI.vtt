&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.990
&gt;&gt; Anne E. McLean: Good
evening, I'm Anne McLean

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.220
from the Library's Concert Office.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.220
We're presenting tonight a
wonderfully rich evening of music

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.990
by Czech composers, Antonin
Dvorak and Bohuslav Martinu

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.850
from the excellent
Pavel Haas Quartet.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.270
It's very unusual to have on offer

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.970
in one concert both the Dvorak
American Quartet Opus 96

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.220
and also the D Minor
Quartet Opus 34.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.030
And we are especially pleased to
be able to preface this concert

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.220
with this lecture by Michael
Beckerman who's an authority

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.960
on Czech composers and
Eastern European music,

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.160
among other subjects.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.230
Dr. Beckman was awarded the
prestigious [inaudible] medal

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.200 position:56%
from the Czech Republic and he is a
laureate of the Czech Music Council.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.470
It's a pleasure really for us to
welcome him back to the library.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.570
He is the Carroll and Milton
Petrie professor of music

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.320
at New York University and the
author of benchmark studies

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.710
on these composers we'll
be hearing tonight,

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.730
including one fascinating book
called New Worlds of Dvorak,

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.330
Searching in America for
the Composer's Inner Life.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.080
And that book we have available
for sale in our anteroom tonight.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.620
He's also the editor of
Dvorak and His World.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.510
So let me just say also
that I wanted to mention

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.910 position:56%
if you're really interested in these
subjects, please check out a lecture

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.740
by Dr. Beckman that
is now already online

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.130
on our website Dvorak
in the New World.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.770 position:56%
He lectured here a few years ago and
this is on our website www.LOC.gov

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.460
and this lecture examines the
role of African-American sources

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.270
in the conception of
an American music.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.510
So please help me welcome
Michael Beckman.

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:15.100
[ Applause ]

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.990 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Beckerman: Thank you,
thank you for the love introduction,

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.490
I'm delighted to be back
here at the library.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:30.480
Well I thought I would begin
by mentioning two composers

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.300
who actually aren't on the program.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.120
I'll begin by playing one.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:03:10.040
[ Music ]

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.770
This piece, which sounds like late
Beethoven was actually written

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.050
by a contemporary of
Mozart's named Jakub Jan Ryba.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.630
Famous for writing one of
the most popular pieces

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.920
in the Czech lands
called the Christmas Mass.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.580
But this [inaudible] quartet was
written long before Beethoven

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.730
and I play it to remind us all
that there is really a long

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.990 position:56%
and distinguished tradition of Czech
string quartet writing or better

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.730
yet a string quartet writing in
what are known as the Czech lands.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:53.880
Composers like [inaudible],
the Stamitzs, many others,

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.160
Wranitzkys who are contemporaries
of Mozart wrote wonderful quartets.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.320
Certainly Smetana in his
contemporaries then Dvorak.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.090
The followers of Dvorak Josef
Suk, [inaudible], Novak, Martinu.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.530
There's just a long and
distinguished tradition

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:19.420
of these composers working in this
medium and it's probably pushing it

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.930
to say that somehow this medium is
specifically suited to the Czechs.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.450
But there are things about it I
think which points that can be made

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.850
and I'll try to make
them as I go along.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.220 position:56%
The second composer I'm going to
mention and it would be obvious why,

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.970
his works are not being
played, but is Pavel Haas.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.630 position:56%
Pavel Haas was a wonderful composer,
a student of Janacek's who was

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.440
in Terezin where he wrote several
wonderful pieces and was killed

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.200
in Auschwitz in in the in 1945.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.460
But he was again an
extraordinary figure

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.250
and a wonderful quartet
composer, a student of Janacek's

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.570
who both carried on that particular
Moravian tradition or sub tradition

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:11.240 position:56%
of Czech string quartets, but also
went very much in his own direction.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.890
But we're going to begin
tonight with someone

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.420
from another generation,
certainly not of the Dvorak,

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.420
Smetana generation this
is Bohuslav Martinu.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:31.870 position:56%
Martinu famously born in a church
tower very high above the small town

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:37.270
of Policka where his father
was a professional fire water

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.370
because he was also a shoemaker,

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.950
but you needed more
than one job in Policka.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:47.170
And there are a hundred
steps above the church

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.410
where the Martinu family
lived in a small room.

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:56.560
And he came down from the tower
really only at about the age of 10,

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.350
went to Prague studied there.

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.070
It was a student after my own
heart because he was thrown

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:07.130
out of school several times
for incorrigible laziness.

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:14.810
And he decided to go to Paris and
I'll get to why he decided to go

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.050
to Paris in a moment,
but I thought I'd begin

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.620
by playing just the opening
of this third string quartet

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.000
which was written in Paris in 1939.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:46.230
[ Music ]

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:51.180 position:56%
Well anyone who actually is familiar
with Martinu would probably be right

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:56.620 position:56%
to say this is quite on the
dissonant edge of Martinu's writing.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.880
Martinu again is in Paris
in 1929, he's in the thrall

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.060
of many different composers,
very interested in French notions

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.580
of clarity, but also very much
in the thrall of Stravinsky

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.440
as one can hear by
these motoric rhythms.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:18.360
But there is one way in which
Martinu's works tend to differ

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.270
from those of Stravinsky
and many others.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:25.690
And you can hear it in the next
passage because what happens

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:30.510
when this motoric style
slows down a bit.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:48.050
[ Music ]

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.260
So you get, you know, you
get all this I don't know,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.060
you know, Martinu.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:58.040
[ Music ]

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.290
So you get one of these sort
of little syncopated passages

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:06.110
that at various times quite
specifically seem to refer

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:11.040
to his notion of something Czech.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:16.150
But really become part of his
style and this is another I think

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:19.720
of Martinu who wrote -- by the
time he wrote this it's 1929,

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:24.270 position:56%
he was born in 1890 he's not that
old he's already written 200 pieces.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:30.990
Martinu is among the most prolific
composers of the 20th century.

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:37.030
He wrote, you know, well I once a
wrote an article called How Many

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:40.600
Pieces did Martinu Write because
depending on how you choose

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.320
to measure pieces you get
any number from 350 to 600.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.070
You know, is it three
etudes, three pieces

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:50.350
or is it one piece called three
etude, you know, things like that.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:53.770
But he wrote a lot of music and
a lot of extraordinary music.

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:57.730
And this aspect of his style
is something you can hear even

00:08:57.730 --> 00:08:59.370
in a quite dissonant piece.

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:03.460 position:56%
I'll give you a couple of examples
from maybe more famous pieces of his

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:07.040
of how these sort of almost
insect-like textures sort

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:11.790
of give way to this sort of
syncopated sort of Martinu sound.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:14.360
And in that way again, he
strikes me as very much

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.590
like a painter who
has his own style.

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:20.570
I mean not all Jackson
Pollocks are alike,

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:21.870
but they're all Jackson Pollocks.

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:24.530
And Martinu has certain
musical fingerprints.

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:27.510
So this is from the sixth
Symphony much later.

00:09:27.510 --> 00:10:17.460
[ Music ]

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.760
So you get these kinds of
sounds and you'll hear that even

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.050
in this quartet as he
goes kind of in and out

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:23.960
of these highly dissonant textures,

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.480
which open up into
these little windows.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.650
And like a lot of pieces this
quartet ends with a kind of,

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:33.510
I mean a movement ends
with a kind of fanfare.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:42.600
[ Music ]

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:47.760
Sorry, the second movement of
this quartet is very much a kind

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:52.510
of inward turning lyrical piece
with a lot of viola solos.

00:10:52.510 --> 00:11:20.070
[ Music ]

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:23.050
And it's quite again an
extraordinary movement

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:27.490
that has a much more
consonant center.

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:33.070
The last movement begins like
the first, a kind of really harsh

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:36.510
and sharp dissonant texture.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:48.040
[ Music ]

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.960
And again, in the middle
of the movement we get one

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.510
of these little Martinu
windows opening up.

00:11:53.510 --> 00:12:31.300
[ Music ]

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.300
Now this is a Martinu
piece unlike some of them

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.450
where there's more dissonance

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:39.060
than you usually get
in one of his pieces.

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:43.780
And it's tricky for a
long time I thought that

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:47.340
and maybe this was just sort of
self-serving that the piece was

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:53.010
about the consonances and that that
he wasn't as invested aesthetically

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:55.990
in the dissonances
as he was in those --

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:58.090
that those moments were
the real Martinu moments,

00:12:58.090 --> 00:12:59.820
but I think that was wrong.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:04.820
I think they're all Martinu moments
and it's I think an exciting kind

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:09.170 position:56%
of aesthetic experience when you
have again, this level of dissonance

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:14.550
which is opening up and I'll
make a kind of trite suggestion

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:17.850 position:56%
that I can't sort of stay away from.

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:22.740
But Martinu did have this very
strange experience of growing

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:27.170
up in this tower and he wrote
about it quite a bit and, you know,

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:30.360
he said I was in the
tower all the time

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:35.990
and in the tower I could always
see these absolutely still

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:37.290
natural forms.

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:40.170
I could see the fields and
the shapes of the fields

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:41.810
and the people weren't
really people they were

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:43.880
like little ants or something.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:47.230
And part of me thinks that
this tendency of Martinu is

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:50.380
to always do this, to always
open out into this sort

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:53.770
of still moment even in
the most dissonant pieces.

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:56.030
You know, is a part of
him that might be related

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:58.920
to that very special
circumstance in which he grew up,

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.650
you can take that or leave it.

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:02.680
But, you know, I can't discount it

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.010
because I think it was
important enough to him.

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:11.170
So we're going to hear two
string quartets by Dvorak.

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:21.070
One of the things I thought
of titling this talk was well

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:27.860 position:56%
if we call Dvorak's Opus 96 the
American quartet what should we call

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:30.090
the other quartets?

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:35.540
Should we call Martinu's the
Parisian, the Parisian Tower.

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:42.170
And what do we call Dvorak's
non-American quartet,

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:44.930
do we call it a Czech quartet or?

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:49.950
So let's just begin by
listening to the opening

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:51.250
of the first movement here.

00:14:54.510 --> 00:15:46.040
[ Music ]

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:49.800
So there would seem to be to me
absolutely nothing national in it,

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:52.060
no spices, no paprika

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:54.930
to make Hungarian chicken
or American spices.

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:57.510
And it uses a kind of standard.

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:06.110
[ Music ]

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:08.720
So to go back and forth
between major and minor,

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.590
but that's something
that Schubert does.

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:15.270
This seems to be very
much within the larger,

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:19.900
particularly German quartet
tradition of the composers

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:24.840
that Dvorak loved and Mozart
and Haydn, especially Schubert.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:30.050
Mozart, I mean Dvorak was quite
reticent, he wasn't a literary man.

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:33.450
But one of the only articles
he wrote was about Schubert,

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:35.880
so he was very much a
Schubertian, Schumann.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:38.520
Certainly Brahms, it's
well-known that these --

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:41.060 position:56%
the quartet was dedicated to Brahms.

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:45.610
And Brahms of course, clucked a bit
and said, well young man, you know,

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:48.960 position:56%
I like this piece okay, but you
really need to be a bit more careful

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:53.920
around the edges and they had that
kind of relationship that it's,

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:58.030
you know, I don't know what
it says about Brahms to say

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:01.150
that Dvorak might have
been his favorite composer,

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:03.930
but he would still
wag his finger at him.

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:07.950
But they had an extraordinary
relationship and I think he wanted

00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:11.940
to write -- Dvorak very much
wanted to write a quartet

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:14.160
that fit into that tradition.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:21.450
Now the quartet is not without
sort of obligatory genuflections

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:24.910
to the worlds of nation
and nationality.

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:33.510
You know, the second movement
is a polka or ala polka.

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:46.060
[ Music ]

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:49.520
So this is just at the moment
where Dvorak is figuring himself

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:53.440
out about how he's going to
bill himself, how he's going

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:59.010
to portray himself, particularly
in the German-speaking lands.

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:04.170
This is almost like a little bit
of one of his Slavonic dances

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:06.320
that sort of intrudes into this.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:10.940
But you know you also get
one of the wonderful moments

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:16.160
in this quartet is the trio,
the middle section of this polka

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:20.320
where everything stops
and you get a little kind

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:25.510
of Christmas pastoral absolutely
exquisite sort of rural moment.

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:41.050
[ Music ]

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:45.250
So there's a bit of a clash and
a wonderful one in this piece

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:50.030
between this sort of darker D
minor opening movement of polka

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:53.490
and then the polka
opening up into sort

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:57.760
of a little almost
Beethovenian image of this kind

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:03.420
of rural bliss that's just really,
you know, an extraordinary thing

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:06.750
and I think it's something
that Brahms noticed as well.

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:13.190
You can hear Dvorak's debts
to some of his predecessors,

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:16.000
particularly in the last movement.

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:30.590
Oops sorry.

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:37.750 position:56%
That's the lea, I skipped the second
movement and that's my favorite one.

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:40.970
So let me talk about the second
movement, I mean the slow movement.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:43.490
The slow movement, the
adagio is again one

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:47.200
of Dvorak's great movements.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:52.930
It's absolutely I think devoid
of any kind of nationalizing,

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:57.360
any sort of genuflections
in those directions.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:03.950
And it pursues a formal structure
that many composers employed,

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:11.090
but Dvorak I think to particular
effect, which is begins as a kind

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:15.540
of romance, as a highly
expressive romance and then

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:20.250
as the movement goes on it simply
gets more and more expressive

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:25.160
until the very middle of the piece
where it kind -- where it explodes.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.000
But here's the opening of it.

00:20:33.510 --> 00:21:06.040
[ Music ]

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:10.100
So setting this tone
of kind of reflection,

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.580
prayerfulness, but also romance.

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:17.920
So there are kind of two middles
as it gets more and more intense.

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:24.510
The first one almost suggests a
kind of Spanish harmonic quality.

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:57.040
[ Music ]

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.990
So this is also this
is a kind of reference

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:02.520
to something quite exotic
Dvorak loved to do that.

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:08.510
Here's a kind of similar passage
from his famous violin romance.

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:24.080
[ Music ]

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.780
So not very Czech right.

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:29.980 position:56%
I mean so there's a lot of
languages that Dvorak is pulling on.

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:34.440
There's Brahms in the high style,
there's Czechness [phonetic]

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:39.710
when he needs a polka and
there's Spanish style,

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:43.150
little pastoral style
taken from early Beethoven.

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:47.440
But in the middle of this
piece and some of you

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:51.610
who have heard me might know
that I'm a great, great believer

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:56.150
in middles that, I mean
if you actually push me

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:58.840
to the wall I'd say the only
purpose of outer movements is

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.480
so that there can be a middle.

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:03.770
And that all the best
stuff happens in the middle

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:06.940
and if it's not in
the middle of moving.

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:14.630
And here again, just to remind
you this is the opening [music].

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:18.000
So this is the opening
of the slow movement.

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:32.040
[ Music ]

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:35.410
That gesture and when it comes
back in the real absolute center

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:38.510
of the piece it sounds like this.

00:23:38.510 --> 00:24:15.120
[ Music ]

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.750
So you have the whole show
you've got the violins

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:20.100
and octaves playing
at parallel intervals.

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:23.290
You've got the pizzicato, you've
got the tremolos, you know,

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:28.030
every single sort of musical
sign of excess romance

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:29.450
of over the topness [phonetic].

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:32.300
And I think there are no other
composers who really do this

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:34.790
at that time, it's really
quite and you could hear it

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:37.080
in many other pieces by Dvorak.

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:42.170
The slow movement the seventh
symphony, some of the piano trio

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:45.870 position:56%
and the piano quartet all have these
and so I think it's a real treat.

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:48.090
I hope you look forward to it.

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:51.370
You can actually stop the quartet
in the middle after that passage

00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:54.970
and ask them to play it, no, no.

00:24:54.970 --> 00:25:00.000
Okay and here's the
last movement of it.

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:18.090
[ Music ]

00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:22.510
Okay, so that opening
and then followed by.

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:29.060
[ Music ]

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:34.130
Okay, so the opening itself,
you know, is kind of reminiscent

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:37.080
of another quartet, a
favorite of Dvorak's,

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.450
the quartet Death of
the Maiden [music].

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:43.510
So here's Dvorak.

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:53.040
[ Music ]

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.740
But also reminds us a
little bit of the rhythms

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:59.510
of the Schubert quintet in C.

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:08.200
[ Music ]

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.010
But again, listen after the
opening what happens right.

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:13.510
So this is the [inaudible].

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:37.040
[ Music ]

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.650
A little a few, a little
contrapuntal passage,

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:43.810
which I think was stolen from
let's see if I can get it right,

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:47.080
happily stolen from, you know,

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:50.450
I mean he gives it
back, but it is here.

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:53.510
So okay.

00:26:53.510 --> 00:27:03.040
[ Music ]

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:05.270
So it's this, you know
the trio from the scherzo

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:06.860
from the Beethoven fifth.

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:10.360
So he's taken that from Schubert
and he's taken that from Beethoven,

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.980
but the amazing thing is he's
put them together, you know,

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:14.680
he's put them together one
right next to the other

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:16.270
and it creates a really
powerful effect.

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:20.070
So, you know, this is quite an
astonishing piece this quartet

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:22.180
with enormous power.

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:26.030
Dvorak was a young man when he
wrote it and it really is one

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:29.290
of his great early works.

00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:34.940
So I'm back here at this podium
where I was some years ago trying

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:40.310
to talk about Dvorak's
American works.

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:46.290
What it means that a composer who
thought of himself as Czech got

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:51.770
on a boat, landed in
New York and decided

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:54.060
that he would try to
write American music.

00:27:54.060 --> 00:28:00.940
It was an astonishing thing,
it's still an astonishing thing.

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:07.210
And the F Major Quartet is
one of the greatest products.

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:13.160
So first let me go over quickly
some of you may know it the story

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:16.860
of Dvorak and the United States.

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:19.530
He was brought to the United States

00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:22.660
by an extraordinary woman
named Jeanette Thurber.

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:27.540
Jeanette Thurber was a
brilliant woman who decided

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:32.840
that the United States should
try to hold its own with Europe

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:34.330
in terms of musical culture.

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:39.200
She started an opera company,
she believed in opera in English.

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:43.050
She had the for its
time or maybe honestly

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:48.410
for any time the astonishing
idea that anybody should be able

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:53.000
to study music regardless of
their background, their color,

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.550
their economic level, their
religion, their gender.

00:28:56.550 --> 00:29:01.480
She wanted to create an institution
that would be open to all.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:06.380
And she fastened on Dvorak
because she knew that Dvorak came

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:09.380
from humble circumstances
and thought

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.820
that he would make
a marvelous leader

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:15.410
for her national conservatory,
which she started

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:20.870
on East 17th Street now the site
of Washington Irving High School,

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:23.860
but formerly the site of
the National Conservatory.

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:31.110 position:56%
She paid Dvorak what we already know
was a princely wage in 1893, 92,

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:34.020
93 to come to the United
States and the reasons

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:38.150
that she wanted Dvorak
were I think threefold.

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:44.050
The first again, she wanted
to create an institution

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:47.490
in the United States that
would be of such high quality

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:51.100
that students would not feel
the need to go to Europe

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:53.320
to finish their musical education.

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:58.590
So she thought well let's get
the best people in the world,

00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:03.310
let's use American know-how and
especially money to hire some

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:06.450
of the best people so that
people didn't have to go abroad.

00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:08.860
The second as I've
already mentioned,

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:14.000
she wanted to have an
institution which she felt was true

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.820
to the principles of this country,
of the ideals of this country

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:21.210
that would be open to everybody.

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:26.590
And if people couldn't pay their
tuition would be paid it didn't

00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:28.480
matter what their background was.

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.460
So she had many women students,
African-American students,

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:34.670
students from all kinds
of backgrounds.

00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:38.170
But the third thing she wanted and
this is really where Dvorak came

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:41.430
in whether it's a wrongheaded
idea from the get-go

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:45.250
or not is something you
all can decide over time,

00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:46.640 position:56%
I think there are many perspectives.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:52.080
But she wanted a music that would
sound American the way she thought

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:55.410
Russian music was Russian,
Hungarian music was Hungarian

00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:57.480
and Czech music was Czech.

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:01.470
She wanted something that would be
an equivalent and she brought it --

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:05.770
you can view it as an
experiment that she's a scientist

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:09.860
and she brought Dvorak
over as an experiment.

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:11.790
By the way, I'm just
reminded as I'm speaking one

00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:14.990 position:56%
of the great science-fiction stories
I read was by is called a Work

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:19.690
of Art by James Bliss, it's
online you can read it.

00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:23.080
And hundreds of years or
maybe a thousand years

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:28.030 position:56%
in the future I can't quite remember
they recreate Ricard Strauss

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:32.820
out of some scientific principle so
that he can write works for them,

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:36.330
but he can't because
he's out of his time.

00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:39.600
But this is kind of an experiment
she's bringing Dvorak to America,

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:44.250
she's saying okay, I'm going
to give you all kinds of queues

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:47.910
and let's see what it means
to write American music.

00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:55.460
So Dvorak arrives in the
United States October 1892.

00:31:55.460 --> 00:32:01.550
If you do your math October
12, 1892 is not the 500th,

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:04.970
but the 400th anniversary
of Columbus.

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:08.810
There are many talks about
the new world of music,

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:13.100
a title that gets picked up by
Dvorak later for a work that some

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:15.330
of you may know, the
New World Symphony.

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:19.940
And additionally, he
hears that first week

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:23.760
because his hotel is right over one
of the main parade routes all sort

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:27.800
of the music of America,
blacksmiths choirs, you know,

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:30.800
spirituals are marching
under his window.

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:35.490
Not only that, he's famous, he's
incredibly famous and as you know,

00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:38.010
all of you I'm sure
who are all famous

00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:40.750
that when you're famous
people give you things.

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:42.870
People just come up to you
and they give you things

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:44.750
and so everyone is
giving Dvorak music

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:46.920
and they're saying look
at this music right.

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:53.990
And one of the real preoccupations
of Jeanette Thurber was the idea

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:59.620
that Dvorak should fuse the
local styles of the United States

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:01.230
to create something Czech.

00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:06.950
And that meant to her mind not only
the various styles of Celtic music

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:09.500
or French music, but primarily

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:13.870
in her view African-American
and Native American.

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:20.230
Dvorak very quickly seems to fall
in love with African-American song.

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:24.760
There are I think many
reasons for it.

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:28.150
Reason one, he was hearing
some extraordinary music

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:29.750
that he never heard before.

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:34.200
Another thing was Dvorak was deeply
religious and as you may know,

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:38.940
Czech folksongs generally are about
drinking wine and chasing girls.

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:42.330
And suddenly he found what he
thought was an American folk music,

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:43.630
which was biblical.

00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:47.280
It was all about Daniel in the
lion's den and go down Moses.

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:51.850
He very quickly hooked up with
Harry T. Burley, who was studying

00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:55.320 position:56%
at the school and also working there
who is an extraordinary singer,

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:58.640
whose grandfather had been a slave.

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:02.220
And as Burley walked with
his grandfather in Erie,

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:05.290
Pennsylvania his grandfather
became a lamplighter.

00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:09.370
The grandfather sang all
these songs for Burley and so

00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:11.150
to Dvorak Burley seemed

00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:15.790
like an authentic source
for what this music was.

00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:21.530
Dvorak also was in with a group
of people who felt that because

00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:26.220
of the history of slavery
it wasn't only

00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:30.800
that African-American music was
expressive or very expressive

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.020
that it was the most expressive.

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:36.580
That it was the music that
should be the foundation

00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:38.120
for an American style.

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:40.230
And Dvorak in a long interview

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:43.840
with a yellow journalist named
James Creelman, whose signature,

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:47.500
he signed that over at the picture,
was signed over to Creelman.

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:50.200
To my dear friend, James Creelman.

00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:54.540
That he said in this
article the future

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:59.040
of American music should
be based on black music.

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:01.800
He had found this also
in an article written

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:05.620
by a wonderful woman named
Mildred Hill, who wrote an article

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:09.230
under the pseudonym Johann
Tonsor called Negro Music

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:11.540
and argued the same
thing that the future

00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:13.560
of American music should be black.

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:16.330
That this is where
the source should be.

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:19.500
And Dvorak took this
very much to heart.

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:30.910 position:56%
The New World Symphony is steeped in
these, you know, these [music] and,

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:40.610
you know, swing-low and Dvorak cuts
out the first measure and sorry,

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:41.910
it's too small a keyboard.

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:43.210
I have to sing the top.

00:35:43.210 --> 00:35:49.830
So we have this sort of reliance
on black melody, certain levels

00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:52.860
of expression that were
really new to Dvorak.

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:55.870
So Dvorak writes the
New World Symphony

00:35:55.870 --> 00:36:00.760
in the winter and the
spring of 1893.

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:05.250
In May of 1893, he gives this
interview with New York Herald

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:09.280
where he basically says
American music should be based

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:11.140
on black models.

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:14.200
And there's a huge
controversy around it,

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:17.050
people argue some agree,
some disagree.

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:19.830
Can this really be the
source for American music?

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:21.330
Dvorak wants to get
away from it all,

00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:24.540
so it ends up going out
to Spillville, Iowa.

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:27.290
Now Spillville, Iowa
was a Czech colony,

00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:30.670 position:56%
it goes back to the 1830's and 40's.

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:32.650
He went there because his secretary

00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:37.160 position:56%
who was an American-born Czech named
Josef [inaudible] his family lived

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:41.380
there and suddenly after all this
very stressful time writing the

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:45.650
symphony, getting involved in
this controversy he finds himself

00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:49.960
in nature, he finds himself
in the middle of Iowa

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:54.470
and where everybody actually
-- all the people there,

00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:56.870
you know, came over in the 1840's.

00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:59.230
So they all talked like his
grandparents even though they're

00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:00.530
his age.

00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:04.090 position:56%
So he sits around with these farmers
and he drinks beer and he feels

00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:08.670
like he's at home again and he
snaps his fingers and writes two

00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:11.310
of the greatest works in the
Chamber of music Repertoire.

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:14.670
The first, the American
quartet was written in a flash,

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:18.350
it was written in less
than two weeks.

00:37:18.350 --> 00:37:21.470
And I think it's an
extraordinary work in many ways.

00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:27.680
First of all, it's Dvorak
again in his American-style,

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:31.510
here's the famous opening
of the quartet.

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:51.170
[ Music ]

00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:53.510
So this kind of.

00:37:53.510 --> 00:38:02.070
[ Music ]

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:03.830
Sort of, you know, huge spaces,

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:05.600
that's another aspect
of the American style.

00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:08.510
So-called five note scales right.

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:13.040
[ Music ]

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:15.660
But also the space of it.

00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:21.410
So you have a sense of Dvorak's
sense of openness and space.

00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:25.510 position:56%
It's not that different from, sorry.

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:30.040
[ Music ]

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:31.480
The new world symphony's
[inaudible], this is.

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:37.200
So it had that sense

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:41.010
of expansiveness, of
energy, of reaching.

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:45.550
Okay, since I threw a
little autobiographical

00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:48.370
in talking about Martinu.

00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:49.830
I think that there is a kind

00:38:49.830 --> 00:38:53.460
of slight autobiographical
tinge to this.

00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:57.690
I think this work almost
hinges sometimes on the manic

00:38:57.690 --> 00:39:01.440 position:56%
and I think Dvorak was so
extraordinarily excited to get back,

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:05.090
to get into nature, to be himself
again after being in the city

00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:12.280
that this opening sound of
Dvorak was famously a violist.

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:21.110
[ Music ]

00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:24.870
I think that's sort I'm back,
not literally, but you know,

00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:31.060
just so that you know this is a
guy who wrote a piece called Song

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:35.740
of the Hero, which was
an autobiographical work.

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:39.130
He wrote other kind of
autobiographical things.

00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:43.790
There's a very long-standing
tradition, well not that long,

00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:48.620
but [inaudible] his famous quartet
was autobiographical from my life.

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:53.330
And I think this is a kind of
Dvorak has put himself into it much

00:39:53.330 --> 00:39:57.130
in the same way I think he puts
himself as a kind of character

00:39:57.130 --> 00:40:01.090
into that other great bookend
work of the American years

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:03.770
that is the cello concerto.

00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:10.670
Well perhaps the most
extraordinary movement

00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:13.230
in this quartet is
the slow movement,

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:15.990
is the middle movement again.

00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:20.860
I think Dvorak did find
this whole beautiful part

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:26.140 position:56%
of Iowa extraordinary, but one
thing he kept saying, he kept saying

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:31.050
that sometimes he says, you
know, it's so wild here,

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:38.040
it's so wild that this is said
unto despair, it's like a desert.

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:39.740
And I think that's
something he tried

00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:43.000
to capture in the second movement.

00:40:46.510 --> 00:41:33.040
[ Music ]

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:35.510
So this is really an extraordinary.

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:42.040
[ Music ]

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:49.730
You know, these kinds of harmonies
where and Dvorak love those sort

00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:52.850
of nothing really happens, it's not

00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:55.710
as if you have a sense
of harmonic movement.

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:59.130
It's as if the lights
shifted a little bit.

00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:03.110
And so you get this and this
is written I think in the --

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:06.160
at least partially in
this Schubertian sort

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:07.680
of heavenly length traditionally.

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:11.090
It just really goes on and
on, there's no real pause.

00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:14.280
It just keeps unfolding
and intensifying

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:18.510
in a way that's really
quite marvelous.

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:22.190
It has the quality of lament to it

00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:24.430
and several times people
have referred to it

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:26.560
as a kind of Indian lament.

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:30.690
And that's one of the chapters of
Dvorak's time in the United States,

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:35.520
which is most poorly understood
and I don't know if we ever will.

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:38.220
Well when Dvorak's
first great biographer

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:42.130
in English John Clapham
wrote about Dvorak's time

00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:47.210
in Iowa he became puzzled
because there was a reference

00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:53.660
to the Kickapoo and he wanted to
know what tribe the Kickapoo were.

00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:56.780
But in fact, there was
no Kickapoo tribe there,

00:42:56.780 --> 00:43:00.220
there was something called
the Kickapoo Medicine Show

00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:02.090
that Dvorak heard.

00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:08.420
And the Kickapoo Medicine Show
was a kind of Pan American music,

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:11.140
it had an African-American
banjo player,

00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:14.590 position:56%
it had people from different tribes,
it was a little bit of a show.

00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:17.620
So we really don't
know what he heard.

00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:22.110
But it's likely that the
he was taken by this,

00:43:22.110 --> 00:43:24.990
although his reactions
to it were ambivalent.

00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:27.730 position:56%
We don't know quite what he thought.

00:43:27.730 --> 00:43:32.490
But in any case, there was a
tendency to tie Dvorak to this.

00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:35.520
But there's also another thing
in this particular movement

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:39.300
which is redolent of Dvorak.

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:42.310
Dvorak had something of
a reputation of being

00:43:42.310 --> 00:43:49.820
in unproblematic happy Czech
and yet, his works are filled

00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:53.110
with funerals and funeral marches.

00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:57.970
The symphonic poems almost all
have funeral marches in the middle

00:43:57.970 --> 00:44:02.520
of the Largo of the New World
Symphony, there's a passage based

00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:06.670
on the death of Minnehaha
from the song of Hiawatha.

00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:12.870
The cello concerto slow movement
has a funeral interruption

00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:20.720
and at the very end of this
movement there's some kind of --

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:27.380 position:56%
the constant sound which has gone on
and on for five or six minutes stops

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:30.510
and we have this kind
of funeral march.

00:44:30.510 --> 00:45:01.040
[ Music ]

00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:06.620 position:56%
So some kind of prairie funeral
being enacted in the course of this.

00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:11.610
Now we don't actually know
exactly what to do with pieces

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:16.820
of music right because, you know,
you have this inner longing,

00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:26.200
sighing, deep maybe even anguish
and then here's the next movement.

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:30.810
What are you supposed to do with
that, nobody really knows right.

00:45:30.810 --> 00:45:34.160
I mean it really is an
astonishing contrast

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:40.060
and this movement is also
another way that Dvorak tried

00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:43.050
to make American music and
maybe he can be forgiven

00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:45.080
for doing it too obviously.

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:49.000
So again, here's the opening.

00:45:51.510 --> 00:46:08.190

00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:11.510
So that passage there.

00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:16.040
[ Music ]

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:20.160
We're told that Dvorak while
he was writing this sort

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:25.730
of became a little bit obsessed
with the sound of black bird

00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:30.040
or with red wings or red wing, you
know, we're not quite sure what.

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:32.000
But we pretty much think it's this.

[ Birds Singing ]

00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:49.840
Scarlett [inaudible] and
that Dvorak was trying.

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:53.390
One of the ways that he tried
to make his music American was

00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:55.660
to stick an American bird in it

00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:58.040
because how can you
say it's not American.

00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:01.620
And so we hear this in
various different times.

00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:05.510
So here's another one.

00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:18.040
[ Music ]

00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:21.420 position:56%
Those are the robin and the bluebird
taken out of a book of bird songs

00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:25.510
and stuck right into
the New World Symphony.

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:32.040
[ Music ]

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:35.990
Magpies and blue jays in the
scherzo of the New World Symphony.

00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:41.200
So Dvorak decided that in
his scherzo he would stick

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:44.140
in the sounds of this tanager.

00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:46.690
And so we have this
sort of full picture.

00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:50.940
We have the sadness of the prairie,
we have the energy of coming

00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:53.980
into the country and
then we have these sort

00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:56.080
of extraordinary bird songs.

00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:59.180
The last movement combines
a lot of these things

00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:02.510
because we have a kind
of celebratory.

00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:13.040
[ Music ]

00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:14.700
So again, what are these sounds?

00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:17.000
It's these simple sounds.

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:22.230
The kinds of things he
was hearing in black music

00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:23.530
that he was sometimes hearing

00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:26.850
in Native American music these
little phrases that come together,

00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:32.260
but also an extraordinary
sense of lyrical expansiveness.

00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:35.510
This is the second theme
in the last movement.

00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:50.040
[ Music ]

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:54.290
I mean, you know, you can name
70 film scores that come right

00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:57.250
out of this sound, which was
a very influential sound.

00:48:57.250 --> 00:48:59.280
But then in the middle
of the movement,

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:00.580
middle of the movements sorry,

00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:05.510

something a little bit unusual.

00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:34.190
[ Music ]

00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:39.130
So he has kind of reminiscence
of the mood of the slow movement,

00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:44.670
the second movement kind of comes
back in a celebratory last movement

00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:49.460
to once more sort of suggest
a more reflective mode.

00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:54.410
You know, writing a piece
of music is both someone

00:49:54.410 --> 00:49:58.140
like Dvorak quite natural,
but also extremely complex.

00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:00.970
You're always asking how much
of this do I do before I do some

00:50:00.970 --> 00:50:03.970
of that and what's the
effect of that going to be.

00:50:03.970 --> 00:50:06.380
And if I want to say
this, how do I say it.

00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:09.070
If what I really want to say is
the middle how do I surround it

00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:10.370
with various parts.

00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:16.300 position:56%
And in a piece like this just as I
think Mrs. Thurber was experimenting

00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:20.330
with what it meant to try
to make American music.

00:50:20.330 --> 00:50:24.830
Dvorak was using all these new
ideas combined with his old ones

00:50:24.830 --> 00:50:29.190
because the people who don't
like this notion of Dvorak trying

00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:34.890
to write American music will always
point out that Dvorak used some

00:50:34.890 --> 00:50:40.030
of these same ideas when he was
in the Czech lands, in Bohemia.

00:50:40.030 --> 00:50:45.810
That would be like saying
somebody who comes over from Japan

00:50:45.810 --> 00:50:51.280
to paint the American West
isn't painting the American West

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:53.800
because they're using a tree.

00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:56.840
Well I mean everyone
has a basic technique,

00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:01.150
you don't lose your
basic technique simply

00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:04.310
because you find new inspirations.

00:51:04.310 --> 00:51:06.570
But what Dvorak tried
to do I think was

00:51:06.570 --> 00:51:11.840
to quite consciously do what
Mrs. Thurber wanted him to do,

00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:15.530
which was again to
create an American music

00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:17.310
that was like his Czech music.

00:51:17.310 --> 00:51:22.660
I think and this is crude that she
thought he had made Czech music

00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:26.970
by taking our basic model, a
German model really of music

00:51:26.970 --> 00:51:30.420
and putting Czechisms [phonetic]
in she sort of wanted him to take

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:34.260
out the Czechisms and
put in Americanisms.

00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:37.420
And one of the ways he did that
was by not putting in Czechisms.

00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:41.010
So there's very little in any
of these American period works

00:51:41.010 --> 00:51:44.520
that even by name or deed
or sound suggest polka,

00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:48.290
suggest anything other
than American-style.

00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:52.300
But there's every evidence
that Dvorak believed in this

00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:54.280
and that he believed
that he should try

00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:58.690
to show American composers what
it meant to write American music.

00:51:58.690 --> 00:52:00.760
Well whether you want to
take the view of some people

00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:04.700
and say this led directly
to Gershwin, to Copeland

00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:08.010 position:56%
and to Duke Ellington as my
colleague, Maurice Perez, would say.

00:52:08.010 --> 00:52:09.850
Or whether you're a
little bit more skeptical

00:52:09.850 --> 00:52:14.550 position:56%
about how Dvorak's American language
was received, there's no doubt

00:52:14.550 --> 00:52:18.730
that he tried to do it and the best
proof of that was a remark he made

00:52:18.730 --> 00:52:26.250
in some anger to his student and
amanuensis, Yosef Kovarik she said,

00:52:26.250 --> 00:52:29.570
this is -- after he'd written
these pieces he came back.

00:52:29.570 --> 00:52:33.910
New World Symphony was premiered,
all kinds of angry cries there's no

00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:35.210
such thing as American music

00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:37.010
who do you think you are
you don't know anything.

00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:39.730
You come from Bohemia you're
going to teach us, go away.

00:52:39.730 --> 00:52:44.010
And Dvorak wrote, you know,

00:52:44.010 --> 00:52:48.160
they call me an American
composer, you know, but I'm not.

00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:50.440
I just tried to show
them what it would be

00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:53.960
like to be an American composer,
but I'm not doing that anymore.

00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:56.820
And I think by and large
he stopped doing it.

00:52:56.820 --> 00:53:00.880 position:56%
So the fact that he was doing is the
evidence in effect that he stopped.

00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:04.390
So these again, are
extraordinary pieces.

00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:08.200
Whether you choose to call
this one the American,

00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:12.810
Martinu is the Parisian and
Dvorak's earlier one the Habsburg

00:53:12.810 --> 00:53:16.940
because it seems to combine all
the styles that you would want

00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:21.080
to have together or you
just simply think of them

00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:24.840
as extraordinary pieces of music
doesn't really matter much.

00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:29.460
But what does matter is the kinds
of intensity and combinations

00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:31.520
and contrast that you
get in these pieces.

some of his musical influences,

00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:10.130
if any because he doesn't really
sound much like anyone else?

00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:12.590
&gt;&gt; Michael Beckerman: Well
I mean that's, you know,

00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:14.620
I mean the best thing I've
read about influence not

00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:17.530 position:56%
that I really understand it is that
the reason it's so difficult to talk

00:54:17.530 --> 00:54:22.160
about it because the most profound
influences act over a long period

00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:25.970
from a great distance, so it's
always tricky to pick them up.

00:54:25.970 --> 00:54:29.800
But I think there are several,

00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:36.500
I mean I think he was very much
taken with his Dvorak school.

00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:40.330
You know, I think in many ways even
though his music sounds different

00:54:40.330 --> 00:54:47.000 position:56%
in terms of the kinds of pieces that
he wrote he chose to follow that.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:50.990
He studied with Josef Suk,
you know, Dvorak's son-in-law

00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:55.970
and I think again, I think he
was influenced by this tradition.

00:54:55.970 --> 00:55:00.780
I Again, it's tricky to sort of
make generalizations like this

00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:02.580
because they stick
and they ought not to.

00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:08.370
But, you know, this was a
tradition of non-virtuosos.

00:55:08.370 --> 00:55:10.830
You know, Suk himself even
though he was the leader

00:55:10.830 --> 00:55:13.950
of the Bohemian Quartet
was a second violinist.

00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:16.080
Martinu was a second violinist.

00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:18.200
Dvorak was a violist.

00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:22.560
And I think something of
that kind of workman-like,

00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:26.400
somewhat modest part of
the tradition comes out

00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:28.520
and I think he knew those works.

00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:32.440
I think he was interested in
Janacek and I think that comes

00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:35.160
out sometimes in the operas.

00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:38.990
I was, I mean the person
I spoke to most

00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:41.070
about this was a little
trick was Rudolf [inaudible],

00:55:41.070 --> 00:55:46.220
who was a student of Janacek's and
a very good friend of Martinu's.

00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:50.800
And now Martinu also
was I think very taken

00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:53.580
with Albert Roussell
and the French style.

00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:58.150 position:56%
He studied with Roussell and he was,
you know, active and influenced.

00:55:58.150 --> 00:56:02.240
There's an extremely strong
Stravinskian influence in a lot

00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:05.480
of pieces from that period.

00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:12.040
But I think sort of the Martinu
style that he cultivates really

00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:16.220
from the 1930's on, I mean again
it draws on Czech folklore,

00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:20.660
it draws on Slovak music, it draws
on Czech pastoral traditions.

00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:24.900
He richly draws on a lot, but I
don't think there is that kind

00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:26.630
of influence I think you're right.

[inaudible] in any of Dvorak's work?

00:56:39.330 --> 00:56:43.840
&gt;&gt; Michael Beckerman:
Yeah, I think certainly,

00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:48.290
I mean Smetana was unavoidable
to Dvorak for many reasons.

00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:51.700
One of greatest was that
he played under Dvorak,

00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:54.900
I mean Smetana's baton for, you
know, played as second violinist

00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:58.710 position:56%
and Smetana was the conductor of the
orchestra of the provisional theater

00:56:58.710 --> 00:57:02.840
and so he obviously learned an
enormous amount from Smetana.

00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:06.200
You know and I think
he admired Smetana.

00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:13.750
There was a certain level of
rivalry Dvorak Slavonic dances were

00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:17.330
extraordinarily successful
and it sort

00:57:17.330 --> 00:57:22.390
of illustrates a little bit you
know the Harold Bloom anxiety

00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:28.550
of influence because people
often like to tell happy stories,

00:57:28.550 --> 00:57:32.350
people often like to tell happy
stories about the relationship

00:57:32.350 --> 00:57:38.410
between composers, how they help
each other and Haydn loves Mozart.

00:57:38.410 --> 00:57:43.340
But you know Bloom thinks of
this more as mortal combat

00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:45.230
and I don't know how mortal it was,

00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:48.440
but when Dvorak had
this enormous success

00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:51.630
with the Slavonic dances
Smetana kind of shook his finger

00:57:51.630 --> 00:57:54.680
and wrote a series
of quite wonderful --

00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:55.980
not as popular as Dvorak,

00:57:55.980 --> 00:57:59.870
but wonderful pieces called the
Czech dances because he felt

00:57:59.870 --> 00:58:03.090
that Dvorak's dances
were not Czech enough.

00:58:03.090 --> 00:58:07.630
And he wanted to show him what
it meant to write Czech music

00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:13.010 position:56%
for Smetana was to apply the highest
level intellectual traditions

00:58:13.010 --> 00:58:17.680
of modern music, but somehow
referring to local things.

00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:21.460
So and I think he felt
Dvorak was too international.

00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:27.400
And unfortunately, this became a
very ugly battle not between Dvorak

00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:30.260
and Smetana who were mostly gone

00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:34.250
by the time the biggest battles
erupted, but it's well-known

00:58:34.250 --> 00:58:37.580
that the Smetana's
champion was a kind

00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:43.270 position:56%
of a mustachioed intellectual
villain and his name was [inaudible]

00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:47.580
who gained more power than a
musicologist should ever have.

00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:51.140
By the time the communists took
power he became the Minister

00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:52.440
of Culture.

00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:55.570
But long before that he has
basically taught generations

00:58:55.570 --> 00:59:01.650
of students to worship Smetana and
[inaudible] and to revile Dvorak

00:59:01.650 --> 00:59:06.210
as a kind of bloated, cosmopolitan

00:59:06.210 --> 00:59:09.690
who simply whatever good qualities
he might've had he was simply

00:59:09.690 --> 00:59:12.850
showing Czech music
the wrong way forward.

00:59:12.850 --> 00:59:17.510
So these kinds of things intrude
even now into the literature.

00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:20.040
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:24.900
That was actually composed
almost just before this quartet.

00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:27.760
So yeah, I mean the two of
them were dipping into many

00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:30.950
if you'll forgive the
terrible pun the same streams.

00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:33.650
Yes, anymore questions?

00:59:33.650 --> 00:59:36.180
Yes.

00:59:36.180 --> 00:59:38.490
&gt;&gt; You commented that Dvorak felt

00:59:38.490 --> 00:59:42.120
that American music should
be influenced or maybe led

00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:46.310
by African-American music can
you tell us some of the composers

00:59:46.310 --> 00:59:49.490
or influencers or musicians
that you might've heard

00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:52.580
and been impressed by.

00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:58.020
&gt;&gt; Michael Beckerman: Well, you
know, I think his love affair.

00:59:58.020 --> 01:00:02.280
Look, I mean the bottom line
is that most of what happened

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:04.040
in the past we don't know right.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:08.080
So, you know, there's just so many
encounters that he might've had

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:09.380
that we know nothing about.

01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:13.410
The ones we know about primarily
are either his encounters

01:00:13.410 --> 01:00:20.440
with notated music or his
encounters with specific musicians.

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:25.780
The one who was most influential
in that regard from a lot

01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:27.550
of different sources, you know,

01:00:27.550 --> 01:00:29.900
you don't necessarily
believe any one source,

01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:32.770
but if you have a whole range of
people who don't know each other

01:00:32.770 --> 01:00:34.280
who all seem to say the same thing.

01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:37.720
So the relationship between
Harry Burley and Dvorak

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:42.340
that one profound way that
that he heard black music.

01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:45.440
He knew this Sissieretta Jones,

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:49.850
who was considered the black Patti
singer and she also sang for him.

01:00:49.850 --> 01:00:53.730
He probably encountered
more musicians,

01:00:53.730 --> 01:00:56.990
but we don't actually
know that much about them.

01:00:56.990 --> 01:01:00.370
He had one or two African-American
students

01:01:00.370 --> 01:01:02.970
and it's quite possible,
you know, the famous.

01:01:02.970 --> 01:01:07.900
Sorry, I've have to
change the key right,

01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:11.450
those famous [inaudible]
sounds very much like one

01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:15.320
of the plantation songs
written by one of his students.

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:17.610
But he was an ardent
student of these things.

01:01:17.610 --> 01:01:22.550
He was given musical notation,
he was given articles and again,

01:01:22.550 --> 01:01:26.790
I believe that his first, you
know, interest in this was piqued

01:01:26.790 --> 01:01:31.220
when he met Burley and at the
same time read this article

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:34.820
that not only spoke about
the expressive quality

01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:39.960
of African-American music, but
gave several musical examples.

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:42.850
And at the same time argued

01:01:42.850 --> 01:01:46.140
that these examples should
be the foundation of a music.

01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:51.460
Well even if it was a pretext,
even if Dvorak was being paid a lot

01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:54.870
of money to make American
music he had to figure out how

01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:56.780
to make it and pretty quickly.

01:01:56.780 --> 01:02:01.750 position:56%
And I think it's when he heard these
songs that he felt this has got

01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:04.610
to be -- this is my clay out
of which I'm going to make it.

01:02:04.610 --> 01:02:07.360
And I don't he ever
really deviated from that.

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:11.510
But you're right, there are not
that many sources other than Burley

01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:14.600
and one or two of his students
of musicians that he heard,

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:17.480
although we assume that
he must've heard many.

01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:18.990
Thank you.

01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:20.430
&gt;&gt; Anne E. McLean:
Wonderful, this is fantastic.

01:02:20.430 --> 01:02:22.140
I'm sorry to have to cut you off,

01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:24.100
but I know you're going
to love this concert.

01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:27.530
Thank you so much Dr. Beckerman.

01:02:27.530 --> 01:02:28.830
&gt;&gt; Michael Beckerman: Thank you.

01:02:28.830 --> 01:02:32.180
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
