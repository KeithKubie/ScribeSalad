(hip hop music)

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:12.545
(screen buzzes)

00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:15.081
(spooky music)

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:23.756
(gasping)

00:00:23.756 --> 00:00:25.358
(breathing heavy)

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:26.692
- Why am I in the morgue?

00:00:26.692 --> 00:00:29.028
- Because you're dead.

00:00:29.028 --> 00:00:30.463
- No I'm not.

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:32.298 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Well, the certificate
here says that you're dead.

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:34.067 align:start size:88% position:13%
So, if you have one that
says that you're not,

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:35.401
I'd love to see it.

00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:36.936
- I don't have any certificates.

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:38.304
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about, man.

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:39.271
I'm not dead.

00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:41.407
- Well, maybe you're a zombie.

00:00:41.407 --> 00:00:44.243
- Do I look like a zombie?

00:00:44.243 --> 00:00:46.479
- Well, terrible skin, bloated,

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.748
yellow teeth, bags
under your eyes.

00:00:48.748 --> 00:00:49.983
Shall I go on?
- Okay, I'm sorry

00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:51.450
I'm not dressed for
the fucking prom,

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.552
but I'm talking to you.

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:53.819
Can zombies do that?

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:54.954
- They talk in Night
of the Living Dead.

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:56.455
- Oh, shut the fuck up.

00:00:56.455 --> 00:00:58.757 align:start size:94% position:6%
I cannot believe I'm
having this conversation.

00:00:58.757 --> 00:01:00.560
Look, my skin's not falling off.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.894
Okay, I'm not a zombie.

00:01:01.894 --> 00:01:04.397
- Well, Nicholas Holt's
skin doesn't fall off

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:07.433
in Warm Bodies, and he
talks in that one too.

00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:09.435
- That's not canon!

00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:10.936
If you think I'm a zombie,

00:01:10.936 --> 00:01:12.505 align:start size:88% position:13%
aren't you afraid I'm
going to come over there

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:13.940
and bite your fucking neck?

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.274
- I can out run a zombie.

00:01:15.274 --> 00:01:16.809
- What if I was one
of those fast running

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:18.077
World War Z zombies?

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:19.245
- Oh you're a fast?

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:20.246 align:start size:84% position:16%
You're a fast
World War Z zombie,

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:21.447
have you seen your own body?

00:01:21.447 --> 00:01:22.681
Have you seen your
own fat human body?

00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:24.116
Probably a slim chance
of that, right big boy?

00:01:24.116 --> 00:01:25.084
(growling)
- Oh fuck!

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:26.018
There's a zombie behind you!

00:01:26.018 --> 00:01:26.819
- What?
- Oh God!

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:27.987
- What's the matter with

00:01:27.987 --> 00:01:29.121 align:start size:84% position:16%
your leg zombie?
- My legs are asleep!

00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:30.756
He's gonna fuckin' bite you!

00:01:30.756 --> 00:01:31.657
(growling)
- Well, okay,

00:01:31.657 --> 00:01:33.158
so you want me to turn around

00:01:33.158 --> 00:01:34.527
so that you can bite me neck?
- There's a zombie in there!

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:37.430 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I'm not falling...
(screaming)

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.133
- Oh my God!
(screaming)

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:42.134
Now you're a zombie!

00:01:42.134 --> 00:01:44.136 align:start size:84% position:16%
- No I'm not.
(upbeat hip hop music)

00:01:44.136 --> 00:01:45.772
I'm not!

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:46.806
(sobbing)

00:01:46.806 --> 00:01:48.541
I'm normal!

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:49.476
