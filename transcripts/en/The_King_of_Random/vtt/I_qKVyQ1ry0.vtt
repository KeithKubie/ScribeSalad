00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.900
What's up guys welcome back to the King of Random kitchen

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.200
you guys have been asking for it

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.960
you guys have been waiting for it

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.300
so in today's episode I'm finally doing it

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.440
I'm teaching you how to make liquid nitrogen

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.220
I've been really hesitant to put out a video

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.320
on how I make liquid nitrogen

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.080
because honestly

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.840
my setup isn't very professional

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.080
It's all jury-rigged together

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.150
realize you guys don't really care what
it looks like you're more interested in

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.359
how its functions so that's what we're
getting into today now if you go outside

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.560
and take a deep breath you're filling
your lungs with about 20% oxygen 79%

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.669
nitrogen and 1% of other gases now the
first step in making liquid nitrogen is

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.850
just to take the regular atmosphere and
compress it into some kind of a

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.739
container that can hold it under
[ pressure ]

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.710
once it's under pressure we can pass it
through a nitrogen membrane which will

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.910
separate the oxygen and the other gases
leaving pure nitrogen gas behind but

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.030
there's one other problem the nitrogen
might have some moisture associated with

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.449
it and we don't want any moisture so the
next step is to pass that gas through

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.809
some kind of mechanism that dries it out
now in one of the secret compartments of

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.140
my room I have this nitrogen generator
that does all that for me and I really

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.199
have to give credit where credit's due
to my friend Chris Roberts who really

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.769
made all this possible he's the one that
located all the items he sourced all the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.220
equipment he helped put it all together
and he helped it get to the functioning

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.610
state that it is today now once we've
got the clean dry nitrogen gas we need a

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.860
place to store it
my friend Chris went down to Harbor

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.770
Freight and pick up a little tank for
about 20 bucks that we use to store that

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.040
nitrogen gas under pressure and we added
a little regulator so we can turn a knob

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.220
and regulate how much gas flows out and
now it might seem a little bit too

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.950
simple but that's half the battle in
making liquid nitrogen

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.180
once we've got dry nitrogen seeping out
at about 1 psi all we have to do is get

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.659
it cold enough that it liquefies and
this is where we bring in the helium

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.500
compressor now helium compressor unit is
basically just a glorified air

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.460
conditioning unit the whole purpose of
this existence is to get colder than the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.409
boiling point of nitrogen now helium has
a boiling point around minus 452 degrees

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.590
Fahrenheit which is way below the
boiling point of liquid nitrogen

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.340
I think it's Boyle's law that says if
you take a gas and compress it and then

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.180
let it cool back down if you rapidly
expand it that gas will get very very

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.320
cold and because we're using helium we
can compress it cool that gas down and

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.799
rapidly expand it to a temperature
that's lower than the boiling point of

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.250
liquid night
so now that you've got the basic concept

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.100
let me explain in a little bit more
detail how a helium compressor works

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.180
it's charged up with helium gas in a
closed-loop system the helium gas is

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.090
compressed where it keeps up
tremendously and we need some kind of a

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.390
system to cool it down which I'll talk
about in just a minute but once it is

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.780
cooled down it can travel to the cryo
head where it's rapidly expanded and

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.380
cooled down to a temperature lower than
the boiling point of nitrogen so what

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.350
would happen if we had a surface that
was colder than the boiling point of

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.880
liquid nitrogen and we had a small vapor
of nitrogen gas blowing at it that's

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.910
right it's going to condense and is
going to form small droplets and drip

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.000
down to ground now if we're able to
catch those droplets into some kind of a

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.440
glorified thermos a Dewar if you will
then theoretically over time those

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.250
droplets would add up and produce
bucketfuls of liquid nitrogen and that's

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.790
it guys that is exactly how we make
liquid nitrogen hey guys just stepping

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.250

membership club oh you are I love it no
kidding you know be in a video

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.550
all right guys time is up back to the
video I'll be back up for a second and

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.530
just talk about the cooling system we
used for the Gila

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.019
compressor which is pretty cool because
it's just jury-rigged out a

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.230
three-component my friend Chris and I
start out by building a housing for the

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.350
furnace blower and the radiator so we
could suck in tremendous amounts of air

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.770
and blow it through the radiator and
cool down all the liquid inside next we

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.650
ran some poly hoses from the radiator
all the way back to the helium

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.040
compressor where it runs through a heat
exchanger where it soaks in all the heat

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.250
from the compressed helium runs it back
to the radiator and cools down once

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.040
again and this whole system is powered
by a sump pump that I got from Home

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.370
Depot for about 20 bucks I just built it
so it sits inside of a little bucket

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.639
inside of a bigger bucket that way if
any water splashes out it's not going to

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:51.080
damage our electronics now the sump pump
runs on normal house power about 120 AC

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.370
but the nitrogen generator and the
helium compressor run on 240 and by now

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.950
I know you've probably got two questions
on your mind how much energy does

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.880
actually use and how much nitrogen gets
generated cats are the first question I

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.430
don't really know how much power it uses
but it's not enough to make a difference

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.729
in our monthly electric bill and answer
the second question how long does it

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.940
take to make well to make 30 litres
which fills up my Dewar it takes about

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.750
three weeks remember guys we not only
have to get the Dewar cold enough where

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.840
it can hold liquid nitrogen without
evaporating but then we have to fill it

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.710
the rest of the way up by drip by drip
and that takes a really long time so

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.830
where do you find all this equipment
well honestly we found it on Amazon eBay

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.210
and we found it at university surplus
and as long as you can find a nitrogen

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.919
compressor with a nitrogen membrane a
helium compressor a cryo head and Jimmy

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:36.919
rig your own liquid cooling system you
could probably make one of these for

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:39.650
yourself but as my friend nurdrage says
I'm going to have to crush your

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.100
expectations because even jury-rigging
it together yourself it's still going to

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.580
cost you a lot of money I've got about a
thousand maybe $1,300 and see unit I've

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.370
got here so when we draw it out like
this it kind of looks like a complicated

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.220
system and there are a lot of moving
parts but what it comes down to our two

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.660
main essentials dry nitrogen gas meeting
a very cold surface the nitrogen

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.960
condenses gets liquefied and then gets
captured into some kind of a container

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.110
that can keep it nice and cold and
that's it that's the basics of making

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.310
liquid nitrogen in a nutshell so there
you have a guy's mystery solved you now

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.800
know how to make liquid nitrogen by
pulling nitrogen right out of the air

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.089
and getting it so cold that it liquefied
hey thanks for joining me for this video

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:18.640
I'll be looking for you the next one
talk to you then liquid nitrogen due to

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:26.740
paper shiny and wet just like a liquid
now our paper is really really cold
