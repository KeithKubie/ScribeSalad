00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.980
Two of the most noted features of DNA

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.800
are that it's double-stranded and in a spiral,

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.700
or helical, shape. Thus, we call it the

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.390
double helix. But for us to understand how

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:18.220
DNA does what it does so well, we really need to simplify this model even more.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.550
We need to simplify both of these basic

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.310
features. So, first, we're going to unwind our DNA.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.040
And now, we actually want to separate

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.320
the double stranded DNA into two single strands.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.870
And looking at one of these single strands, we can immediately see the basic

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.340
unit of DNA called the Deoxynucleotide. Deoxynucleotides

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.190
are just the basic building blocks that make up DNA. In fact, looking at this

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.600
single strand here, which structure do you think is the deoxynucleotide?
