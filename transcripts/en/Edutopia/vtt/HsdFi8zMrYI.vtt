00:00:03.196 --> 00:00:06.356
&gt;&gt;Pasi: If you look at the
15-year-olds, or 16-year-old Fins

00:00:06.356 --> 00:00:10.376
who are leaving the basic
school, most of them have been

00:00:10.376 --> 00:00:13.236
in special education
throughout their schooling.

00:00:13.556 --> 00:00:16.806
Which means that special education
is actually nothing special.

00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:20.856
So it's you are a special child
or student if you haven't been,

00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:23.826
if you haven't ever
used special services.

00:00:41.046 --> 00:00:44.426
&gt;&gt;Pasi: We are putting a lot of
emphasis on the early detection

00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:49.096
of any difficulties and problems that
the students in our schools may have.

00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:51.966
And this is a very different
policy to many other countries

00:00:52.026 --> 00:00:55.926
where these measures are designed in
a way that they are implemented only

00:00:55.926 --> 00:01:00.506
when the problems have
emerged and are too visible.

00:01:01.056 --> 00:01:02.566
But we don't' think
like this in Finland.

00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:05.926
I think we believe in this early
intervention to make sure that those

00:01:05.926 --> 00:01:11.126
who are likely to be in trouble
will be recognized early,

00:01:11.126 --> 00:01:14.976
and provided help and support
as quickly as possible.

00:01:41.046 --> 00:01:44.236
&gt;&gt;Olli: We as subject teachers
cooperate with the special teacher

00:01:44.236 --> 00:01:45.406
in cases where we see

00:01:45.406 --> 00:01:49.906
that an individual student has
problems with their studies.

00:01:50.396 --> 00:01:53.126
It might be problems with
concentrating on a theme.

00:01:53.126 --> 00:01:56.056
It might be reading and
listening difficulties,

00:01:56.056 --> 00:01:57.436
especially in languages and math.

00:01:57.686 --> 00:02:01.326
What we do is that we
contact the special teacher

00:02:01.326 --> 00:02:03.036
at the very early moment.

00:02:03.036 --> 00:02:04.646
We call it the first intervention.

00:02:04.886 --> 00:02:09.126
We talk with the special teacher,
and try to arrange a time that she

00:02:09.126 --> 00:02:12.846
or he could be able to come and
join me as a subject teacher

00:02:12.846 --> 00:02:15.976
to my classroom, and then
focus on the problem.

00:02:51.946 --> 00:02:55.236
&gt;&gt;Olli: The special teacher is
available for a couple of hours.

00:02:55.796 --> 00:03:00.326
And then she picks the
student to a separate classroom

00:03:00.526 --> 00:03:01.956
and helps him or her there.

00:03:02.316 --> 00:03:05.706
And we also make an
individual learning plan

00:03:06.166 --> 00:03:09.196
for that individual student.

00:03:09.556 --> 00:03:12.776
And by taking these
measures, we try to guarantee

00:03:13.056 --> 00:03:14.746
that no one is lagging behind.

00:03:41.186 --> 00:03:44.676
&gt;&gt;Olli: The student welfare
team gathers on a weekly basis,

00:03:44.956 --> 00:03:49.096
and subject teachers inform
the group with different cases.

00:03:49.096 --> 00:03:51.616
They might be bullying, they
might be skipping classes,

00:03:51.616 --> 00:03:52.976
they might be learning difficulties,

00:03:52.976 --> 00:03:54.976
it might behavioral
problems, all kinds of things.

00:04:16.096 --> 00:04:19.776
&gt;&gt;Olli: And then these individual
problems are dealt with case-by-case

00:04:19.986 --> 00:04:24.976
in this weekly meeting that
every school in Finland has.

00:04:39.046 --> 00:04:41.416
&gt;&gt;Merja: Well, a student welfare
group deals with any kinds

00:04:41.416 --> 00:04:48.036
of problems that we see in a school
having to do with problems at home

00:04:48.586 --> 00:04:52.746
or at learning disabilities,
multi-cultural problems.

00:04:53.316 --> 00:04:57.686
The main value of our student
welfare group is to interrupt as soon

00:04:57.686 --> 00:05:00.376
as possible, problems involved.

00:05:08.416 --> 00:05:11.086
&gt;&gt;Pasi: With this policy, we are
trying to really make it easy

00:05:11.086 --> 00:05:14.926
for everybody to say, "Yes, I have
some areas where I need help now.

00:05:15.476 --> 00:05:17.206
Is there anybody who can help?"

00:05:17.336 --> 00:05:19.256
rather than trying
to hide these things.

00:05:19.456 --> 00:05:22.806
And in many cases, when you do this
in the later years they will come

00:05:22.806 --> 00:05:25.496
and accumulate even
more difficult problems.

00:05:25.856 --> 00:05:29.816
So I think with this, we have been
able to positively affect both the-

00:05:29.816 --> 00:05:33.906
the equity of the system, and
also the quality of the system.
