00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.190
I've been asked to do a few
more implicit differentiation

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.490
problems, and this is something
that I think confuses a lot of

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.100
people, so let's do a
couple more problems.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.740
And I think there was a typo.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.660
I forgot the user that actually
sent this, but I'm guessing

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.210
this is what he intended.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.430
And if this isn't what he
intended, this is something

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.760
close, so it should
give the idea.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:32.030
So the implicit function they
gave was x squared minus 24xy

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:45.560
plus 16y squared minus 400x
minus 300y is equal to 0.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.670
So, how do we do this?

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.770
Well, we take the derivative of
both sides with respect to x.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.800
I could write the derivative
operator on both sides, but I

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.460
think you know that at this
point, so that's the next step.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.330
So let's do that, and
I'll do it in blue.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:04.330
OK, derivative of x square
with respect to x is 2x.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.360
And now, let's see, it's
going to be minus 24.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.520
I'm going to take the constant
term out, so minus 24 times

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.580
the derivative of xy.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.600
So what's the derivative of xy?

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.450
We could use the
product rule here.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.470
The derivative of the first
term x, well, that's

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.810
just 1, right?

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.140
So 1 is the derivative of x
times the second expression,

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.750
or you could say the second
mini-function or whatever,

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.670
times y, and then plus the
first expression x times

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.560
the derivative of the
second expression.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.260
Well, what's the derivative
of y with respect to x?

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.660
And this sometimes confuses
people because it's so easy.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.810
Well, it's just dy/dx.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.240
Instead of writing dy/dx, I'm
just going to write y prime

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.400
here just to get you used to a
different type of notation,

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.430
although I prefer dy/dx
because you realize you're

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.870
using the chain rule.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:03.360
But anyway, xy prime, that's
dy/dx, plus-- so we'll

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.490
do the chain rule again.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.330
So let's take the derivative of
this expression with respect to

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.590
y first, so that's just 32y.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.650
But we're taking the derivative
with respect to x, so we have

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.000
to take the derivative of this
with respect y, which we did,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.380
and then multiply that times
the derivative of y with

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.880
respect to x, which is
just dy/dx, or y prime.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.960
And then this with respect to
x, well, that's just minus 400.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.170
And then what's the derivative
of this with respect to x?

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:46.520
Well, it's minus 300, and then
times the derivative of y with

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.510
respect to x because we're
doing the chain rule, right?

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.110
Minus 300 is just the
derivative of this

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.800
with respect y.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.600
And then-- I want
to hit this point.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.840
You know, some people when they
learn this, they just say, oh,

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.580
whenever I take a derivative of
y, I just take the derivative

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.210
and I multiply by y prime.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.890
And that's right.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:01.820
That's essentially
what you're doing.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.350
But I want you understand
that you're doing the chain

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.860
rule when you do that.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.730
So you're taking the derivative
with respect to y and then

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.800
multiplying that times the
derivative with respect to x,

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.690
which we'll write as y prime
now, and all of that

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.140
is equal to 0.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.040
Now let's simplify this.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:38.210
Let's see, I get 2x minus 24y
minus 24xy prime plus 32yy

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:49.650
prime minus 400 minus 300y
prime is equal to 0.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.760
And let's switch colors.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.060
So let's separate all
the y prime terms out.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.590
So let's see, what are
the y prime terms?

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.420
We have this term has a y prime
in it, we have this term has a

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.950
y prime in it, and we have this
term has a y prime in it.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.140
So we can write these.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.130
Let's do the positive
ones first.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.770
So 32y, so this is the
same thing as y prime.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:28.850
y prime times 32y
minus 24x minus 300.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.800
Those are all the y prime
terms, and then we're left

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.150
with just the regular terms.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:44.920
So then plus 2x minus 24y
minus 400 is equal to 0.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.130
I just rearranged it and
took out the y prime out of

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.380
this, this and this term.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.500
Let's take all of these to the
other side of the equation.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.430
Now , essentially what I want
to do is get all the terms that

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.830
don't have the y prime onto the
right-hand side and then divide

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.980
by this, and then we will
solve the equation.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.130
Let's see, so we get y prime
times-- and this is-- you could

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.595
also write, you know the
derivative with respect

00:05:04.595 --> 00:05:06.860
to x or dy/dx.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.210
In general, even though it
takes more time, I like to

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.300
normally write dy/dx, because,
you remember, I'm taking the

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.370
derivative with respect
to x. y prime?

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.850
I don't know.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.180
You might be taking the
derivative with respect

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.960
to who knows what?

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:26.280
Let's see, 32y minus 24x minus
300 is equal to-- put all these

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.570
on the right-hand side so you
get-- I'll switch the order.

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.760
I like to put the
positive numbers first.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:37.620
24y minus 2x plus 400, right?

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.340
And then divide both sides by
this, and I'll do it in a

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.570
different color because we're
almost at the answer, and we

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.250
get y prime-- the derivative
with respect to x is equal to

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:56.230
this thing-- 24y minus 2x plus
400, all of that over this

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:03.930
thing: 32y minus 24x minus 300.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.270
And let's see, we could at
least-- it looks like-- well,

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.160
everything's divisible by 2, so
we could divide the numerator

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:19.410
and the denominator by 2, and
you get 12y minus x plus 200

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:26.820
over 16y minus 12x minus 150.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.550
And if I didn't make a careless
mistake, that's the answer.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.780
The derivative of y with
respect to x any time is this

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.280
expression that has y's and x
in it, and that's cool because

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.060
this is a fairly convoluted
implicit function, but we can

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.900
figure out the slope of it at
any point because we

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.190
know the derivative.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:43.430
Let's do the next one.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.080
And this one is-- this
one looks simpler.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:07:04.300
x minus y squared is equal
to 8 times y minus 6.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.240
All right.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.290
So let's just take the
derivative with respect to x of

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:12.250
both sides, and I'll use the
dy/dx notation this time.

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.710
So let's first use
the chain rule.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.880
Let's take the derivative
of the inside.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.280
So what's the derivative
of the inside function?

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.480
Well, we could do
it either way.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.000
Let's do it the other way.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.290
I always do inside and out, but
let's take the derivative of

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:29.130
this entire expression with
respect to x minus y.

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:35.250
Well, that is 2
times x minus y.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.900
And then it's going to be that
times the derivative of x

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.010
minus y with respect to x.

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:45.060
So what the derivative of x
minus y with respect to x?

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:49.110
Well, the derivative of x
with respect to x is just 1.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:51.830
And what's the derivative of--
well, we could say minus

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:53.020
y with respect to x.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.870
Well, it's just minus dy/dx.

00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:00.530
You could say the derivative of
y with respect to y is-- or the

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:03.550
derivative of minus y with
respect to y is minus 1, and

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:05.970
then by the chain rule,
multiply that times by

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:07.620
the derivative of y
with respect to x.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.200
Either way, I think you
get the point, hopefully.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.210
So that's the derivative
of the left-hand side.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:16.540
And now what's the derivative
of the right-hand side?

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.200
Well, we could do the chain
rule or whatever, but, you

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:24.130
know, this is the same thing
as 8y minus 48, right?

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:29.880
So we could rewrite
this is 8y minus 48.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.450
And so, if you take the
derivative of this with

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:35.050
respect to x, the constant
doesn't contribute.

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:37.955
So what's the derivative
of 8y with respect to x?

00:08:37.955 --> 00:08:41.590
Well, it's the derivative of 8y
with respect to y, which is

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:46.970
just 8, and by the chain rule,
times the derivative of 8y with

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:50.290
respect to y times
the derivative of y

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:53.530
with respect to x.

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:57.270
And now, we just
solve for dy/dx.

00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:00.710
Let's see, you get-- and I will
do a different color now.

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:12.910
2x minus 2y times 1 minus
dy/dx is equal to 8 dy/dx.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.290
And then what can we do?

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:18.960
We can distribute this out.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.540
So 2x times this whole thing.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:28.650
So 2x minus 2x dy/dx, right?

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:32.280
That times that, and then
that times that, and

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.320
then this times this.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:40.600
So minus 2y and then minus
minus, or plus, 2y dy/dx.

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.680
And then let's take this
because I want to put all the

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.300
dy/dx terms on the same side,
so let's subtract this from

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:49.310
both sides of the equation.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:56.880
So then we get minus 8
dy/dx is equal to 0.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.870
And then the next step, well,
let's just separate out

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.470
all the dy/dx terms.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:05.450
So that's a dy/dx term,
that's one, that's one.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:08.790
They're easier to spot than
when you write y prime.

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:13.610
So if we take those together
and take out the dy/dx, we get

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:18.140
dy, the derivative of y with
respect to x, times-- let's

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:19.540
see, are any of them positive?

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:20.940
I'll put that one first.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:24.190
2y minus 2x, right?

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.420
That's this one.

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:37.450
Minus 8 and then plus 2x
minus 2y is equal to 0.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:39.140
Let's put these onto
the right-hand side

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.880
of the equation.

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.610
We're almost there.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:53.250
dy/dx times 2y minus 2x minus 8
is equal to 2y minus 2x-- I

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:55.540
just took those and put them on
the right-hand side-- and

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:58.740
now divide both sides by
this, and we are done.

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:10.610
dy/dx is equal to 2y minus
2x, all of that over

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:13.640
2y minus 2x minus 8.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.030
And once again we can divide
the numerator and the

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:17.390
denominator by 2.

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:24.960
So we're left with y minus
x over y minus x minus 8.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:25.850
And we're done.

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:28.840
Hopefully, you found
that helpful.
