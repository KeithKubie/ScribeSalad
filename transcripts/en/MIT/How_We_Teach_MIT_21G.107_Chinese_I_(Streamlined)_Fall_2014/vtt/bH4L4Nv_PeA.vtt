MIN-MIN LIANG: Lingt,
it's an online tool,

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.710
so many teachers use it.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.200
You can record your voice.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.330
You can ask your students
to record a voice.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.220
You can assign the speaking
lessons assignment on that.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.590
It's very convenient, because
everybody has a computer.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.240
You don't need to go
to the lab anymore.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.380
So the tooling is created
by two MIT students.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.640
So when they
started, they want us

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.800
to participate as a guinea pig.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.860
So it was fun.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.850
What I use for this
class, because I discover,

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.990
I usually think in our
class is the time to speak.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.240
I don't like to spend a lot
of time explaining things,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.640
or teach them how
to pronounce words,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.490
because they know the alphabet
part of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.040
already.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.690
So I like them to do with
these mechanic works at home.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.700
And in class they
are well prepared

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.920
and then we talk
about this lesson.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.840
And I realize that giving
them a quiz of this content

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.600
is not enough.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.980
Because I realize
students study, they do.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.290
So they want to do
well in their quiz.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.710
So they read the text,
silently, at home.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.510
So they might know
what it means,

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.520
they don't know how
to pronounce it.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.620
So how do I fix that?

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.730
Because I used to spend
time, ask everybody

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.520
to read one line of the class,
and I encountered this problem.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.460
The kids just-- they can
translate the sentence,

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.380
they cannot say the vocabulary
in Chinese when they read it.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.400
They say I know that word, but I
don't know how to pronounce it.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.710
So I-- that's it dawned on
me that they did prepare,

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.350
but they not reading
out loud at home.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.010
So they don't know how
to pronounce the words.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.320
If you don't know
how to pronounce it,

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.850
you're not learning it.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.160
So I create this-- I
didn't create it, Lingt--

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.240
actual assignment
every new lesson,

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.770
I ask them to read the
textbook and record

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.290
a voice on the Lingt.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.580
Lingt is the web tool.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.410
And send it to me
where I can check.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.580
So I found out
that many students

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.650
want to have a perfect
recording, so they will read

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.810
10 times before they record it--
which is great, because they

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.850
say they memorize the text.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.430
And they know every words,
how to pronounce it.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.830
That's my goal.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.415
So that's how I use it.

00:02:34.415 --> 00:02:38.240
I find that I don't need
to spend more time to check

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.260
do you know how to pronounce
this words anymore,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.010
because they have to do it.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.570
Yeah, so that's how I use.
