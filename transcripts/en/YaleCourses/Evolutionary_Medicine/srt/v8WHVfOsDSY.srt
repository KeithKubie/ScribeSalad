1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:06,620
The third major evolutionary concept
that's useful in evolutionary medicine is

2
00:00:06,751 --> 00:00:07,584
mismatch.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,870
It is a major cause of mal
adaptation or disease. States

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,900
mismatch is often invoked
and it's frequently misused.

5
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:23,520
One has to be careful.
In thinking about causes of mismatch,

6
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,020
there was not a single environment
of evolutionary adaptation.

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,940
Our ancestors had many
different diets and lifestyles,

8
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:39,050
so any argument that invokes an imagined
past to support a favored hypothesis is

9
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:43,680
suspect.
It's biased.

10
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:49,080
The Paleo Diet movement is guilty
of suspect certainty on this point.

11
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,410
However,
mismatches real,

12
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,670
and it occurs in two ways in time.

13
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,450
The environment is changing faster
than the population can adapt.

14
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:05,490
The human examples include the
agricultural revolution, urbanization,

15
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,383
hygiene,

16
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,780
all producing mismatch to
evolve biology and in space.

17
00:01:12,571 --> 00:01:16,260
Organisms can move from environments
where there were well adapted to

18
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:17,580
environments where they're not,

19
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,570
and the human examples would
be migration and immigration.

20
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,980
So let's first consider
mismatches in time.

21
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,720
Our Diet before agriculture
certainly was higher and lean meat,

22
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,560
fruit roots, nuts and seeds and
had less sugar, no refined starch,

23
00:01:37,561 --> 00:01:40,110
less salt,
and there was no milk after weaning.

24
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,660
Our microbiota before hygiene
and antibiotics was more diverse.

25
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:51,250
Almost everyone had worms and our gut
flora was diverse and was often helpful.

26
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,960
Addictive substances and technologies were
rare or absence. There was no tobacco,

27
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,850
alcohol, heroin, or cocaine.
There was no television, email,

28
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,590
Twitter, or Facebook. There
were no horses to ride,

29
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,960
no bicycles,
cars or planes.

30
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,560
So those are all things
that have happened.

31
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:20,230
Some of them quite recently and others
within the last 10 or 20,000 years.

32
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:22,930
Yeah,

33
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,930
there was also more movement
unless sitting around.

34
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,500
So we had a different
diet and we exercise more.

35
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,680
Let's take the example of milk.

36
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,400
This one has been particularly
well investigated.

37
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,580
Evolution takes hundreds of generations
to adjust traits to new conditions.

38
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:48,730
That lag produced a serious mismatches
in our reactions to novel conditions.

39
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,300
What was novel about milk? Well,
lactase persistence in adults,

40
00:02:55,301 --> 00:03:00,301
the ability to digest milk as adults is
something that only happened after the

41
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:05,740
agricultural revolution. Domesticated
dairy, cattle and goats and sheep.

42
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,790
If we look at the selection pressure
that might be required to produce the

43
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:13,900
change,
observe,

44
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:18,700
we can see that a mutation that enabled
the delts to digest lactose and gave

45
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:23,140
them a selective advantage of 5%
which is a big selective advantage,

46
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,500
would take about 8,000 years to increase
when 1% up to 90% in the population.

47
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,120
So that's a theoretical example.
What actually happened,

48
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:35,440
it was a bit more complicated.

49
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,900
There were both local responses to
selection and there was immigration from

50
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:45,901
areas where lactase persistence had
already started to evolve depending on the

51
00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:48,400
region and the level of immigration.

52
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:52,690
The selective advantage of drinking
milk would actually have to have been

53
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:57,490
between about half a percent and 3% to
account for the patterns that we see both

54
00:03:57,491 --> 00:04:00,130
today and in the archaeological record.

55
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,170
Only a few populations
are now 90% tolerance.

56
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,120
So what is the point of that example?

57
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:15,460
The first point is that the current
prevalence of primary lactose tolerance

58
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:20,461
ranges from 95 to 97% in Scandinavia
to zero to 10% in East Asia.

59
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,820
Not everyone on the planet
can digest milk. Is Nettle

60
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:31,410
strong selection and 8,000 years
was not enough to fix the trait.

61
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,180
Now that means that mismatches to
modernity or plausible for many traits,

62
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,730
not just lactose tolerance and adults.

63
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,360
So it gives us an example with a timeline
and a dynamic rate that shows us that

64
00:04:49,391 --> 00:04:52,390
Lee's lags in biology are real

65
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,780
remote.
Ms Masters in space,

66
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,500
well migrants introduced new diseases,

67
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,560
so Columbus is sailors brought syphilis
back to Europe where it was initially

68
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:09,070
highly variant spreading from Naples
and routing the French army that was

69
00:05:09,071 --> 00:05:13,900
invading Italy. Europeans on the
other hand introduced measles,

70
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:17,110
smallpox, bubonic plague,
influenza, typhus,

71
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:20,890
diphtheria and scarlet
fever to the new world.

72
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:22,900
And the Polynesia causing epidemics,

73
00:05:22,901 --> 00:05:27,070
the killed from 20% to
over 90% of the natives.

74
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:32,890
So here is an example of tertiary syphilis
from the immune [inaudible] Olam and

75
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:33,724
Paris.

76
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:39,090
Here is an infant with measles
rash and here is scarlet fever.

77
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,001
Okay,

78
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:45,001
so these are all things that
were moved by migration.

79
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,970
Now immigrants also leaf
pathogens and symbiotes behind.

80
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,860
So when African Americans
came to North America,

81
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:02,150
they continue to suffer from sickle
cell anemia and that has compensating

82
00:06:02,151 --> 00:06:06,650
advantages only when malaria is present.
Also,

83
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:11,060
immigrants that are currently coming
to develop countries suffer from eight

84
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:14,030
Hopis that may be related to
shifts in their microbiomes.

85
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:19,670
International adoptees and children born
in Sweden to foreign born parents used

86
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:23,810
asthma medications three to four times
as often as did foreign born children.

87
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:29,590
So immigration of also involves a switch
in the Microbiota and that cascades

88
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:36,500
through communication with the immune
systems and if the immune system is

89
00:06:36,501 --> 00:06:39,320
mismatched to the Microbiota
are getting the wrong signal,

90
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:44,120
then you can have one of the diseases
that result from immune malfunction.

91
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,820
There is a general lesson in this.

92
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,900
We are adapted to things that
happened frequently in our past.

93
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:59,240
Reproductive success occurs much more
frequently in the young than in the old

94
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,690
and in supportive environments and
then healthy bodies than in threatening

95
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:04,430
environments and in sick bodies.

96
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:09,970
That means that do you the
young are better adapted add

97
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:17,050
that healthy bodies are better
adapted than are sick bodies.

98
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,180
We are adapted to circumstances that
frequently led to reproductive success in

99
00:07:26,181 --> 00:07:27,014
the past.

100
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:30,950
We are not adapted to circumstances
that we did not encounter in the past.

101
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:36,470
So things that happen very frequently
with small effects can accumulate to have

102
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:39,640
large effects. That is another, uh,

103
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,780
thing about the numbers game of evolution.
For example,

104
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:49,640
anything involved in protein synthesis
is going to be very finely adjusted

105
00:07:49,641 --> 00:07:53,810
because that's something that is
going on in every cell in the body.

106
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:57,620
So that by the time
reproduction actually occurs,

107
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:02,980
there has been a history
in that individual organism
of trillions of protein

108
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:08,510
synthesis events that that's something
that can be extremely finally adjusted.

109
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:14,030
We're mismatched or things that happened
rarely or never before. And we are,

110
00:08:14,031 --> 00:08:18,530
we'll matched to things that
happen frequently. So in summary,

111
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,550
although the concept of mismatches
often misused, mismatch is real,

112
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,640
the evolution of lactase persistence
shows that ms masters in time are real.

113
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,440
We are mismatched to conditions that
are encountered rarely or never before.

114
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,970
And we can also be mismatched to things
that happen in other environments,

115
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,290
but not in this one.

116
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:44,630
So migration and immigration
are also sources of mismatch.
