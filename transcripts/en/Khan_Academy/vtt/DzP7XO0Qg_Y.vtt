00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.920
- [Instructor] We are
told the pedigree chart

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.130
represents the inheritance
of color blindness

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:05.650
through three generations.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:06.830
And we see this here.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.600
The standard convention is a square

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.160
is male, circle is female.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.960
If it's colored in, that means
that they exhibit the trait,

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.650
in this case it's color blindness.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.720
So Bill exhibits color blindness.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.530
His phenotype is color blind,

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.800
while Bonnie does not
exhibit color blindness.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.400
Color blindness is an
X-linked recessive trait.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.970
If Barbara is expecting another child,

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.680
so this is Barbara right here,

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.170
what is the probability
that it will be colorblind?

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.870
So pause this video and see if you can

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.890
figure that out on your own.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.040
All right, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.320
So they're asking us about
their next child here.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.220
What is the probability that
it is going to be colorblind?

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.800
And to help us with that,

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.670
we can try to figure out the
genotypes of Tom and Barbara.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.730
So Tom is pretty straightforward.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.360
He is male, we know that
'cause there's a square there.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.400
So X, he has an X chromosome
and he has a Y chromosome.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.800
And color blindness is an
X-linked recessive trait.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.910
And so let me just make
clear what's going on.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.710
So I'll do lowercase C for
colorblind, colorblind.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.780
And I could do a capital
C for the dominant trait,

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.420
which is not colorblind,

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.670
but since they look so similar,

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.780
I'll just use a plus for not colorblind,

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.960
not color, not colorblind.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.210
And so Tom, his phenotype,
he is colorblind,

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.783
and he only has one X chromosome,

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.330
what the colorblind trait is linked to.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.900
And so that must have the
recessive allele right over there.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.730
So this is Tom's genotype.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.090
But what about Barbara?

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.310
Well, we know Barbara's going to have

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.520
two X chromosomes because
Barbara is female.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.100
And we know that both of
them can't be lowercase C

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.860
because then Barbara would
exhibit color blindness,

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.800
but how can we figure
out her actual genotype?

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.670
Well, we could look at her parents.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.750
So Bill over here is going to have

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.200
the same genotype as Tom,

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.410
at least with respect to color blindness.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.400
He is male, so he has an X
chromosome and a Y chromosome.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.300
And because he exhibits color blindness,

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.940
that X chromosome must have the recessive

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.680
colorblind allele associated with it.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.910
Now, Bonnie, we do not know.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.990
She will be XX, will
have two X chromosomes.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.990
Like Barbara, we know that both of these

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.450
can't have the recessive allele

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.150
because then Bonnie would be filled in,

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.990
she would exhibit color blindness.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.160
But we don't know whether she is a carrier

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.840
or whether she isn't.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.840
But let's just think about where

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.370
Barbara got her chromosomes from.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.883
One of her X chromosomes
comes from her father.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.640
And the other one comes from her mother.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.360
So if she got this X
chromosome from her father,

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.860
her father only has one
X chromosome to give,

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.710
the one that has the colorblind allele.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.170
So if this is from her father,

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.800
it must have the colorblind allele here.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.140
And we know that the one from her mother

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.680
does not the colorblind allele

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.480
because if it was like this,

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.950
then Barbara would be
colorblind, and she isn't.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.970
So we know that this must be a plus here.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.750
It is the dominant non-colorblind allele.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.360
And so now we know both of their genotypes

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.730
and we can use those to then figure out

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.530
the possible outcomes for their offspring.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.300
So for example, Tom can contribute

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.620
a X chromosome that has
a colorblind allele,

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.710
or a Y chromosome.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.970
And Barbara, right over here,

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.860
can contribute an X chromosome

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.580
that has the colorblind allele,

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.810
or an X chromosome that has
the non-colorblind allele.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.570
Barbara is a carrier.

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.973
And so let me just draw a
little Punnett square here.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.620
And so we have four possible
outcomes for their children

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.600
and they're all equally likely.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.600
So you can get the X
chromosome from Barbara

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.740
that has the colorblind allele

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.790
and the X chromosome from Tom

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.820
that has the colorblind allele.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.240
You could have the X chromosome

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.880
from Barbara with the colorblind allele,

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.280
and the Y chromosome from Tom.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.030
You could have the
non-colorblind X chromosome

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.300
that does not have the
colorblind allele on it,

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.863
and get the colorblind
X chromosome from Tom.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.490
Or you could have the
non-colorblind X chromosome

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.540
and the Y chromosome from the father.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.050
So there's four equal scenarios.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.850
And so in how many of these scenarios

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.493
is the offspring colorblind?

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.870
Well, here we have a colorblind female.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.050
She has two of the recessive alleles,

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.760
so that female will be colorblind.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.300
This is a female carrier,

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.840
but they will not show the
phenotype of being colorblind.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.430
This over here is a colorblind male,

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.910
has only one X chromosome

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.600
and it has the colorblind allele on it.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.360
And this is a non-colorblind male.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.290
So out of four equal outcomes,

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.760
two of them have the
offspring being colorblind.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.920
So two out of four, that
would be a 50% probability

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.820
that the offspring will be colorblind.
