00:00:00.244 --> 00:00:01.544
- [Voiceover] So let's revisit a scenario

00:00:01.544 --> 00:00:03.100
that we have seen in several videos,

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.285
especially the last video,

00:00:04.285 --> 00:00:07.186
where we tried to find this
neutral frame of reference.

00:00:07.186 --> 00:00:08.626
Let's say we're in spaceship A.

00:00:08.626 --> 00:00:10.902
We are in an inertial frame of reference.

00:00:10.902 --> 00:00:14.012
And let's say right at time equal zero

00:00:14.012 --> 00:00:15.289
in our frame of reference,

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:18.100
spaceship B is exactly where we are,

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.560
but it's traveling in
the positive x-direction

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.766
at eight tenths the speed of light.

00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:24.643
We've already seen that we can overlay

00:00:24.643 --> 00:00:27.084
the spacetime diagrams for each of these

00:00:27.084 --> 00:00:28.501
frames of reference.

00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:32.501
If we do our axes,

00:00:32.501 --> 00:00:34.769
the x is one direction of spacetime

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:37.161
that we associate with
the x-direction of space

00:00:37.161 --> 00:00:39.344
and then the ct, this vertical axis,

00:00:39.344 --> 00:00:41.132
this is another direction of spacetime

00:00:41.132 --> 00:00:44.985
that we perceive as the passage of time.

00:00:44.985 --> 00:00:48.655
Well, you can then overlay
B's frame of reference,

00:00:48.655 --> 00:00:53.655
and you kind of have these skewed axes.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.201
And you could look at a change in time.

00:00:56.201 --> 00:00:57.872
So for example, if you were to compare

00:00:57.872 --> 00:01:01.146
the event right when B passes us up to

00:01:01.146 --> 00:01:04.211
let's say some amount of time later,

00:01:04.211 --> 00:01:07.462
some amount of, so let's
say this right over there

00:01:07.462 --> 00:01:10.179
is the change in ct.

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:11.385
In our frame of reference,

00:01:11.385 --> 00:01:14.637
these two events are happening
at the exact same place.

00:01:14.637 --> 00:01:16.912
They're just separated,
in our frame of reference,

00:01:16.912 --> 00:01:19.675
we would perceive them as
being separated by time.

00:01:19.675 --> 00:01:21.440
But if you want to say, well how much time

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.807
seems to separate these events
in B's frame of reference?

00:01:24.807 --> 00:01:29.217
Well then, you would wanna go
parallel to the x prime axis.

00:01:29.217 --> 00:01:30.718
We're viewing B's frame of reference

00:01:30.718 --> 00:01:32.726
as a primed frame of reference

00:01:32.726 --> 00:01:35.928
and see where we intersect the ct prime,

00:01:35.928 --> 00:01:37.786
the ct prime axis.

00:01:37.786 --> 00:01:39.806
So this is our change in ct

00:01:39.806 --> 00:01:43.545
while this is our change in ct,

00:01:43.545 --> 00:01:46.842
this looks like our change in ct prime.

00:01:46.842 --> 00:01:48.792
And it looks longer
but we have to remember

00:01:48.792 --> 00:01:50.650
that we haven't scaled these things.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.390
And actually the scales change

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.851
depending on the relative velocities.

00:01:55.851 --> 00:01:58.275
But we can actually verify algebraically

00:01:58.275 --> 00:02:00.642
that our change in ct
prime is going to be larger

00:02:00.642 --> 00:02:02.057
than our change in ct.

00:02:02.057 --> 00:02:03.922
And we just have to look
at Lorentz transformations

00:02:03.922 --> 00:02:05.410
to realize that.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.317
So our change in ct prime is going to be

00:02:09.317 --> 00:02:13.590
equal to the Lorentz factor
times our change in ct

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.887
minus beta times our change in x.

00:02:16.887 --> 00:02:18.906
We've seen that multiple times before.

00:02:18.906 --> 00:02:20.463
Well our change in x,

00:02:20.463 --> 00:02:22.180
our change in x is zero.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.946
It looks stationary in
our frame of reference

00:02:23.946 --> 00:02:25.570
so that term is zero.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.100
So our change in ct prime
is going to be equal

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.422
to the Lorentz factor times,

00:02:31.422 --> 00:02:33.210
I don't have to use this
parentheses anymore,

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.063
times our change in ct.

00:02:37.063 --> 00:02:39.410
And our Lorentz factor is
going to be greater than one.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.196
I could actually calculate
that, let's do it.

00:02:41.196 --> 00:02:42.846
So the Lorentz factor,

00:02:42.846 --> 00:02:45.707
the Lorentz factor here.

00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:47.722
So gamma is going to be equal to one

00:02:47.722 --> 00:02:51.694
over the square root of one minus,

00:02:51.694 --> 00:02:56.694
well B's relative velocity so 0.8c

00:02:57.753 --> 00:03:00.841
over the speed of light squared.

00:03:00.841 --> 00:03:02.629
Well what is this going to simplify to?

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:03.697
The c's cancel out.

00:03:03.697 --> 00:03:06.274
0.8 squared is 0.64.

00:03:06.274 --> 00:03:09.268
One minus that is 0.36.

00:03:09.268 --> 00:03:10.198
This is going to be,

00:03:10.198 --> 00:03:11.381
and then you take the square root of that,

00:03:11.381 --> 00:03:14.842
that's going to be one over 0.6

00:03:14.842 --> 00:03:16.839
which is equal to one over six tenths

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:19.578
which is the same thing as 10 over six

00:03:19.578 --> 00:03:23.657
which is equal to the
same thing as five thirds

00:03:23.657 --> 00:03:26.767
which is equal to one and two thirds.

00:03:26.767 --> 00:03:28.625
So you can see our change in ct prime

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:30.157
is going to be one and two thirds

00:03:30.157 --> 00:03:32.387
times the change in ct.

00:03:32.387 --> 00:03:33.362
Now you might wanna just say,

00:03:33.362 --> 00:03:35.684
well do these two look
like one and two thirds?

00:03:35.684 --> 00:03:37.263
And it might look a little bit like that

00:03:37.263 --> 00:03:38.702
the way I draw it, but you can't just

00:03:38.702 --> 00:03:40.514
look at it purely on,

00:03:40.514 --> 00:03:42.302
you can't just take a
ruler for this length

00:03:42.302 --> 00:03:43.370
and a ruler for this length

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.924
because the scales are different

00:03:44.924 --> 00:03:46.689
and I haven't marked off the scales.

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:48.709
Well this at least helps us visualize.

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.263
But let's think about
the other way around.

00:03:52.263 --> 00:03:55.977
Let's imagine the change in ct prime

00:03:55.977 --> 00:03:58.590
between right where the spaceships pass by

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.925
and a little bit later.

00:03:59.925 --> 00:04:01.318
Now, I'll do this in a different color

00:04:01.318 --> 00:04:04.615
'cause this is actually a
different event in spacetime

00:04:04.615 --> 00:04:07.657
than the one that we were
focusing on right now.

00:04:07.657 --> 00:04:10.188
And we're gonna be viewing it
from B's frame of reference

00:04:10.188 --> 00:04:13.369
so that's our change in ct prime.

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:16.131
But what is going to be our change in ct?

00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:17.153
Well, to think about it,

00:04:17.153 --> 00:04:20.451
we could go parallel to the x-axis,

00:04:20.451 --> 00:04:23.701
the x-axis right over
there, so you'll parallel,

00:04:23.701 --> 00:04:27.904
parallel to the x-axis and
you get right over there

00:04:27.904 --> 00:04:30.226
and so our change in ct

00:04:30.226 --> 00:04:31.921
looks like it's more.

00:04:31.921 --> 00:04:34.057
And once again, we can
algebraically verify it

00:04:34.057 --> 00:04:35.797
by really doing the same thing.

00:04:35.797 --> 00:04:40.650
Our change in ct is going
to be equal to gamma

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.692
times our change in ct prime

00:04:43.692 --> 00:04:48.127
minus beta times delta x prime.

00:04:48.127 --> 00:04:49.242
And if you were to actually,

00:04:49.242 --> 00:04:51.517
if we actually did have
a change in x prime here,

00:04:51.517 --> 00:04:53.815
the beta, the velocity now
has a different direction

00:04:53.815 --> 00:04:55.163
so it would all be the negative

00:04:55.163 --> 00:04:57.763
but our change in x prime
from B's point of view,

00:04:57.763 --> 00:05:00.318
these two events are
happening in the same place

00:05:00.318 --> 00:05:02.663
so our change in x prime is zero.

00:05:02.663 --> 00:05:07.663
So you have change in ct is
equal to gamma times change,

00:05:08.072 --> 00:05:09.628
once again I don't need my parentheses,

00:05:09.628 --> 00:05:12.600
times change in ct prime.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.458
And it's going to be the same gamma

00:05:14.458 --> 00:05:16.431
because remember, we're taking v over c

00:05:16.431 --> 00:05:18.080
and so whether it's
either v or negative v,

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.170
when you square it, it gets the same value

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.837
so once again, gamma is going
to be one and two thirds.

00:05:23.837 --> 00:05:26.670
So it's going to be one and two thirds.

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.574
So it seems a little bit strange.

00:05:28.574 --> 00:05:30.177
You know, I have some passage of time

00:05:30.177 --> 00:05:31.895
in my frame of reference where it looks,

00:05:31.895 --> 00:05:33.381
you know, it's something
that looks stationary,

00:05:33.381 --> 00:05:34.542
two events that look
like they're happening

00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:37.026
in the same place but one after another.

00:05:37.026 --> 00:05:38.722
It looks like their change in time,

00:05:38.722 --> 00:05:41.461
it takes longer for those
two events to happen

00:05:41.461 --> 00:05:44.920
in the ct prime in the
moving frame of reference.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.574
But then, if we have some event

00:05:47.574 --> 00:05:49.704
that looks stationary in
B's frame of reference

00:05:49.704 --> 00:05:52.211
and they're separated
by a change in ct prime,

00:05:52.211 --> 00:05:55.625
it looks like the change in
ct between those two events

00:05:55.625 --> 00:05:57.134
is even larger.

00:05:57.134 --> 00:06:00.503
So it looks like this
somewhat bizarre phenomenon.

00:06:00.503 --> 00:06:02.382
And to help us reconcile these

00:06:02.382 --> 00:06:03.890
and to visualize a little bit better,

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.746
actually even to be able
to put ct and ct prime

00:06:07.746 --> 00:06:10.020
on the same scale,

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.575
we can look for this
neutral frame of reference

00:06:12.575 --> 00:06:15.361
which we did in actually
the last video I made.

00:06:15.361 --> 00:06:17.149
I don't know if it's the
last video you've seen.

00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:19.262
Or we could say look, if A and B

00:06:19.262 --> 00:06:22.256
are travelling with a
relative velocity of 0.8

00:06:22.256 --> 00:06:23.906
times of the speed of light
relative to each other,

00:06:23.906 --> 00:06:26.832
B is travelling 0.8c in
the positive x direction

00:06:26.832 --> 00:06:28.968
relative to a stationary A

00:06:28.968 --> 00:06:33.937
or A is travelling 0.8c in
the negative x direction

00:06:33.937 --> 00:06:35.608
relative to a stationary B.

00:06:35.608 --> 00:06:38.092
You can find a frame of reference

00:06:38.092 --> 00:06:40.693
where A and B were in
that frame of reference

00:06:40.693 --> 00:06:42.667
to a stationary observer
in that frame of reference,

00:06:42.667 --> 00:06:44.896
A and B are both travelling outwards

00:06:44.896 --> 00:06:46.614
at half the speed of light.

00:06:46.614 --> 00:06:47.797
And we figured that out where we

00:06:47.797 --> 00:06:50.560
did those videos on a
neutral frame of reference.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.721
And what's neat about that

00:06:51.721 --> 00:06:55.786
is if you make what looks like
a Minkowski spacetime diagram

00:06:55.786 --> 00:06:57.741
in that neutral frame of reference

00:06:57.741 --> 00:07:01.267
then the ct and ct prime, A
and B's frame of references,

00:07:01.267 --> 00:07:04.637
get equally skewed to the, you know,

00:07:04.637 --> 00:07:07.093
if you think about the time
axis to the left and the right.

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:09.252
And since they're equally skewed,

00:07:09.252 --> 00:07:12.805
the time dilation relative
to this rest frame

00:07:12.805 --> 00:07:15.545
is the scaling is going to be the same.

00:07:15.545 --> 00:07:18.261
So we could put both of these on,

00:07:18.261 --> 00:07:20.374
both of these on the same scale.

00:07:20.374 --> 00:07:23.672
And you could see that this
neutral frame of reference,

00:07:23.672 --> 00:07:26.319
this ct prime prime frame of reference,

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:27.503
I drew them over here,

00:07:27.503 --> 00:07:30.127
that if you look at either of
A or B's frame of reference,

00:07:30.127 --> 00:07:31.658
they're going to be in between

00:07:31.658 --> 00:07:33.121
A and B's frame of reference.

00:07:33.121 --> 00:07:34.422
But here it's the neutral one.

00:07:34.422 --> 00:07:36.244
It's the one where we're drawing the time

00:07:36.244 --> 00:07:38.392
or we're drawing the two
axes being perpendicular

00:07:38.392 --> 00:07:39.391
to each other.

00:07:39.391 --> 00:07:41.434
And now if you look at these two events,

00:07:41.434 --> 00:07:43.035
so if you look at this first event,

00:07:43.035 --> 00:07:45.103
where you have our delta ct,

00:07:45.103 --> 00:07:47.750
so you look at this first event

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:50.722
where you have a delta in ct between

00:07:50.722 --> 00:07:53.137
right when the spaceships
pass and right over there.

00:07:53.137 --> 00:07:54.739
You see that if you were to look at that,

00:07:54.739 --> 00:07:57.710
if you were to look at
the ct prime coordinate

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:01.750
for that event, when you go
parallel to the x prime axis,

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:03.654
you get right over there.

00:08:03.654 --> 00:08:08.182
So this is, that is
your change in ct prime.

00:08:08.182 --> 00:08:11.223
And likewise, if you have that other event

00:08:11.223 --> 00:08:14.475
that I drew in that blue-green
color, right over here.

00:08:14.475 --> 00:08:17.191
And this is your change in ct prime.

00:08:17.191 --> 00:08:20.000
This is your change in ct prime,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.181
well then if you think of it
from A's frame of reference,

00:08:23.181 --> 00:08:25.736
well we just follow the
x-axis not the x prime.

00:08:25.736 --> 00:08:27.106
We go parallel to it.

00:08:27.106 --> 00:08:29.312
We end up right over there.

00:08:29.312 --> 00:08:31.493
Now what's really interesting about this,

00:08:31.493 --> 00:08:33.385
what's really interesting about this

00:08:33.385 --> 00:08:36.951
is from A's frame of reference,

00:08:36.951 --> 00:08:40.038
the yellow event happens
before the blue event.

00:08:40.038 --> 00:08:43.499
But in B's frame of
reference, the blue event

00:08:43.499 --> 00:08:45.728
happens before the yellow event.

00:08:45.728 --> 00:08:48.467
So really, really, really
fascinating things going on

00:08:48.467 --> 00:08:50.255
but what I really like about this diagram

00:08:50.255 --> 00:08:52.623
is that A and B's frame of reference

00:08:52.623 --> 00:08:53.993
are going to have the same scale

00:08:53.993 --> 00:08:56.902
since they're both equally
skewed to the left and the right

00:08:56.902 --> 00:08:58.382
if we're thinking about the time axis.

00:08:58.382 --> 00:09:01.492
And this type of diagram
is called a Loedel diagram.

00:09:01.492 --> 00:09:04.790
Loedel, Loedel diagram which is really

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:07.461
a variation of a Minkowski diagram

00:09:07.461 --> 00:09:10.339
but it lets us really
appreciate the symmetry

00:09:10.339 --> 00:09:12.887
between these frames of reference.
