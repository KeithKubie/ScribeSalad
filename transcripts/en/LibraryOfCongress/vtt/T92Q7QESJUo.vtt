00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of Congress
in Washington, D.C.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:14.520
[ Pause ]

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.320
&gt;&gt; We have a special guest
with us tonight Sam Wineburg.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.970 position:61%
And I'm going to turn things over to
the director of education outreach here

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.600 position:69%
at the Library of Congress Lee Ann Potter
to welcome you and to introduce our speaker.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.480
&gt;&gt; Thanks very much, Cathy.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.980 position:73%
As Cathy said, we really are so glad all of you
could join us this evening for this the Library

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.270 position:59%
of Congress's first online conference.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.230 position:64%
It is my pleasure to be serving as the MC

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.290
for this session entitled
"Reading Like a Historian."

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.110
During this session for about
the next 50 minutes,

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.780 position:72%
we will explore the Stanford history education
group's reading like a historian curriculum

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.730
and the research behind this
free online resource.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.340 position:61%
You will have an opportunity to examine
a sample lesson plan and consider how

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.490 position:73%
to implement these materials in your classroom.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.640
I'm really pleased to introduce
a good friend Sam Wineburg.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.050 position:58%
Sam is the Margaret Jacks professor
of education and professor of history

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.250
by courtesy at Stanford University.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.700 position:72%
He leads the Stanford history education group,
the teaching with primary sources program

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.400
at Stanford University, Stanford's
Ph.D. program in history education,

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.040
and the master's program
for future history teachers.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.550 position:69%
His scholarship has been featured in the New
York Times, the Washington Post, USA Today,

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.230 position:70%
the New Yorker, as well as on NPR and C-SPAN.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.890
Delighted to have you here, Sam.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.400
Let's get started.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.630 position:63%
&gt;&gt; My name is Sam Wineburg and thank you
very much Lee Ann for the introduction.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.950
And Cathy for setting this up.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.060
And welcome to all of you who
are joining in here today.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.820
I want to spend the next hour with
you or so, with time for questions,

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.140
talking about the question
of historical literacy.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.420
What it is and what it is not.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.230
And I want to begin actually by
telling you about a textbook.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.860 position:59%
A textbook called "Our Virginia" which
was published and went into classrooms

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.470 position:69%
in the state of Virginia in October of 2010.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.720 position:58%
Now, this is a -- a textbook that was
intend for fifth graders and in it --

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.580 position:58%
in the story that it tells about the
Civil War it contains this statement.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.320
Thousands of southern blacks
fought in the confederate ranks,

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.020 position:56%
including two black battalions under
the command of Stonewall Jackson.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.350 position:67%
Now, if you know a little bit about your --

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.100
your Civil War history, you might
be a bit surprised by this claim.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.490 position:64%
If you know about the role, for instance,
of African-Americans in the Civil War.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.760 position:75%
You might know if you've seen the movie "Glory."

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.360
The story of the Massachusetts 54th

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.570
which was the first black
division to join the union ranks.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:19.410
It was a -- a topic of considerable
debate among union soldiers.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:26.640 position:70%
By the end of the civil war, there were about
180,000 African-Americans who were suited

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.990 position:58%
up in -- for the forces of the union.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.330 position:69%
But the notion of southern blacks fighting
for the confederates under Stonewall Jackson

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.930
that might be a claim that
you're unfamiliar with.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.840 position:59%
Now, if we look at this claim, we know

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.150
that Thomas Stonewall Jackson
actually died on May 10th 1863.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.940
He was killed by friendly fire.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.630 position:58%
So, this is still right near the apex
of the fighting in the civil war.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.010
The tide has not yet quite turned.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.620
And if there are two black
battalions under Stonewall Jackson,

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.080
we can imagine that there were
many other under other generals.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.010
And if we do our math, well, two --

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.780
two battalions that means
a whole bunch of regiments.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:17.790 position:73%
It means -- it means tens of thousands of
African-Americans who were suited up in uniform

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:25.220 position:64%
under the command of Stonewall Jackson
essentially fighting for the confederacy.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.390 position:58%
So, here's -- here's what we do know.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.290
We do know, of course, that
there were African-Americans,

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.390
slaves often who had no choice.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:42.560 position:58%
Who were brought into the confederate
army as cooks or as laborers.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.910 position:73%
We even know of cases and we can find them
documented sometimes with photographic evidence

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:56.980 position:73%
of slaves who were suited up and accompanied
-- often under duress, often forced and pressed

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.180
into service -- who accompanied
their masters into battle.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:07.590 position:66%
So, here is a picture of one of the -- the
pictures that we have of a case like that.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.250
But that's not quite what we're
talking about with this claim.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:18.920 position:66%
We are talking about the -- the historical
basis of a claim that there were thousands

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:25.370 position:70%
of African-Americans who were armed who
actually fought on behalf of the confederacy.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.700
And we can ask, what exactly
were they fighting for?

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.460 position:63%
Fighting for the right to remain slaves?

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.770
I mean, it becomes a bit ludicrous.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:39.200
Fighting for the right to have
their children go into slavery?

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.520
I mean, the -- the very claim
strains the imagination.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:51.770 position:72%
Now, when we look at the documentary evidence
for this claim, when we look in the vast trove

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:59.850 position:70%
of documents that constitutes the documentary
record, the only documentary evidence we have

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:06.700 position:67%
of the notion of bringing African-Americans
and suiting them up and arming them

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:11.710
for the confederacy is general
orders, number 14.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:18.560 position:63%
And you can see from -- from this in the
section that is highlighted in yellow.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:30.260
[pause] And you'll also note the
date of this particular document.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:35.370
Which is March 23red 1865.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:39.540
Now, this is in the waning
days of the civil war.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.450 position:56%
It's clear that the south is losing.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.510
It's just a matter of time
before general Lee decides

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.000
that he will sign the surrender
-- the surrender of orders.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.550
In fact, this is less than a
month away from the signing

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:59.100
of those surrender orders on
April 9th 1865 at Appomattox.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.470
This is the only document that
we have of African-American --

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:09.450 position:70%
of the talk of the confederacy drafting
African-American soldiers and suiting them up

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.680 position:67%
and giving them arms and actually fighting.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:20.970 position:73%
So, the question becomes, In this textbook that
was given to children in the state of Virginia,

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:27.040
where did the author find the
basis for the claim that she makes?

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:32.810 position:70%
And when she was asked about it by a reporter
for The Washington Post she responded,

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:37.830
As controversial as it is,
I stand by what I write.

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:43.430 position:69%
I am a fairly respected author -- excuse me.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:46.320
I am a fairly respected writer.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.480 position:58%
And this is how the author responded.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:56.440 position:58%
Now, the Washington Post reporter
actually pressed on and tried to find

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:04.040
out on what basis did -- did
Miss Masoff make these claims

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.900 position:56%
that there were organized regiments,
that there were hundreds --

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:13.070 position:70%
that were 50 to 60,000 African-American
soldiers fighting on behalf of the civil war.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:18.890 position:64%
When she was asked how she would
document this claim, she said that she --

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:24.590
she reported that she did
her research on the internet.

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:28.510
And when she was asked where she
went to find her information,

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:32.460 position:59%
she pointed reporters to this website.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:39.450
The sons of confederate veterans,
which is a patriotic, historical,

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:46.180 position:63%
educational institution founded in 1896,
dedicated to honoring the sacrifices

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:52.090
of the confederate soldier and
to preserving southern culture.

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:58.870 position:64%
This is the situation that we face today.

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:04.920 position:66%
And I am sure that many of you are facing
situations where your students come to you

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:09.950
and say, well, I Googled it and
I found this on the internet.

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:16.350
Now, when I grew up -- and I'm
sure when many of you grew up --

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:20.760 position:69%
before historical information reached us, it
had actually been vetted through the hands

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:27.800 position:67%
of subject matter experts and publishers
and newspaper editors and the various kinds

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:32.130
of people who checked information
before it reached our hands.

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:38.810
But we are actually living in a
time when those kinds of skills

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:44.680 position:66%
of vetting information actually fall on
the shoulders of each and every one of us.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:52.130 position:72%
I don't think that -- that the author of this
textbook is all together different from the --

00:09:52.130 --> 00:10:01.250 position:64%
from facing the kinds of dilemmas that we
face in a totally new digital wild west.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:05.950
Now, I want to return to this
question of historical literacy.

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:12.000 position:67%
Because for many people -- for many people,
the notion of historical literacy at least

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:22.110
as it is taught in schools
resembles something like this.

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:29.140 position:72%
[pause] Now, this actually is an artifact from
a real middle school social studies classroom.

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:31.230
I am not going to tell you where.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:35.100
I am going to tell you that
it is cut off at 28 items.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.720
It actually goes to 50.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:43.740 position:70%
And the way that this classroom went was that
on Monday the teacher would hand out a list

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.100 position:61%
of terms to the middle school students.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.440
And on Friday they would
have a quiz on these terms.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.120
And I happened to be visiting
this classroom to try

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:59.440 position:72%
to understand what does social studies class
look like through the eyes of seventh graders.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:03.970 position:66%
And so I kind of went up to one table
where there were a group of girls working.

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:05.250
They were all girls.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:06.770 position:58%
And I said, well, what are you doing?

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:10.060
And they said, we are studying
for our Friday quiz.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:17.060 position:75%
And so I asked them if I could peer at this list
that went from acropolis to crusades to czar

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:22.800
to diaspora to ethics and feudalism
and to filial piety, et cetera.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:27.570
And I said to the young girls -- I
said, well, what exactly is this?

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:30.580
And they kind of grumbled
and laughed to each other.

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:38.660 position:66%
And then one of the little girls whispered
to me and said, sir, it's traxoline.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.300
And I said, excuse me?

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:46.230
And she said, sir, it's traxoline.

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:50.370 position:56%
Now, I wonder how many of you who
are listening to me today would find

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:52.320
that answer a little bit quizzical.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.510
What --

00:11:53.510 --> 00:12:05.040
[ Pause ]

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:05.400
What --

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.690
&gt;&gt; Okay. This is Cathy.

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:08.720
I'm sorry to interrupt, Sam.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:14.120 position:59%
I'm sorry to interrupt but we had some
audio issues and now you're back on.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.310
So, I'm going to -- I'm going
to mute myself again.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:17.320
Thank you.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.580
&gt;&gt; I apologize.

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:20.800
What is traxoline?

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:26.610 position:66%
Well, let me ask you if you can -- if you
can respond to that because I didn't know.

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:34.030 position:70%
And so in order for you to essentially test
you as really good students of social studies

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:41.990 position:70%
in the eyes of this young girl, I am going to
now teach you a short lesson about traxoline.

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:44.200
So, is everyone ready?

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:48.440
Okay. Pay close attention.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:54.230
It is very important that
you learn about traxoline.

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:58.300
Traxoline is a new form of zionter.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.910
It is montilled in Ceristana.

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:05.300
There's Ceristanians gristerlate
large amounts of fevron

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.900 position:63%
and then bracter it to quasel traxoline.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:13.390
Traxoline is important because
of our zionter lesidge.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:15.230
Okay, folks.

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:18.000
Let me ask you this and you
can type your answer.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.990
What is traxoline?

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:21.510
I'll wait a second.

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:35.040
[ Pause ]

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:39.090 position:61%
Indeed, traxoline is a form of zionter.

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:40.600
Thank you very much.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.640
Now, the questions are going
to get a little bit harder.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:48.600
Where is traxoline montilled?

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.750
[pause] Unbelievable.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.020
I'm looking at your answers.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.240
You're doing great.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.890
Ceristana, absolutely correct.

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:02.600 position:59%
However, those of you who are familiar

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:07.500
with Bloom's taxonomy should be
ready for a higher-order question.

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:11.720
A question that requires some
application and some synthesis.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.140
And now I'm going to ask you a
question about where you're going

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.670 position:59%
to have to make a bit of an inference.

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:20.200
Why is traxoline important?

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:24.930
I'll wait.

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:28.250
Put your thinking caps on.

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:29.500
There we go.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.790
Because of our zionter lesidge.

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:40.490 position:58%
Now, this was the situation that this
young 11-year-old explained to me.

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:44.840
This is -- this is how she
described the kind of meaning --

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.260
the meanings of the words
in her social studies class.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:54.290 position:61%
The words serf and hajj and schism and
heretic and plebeian and oligarchy made

00:14:54.290 --> 00:15:02.300
about as much sense as traxoline,
gristerlate, zionter, and lesidge.

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:11.840 position:59%
This notion of -- of disembodied facts
that kids can define unfortunately

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:17.640
in many ways still defines our
ideas about historical literacy.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:24.180 position:73%
And we need to go no farther than the headlines
of our major newspapers when a new study

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.300 position:56%
about student's knowledge comes out.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:31.080 position:63%
This one is actually from May 12th 2002.

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.410 position:58%
Kids get an abysmal grade in history.

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:37.400 position:67%
High school seniors don't know basic facts.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:40.740
And actually if we were to
go nearly 10 years later,

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:44.840 position:75%
we could read virtually the same exact headline.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:49.150 position:75%
Students stumble again on the basics of history.

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.940 position:56%
National test shows little progress.

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:58.140 position:56%
And we will get exactly the same
headlines in the 2014 administration

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:01.410
of the national assessment
of educational progress.

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:07.250 position:67%
Over and over again we talk about the
dismal or abysmal knowledge of our student.

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:14.740 position:73%
That, if we go back to the first large scale
test of historical facts which was done in 1917

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:19.030
in Texas where less than 10% of
the population actually went --

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:24.780 position:56%
made it to high school, we will hear
the same kinds of complaints then.

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:27.170 position:58%
But let's change course a little bit.

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:32.000
Let's talk about the assumptions
behind these kinds of headlines

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.800 position:59%
and the assumptions behind the kinds
of tests that we give to young people.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.120
So, what is the assumption?

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:44.060
The assumption is that if kids
had lots of names and dates.

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:51.320 position:73%
If they were historically literate, if you
will, they would be able to think historically.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:57.080 position:75%
And so I want to talk about this assumption for
a second with you by recounting a bit of history

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.140 position:64%
that you may or may not be familiar with.

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:04.350
So, let's go to the dawn
of the American revolution.

00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:06.340
A very famous event.

00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:08.200
The shot heard 'round the world.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.670
The battle of Lexington.

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:15.440
April 19th 1775.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:22.300 position:58%
Take a look at this picture and think
about how you would describe some

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:23.510
of the things that you see in it.

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:37.320
[ Pause ]

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:40.110
What is it that you notice?

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:16.290 position:69%
Now, if you compare this painting to another
image -- I'm seeing some of your answers.

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:18.500
Lots of smoke.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:19.380
People who are injured.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.440
A defiant man.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:25.410
Someone is interpreting the
-- the minute man in the front

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:28.530 position:70%
with an outstretched arm as saying something.

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:29.530
Who knows what he's saying.

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:31.200
We don't have a tape recording.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.960
Maybe saying, our colors don't run.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.340 position:66%
Well, that would be an anachronistic since
we didn't have colors yet at that point.

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:40.460
These men still saw themselves
as British subjects.

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:44.280
Let me give you another rendition
of this same event.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:48.530
A different illustration of it.

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:50.510
What do you see in this picture?

00:18:50.510 --> 00:19:14.660
[ Pause ]

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.550
Now, one of the questions we would
want to ask -- and I'm -- I'm --

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:22.520 position:69%
I'll read aloud some of the answers that
you're seeing in your -- in your chat boxes.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.500
The colonists are victims.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.930
This is a slaughter.

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:29.080 position:56%
This is not the battle of Lexington.

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.850
This is the massacre at Lexington.

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:35.590 position:64%
In fact, if you were to take a magnifying
glass to this second illustration

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:38.770
which was actually a wood
cut done about -- done --

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:46.320 position:69%
a lithograph done by amos doolittle about a
month after the actual battle in -- in 1775.

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.110 position:61%
If you took a magnifying glass -- at --

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:50.620 position:58%
of it, you would see not a single one

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:55.630 position:59%
of the minute men actually holding a
firearm and taking aim at the British.

00:19:55.630 --> 00:20:00.770
They are all hastily beating a
retreat from the battlefield.

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:03.730
Now, how do we know what is true?

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:08.650
What -- what -- how would we
-- here we are probably one

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:11.540 position:73%
of the most -- the shot heard 'round the world.

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:13.420
Two different illustrations.

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:17.100 position:75%
We might want to ask, what are the circumstances
of each one of these illustrations?

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:20.040 position:67%
I'll go back to the first one for a second.

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:25.190
This picture was actually done in
1886 for very different purposes.

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:29.730
And this was done in 1775 for
also very different purposes.

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:34.740
And yet when we commemorate
ourselves as a people that --

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:40.990 position:70%
and we choose an illustration to commemorate
this event actually 150 years after the event

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:44.550
with a U.S. postage stamp -- it is
not this one that we choose to put

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:47.330 position:56%
on the postage stamp but the former.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:54.590 position:66%
This is the way that we choose as a people
to represent ourselves to ourselves.

00:20:54.590 --> 00:21:00.030
But immediately we are thrown
into the abyss of historiography.

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:02.870 position:64%
How do we know what happened in the past?

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:04.580 position:56%
Here are two different perspectives.

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:09.020 position:63%
We can get a variety of original sources
that disagree about what happened.

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:14.180 position:61%
Was this a group of colonists standing
tall representing what would become the

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:15.180
American spirit?

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:21.540
Or were these a group of very
scared British subjects getting off

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:23.890 position:70%
of the Lexington green as soon as they could?

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:27.160
As soon as firing started?

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:34.740 position:70%
Now, I wanted to actually look at how some
of the successes of our educational system --

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:41.700 position:75%
not the students who do poorly on these factual
tests but students who do quite well do on them.

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:47.160 position:61%
And so I selected a group of students
who had completed an AP history course,

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:53.390 position:59%
had very high reading scores on the
SAT, who knew a great deal of history.

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:56.870 position:70%
And I compared them to a group of historians.

00:21:56.870 --> 00:22:04.530 position:73%
And I am here to tell you, as a kind of example
of what research and education is all about,

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:11.690 position:59%
the chief finding of this research was
that the historians did much better

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:16.730
on this task adjudicating among
these two different paintings.

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:20.300
Looking and ferreting out
the discrepancies among seven

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:23.540
or eight fragmented primary sources
many of them which you can find

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:25.750 position:63%
in the Library of Congress's collection.

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:32.160 position:66%
The historians did much better in
creating a sound historical interpretation

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:38.290
than the high school students.

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:42.100
Now, if I could see the facial
reaction of many of you,

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:45.960 position:66%
some of you might be scratching your head.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.650 position:56%
You might be saying to yourself, um.

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:52.470
Okay. The historians did better.

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:56.490 position:72%
Um. So, that's -- that's what you want to say?

00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:59.120
The historians did better?

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:06.220 position:69%
Now, if you are quizzical and you are asking
yourself that question, then I would ask you

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:11.620
to answer the question, why do you
think the historians did better?

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:16.690 position:59%
And you might respond by saying, well,

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:21.030
the historians did better
because they're historians.

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:25.100 position:64%
After all, they're -- they're historians.

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:32.180 position:72%
Well, if you have taken a college philosophy
course, philosophy 101, you know the statement

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:37.290 position:63%
that historians did better because they
are historians is what philosophers call

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:38.440
a tautology.

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:44.850 position:59%
It's like saying sleeping pills work
because of their dormative properties.

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:50.720
It is a case of circular reasoning.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:56.260 position:66%
You -- you might then say that historians
did better because they're better readers.

00:23:56.260 --> 00:24:02.140 position:61%
Well, again, I took really the cream of
the cream of our high school students.

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:06.340 position:59%
You might say that historians do
better because they know more history.

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:10.120 position:67%
That's -- that's sort of what defines them.

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.190
Well, here's what I did.

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:15.480
Here's the wrinkle that I threw
into this -- this little project.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:19.030
I gave a quiz to historians.

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:22.200
Questions from the chapter review
tests at that point of "Rise

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.440 position:58%
of the American nation," Todd, Curti.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:27.780 position:67%
It was reading -- U.S. history textbook for
the eleventh grade when I did this work.

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:30.920
And here are some of the kinds
of facts that were on this quiz.

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:36.560 position:56%
Virtual representation, olive branch
petition, identify George Grenville,

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:40.780
internal versus external
taxation, the Quebec act.

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:45.210
And I chose only dumb historians.

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:49.400 position:58%
I choose -- chose historians who were
not specialists in American history.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:53.420 position:69%
And I chose students who had done very well.

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:58.980 position:66%
In fact, had earned a grade of three and
above on the AP U.S. history exam who were

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:05.030 position:63%
in many ways the poster children for
the successes of our educational system.

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:09.620 position:66%
Now, what I want to suggest to you that --

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:15.960 position:72%
is that when the historians and the high
school students looked at the original sources

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:21.220
that I used they saw profoundly
different things.

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:26.090
And I further want to argue that
it was not an issue really of --

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:30.490
of reading level or of knowing
different vocabulary.

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:35.440
It was the very approach to
what a historical text is.

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:41.080 position:69%
And let me see if I can -- I can demonstrate
that to you by letting you look at the one

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.260
of the primary sources that
I used which you will find

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:45.120 position:63%
in the library of congress's collection.

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:51.080 position:73%
So, I'm going to make it the next slide and ask
you to spend a minute looking at it as a piece

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.700 position:58%
of primary evidence about this event.

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:58.610 position:59%
But as you're looking at it, please,
monitor kind of the way that you read.

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:00.820 position:61%
The way that you approach the document.

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:02.240
What's the first thing that you do?

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.440
What do you attend to?

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:06.860 position:56%
So, I'm going to flash it up and I
want you to kind of be bifocal here.

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:11.890 position:67%
Look at the content but also try to reflect
on your own approach to this document.

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:14.050
Okay. Are we ready?

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.510
Here it is.

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:53.120
[ Pause ]

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:56.760
Okay. We ready?

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.250
All right.

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:03.730 position:66%
So, let me -- let me -- I want to kind of
model for you how one of these students --

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:07.070
very good, very good students --
how they approached this document.

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:10.240 position:64%
So, I'm going to read a little bit aloud.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:14.600
And -- and -- and I use a
technique called thinking aloud

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.310
where people articulate their
thoughts during the act of reading.

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:21.350 position:59%
So, let me try to model how one of the
17 year olds -- we'll call her Ellen.

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:23.530 position:69%
How she -- how she approached this document.

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:24.980
So, she began, 19.

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:28.690 position:70%
At 2:00 o'clock, we began our march by wading
through a very long ford up to our middle.

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:29.460
She stops.

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:32.410 position:56%
She says a -- a -- a very long ford.

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:34.100
I don't know what ford means.

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:36.600
Clearly, it's not an automobile.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:41.710 position:66%
But we -- wading means going through water
and up to our middle so maybe it's some --

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:44.500 position:63%
a forward is some kind of body of water.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:48.420 position:66%
For those of you who work with adolescents
all day long and perhaps some of you work

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:53.130 position:66%
with struggling leaders or English
language learners, you know that that kind

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:57.940 position:56%
of meta cognition, the ability to
step back and infer a word's meaning

00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:05.160 position:75%
from context is an extremely sophisticated skill
that characterizes the reading armamentarium

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:08.050
of our best students, our best
reading comprehenders [phonetic].

00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:08.780
She then goes on.

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:11.660 position:64%
After going a few miles, three or four
people were going out to get intelligence

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:14.600
about five miles out of town called
Lexington which lay on a road.

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.010 position:69%
We heard there were some hundreds of people.

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:17.440 position:58%
She starts, we heard there were some.

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:21.430
And she says, it -- it sounds
like it was a chaotic situation.

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:24.330 position:59%
She -- she continues to read, I
believe three -- two to three hundred.

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:25.790
She says, see.

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:26.860
Yes, it was chaotic.

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:31.070 position:70%
Those of you who were familiar with a reading
technique called "reciprocal teaching" know

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:36.080 position:73%
that at the heart of reciprocal teaching is
developing students' meta cognition and the use

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:37.830 position:61%
of prediction in the course of reading.

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:42.050
So, she actually predicts and
then confirms what she reads.

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:45.230 position:70%
So, again very, very able reading strategies.

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:46.960
She continues to read.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:47.740
Gets near the bottom.

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:49.560
We then formed on the common
but with some difficult.

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:50.450
And she says, see.

00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:54.030 position:61%
I -- I see a chaotic image in our mind.

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:56.120 position:73%
The men were so wild they could hear no orders.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:59.530
Again, a confirmation of the kind
of picture that she's developing.

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:02.590 position:63%
We waited a considerable time there and
at length proceed on our way to Concord.

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:07.950
And then she'll say entry to April
19th from the [inaudible] Barker.

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:16.680 position:73%
This is an extremely sophisticated reading with
a lot of antiquated vocabulary by a 17-year-old

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:22.150 position:59%
who has the kind of reading skills
that we wish for many of our students.

00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:27.270 position:66%
She actually went on to a very prestigious
four-year college and had a lot to go on.

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:34.530 position:67%
Now, I want to suggest by showing you the
reading of a historian Fred, a medievalist,

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:40.250 position:75%
who -- who, you know, was -- didn't do too good.

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:41.070
Didn't too well.

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:42.330
Excuse my English.

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:46.940
A -- a pretest on the olive branch
petition and George grenville.

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:48.470
He's a -- a medievalist.

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:49.700
We can give him a little slack.

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:54.380 position:59%
He -- maybe hasn't made his way all
the way up to the American revolution.

00:29:54.380 --> 00:30:00.760 position:73%
This medievalist looked at the same document,
did much worse on the test of factual knowledge

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:04.360
that presumably is what you
need in order to read critically

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:06.220
and to read in sophisticated ways.

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:08.910
Let's look at the way that
Fred begins his reading.

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:12.430 position:58%
So, he begins with the same document.

00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:14.540
Nineteenth at 2:00 o'clock we
began our march by wading a

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:16.240 position:67%
through a very long ford up to our middles.

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:19.820 position:64%
And this is the first thing that he says.

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:23.810
This is the first thing that
comes out of his mouth.

00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:29.240
Dire [phonetic] of John Marker,
British, an officer, 19th.

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:32.190
That's the day itself.

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:36.680 position:56%
So, I want you to think for a second
what it is that Fred has done?

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:41.360
What is it that he has done that
profoundly distinguishes his --

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:46.510 position:73%
his reading from the way that these very bright
high school students approach this document?

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:59.400
[ Pause ]

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.850
I see a lot of answers.

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:07.790 position:61%
You are answering in -- in a lovely way
but I want you to think behaviorally.

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:14.040 position:63%
I want you to really go -- explain this
on the level of what are his eyes doing,

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:20.710 position:59%
what exactly is he doing with his
eyes that is so deceptively simple and

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:24.510
yet so profoundly different from
what the high school students do.

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:33.300
[ Pause ]

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:37.590
So, yes, I see someone -- he goes
to the bottom of the document.

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:40.830
So, on a pure behavioral level, he
goes to the bottom of the document.

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:45.280 position:58%
But -- but how do you explain -- what
does he mean, That's the day, itself?

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.180
What the heck is he talking about?

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:48.240
Nineteenth.

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:50.870
That's the day, itself?

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:56.220 position:67%
We have to go into these details for you to
understand the depth and the sophistication

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:59.840 position:64%
of what appears to be a very simple move.

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:10.650 position:63%
Yes, he knows the date of the battle and
indeed he's writing it on the same day.

00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:16.560 position:63%
Now, I want you to give this document to
your students tomorrow without any kind

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:24.710 position:69%
of preparation and see if any single student
in the class even make the suggestion

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:30.430 position:58%
that by putting 19th at the top of a
diary entry does not necessarily mean

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:31.500
that it was written on the 19th.

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:32.870 position:58%
It could've been written on the 27th.

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:34.650 position:58%
It could've been written on the 28th.

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:38.960
It could've been actually after
all kinds of hell broke loose

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:42.070
and he decided he needed to
go back and change his diary.

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:47.600 position:72%
But this is the way the historian starts to
think about the nature of historical evidence.

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:51.020
Now, then he does something
that I do not believe that if --

00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:52.510 position:67%
unless you've taught your student this way.

00:32:52.510 --> 00:33:22.390
[ Inaudible speakers ]

00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:25.160 position:66%
So, here's what I want you to do tomorrow.

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:32.700 position:63%
Give your students this document and see
if any of them do what Fred does here.

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.210
He continues.

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:36.490
He reads the document once
through making a few comment.

00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:39.260
And then he makes this comment.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:45.170
We all know about diaries.

00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:47.060
Nineteenth.

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:49.900
He wrote it on that day.

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:52.620
Maybe. Cover his back side.

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:57.910 position:63%
Better that he lost control over his
men than to have ordered the first shot.

00:33:57.910 --> 00:34:06.140
Useful in an inquest.

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:07.990
Useful in an inquest.

00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:09.780
He was a Berkeley historian.

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:12.020
What were they smoking in Berkeley?

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:14.530
There's nothing in this document
about an inquest.

00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:19.720
There's not -- yet Fred has a
fundamentally different relation

00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:23.000
to historical evidence than
our high school students.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.320 position:56%
Our high school students are looking
at primary sources almost as if --

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:32.890 position:63%
as if they were baskets of
information to be mastered and memorized

00:34:32.890 --> 00:34:36.620 position:64%
to be repeated on a multiple choice test.

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:39.750 position:69%
For Fred, these documents are not inanimate.

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:40.850
They are people.

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:47.200 position:75%
And before he can understand what is in a
document, he has to know to whom he is speaking.

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:50.700
This is why we use primary
sources in the classroom.

00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:54.440
This is why we go to the library of
congress and examine these sources.

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:59.530 position:63%
Because we hear the voices of real
human beings who actually made the past.

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:04.890 position:70%
And for kids to resurrect these voices, to
actually hear them is fundamentally different

00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:10.250 position:66%
from the kind of socialization that we put
them through with 14,000 hours in school

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:13.370
where they look at anything
having to do with history as,

00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:17.130 position:59%
will I need to know this for the test?

00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:20.590 position:73%
Now, I want to end -- I'm going to jump
through a few slides because our time is short.

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:27.570 position:69%
And I just want to quickly talk about -- I'm
going to skip a bit and talk about trying

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:32.310
out this approach in -- in a
large city school district.

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:37.590 position:63%
And about four years ago San Francisco
asked us largely because of issues of --

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:41.750
of literacy and wanting -- wanting
to use and marshal the resources

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:44.680 position:70%
of social studies to help students' literacy.

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:48.080
They asked us to come in with
this approach and actually take

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:50.940
over the eleventh grade curriculum
in several high schools.

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:55.500 position:56%
And we did what in research terms is
called a "treatment control study."

00:35:55.500 --> 00:36:01.440 position:70%
This was done by my Ph.D. student Avishag --
Abby Reisman who's now an assistant professor

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:04.220 position:70%
at the university of Pennsylvania and with --

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:09.210 position:66%
with just indomitable energy she went into
San Francisco and working with a group

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:14.700 position:72%
of teachers taught history in this approach
starting with legitimate historical questions.

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:18.940
Central historical questions.

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:20.820
Providing some background.

00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:24.850
The evaluation of evidence
and whole class discussions.

00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:28.740 position:59%
Now, I'm going to cut to the chase
and show you the kind of thing that --

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:31.350 position:56%
that very much excited the district.

00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:33.300 position:58%
We had different kinds of assessment.

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:36.930
The district was very interested
in this assessment.

00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:39.180 position:72%
And you -- the [inaudible] comprehension test.

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:44.640 position:72%
And low and bond when students in their social
studies classrooms are looking carefully

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:48.310 position:59%
at primary source documents and
learning to read in a very careful way

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:50.540 position:67%
like this -- this predates the common core.

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:53.300
We like to say we were common
before the common core.

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:57.050
There is a significant effect
for reading level for students

00:36:57.050 --> 00:37:00.080 position:63%
in this -- in these kinds of classrooms.

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:04.250 position:67%
Since then, we have become, for instance,
the -- the social studies curriculum and --

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:06.820
and LA unified, the second
largest district in the country.

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:12.190 position:73%
I can tell you a great deal about this research
but I'm going to now share with you this video.

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:15.830
Shows the power of primary
sources and inquiry of learning.

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:20.360 position:75%
&gt;&gt; I remember they, like, last year -- last year
our first year of history and I did not like it

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:23.120 position:67%
because they would just give us a textbook.

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:28.100
When it comes to this year,
it was more like, wow.

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:28.870
We get documents.

00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:30.130
Like, I never seen that before.

00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:31.540 position:56%
Like, a teacher giving me documents?

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:37.030 position:72%
&gt;&gt; The reading like a historian project turns
the traditional history classroom on its head.

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:42.800 position:75%
Rather than focusing on the passive retention of
names and dates, this approach invites students

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:47.010
to become historical investigators
using the skills of historians

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:49.570
to answer questions about the past.

00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:53.440
Each class is organized around a
legitimate historical question.

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:57.830 position:67%
Students explore these questions by going
back to the sources encountering the voices

00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:00.480 position:67%
of historical actors in original documents.

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:03.910
&gt;&gt; There's usually some kind
of intro lecture or, you know,

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:07.090 position:73%
giving students the background information,
setting the stage for what they might not know.

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:10.420
And then typically it poses
the question for the day.

00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:12.780
Is the question for the day,
was the new deal a success?

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:14.610
Is the question for the day,
was Lincoln a racist?

00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:18.410
&gt;&gt; Is the image of the happy
1950s housewife accurate?

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:22.660 position:63%
I want you to show me the evidence that
leads you to believe that's your answer.

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:22.830
[inaudible speaker]

00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:23.550
&gt;&gt; Like where?

00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:25.170
Document c.

00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:27.770
&gt;&gt; I never really done that before.

00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:30.510
Like, getting the chance to agree
and disagree with what we study.

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:32.970
It helps to get deeper in
what you're learning about.

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:36.720 position:61%
&gt;&gt; We have a crucial problem of
literacy in our nation's urban schools.

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:42.000 position:75%
And the moment this approach goes into a school,
what we automatically do is we double the amount

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.050 position:61%
of time that kids are exposed to texts.

00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:47.910
&gt;&gt; I believe that their reading
is improving at least as much

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:50.090 position:59%
as their ability to analyze documents.

00:38:50.090 --> 00:38:54.850 position:59%
I think this constant knowing when you
walk in the door we are reading today.

00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:58.180
And we are not just putting
our eyes on the page and hoping

00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:00.940
that the bell rings before
anybody asks us a question.

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:03.080
But we're reading and then
we're talking about it.

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:05.080
&gt;&gt; Ninety-six percent in document d

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:09.180 position:61%
of women married reported they were
either extremely happy or fairly happy.

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:12.310
&gt;&gt; We have document a. What's the
first thing we're going to do?

00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:13.670
&gt;&gt; [students respond] Source.

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:17.750 position:75%
&gt;&gt; Teachers trained in the approach were matched
with teachers in regular history classrooms.

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:22.050 position:72%
At the end of the year, students were
assessed on their historical thinking ability,

00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:26.550 position:70%
their mastery of factual knowledge, and their
growth in general reading comprehension.

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:30.870 position:73%
&gt;&gt; What we found was that not only did students
in the treatment classes and the reading

00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:35.660 position:63%
like historian classes do better on
historical thinking and on the retention

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:40.340
of historical facts but also they
grew in reading comprehension.

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:42.300 position:69%
&gt;&gt; Now I know history like boom, boom, boom.

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:42.990
Like this now.

00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:44.320
It's kind of easier.

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:46.490
And, like, I know certain dates.

00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:47.470
Kind of weird and everything.

00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:48.980 position:64%
But I know certain dates like better now.

00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:54.490 position:69%
&gt;&gt; I was absolutely into nurturing them so
that they would never be made too feel badly

00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:56.340 position:70%
because they didn't have good reading skills.

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:58.690
And I took very good care of them.

00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:01.300 position:70%
And I didn't teach them how to read anything.

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:08.620 position:67%
&gt;&gt; Now that I see that there's a difference
between making somebody feel better

00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:13.460 position:72%
about themselves for no good reason and
giving them the skills to be able to do better

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:15.840
in their lives and be more
powerful in their own lives.

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:21.350 position:67%
Right? That's what I think this program has
done for me as a teacher because I'm able

00:40:21.350 --> 00:40:24.470 position:61%
to see them actually do so much better.

00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:27.600
&gt;&gt; I read more thoroughly and more,
like, detail to certain parts.

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:29.770 position:58%
I look for certain things right away.

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:32.050 position:75%
&gt;&gt; And so far this is my favorite history class.

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:34.100
I really mean it.

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:34.790
It's not boring.

00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:37.250
It's fun. I learn many things.

00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:41.310 position:64%
I wish there was, like, a better -- like,
for next year, for senior year, like,

00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:47.840 position:67%
same history class but learning more things
because I feel like there's more to learn.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:49.560
A lot more.

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:50.530
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:53.830
Again, some people have seen the
video and some people haven't.

00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:58.530 position:69%
Take a look at it at your time but I am here
for you at least for the next seven minutes

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:01.260 position:69%
to answer your questions about our approach.

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:05.470
&gt;&gt; I was noticing when I
was on the YouTube video

00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:09.140
that there were quite a few
additional videos produced

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:11.340 position:63%
by the Stanford history education group.

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:13.590 position:72%
Do you want to describe what some of those are

00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:18.280 position:61%
because I have a feeling this group
may be particularly interested in them.

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:26.500 position:59%
&gt;&gt; Sure. There -- we -- we have quite
a few videos of -- if you go to the --

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:30.660 position:69%
our main web page -- the [inaudible].edu And
Joel [inaudible] if you're going to listen

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:34.660 position:59%
to that webinar as well we'll tell you
more about how to use different kinds

00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:37.100 position:63%
of assessments in the history classroom.

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:41.220 position:64%
But I think my experience in working with
groups of teachers who are not familiar

00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:44.850
with this approach the most useful
thing from our experience has been

00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:50.350 position:67%
to see teachers actually teaching in these
ways in some very difficult urban settings.

00:41:50.350 --> 00:41:54.410 position:67%
In some settings that where students may be
in 11th grade but are not reading at grade.

00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:56.300
What do you do?

00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:57.980
And so the teaching channel --

00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:03.910 position:61%
teachingchannel.org has produced a
50-minute special in various classrooms

00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:06.760
that are using our reading
like a historian approach.

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:09.170
And if you go to the History
Channel and register,

00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:11.680 position:69%
it's completely -- the registration is free.

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:15.730 position:56%
You will see a series of about five
or six videotapes that together come

00:42:15.730 --> 00:42:20.230 position:58%
to about 50 minutes of footage of
different teachers in different kinds

00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:23.010
of classrooms using this
approach with real students

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:24.570 position:69%
in high school and middle school classrooms.

00:42:24.570 --> 00:42:27.970
So, you'll want to check that
out on the teachingchannel.org.

00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:31.730
Just type in for the search,
reading like a historian.

00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:35.020
There was a question here.

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:38.930 position:70%
Is -- is the Stanford history education group
continuing to come out with lesson plans?

00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:42.160
The answer is absolutely yes.

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:48.720 position:73%
We are expanding our resources particularly
for the teaching of middle school world history

00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:53.660 position:63%
and ancient civilizations as well as the
high school world history curriculum.

00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:58.630
And we are continuing again
within our capacity to --

00:42:58.630 --> 00:43:02.870 position:64%
to produce new materials to be responsive
to the needs that you expressed.

00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:04.200
We depend upon you.

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.390
We hope you will follow us.

00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:06.450
We hope you will write to us.

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:08.620
We hope you will use our materials.

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:11.270
All of our materials are free.

00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:13.100
It costs nothing to download.

00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:16.110
There is no curriculum to buy.

00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:19.250
All of the materials that we have
on our website are completely free.

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:29.490 position:59%
All you have to do is register and you
can download to your heart's delight.

00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:31.960 position:61%
[pause] Are there -- there's a question
of could you recommend resources

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:35.090 position:58%
to assist elementary school teachers?

00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:39.060 position:56%
Well, I would say one thing to do
is to follow Lee Ann Potter's column

00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:41.700
in social education every
month that it comes out.

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:46.330
To become a member of the national
council for the social studies.

00:43:46.330 --> 00:43:51.650 position:64%
There are a variety of good resources for
the elementary social studies curriculum.

00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:57.600 position:66%
There's a website called "bringing history
home" done at the university of Iowa

00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:03.260 position:66%
which is extraordinary in terms of helping
fourth and fifth graders think both

00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:09.510 position:69%
to develop their literacy skills as well as
to develop their historical thinking skills.

00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:10.740
There's a question.

00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:13.280 position:63%
Do you find it hard to get kids reading?

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:18.810
Yes. Increasingly, it is hard
to -- to -- to get kids to read.

00:44:18.810 --> 00:44:23.890 position:56%
It's one of the reasons why our
primary sources are extremely short.

00:44:23.890 --> 00:44:29.290
So, give an eighth grader or even
an 11th grader reading at a --

00:44:29.290 --> 00:44:36.690 position:73%
at a normal grade level a dense page of tightly
packed text in 10-point type is intimidating.

00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:39.720 position:58%
I can tell you that it's
intimidating for the students I teach

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:43.240 position:61%
as 18-year-olds at Stanford university.

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:46.670 position:56%
The reason that we work with primary
sources in the classroom is not

00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:49.850 position:73%
to expose students to copious amounts of texts.

00:44:49.850 --> 00:44:54.250
It's to teach them to read slowly
and to really read closely.

00:44:54.250 --> 00:44:57.730
And the longer and the more
dense a text is the more you --

00:44:57.730 --> 00:45:02.380 position:59%
the more you defeat the purpose of
reading carefully and reading closely.

00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:04.280
So, yes, it's difficult.

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:08.610 position:58%
And students don't spontaneously come
to us knowing how to read this way.

00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:14.700 position:73%
The best and most important piece of curriculum
that you have at your disposal is your own self

00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:19.550 position:61%
and modeling for students how you think
about text and how you read this way.

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:23.140
Without a clear adult model
of how you read, it's --

00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:28.220 position:73%
you can bet that many students will not develop
the kind of reading skills that you want them

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:33.110
to develop in order to be
sophisticated, informed citizens.

00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:34.260
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Sam.

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:35.300
This Cathy.

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:39.730 position:66%
I'm going to leave you with Tim's question
as the last question of the evening

00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:43.290 position:66%
and Amber sent in a more complex question.

00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:46.560
And we'll make sure that we
get that to you in the chat.

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:51.900
You can follow Sam at Sam
Wineburg and his website

00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:55.840
for the Stanford education
group is up on the slide.

00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:57.580 position:72%
I'm going to leave you with the last question.

00:45:57.580 --> 00:46:01.180 position:56%
Then I'm going to advance to the
last slide which is some information

00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:03.290 position:63%
about getting certificate of completion.

00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:07.380
Plus a link to a three-question
survey that we'd like to ask our --

00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:11.180 position:63%
our folks to fill out before they leave.

00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:13.870
We do have to end this session
in about two minutes.

00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:17.760 position:61%
But Tim's question is, how long does it
typically take to get kids up to speed

00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:21.030 position:69%
and comfortable with these types of sources?

00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:25.660 position:59%
&gt;&gt; That's a really good question, Tim.

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:30.410
It -- it takes a while.

00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:33.700 position:56%
Because we've done a number on kids.

00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:37.150 position:66%
Right? We -- we have tested them to death.

00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:40.890 position:69%
We've tested them with traxoline-like tests.

00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:47.650 position:75%
And so the -- the consequences of our own fruits
is the attitude that many students display

00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:50.930 position:63%
which is, well, just tell me the answer.

00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:56.450
And so for students to unlearn that
is not a one- or two-lesson issue.

00:46:56.450 --> 00:47:00.280
It is something that we have to
stay the course and do regularly.

00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:04.330 position:63%
And we have to show them how
applicable it is to their everyday life.

00:47:04.330 --> 00:47:08.780 position:67%
I hope you will see the connections between
the kinds of questions that we're asking

00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:14.300 position:72%
about historical evidence and the very way
that information comes to us in a digital age.

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:17.510 position:56%
If we do not ask who made a website,

00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:21.810
who is telling us this information,
why are they telling it to us.

00:47:21.810 --> 00:47:23.550
Is it -- is it sponsored?

00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:25.560 position:58%
Is it sponsored content which is a --

00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:30.400
a euphemism for an ad that actually
masquerades as a news story?

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.980 position:75%
These kinds of questions might have been in a --

00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:38.820 position:73%
in a previous age something that maybe only the
elite students had to -- had to think about.

00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:42.880
In the digital age that we live
where all information comes to us,

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:47.620 position:72%
where there are no people who are vetting what
comes us on the web as we saw from the example

00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:51.970 position:66%
of the textbook "our Virginia," these are
the kinds of ways of thinking and the ways

00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:55.890 position:67%
of knowing that have to be the inheritance,
that have to be in the possession

00:47:55.890 --> 00:48:01.220 position:70%
of every single informed citizen that we want
to send out to the world in our classrooms.

00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:03.880
So, I think my time is actually up.

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:06.590
Thank you very much [inaudible
speaker] And be sure to contact us.

00:48:06.590 --> 00:48:07.120
Take care.

00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:09.680
I really enjoyed your questions.

00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:12.540
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much, Sam.
