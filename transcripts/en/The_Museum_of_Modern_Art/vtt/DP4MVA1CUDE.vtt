Rita Dove

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.505
“Say Grace”

00:00:06.423 --> 00:00:09.716
Got a spoon
Got a pan

00:00:10.553 --> 00:00:12.803
Got a bucket for the scraps

00:00:14.065 --> 00:00:16.431
Got a nail to hang our things on

00:00:16.935 --> 00:00:19.768
A wish
An empty sack

00:00:20.936 --> 00:00:22.936
Dear Lord bless our little bit

00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:26.150
This table
Our beds

00:00:27.058 --> 00:00:30.155
Dear Lord who made us
And the world

00:00:31.196 --> 00:00:33.196
Now can we raise our heads
