00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:06.420
 Your attention, for example, is handled by unconscious forces - and you know it, you know it perfectly 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.720
 This is another important observation. As you know, if you sit out of 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.179
 Study time 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.779
 For example, your conscious attention is to be studied. 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.980
 But you know well that all kinds of illusions that distract your attention will enter your imagination 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.440
 Non-stop, annoying, and there's not much you can do about it, maybe, wait 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.520
 As you know, so you will be sitting there and your attention will go away. You will think 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.300
 I do not know 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.040
 You might want to watch Gene Virgin (a US series) on Netflix or something like that, or maybe it's time to get a peanut butter sandwich 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.489
 Or you must take out the bunched rabbits from under the bed 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.999
 Or maybe you take a grain of sugar or maybe a cup of coffee 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:49.559
 Or it is like all the systems in you that want to have nothing 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:56.099
 Very happy just in order to sit there while reading this thing that you are bored of and so float on the roof and try to 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.079
 Controlling your perceptions and your actions non-stop, you probably think this is stupid 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.969
 In any case, why should I read this damned article, what do I do at university and what is the point of life? 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.069
 You can really do well 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.099
 You can go if you try to avoid doing your homework 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.049
 And then you may think. Well what are you trying to avoid it 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.500
 After I took the damn course, I told myself to sit down. Why do not you listen? 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:30.569
 Well, because you're in a mess, that's why you do not get control of yourself at all 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.199
 And no more control over this laptop 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.140
 Well, then there is the memory function of the subconscious mind 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:47.430
 There are job solutions and these are interesting. The subconscious mind contains once voluntary habits now 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.119
 The trusting and separate elements of the personality, which may lead to an intrusive existence. this is interesting 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.549
 I would like to root that out more into procedural memory 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.819
 You also know that what you have done is practicing certain habits 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.829
 Whatever they can be let them be called bad habits, and you like to control those things 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.839
 But you can not when you talk for example 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.869
 You use a word for example "and" as you know "and you say" Ummmm "a lot and you do so to be good at it 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.160
 And you want to stop, but you do not print because you built this small machine in being right 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.439
 It's nervous and not under conscious control and anything you exercise 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:32.269
 Becomes it; becomes part of you, this is another element of the subconscious. Different part, and then there is an innovative part 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.370
 What's this ... okay? You know you're sitting and maybe trying to write something or maybe you want to 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.260
 Produce a piece of art, or something musical, or maybe you're dreaming in bed 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:49.609
 And you have all these strange ideas, especially in dreams. It's like ... what? Where do these things come from and what's more strange 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.689
 One of the really weird things about dreams and almost strange is that you are an observer in your dream 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:04.249
 It's like a dream is something that happens to you. Well, you're dreaming, theoretically, how can you be an observer? 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.549
 It's almost like you're watching a video game or a movie
