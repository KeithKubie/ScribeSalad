00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.032
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; In order to use interval notation to write the possible values that x can

00:00:04.032 --> 00:00:07.851
have, we need to figure out the lower bound and the upper bound of this

00:00:07.851 --> 00:00:12.049
interval. I think the lower bound will be too difficult in this one, but I'm

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:16.369
curious about what maximum value you think x can take on. Please pick. Do you

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.410
think it's 0, 5, 10, or, do you think there isn't one?
