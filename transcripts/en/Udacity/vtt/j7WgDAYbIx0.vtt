00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.835
Hi, I'm Jocelyn, and I'll be teaching
you how to add code to your mobile app

00:00:04.835 --> 00:00:08.130
so you can track usage data,
and Google Analytics.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.730
I'll also introduce you to Tag Manager.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.370
Using Tag Manager, you can make
configuration changes to your app,

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.320
without having to redeploy the binary.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.070
And you can also manage the tags
to send data to analytics.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.230
This course assumes you know
how to build an Android app and

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.030
how to add the Google API client library
to your project in build.gradle.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.650
The course uses a skeletal sample
app that helps you figure out

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.110
what's for dinner.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.230
This app is already built for you.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.290
Your task will be to add the code
to send data to analytics and

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.190
to use Tag Manager variables
to dynamically update the app.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.110
This course focuses on how to
add code to your mobile app

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.530
to use Google Analytics and Tag Manager.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.510
It does not teach everything
about the Google Analytics and

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.700
Tag Manager dashboards.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.090
There are excellent
alternative resources for

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.550
learning about both of these.
