00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:22.050
Have you ever wondered why, supposedly, people
used to think the Moon was made out of cheese?

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.600
Well, wonder no more.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.980
It’s because it was formed in the Milky
Way… (maybe include sound effects?

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:27.980
http://instantrimshot.com/classic/?sound=rimshot
and *crickets*) :-)

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.099
In fact, nobody really ever thought the Moon
was made of green cheese…

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.120
Well, there are nutters out there, so it’s
possible that there was at least one person

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.720
who thought the Moon was made of cheese, and
kids used to sometimes believe the Moon was

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.670
made of cheese thanks to various fables, but
kids will believe anything.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.050
For instance, in 1902 it was found that the
most common theory as to what the Moon was

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.180
made of according to children in the United
States was that it was made of cheese.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.530
But these children weren’t exactly setting
the bar high as other popular responses from

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.950
them were things like “yellow paper, dead
people, and rags.”

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.440
So other than lunatics and children who were
told so by their parents via fables, nobody

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.710
seriously ever thought the Moon was made of
cheese.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.890
Another common misconception surrounding the
Moon/green cheese thing is that the “green”

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.920
here is referring to the color green.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.200
While there are actually green cheeses, what
the “green” signifies here is “new”

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.220
or “fresh”, so “the Moon is made of
new cheese.”

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.640
This was a common way to refer to cheese where
the whey either hadn’t yet all been pressed

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.920
out or had just been removed from the curds,
in other words, cheese that has not been aged

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.920
at all.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.030
So how did this “Moon is made of green cheese”
thing all start and become popularized?

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.760
It isn’t entirely clear who was the first
to come up with the expression, but it became

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.170
extremely common starting in the mid-16th
century.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.909
The credit for the person to come up with
the expression usually goes to famed French

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.280
monk and scholar François Rabelais or English
writer John Heywood.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.460
Heywood first used it in The Proverbs of John
Heywood written in 1546

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.810
“Ye fetch circumquaques to make me believe,
Or thinke, that the moone is made of greene

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:02.810
cheese.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.160
And when ye have made me a lout in all these,
It seemeth ye would make me goe to bed at

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.689
noone.”

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:14.040
So basically, the expression itself simply
was used to refer to something so ludicrous

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.129
that only the extremely gullible would believe
it.

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:23.329
Another early example using the statement
in the same way can be found in 1565 in Shacklock’s

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:26.579
Hatched of Heresies:
“Whilst they tell for truthe Luther his

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:32.510
lowde lyes, so that they may make theyr blinde
brotherhode and the ignorant sort beleve that

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.129
the mone is made of grene chese”
Yet another early reference from John Wilkins’

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:43.469
New World Book 1 (1638), which is explicitly
clear as to the meaning of the expression

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:48.370
and that it had become common,
“You may as soon persuade some Country Peasants

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.419
that the Moon is made of Green Cheese (as
we say) as that ’tis bigger than his Cart-wheel”

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:58.989
While in the early days it was used just to
signify gullibility, in the last couple centuries

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.450
many started thinking that people actually
used to believe this, which is kind of ironic

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.879
if you think about it.

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.919
This is not unlike how people started believing
that most thought the world was flat during

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:13.239
the Middle Ages, when in truth in many parts
of the world people have known the world wasn’t

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.269
flat for well over 2000 years.

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:21.049
For instance, Eratosthenes (at the time the
head librarian at the library of Alexandria)

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:26.669
around 240 BC not only knew the Earth was
round, as most Greek scholars did at the time,

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:30.389
but managed to become the first known person
to calculate the circumference of the Earth

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.310
accurately, only off by about 2%.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.989
He also calculated the distance from the Earth
to the Sun and was off by only about a half

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:37.989
a percent.

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.309
Not only that, but he calculated the tilt
of the Earth on its axis and was off by less

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:42.860
than half a degree.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.359
Another amazing accomplishment by Eratosthenes
was that he basically invented the discipline

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:51.920
of Geography with his remarkable three book
treaties Geographikia.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.269
Bonus Moon Facts:
• Yet another Moon myth is that during the

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.790
1950s and 1960s, Americans were all crazy
about getting to the Moon.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.879
In fact, according to Smithsonian space historian
Roger Launius, during the early days of the

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:09.059
Apollo program, the U.S. space program was
one of the top government programs Americans

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:13.311
listed that they thought should be dropped,
with a full 60% of Americans feeling that

00:04:13.311 --> 00:04:16.229
the U.S. was spending too much money on space
flight.

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.699
• Contrary to popular belief, there is no
“dark side of the Moon”.

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:23.230
The Moon has days and nights, just like Earth.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.080
One Moon “day” is 29 1/2 Earth days.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.419
This rotation coincides perfectly with its
rotation around the Earth so that we always

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.810
only see one side of the Moon.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.430
• NASA claimed in 2002 the Moon was made
out of cheese after discovering an expiration

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.870
date printed on the Moon.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.909
They released the following statement, “Using
the new camera on the recently refitted Hubble

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:48.210
Space Telescope, astronomers have been able
to confirm that the Moon is made of green

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.210
cheese.

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.419
The telling clue was the resolution of a numeric
date after which the Moon may go bad.

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:58.139
Controversy still exists, however, over whether
the date resolved is truly an expiration date

00:04:58.139 --> 00:04:59.930
or just a ‘sell by’ date.”

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:05.110
This, of course, was posted by NASA on April
1st…

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.629
• While there is still some debate on how
exactly the Moon formed, one of the most popular

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:12.680
theories is that the Moon formed from a collision
between the Earth and a planet-sized object

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.620
about 4.6 billion years ago, called the “Big
Whack”.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.940
When the impact happened, a cloud of vaporized
rock shot off the Earth’s surface and went

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.639
into orbit around the Earth.

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:26.849
Over time, the cloud cooled and condensed
into a ring of small, solid objects which

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:32.040
then slowly gathered together, eventually
forming the Moon.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.539
• The largest crater on the Moon is about
550 miles in diameter and is near the South

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.280
Pole-Aitken Basin.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.710
The impact caused by the asteroid that formed
this crater was almost powerful enough to

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.090
split the Moon into pieces.

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.159
• The Moon used to have very active volcanoes.

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:51.660
The dark areas of the Moon, called maria (meaning
“seas”), are cratered landscapes that

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.840
were flooded with lava, which then froze forming
smooth rock areas that resemble, from a distance,

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.979
bodies of water on Earth.

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:05.870
• The Moon has a surface area of about 14.6
million square miles, which is about 92.6%

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.990
less surface area than the Earth has.

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.140
This is about 4 times the surface area of
the United States.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:16.590
• Jack Schmitt, an Apollo 17 astronaut,
has the distinction of being the first known

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.550
human to have extraterrestrial hay fever.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.610
After returning to the lunar module and taking
his helmet off, he had an instant reaction

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.610
to the Moon dust with his nose stuffing up
quickly.

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.210
This lasted a couple hours before going away.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.530
According to Schmitt, he wasn’t the only
one to experience this, but pilots don’t

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.220
like to admit to any adverse symptoms or they
think they’ll be grounded.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:43.270
If you’re curious, several astronauts say
that fresh Moon dust smells like spent gunpowder.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.419
• Another slightly popular “Moon myth”
is that people can go temporarily crazy and/or

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:49.639
that more criminal acts occur during full
moons.

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:53.990
There have been numerous studies done to try
to see if there is actually a link between

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:58.410
the phases of the Moon and mental illness
and the like, but, not surprisingly, to date

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.970
nobody’s been able to find any such connection.

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:05.720
Nevertheless, the word “lunatic” ultimately
comes from the Latin for “moon”, “luna”,

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.449
via the Old French “lunatique”, meaning
“insane”.

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:13.819
It first popped up in English around the 13th
century and referenced the mistaken belief

00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:16.340
that the Moon can make people crazy.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:23.590
• In 2002, a 72 year old Buzz Aldrin punched
Bart Sibrel who is a “we never landed on

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:27.990
the moon” conspiracy theorist, “documentary”
maker, and cab driver.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:32.469
Sibrel invited Aldrin to a hotel with Sibrel
telling him he was making a children’s TV

00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:33.800
show on space.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.770
Once Aldrin arrived at the hotel, Sibrel pulled
out a Bible and tried to get Aldrin to put

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.520
his hand on it and swear that he had walked
on the Moon.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.870
Needless to say, Aldrin was pretty irritated
at this point.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:47.449
Things got worse when Sibrel called Aldrin
a “liar” and a “coward”, at which

00:07:47.449 --> 00:07:49.080
point Aldrin punched him.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:54.080
Lucky he didn’t also call him a poltroon,
or Aldrin may have pulled a “President Andrew

00:07:54.080 --> 00:08:00.800
Jackson”, who once killed a man for calling
Jackson a “scoundrel, poltroon, and a coward”

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.589
in the newspaper.

00:08:02.589 --> 00:08:07.879
• In 2009, Sibrel found himself in hot water
once again while working as a cab driver.

00:08:07.879 --> 00:08:11.770
Sibrel wanted a woman’s parking spot, but
she refused to pull out of it, at which point

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.210
Sibrel was able to park across from the woman.

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:18.029
After parking, he proceeded to get out of
his cab, hop onto the hood of the woman’s

00:08:18.029 --> 00:08:35.460
car, and jump up and down causing $1,400 worth
of damage to the car.
