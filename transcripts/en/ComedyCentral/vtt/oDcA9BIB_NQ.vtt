00:02:38.357 --> 00:02:41.627

HE WAS THE JANITOR,

00:02:52.571 --> 00:02:55.074
AND HIS NICKNAME
WAS BUFFALO BUTT.

00:02:55.107 --> 00:02:56.676
THAT IS CORRECT
AND A BONUS POINT.

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:57.710

HIS NAME WAS BOOKMAN?

00:03:15.861 --> 00:03:17.330
YES, AND HE WAS FAT.

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:20.032
WHAT DID THEY CALL HIM?

00:03:20.065 --> 00:03:24.604

ding!
THAT IS CORRECT.

00:03:39.618 --> 00:03:42.454
WHY DID BLACK PEOPLE
DISTRUST RONALD REAGAN?

00:03:45.524 --> 00:03:46.993
BECAUSE HE TOOK
ALL HIS MONEY.

00:03:47.026 --> 00:03:48.160
ding!
THAT IS CORRECT.

00:03:48.193 --> 00:03:49.395

A REPUBLICAN.

00:03:49.428 --> 00:03:51.230
ding!
THAT IS CORRECT.

00:03:51.263 --> 00:03:55.268
WHY DID BLACK PEOPLE
DISTRUST RONALD REAGAN?

00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:58.504

TRUSTED IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:03:58.537 --> 00:04:00.373

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:13.386
NO.

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:14.920
ding!
THAT IS CORRECT.

00:04:14.953 --> 00:04:19.492
BIG DADDY KANE WOULD SAY,
"IT AIN'T EASY."

00:04:19.525 --> 00:04:21.727
"PIMPING AIN'T EASY,"
HE IS CORRECT.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.828
IT'S HARD.

00:04:22.861 --> 00:04:24.597

A HARD TIME WITH IT MYSELF.

00:04:26.832 --> 00:04:30.303

OF FACT, AIN'T EASY.

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:34.206

[people shouting]
BLACK PEOPLE!

00:04:38.977 --> 00:04:41.080
