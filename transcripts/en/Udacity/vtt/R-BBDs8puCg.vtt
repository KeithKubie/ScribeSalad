00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.070
For your first practice problem, try finding f of g of 1, f of g of 2, and f of

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:11.064
g of x. These two should be numbers and this should be a function containing

00:00:11.064 --> 00:00:16.370
the variable x. Here's the function for f of x and here's the function for g of

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.720
x. Good luck on this one.
