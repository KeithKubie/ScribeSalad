00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.820
It's good to find a community
in anything big you do.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.350
Be part of the scene for your industry.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.670
Follow, and hopefully one day also be
followed by, the right investors or

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.620
competitors in your industry.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.090
Be active in relevant online groups and
contribute to them when you can.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.950
These people are your support for
improving and promoting your app.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.630
In terms of your image,

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.950
framing yourself as a thought leader
in the industry is a wonderful idea.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.510
You'll need to share your thoughts,

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.370
if you want people to trust
you as a thought leader.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.680
Consider running your own blog and
sharing your knowledge.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.000
This process is not just about
promoting your product left and around.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.980
It's also about becoming
a trusted expert.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.980
&gt;&gt; For example,
if your product is a bike desk,

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.030
your blog can cover things
beyond just the bike.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.370
Topics like cycling as a sport,
either outdoor or indoor.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.950
This tells your followers that you
know what you're talking about when it

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.200
comes to cycling.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.340
You can write about
fitness in general or

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.430
healthy habits to show that I can
trust you to give me lifestyle advice,

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.250
including just being
active at my own desk.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.470
Consider publishing ongoing
pieces of content, to highlight

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.250
your professionalism in the industry and
promote your online visibility.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.080
This will help both your SEO and
your social presence.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.060
&gt;&gt; Some of the most useful groups,
I would say, are groups that are really

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.220
really targeted to use on part of
this five person group, of people who

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.860
are in the share economy, like budding
entrepreneurs in the share economy.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.380
And then you can really have the
conversation you want to have, right?

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.350
So those have worked better for
me than just on-line forums or

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.030
these big communities.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.890
&gt;&gt; I want you take a few minutes to
explore on-line groups that you'd like

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.130
to be active in.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.850
Start thinking about what it means
to really become a thought leader in

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:41.810
the field.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.790
And think about your plan to get there.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:44.650
When you're ready,

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.830
write two blog titles that you'd
like to write in the blanks below.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.130
After you've come up with your titles,

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.060
go to the forums and outline what these
blog posts will cover and then you'll

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.930
have an opportunity to get feedback
from some of your peers in the course.
