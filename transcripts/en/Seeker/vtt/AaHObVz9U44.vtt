00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.310
After repeated head impacts, experienced in
sports like American Football, the brain can

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.960
begin to shrink and deform, causing dementia-like
symptoms.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:15.240
Why is this happening and can we stop it?

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.850
Howdy gang, I'm Trace, thanks for watching
DNews today.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.890
Chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE is
a serious condition first discovered in the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.970
1920s with boxers, because boxers get hit
in the head, a lot… both during practice

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.160
and during a match.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.910
According to one medical examiner in a 1928
issue of the Journal of the American Medical

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.460
Association, "nearly one half of the fighters
who have stayed in the game long enough" will

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.290
experience something they called being, "punch
drunk," "slug nutty," or, peculiarly, "cutting

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.290
paper dolls."

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.630
In the 20s they termed this dementia pugilistica
-- word of the day: pugilist, which means

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.110
boxer, but today, we call this derangement
CTE.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.739
Even nearly 100 years ago, these specialists
were recognizing repeated cranial impact has

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.280
huge implications.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.619
The brain is bound by the same laws of physics
as everything else and thus will move until

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.709
something stops it, namely, the skull, this
is called a concussion.

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:13.259
And even a minor one, has a serious affect
on your brainbox.

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.679
If the smack is hard enough, the brain tissues
can become deformed or permanently damaged,

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:21.409
even lesser sub-concussions, when taken together,
can affect the brain long-term.

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.999
Basically, any activity where the head comes
to a sudden stop, repeatedly, has the potential

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:32.109
to trigger concussions, and additively will
cause this degenerative brain disease.

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:37.399
CTE has been found in people who play American
football, ice hockey, soccer, rugby, boxing,

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:40.319
and wrestling, plus members of the military!

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:44.719
Even people who only played in high school
can develop CTE.

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:46.229
This is shocking stuff!

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.369
And I just want to stop and say, more pads
can not stop the brain from moving INSIDE

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.969
the skull, any more than a larger bumpers
stop a person moving in a car crash.

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:00.649
In another study from the 1920s, boxers’
brains were looked at after death, in an autopsy,

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:08.819
which is when they realized something was
wrong… their brains had atrophied, or shrunk.

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:18.330
CTE is 
difficult to diagnose, because it manifests

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.470
as behavioral changes that mimic other brain
disorders like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.980
Once the neurons and axons in the brain are
permanently altered from the repeated impacts

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.510
so to is behavior, emotional control, memory,
reasoning skills, physical and mental controls…

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.510
CTE affects everything.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:42.420
The brain reacts to these impacts by literally
shrinking -- called cerebral atrophy.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.909
In modern studies, doctors found as much as
a 30 percent loss of the frontal, parietal,

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:48.239
and temporal lobes!

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.870
The damage centers on collections of neurons,
infused with a protein called tau.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.900
Tau normally helps stabilize neurons in the
brain, but in CTE it manifests as neurofibrillary

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.610
tangles, turning the brain a yellow color.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.190
Neurofibrillary tangles are literally that,
they look like the tau protein threads have

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.551
become bundled up and though how this happens
isn't entirely understood by science, all

00:03:08.551 --> 00:03:12.010
the patients have these tau tangles.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.860
In the end, as the brain shrinks and the amount
of tangles grows, the person gets more aggressive

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.799
and less emotionally and physically stable,
and, frighteningly, more suicidal.

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.670
Obviously, this is all bad.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:33.420
CTE, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are all tauopathic
diseases, and unfortunately, research on living

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.140
people with these disorders is still ongoing,
and as of now there's no cure.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.310
Which means, once CTE sets in, usually in
middle age, decades after the repeated impacts

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.370
occurred, nothing can be done.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.140
Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is manifesting
in athlete after athlete, because they've

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.780
spent their whole careers smashing into one
another, either on purpose or on accident;

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.459
and even this week, there was another death
attributed to the mental anguish that comes

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.310
along with this brain disorder.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.279
In the end, our brains are the source of everything
we are.

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:05.489
Sometimes, concussions can knock a person
unconscious, or worse, they can slip into

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.150
a coma, but what exactly IS a coma?

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:27.100
I've looked into that too, right here.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.449
Does the discovery of CTE and it's mental
and behavioral consequences make you think

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:33.340
twice about joining sports?

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:42.820
Or for encouraging athletes to hit each other
for our entertainment?
