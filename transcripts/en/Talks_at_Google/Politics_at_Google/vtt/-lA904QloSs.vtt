JIM LECINSKI: Well,
good afternoon.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:11.490
My name is Jim Lecinski.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.854
I'm a vice president of
sales here at Google.

00:00:13.854 --> 00:00:15.270
And I'd like to
welcome you to the

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.410
second of our ongoing
series of discussions--

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.610
Race at Google, a
discussion, an exploration,

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:27.650
and an ongoing dialogue about
racial justice, social justice,

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.010
diversity, and inclusion issues.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.110
We're originating to you
here today from our office

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.040
in Chicago, at Google
Chicago, one of the epicenter

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.690
cities of our country,
where all of these issues

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.150
are coming to a head
and in the news and full

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.150
of current events.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.550
And so it's especially important
and especially poignant

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.040
that we have this discussion
originating from Chicago

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.290
to the rest of the Google
offices and around the world

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.600
here today.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.350
And so we have a
very lively panel--

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.740
a VIP, blue ribbon group--
to explore these issues.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.650
I'd like to get things
started by introducing

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.880
your host for the day, our
diversity business partner

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.510
leader here at Google
Dr. Myosha McAfee.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.010
Welcome.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.320
MYOSHA MCAFEE: Well,
hello, Chi-Town.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.740
I have only been cool for about
four months, and oddly enough,

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.725
as of last week, I am no longer
a diversity business partner.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.569
I currently don't have a title.

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:29.110
But I'm going to
want to make one up,

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.270
because that's Google
style on some level, right?

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.769
Like, we'll switch
you up, and we'll

00:01:32.769 --> 00:01:34.280
figure out the details later.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.740
So I'm the in-house race expert.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.410
I do a lot of our strategy
for race at Google.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.922
So how are we going
to be developing

00:01:40.922 --> 00:01:41.880
our skills around this?

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.530
How are we going
to be developing

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.680
our muscles around this?

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.140
I'm going to be in charge of
creating the strategy for that

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.470
and the programming for it.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.080
So we are now at
Revolutionary Change-- The

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.990
Role of the Disruptor.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.440
So when I think about the
word disruptor, most of us,

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.594
when we applied to Google, heard
a story of, this is a company

00:01:58.594 --> 00:01:59.260
of innovators. .

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.300
This is a company of disruptors.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.710
There's people who are all
about making change, right?

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.690
So we wanted to zoom in
on that particular role,

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.280
that particular
archetype, and think

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.600
about what is the
role of the disruptor

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.880
in-house when we're talking
about race, specifically.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.310
So a topic that most of us
feel a lot of anxiety about,

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.881
most of us don't have a huge
expanse of knowledge around,

00:02:19.881 --> 00:02:22.380
but we're paying attention to
what's happening in the world.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.963
We're paying attention
after Philando,

00:02:23.963 --> 00:02:27.710
after Alton, after a whole slew
of African-Americans, Latinos

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.380
Native Americans, that
are top three groups

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.050
killed by police officers.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.420
We're uncomfortable with
killed by police officers

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.180
terminology, because some of
us have cops as family members.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.310
Some of us grew up
trusting the police.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.990
We actually experience them
as folks who serve and protect

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.739
the community.

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.530
So it kind of created
a climate internally,

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.840
and I think also externally,
and on the national stage,

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.230
of how do we navigate
this conversation?

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.440
How do we begin to have it?

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.830
And so part of what we want
to do in the educating process

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.720
is to have race series
at the very beginning,

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.500
where we're inviting
experts, people

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.000
who feel comfortable having
these conversations, people who

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.920
feel comfortable
disagreeing, people who feel

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.030
comfortable stepping over
that red line and getting bit

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.220
or catching a blowback,
or whatever it is.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.920
So we thought it
would be a great idea

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.866
to have those people
be on the stage today

00:03:12.866 --> 00:03:14.740
to kind of model for us
what that looks like,

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.020
so we know, oh, I can actually
enter this conversation

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.010
and not have to worry about not
waking up tomorrow-- most of us

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.880
feel the fear that intensely,
like, will I wake up tomorrow

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.430
if I say something
in this moment--

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.760
and to also just bear
witness of the fact

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.920
that people can
disagree with each other

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.170
and still be a productive
dialogue, right?

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.860
And I can be in the
role of a disruptor.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.870
I can catch some heat
from being a disruptor

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.560
and still have a
job tomorrow, still

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.880
have colleagues who
like me tomorrow, right?

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.540
So that's what we wanted
to model here on the stage.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.000
To begin, Roland Martin is
going to be our moderator.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.740
And Roland is a commentator
for TV 1 cable network

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.170
and host of "Washington
Watch" with Roland Martin.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.655
You've also probably
seen him on CNN.

00:03:51.655 --> 00:03:54.200
He appeared on a variety
of the network's shows.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.050
He's also a national
award winning

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.580
and multifaceted journalist.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.730
His latest book, "The First--
President Barack Obama's Road

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.210
to the White House, as a
recently reported by Roland S,

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.140
Martin," will be available
outside the door.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.920
Please join me in
welcoming Roland Martin.

00:04:11.621 --> 00:04:12.704
ROLAND MARTIN: Y'all good?

00:04:12.704 --> 00:04:13.704
MYOSHA MCAFEE: I'm good.

00:04:13.704 --> 00:04:17.184
ROLAND MARTIN:
In-house race expert.

00:04:17.184 --> 00:04:20.550
All your black questions--
let's go see her.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.190
Hi, glad to be here.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.600
That's a slightly old bio.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.790
I'm host and managing
editor of "News One Now,"

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.740
which is a daily
morning show on TV One.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.210
And it's the first
morning show in history

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.510
that specifically
targets African-Americans

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.600
with our show.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.800
We're the second largest black
cable network in the country.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.050
And so we deal with these
topics every single day,

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.440
five days a week.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.910
So I'm certainly
happy to be here

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.780
to share this conversation,
internally, externally,

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.990
and certainly when we're able
to stream this live to folks

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.870
outside of here.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.240
So let's get right to it.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.270
Introducing our
panel-- first up,

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.070
my homeboy, he knew
he was in Chicago,

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.820
so he wore his bow tie as an
ode to Louis Farrakhan, Nation

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:03.842
of Islam.

00:05:03.842 --> 00:05:05.800
He probably going to
leave here with a bean pie

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.080
to go back to Connecticut--
Dr. Steve Perry,

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.779
a national education figure.

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:11.070
Of course, many of us know him.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.350
He was a contributor on CNN.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.540
We were there together.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.810
He also was the principal of
Capital Preparatory Magnet

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:17.900
School in Hartford.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.210
100% of their students
went to four-year colleges.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.800
Right now he is doing his own
thing with his own schools.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.270
He has one there in Bridgeport.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.910
They are opening one in Harlem.

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.440
And he wants to have a bunch
of them all across the country.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.044
He's a little shy, so
put your hands together

00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:37.210
and welcome Dr. Steve Perry.

00:05:43.242 --> 00:05:44.450
Sit wherever you want to sit.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.900
Don't matter.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:45.350
Don't matter.

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:46.308
STEVE PERRY: All right.

00:05:46.308 --> 00:05:48.470
ROLAND MARTIN: Next
up is Carmen Perez.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.950
You have seen her on television,
radio, online, more than likely

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.450
with her fist raised in the air.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.670
That's what she does so she
can keep from punching people.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.770
She is very much involved
in issues of social justice.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.170
And it was 11 years
ago when she hooked up

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.060
with the great Harry Belafonte.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.730
Raise your hand if you
know Harry Belafonte.

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.540
If you don't, what
is wrong with you?

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.300
He created this group called
the Gathering for Justice

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.130
with Carmen.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.916
And of course, you
may have seen her also

00:06:17.916 --> 00:06:19.666
work with the New York
Justice League, one

00:06:19.666 --> 00:06:22.300
of the organizations that
falls under the Gathering

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.860
for Justice.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.260
She's also one of
the founders of that.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.920
And so we want to
bring up Carmen Perez.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.620
Come on, Carmen.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:35.950
She believes in branding.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.148
So you see her Justice
League NYC shirt

00:06:38.148 --> 00:06:38.898
CARMEN PEREZ: Yes.

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:39.700
ROLAND MARTIN: That's right.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.210
She's always fundraising,
so I'm surprised she doesn't

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.504
have the website on there.

00:06:44.504 --> 00:06:47.510
David Stoval, a professor
here at University

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.670
of Illinois at Chicago.

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.330
He focuses on several different
areas, including critical race

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.780
theory, as well as the
relationship between housing

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.740
and education and also
between schools and community

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:58.660
stakeholders.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.370
He knew we were
coming to Google,

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:01.950
so he dressed up just for y'all.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:13.990
Help Steve and Carmen, though.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.540
I moderate a little
bit differently.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.162
Everybody gets cracked on.

00:07:18.162 --> 00:07:21.440
All right, then, and so
last, but certainly not

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.020
least, my homebody Jeff Johnson.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.020
We go way back.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.170
And Jeff, of course,
has been involved

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:29.660
in media for a number of years.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:30.160
You.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.730
May have seen him on BET,
also doing commentary

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:34.910
on "The Rickey Smiley Show."

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:38.320
He's filled in for me
on my show on TV One.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.030
And he, of course, has his own
company, JIJ Communications.

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.840
He's the managing principal
based out of Baltimore.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.630
And normally Jeff's
wearing bow ties,

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.507
but he knew it was
Google, so he's chilling.

00:07:54.708 --> 00:07:57.430
Y'all can check out, he
got the funkiest socks.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.560
On the panel.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.080
So I want to open
this thing this way.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.930
They gave me-- and
I appreciate it.

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:09.680
Y'all have some phenomenal notes
and talking points y'all gave

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.180
me.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.713
I'm using none of them.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.000
So I want to start
this way, because I

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.940
love to look at words.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:21.780
I love to look at
how we frame things.

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.050
This is call
"Revolutionary Change-- The

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:25.860
Role of the Disruptor."

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.570
I want to first deal
with revolutionary.

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:32.730
What is it about
that word that scares

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:39.679
America when the revolutionary
does not look white?

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:42.132
That wasn't on the list
they gave me of questions.

00:08:42.132 --> 00:08:43.590
DAVID STOVAL: Well,
I mean, I think

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:47.400
the first thing that happens is
when the revolutionary does not

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.430
look white, i.e. it is not
George Washington, Thomas

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:54.810
Jefferson, or whoever
else we lie about,

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:58.420
it actually is going to ask a
different question of the place

00:08:58.420 --> 00:08:59.530
that we live in.

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:04.680
It's going to ask us now a
deeper question of indictment.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.160
What has happened?

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.480
And then, our inability to
talk about these things that

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.960
are actually happening in the
way that they're happening now

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.050
makes it more difficult
for us to even envision

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:20.610
a revolutionary changing
the conditions of the most

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:21.880
oppressed.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.780
JEFF JOHNSON: Let me dive in
a little bit, because I think

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.740
in simple terms, what's
scary is the vision

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:29.340
of the revolutionary.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:33.300
And so revolution is about
how do you tear something down

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.930
for the purpose of
building something else?

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:39.900
And what scares people
about black revolutionaries

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:43.022
has been the vision of
what they want to tear down

00:09:43.022 --> 00:09:44.480
and the vision they
want to create,

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.970
because we're
talking about power.

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:50.380
So the fear is not necessarily
about I like Thomas Jefferson

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.590
over Nat Turner.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:55.050
It's what is Nat Turner
attempting to tear down?

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:57.910
And what is the vision of
what needs to be created.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:00.060
That scares people,
because they inherently

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.140
believe that in order
for those people

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.885
to have any semblance
of power, I lose mine.

00:10:05.885 --> 00:10:07.510
ROLAND MARTIN: The
reason I pose that--

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:10.230
I'm going to jump in--
is because this is James

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:11.122
Forman's book. .

00:10:11.122 --> 00:10:12.705
James Forman was one
of the organizers

00:10:12.705 --> 00:10:14.880
of Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee, one

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:15.880
of their leaders.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.340
And this book is
titled "The Making

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.420
of Black Revolutionaries."

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.725
One of the greatest
organizers, Steve and Carmen,

00:10:21.725 --> 00:10:23.350
and what's
interesting about that

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:25.060
is that you look
at what SNCC did,

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:28.670
the changes that took
place between 1960 and '68,

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:29.780
we credit Dr. King.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.610
We credit NAACP,
National Urban League.

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:38.050
But SNCC forced a lot of
that change-- Freedom Summer.

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:41.010
We can go through all
the different examples

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:44.620
that they did, because he
understood, to Jeff's point,

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.820
this is about tearing
something down and creating

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.335
something different.

00:10:49.335 --> 00:10:51.210
STEVE PERRY: First of
all, one of things I do

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:53.668
want to acknowledge, and why
I'm deeply humbled and honored

00:10:53.668 --> 00:10:57.670
to be here-- the fact that
there are three men up here

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:00.284
and not more women,
I think is worth

00:11:00.284 --> 00:11:02.700
noting when we're having a
conversation around disruption,

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.260
especially as it relates to
the African-American community.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.380
The male perspective
has been overstated.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:10.550
So we could all do a
better job of that.

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:12.310
So there's that.

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:14.860
The second thing is,
I think that in order

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:21.410
for some white people to see
some African-Americans deciding

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:24.080
that it's time for
a revolution, they

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.100
have to accept that that which
they have become comfortable

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:30.020
with is in fact a problem.

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:33.400
If more people,
regardless of hue,

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.830
began to look at, let's
say just Chicago, and say,

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:38.970
this is really messed up.

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:40.910
They'd have to acknowledge
that on some level,

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:44.000
they're complicit
in their silence

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.250
and at another level that by
maintaining the status quo,

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.680
they essentially
push the knife deeper

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.500
into the back of the
African-American community.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.270
So until such time
as individuals

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:56.970
decide that they wish
to disrupt the system,

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:59.060
they have to accept
or allow themselves

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:02.170
to be lulled into sleep
that the system isn't bad,

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:05.000
and that we actually
want it this way.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.350
So when we start
saying, actually, I

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:09.000
don't want to this way.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.369
I'd like it kind of
like you have it,

00:12:11.369 --> 00:12:13.660
where you don't worry about
police officers pulling you

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:15.425
over, or you don't
have to worry,

00:12:15.425 --> 00:12:17.800
as I did when my children
played in our own neighborhood,

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.730
that one of my own
neighbors was going

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:22.570
to say that they
were carrying a gun

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:26.440
and that four squad cars would
come after my 11-year-old

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.030
on the night of
his 11th birthday.

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:31.180
I'd like it like
you have it, where

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:35.600
you can have your kids play in
your neighborhood without fear.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:40.580
When some white
people begin to awaken

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:43.780
to the depth of the
reality of the pain

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.167
that it is to be
African-American

00:12:45.167 --> 00:12:46.750
in this country,
they're going to have

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:48.412
to do something about it.

00:12:48.412 --> 00:12:50.370
They're going to have to
do something about it.

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:51.210
ROLAND MARTIN: Carmen.

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:52.751
CARMEN PEREZ: And
so I want everybody

00:12:52.751 --> 00:12:55.660
to put your hands out.

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:57.860
Put them together.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.210
Right, that's easy.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:01.720
Now try doing it
the opposite way.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.720
Try doing it to where
it's uncomfortable.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.780
And I always tell
people, if you are

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:16.360
comfortable with seeing black
and brown people oppressed,

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.410
you are part of the problem.

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:21.730
And I don't know
anybody's story here.

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:23.890
And I'm not going to say,
oh, I can relate to you,

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:26.710
and we've been down
this path or whatever.

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:29.990
But I do know that
when something

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:32.920
impacts your community,
you want to change it.

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.280
And so we're all up here
because there's something

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.570
that happened in our lives.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.560
I'm making assumptions
now up here,

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.530
but there's something that
happened in our lives that

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:48.580
told us no more.

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.590
Enough is enough.

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:54.970
Whether you grew up in a
community that was plagued

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:58.530
by violence, whether you
witnessed your brother hog

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:02.560
tied, whether you had a sister
[INAUDIBLE]-- whatever it was,

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.820
there was something that
then changed the trajectory

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:11.050
of your life to
be a change agent.

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:17.330
And so it's the fact that
when I walk down the street,

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:20.000
I could see somebody
being handcuffed,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.360
and that person looks like me.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.010
It's the fact that when
I walk into a prison,

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:28.380
and I walk into a detention
center, the young women

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:31.880
that I'm serving look like me.

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:36.650
It's the fact that I
could walk into Google,

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:41.360
and I don't really see
anybody that looks like me. .

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:46.320
So it's a larger question
about you digging deeper, going

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:52.880
into the cavern of your heart,
and asking, what can I do?

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.980
Because it shouldn't be
about you feeling my pain.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:00.090
It should be about the fact
that we all, like you said,

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:03.040
brother, want to be able
to walk down the street.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:06.720
I want to be able to
walk downtown Chicago

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.560
and not feel like I'm in a
community that is gentrified,

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.780
because the only people
that I was walking down

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:15.900
the street that looked like me
were the servers or the host.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:19.710
I want to be able to have
children and tell them

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:23.470
they could be anything--
anything in the world.

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.500
I want to be able to have
the type of lifestyle

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:29.110
that I've seen around
other colleagues, right?

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:30.450
That's all I want.

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:33.550
And so I work hard
every single day.

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:36.040
And I'm involved in the
Black Lives Matter movement,

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:37.340
and people are like,
well, you're Latina.

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:38.020
Why do you care?

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.640
And I'm like, because
I had black teachers.

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.730
I had black coaches.

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:44.810
And I had black pastors.

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:49.080
I've traveled the world.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:49.840
I've been to Cuba.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.090
I've been to all these places.

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:52.980
And I've seen that
black people are

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:56.320
oppressed all over the world.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:00.250
You don't need to come to a
race conversation to see that.

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:04.280
You see it every single day
when you turn on turn on CNN,

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.840
or you turn on Fox,
whatever people prefer.

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:10.610
You see it every
single day, right?

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:14.030
And so I know that once
black people are free,

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:15.112
my people are free.

00:16:15.112 --> 00:16:17.070
ROLAND MARTIN: The thing
I think is interesting

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:21.050
when you talk about seeing--
I've lived and worked

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:23.420
in Chicago for six years.

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:26.540
And what many of you here
in this room, whether you're

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.180
black, white, Hispanic--
doesn't matter

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:32.290
who you are-- you may not
realize that in this city, when

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:34.910
they have the tourist
maps of Chicago,

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:36.910
it did not extend
past 22nd Street.

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:39.590
DAVID STOVAL: Trust.

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:43.280
ROLAND MARTIN: It didn't
go into Bronzeville.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:46.130
It did not literally
go past 22nd Street.

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:50.970
So what that said in Chicago--
if you come to Chicago,

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:57.330
we only want you to
go from here to here.

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:00.140
And it's amazing
how a lot of people,

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:02.580
again, don't have the
context to understand

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:04.119
a city like this
here-- Jeff, I want

00:17:04.119 --> 00:17:08.160
you to speak to this-- also
have and understand the history.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.770
And I want to use
Chicago as the example.

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:14.829
Harold Washington runs
for mayor in 1983,

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:19.240
and the racial
hatred that existed

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.800
that a sitting member of
Congress who was black

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.859
would dare run to
be mayor of a city

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:29.630
with the second-largest
concentration

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:33.460
of black people outside
the continent of Africa.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.510
JEFF JOHNSON: So
what's the question?

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:36.926
ROLAND MARTIN:
Question is, I want

00:17:36.926 --> 00:17:40.700
you to speak to that
experience and how

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.320
folks who might live
here present day

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:46.190
doesn't realize that,
oh yeah, that was 1983,

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:49.950
but it still lives and permeates
the city and its structure

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:51.140
today.

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:55.290
JEFF JOHNSON: Well, I think
one, any time marginalized

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:59.610
people have the gumption
to lead not just those that

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:03.214
are marginalized,
but everybody, there

00:18:03.214 --> 00:18:04.380
are two things that happens.

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:07.790
Number one, it
says, oh my god, we

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:09.800
don't want them in control
of the purse strings.

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:16.010
And let's be honest,
because I think

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:18.330
when we have this race
conversation, a lot Of times we

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:21.620
have it through the lens of we
as marginalized people are only

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:23.280
talking to white people.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.049
There's multi-level
conversations

00:18:25.049 --> 00:18:26.340
that need to be happening here.

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.230
And so even we have
these conversations

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:30.990
about black political
power, black political power

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:33.780
has never been about
black political positions.

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:37.850
And so when you think about what
happened in Chicago, similar

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:40.830
to what happened in Atlanta,
similar to what happened in DC,

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:44.590
these mayors were powerful, not
just because they were black

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:47.870
and they were able to
get control of City Hall.

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:50.700
They were powerful because
they shifted the very resources

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:53.270
of the city to create
black millionaires,

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:55.500
to create opportunity,
to create power.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.170
And while they didn't give it
to everybody-- let's be clear.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:01.150
Everybody didn't get it--
there was a shift of power

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:02.590
that scared people.

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:05.770
And so whether it was
Maynard Jackson in Atlanta,

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:09.640
or whether it was Marion
Barry in Washington DC,

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.970
or whether it was the first
black mayor in Cleveland, Ohio,

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:17.050
with Carl Stokes,
the fear was not just

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:21.250
about the gumption of thinking
that you could have power.

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:25.340
It was what ultimately happens
when this individual has

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:29.400
the ability to shift wealth
and to shift resources

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.670
and to shift what
communities look like?

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:34.980
And to Carmen's point,
the real challenge

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.890
is because so many
of these cities

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:42.220
have been designed with
disenfranchisement in mind,

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:45.390
folks that were never a part
of those other communities

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:48.280
have never been able to
see the inherent value

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.710
in broad-based
economic development.

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:52.500
So I live in a
city like Baltimore

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:58.370
that I think has had decades of
intentional lack of development

00:19:58.370 --> 00:19:59.930
in certain parts of
the city that are

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:02.460
primarily black and poor white.

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:05.720
And Baltimore has billions
of dollars in development.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:07.030
The harbor looks fantastic.

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:10.069
The communities that extend
from the harbor look amazing.

00:20:10.069 --> 00:20:11.860
People come to Baltimore,
and they love it.

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:13.010
They get to go
down to the water.

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:14.040
They get to get some crabs.

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.415
They have a great
time at hotels.

00:20:15.415 --> 00:20:16.090
They shop.

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:19.320
But you have block upon
block upon block upon block

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:22.750
upon block of some of the
worst blight in America,

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:25.840
and not under 1 mayor,
or 2 mayors, or 3 mayors,

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.230
or 4 mayors-- of 10 mayors.

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:30.270
That doesn't happen by accident.

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:35.040
And so the challenge is
for those people of color

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.160
or marginalized people
that get into power--

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:42.760
the disruption is not
you being elected.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.260
The disruption is, do you
do something different

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.680
when you are there
to shift power

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.940
in a way that creates
disruption versus you giving

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:53.260
the appearance of
disruption by you being

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:55.650
the first, second, or third
person of color that's

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:56.510
in this position?

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:57.770
ROLAND MARTIN: And that's
what I wanted to go to Jeff,

00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:59.280
because I want--
and anyone can jump

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:03.000
in on this one, because when
we talk about revolution

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.430
and disruption, what we are
facing right now in 2016,

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:12.000
this is a battle over power.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.920
And this is a generation
that has seen--

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.090
that's post-civil rights.

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:20.300
They saw integration.

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.860
They saw Dr. King,
Fanny Lou Hamer.

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:25.660
They saw so many others.

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.210
And they said, no.

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:30.000
We don't want equality.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.380
We want power.

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:33.090
CARMEN PEREZ: And just
to kind of go back

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:35.390
to what you were saying
in regards to SNCC,

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:37.000
they organized.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.830
They were able to accomplish
so many victories.

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:42.380
But when you look
at the victory,

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:46.090
right, gaining the
opportunity to integrate,

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:48.310
you were integrating
what Mr Belafonte

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:52.100
talks about-- his last
conversation with Dr. King was.

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.610
They were integrating
into a burning house.

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:57.220
So Dr. King then says, so
then, what do we become?

00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:58.405
And he says, fireman.

00:21:58.405 --> 00:21:59.780
But at the end of
the day you're,

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:03.050
integrating institutions
that were racist.

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:05.010
So nobody woke up the
next day and said,

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:09.590
hey, we're walking being black
children into our schools.

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:12.790
Look at how what happened
with the Little Rock Nine.

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:15.370
And so for me, I always
ask Mr Belafonte,

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:17.940
what was the integration plan?

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:20.470
So you made the
assumption that there

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:26.410
was no more racism in
America after that went away.

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:29.140
However, there was no
real integration plan.

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:30.860
And these institutions
are still racist.

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:32.050
JEFF JOHNSON: But that
was never the plan.

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:33.130
CARMEN PEREZ: Right.

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:33.820
JEFF JOHNSON: But
I think there's

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.480
a misnomer when we talk about
civil rights and social justice

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.450
of the 60s.

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:38.880
The plan was never integration.

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.400
It was desegregation.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.670
And so there was
this myth that it

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:44.290
was about black
folks and white folks

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:45.706
and poor people
and wealthy people

00:22:45.706 --> 00:22:47.546
holding hands and
singing "Kumbaya"

00:22:47.546 --> 00:22:48.920
and all feeling
good about living

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:51.370
in the same community, when
it was really about how do you

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:55.160
dismantle policy and
legislation that prevents people

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:59.510
from maximizing access to
the resources that give them

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:01.510
the ability to have the
pursuit of happiness?

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:04.410
But this narrative about that
integration piece I think

00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:08.547
has persisted because it allows
other generations to say,

00:23:08.547 --> 00:23:09.130
wait a minute.

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:11.090
I was never supposed to
be about power for you.

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:12.730
It was supposed to
be about you being

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:17.010
able to get along in spaces
of other people's power.

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:19.790
And when you're allowed to have
that integration narrative that

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:22.360
continues, the
marginalized always

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.400
feel comfortable
being marginalized,

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.720
and white supremacy
is able to persist,

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:30.327
because it gives white folks
the gumption to believe,

00:23:30.327 --> 00:23:30.910
wait a minute.

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:32.860
Integration was always
about these people

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:35.500
coming in and being a part of
what we created and gave them

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:36.420
access to.

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:36.950
Hell no.

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:38.074
That's not what it's about.

00:23:38.074 --> 00:23:41.590
It was about desegregation
to change policies and access

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:44.130
to the very resources
that create power.

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:46.210
And that's scary.

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:47.290
And I'm sorry.

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:50.280
Not just to white folks--
there are black folks

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.170
that were scared of
that, because of how

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:52.895
they had been conditioned.

00:23:52.895 --> 00:23:54.080
ROLAND MARTIN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.250
JEFF JOHNSON: And because of
how they had been conditioned.

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:57.810
And I'm not disagreeing
with Carmen.

00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:00.930
I'm saying that the
narrative of integration

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:04.000
has persisted as the goal of
what civil rights was about.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.450
And that was never the goal. .

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:06.960
STEVE PERRY: In the space
within which I work,

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.560
which is education,
I often found myself

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:10.250
fighting people to
get them to understand

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:11.666
that African-American
children are

00:24:11.666 --> 00:24:13.530
as bright as any other
children on Earth.

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:15.780
They were born no differently,
no different process

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:16.650
to make them.

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:18.890
We all happen the same way.

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:20.800
The difference is
that when we come out

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.380
into a system that
was not designed

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:27.200
to support our overall growth,
we fall short of the beauty

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.030
that we have inside of us.

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:32.060
And so when Jeff is talking
about the disruption

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:34.800
of systems, what
that, for me, means

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:38.710
is the disruption of a system
that educates children or sends

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:40.550
children to schools
that are closest

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:45.290
to their house, addresses that
were determined by keeping

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:47.490
certain people away
from other people,

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:49.410
by systems that were
determined to ensure

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:51.520
that those children who
live in that neighborhood

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:56.930
will never gain the same access
to the quality of education

00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:00.550
that's required to participate
fully in the economy,

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:02.910
to know to read,
to know to write,

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:07.780
to have the basic self-esteem
to be able to sit in a room.

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:11.086
Many of my kids won't
ask a question, for fear

00:25:11.086 --> 00:25:12.460
that they will
think that someone

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:13.584
thinks that they're stupid.

00:25:13.584 --> 00:25:16.570
It's breaking down
those barriers.

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:19.580
Or worse still, that
they will answer those

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:22.560
questions and people will call
them white-- in either case,

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:24.850
they will somehow be
chastised for exploring

00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:26.220
the beauty that's inside them.

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:27.780
But this system
that is put in place

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:29.970
is not just some esoteric
notion of systems

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:31.500
that we often get caught up in.

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.670
But it's an actual set of
principles that ensures that

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:38.660
that which occurred in Baltimore
will continue to occur over

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:40.790
and over and over again,
regardless of the color

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:42.380
of the person that
you put in place,

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:45.550
until such time as people of all
colors get sick and tired of it

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:48.460
and say, man, this just
can't be America. .

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:51.440
We can't be this place
that promises a child

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.870
failure for the
rest of the life,

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:56.339
imprisons them for failing if
they only just did what they

00:25:56.339 --> 00:25:58.630
were supposed to do, which
was to go to the school that

00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:01.670
was never going to educate
them, and Blame the parents

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:02.600
or anyone else.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:07.310
It stops those individuals
who seek to give them freedom.

00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:09.550
I'll say the final part here.

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:12.190
The most revolutionary thing
you can do, Brother Roland,

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:16.440
is teach people who were
never supposed to be taught,

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:20.030
to show them that there is
nothing wrong with them,

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:22.520
to show them that they
are beautiful and capable,

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.240
to give them the
access to the wisdom,

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:28.940
because the root of every
revolution is education. .

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:33.870
And this is why it was one of
the laws on the slave books

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:38.670
that said very clearly it
was punishable by death.

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:41.280
Teach a slave to read,
and we will kill your ass.

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.070
DAVID STOVALL:
There's a part here

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:48.230
that I think we want to
kick this up a little bit,

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:50.430
because I appreciate
everybody's point.

00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:55.510
And it's staying around looking
at desegregation, integration,

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:57.020
and what you talk about power. .

00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:58.770
We should kick that
up a bit, because what

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:00.730
we're talking about is equity.

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:02.970
But there is a piece in equity.

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:06.020
Equity says that
some people who have

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:10.770
been further disenfranchised
might need more.

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:13.390
And herein lies the
problem, because remember

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:16.780
when Harold Washington
was elected, after 1987,

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:19.550
they changed the voting laws.

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:22.120
So here in Chicago, to
win a mayoral election,

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.919
you have to win 50% plus 1.

00:27:23.919 --> 00:27:25.460
ROLAND MARTIN: Where
the previous law

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:26.777
was whoever gets the top vote--

00:27:26.777 --> 00:27:27.610
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:29.110
ROLAND MARTIN: So
when he ran, there

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:31.450
were three people-- him,
Jane Byrne, the incumbent,

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:33.390
and Richard Daley, who
was States Attorney.

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:35.060
He comes in first.

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:37.850
Then a Democrat
running as a Republican

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:40.690
in November,
Washington barely wins,

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:42.540
because it was white black.

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:45.960
But yes, the moment he died,
they changed the law and said,

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.150
we will not have this
repeating itself.

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:51.450
And you have not had a black
mayor in Chicago since.

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:55.050
DAVID STOVALL: And you have not
had voter registration or voter

00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:58.480
turnout over 35%.

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:01.470
So now if we think about
that particular relationship,

00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:04.000
Harold Washington was clear,
and he was pragmatic in it.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.522
He talked about equity, right?

00:28:05.522 --> 00:28:07.480
So Harold Washington was
one of the first folks

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.850
to talk about
affordable housing.

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:11.900
So Harold Washington
had on the books,

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:16.009
if there was any unit have
built over six units--

00:28:16.009 --> 00:28:17.550
so that's any
apartment building that

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:20.360
had over six apartments
in it-- three of them

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:22.580
had to be affordable housing.

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:25.350
So now we're struggling in
Chicago for affordable housing

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:28.770
legislation at 20%.

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:33.060
So now, in thinking about
this equity, equity is saying,

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:36.150
no, you need what you
need when you need it.

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:38.960
That might mean that folks
who have historically

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:42.060
been disenfranchised
might need a little more

00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:43.760
in the larger equation.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.030
And herein lies the
question of power.

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:48.340
That's why random
dude with the comb

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:52.590
over can talk all this
crazy shit, right?

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:54.960
That's why he can say
these things, because he

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:59.480
can get folks to believe that
you now have lost something

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.790
that you never really had.

00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:02.420
You vote against
your own interest,

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:05.309
because if these folks get in
power, this is going to happen.

00:29:05.309 --> 00:29:07.600
Remember the advertisement
where Harold Washington when

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:08.860
Bernard Epton ran against him.

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:12.730
It was Bernard Epton or else.

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:14.960
Donald Trump is sitting in
front of folks and saying,

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:19.540
look, you better rock
with me, or else.

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:21.890
They coming for you, right?

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:25.870
This garbage last week--
what do you have to lose?

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:28.739
58% of your folks
are in poverty--

00:29:28.739 --> 00:29:30.530
whatever bullshit he
was talking about it--

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:32.460
and then saying me a chance.

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:33.740
What?

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:35.570
Because this thing
around now-- we

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:37.610
have to be able to
ask a deeper question,

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:40.630
because on top of equity,
we also need to understand--

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:44.070
and everybody talked about
this-- white supremacy

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:46.680
is not a group of white
extremists calling people

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.550
the N-word or lynching folks.

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:52.600
White supremacy is the
understood views and values

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:57.580
of Western European-descended
able-bodied heterosexual

00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:01.540
Christian men as normal
right and good. .

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:04.970
Everyone else is deserving
of gratuitous punishment

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:09.295
until they acquiesce to those
purported views and values.

00:30:09.295 --> 00:30:10.420
ROLAND MARTIN: Interesting.

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:13.340
Steve, you made a
point that I want

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:15.620
to come back to when you
talk about it in the law,

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:21.270
slaves couldn't read, because
when I hear people say,

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:26.750
can you all just call it
Black Lives Matter Too?

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:31.955
Can you just put the too on
the end so I feel comfortable?

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:39.540
Straight up, that's real.

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:42.710
As you were talking, I begin
to think about the fact--

00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:46.020
and then when Carmen said
being Latina involved in this

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:49.580
movement-- if you actually
look at American history,

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:53.040
not his-story-- some of you
going to catch that when you

00:30:53.040 --> 00:31:00.300
get [INAUDIBLE]-- black folks
have always tried to force

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:05.169
America to live up to
its written ideals.

00:31:05.169 --> 00:31:06.710
There's a white
woman sitting in here

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:10.630
right now that denies
the reality that they

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:14.570
have benefited from Affirmative
Action more than anybody else.

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:18.310
Title IX is talked about
as being about sports,

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:20.960
when in fact, Title
IX was about opening

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:25.150
the professional schools to be
professors, doctors, dentists,

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:26.540
lawyers.

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:30.765
Title IX is a provision of
the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

00:31:30.765 --> 00:31:33.330
Anybody here disabled?

00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:35.010
Anybody here disabled?

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:36.790
The Americans With
Disabilities Act

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:39.900
is a provision of
the Civil Rights Act.

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:42.830
If you are Vietnamese,
and you go vote,

00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:45.140
your ballot is in Vietnamese.

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:49.080
That's because of the
Voting Rights Act, 1965.

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.160
If you are gay and
lesbian, and you

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:53.170
are excited you can
now get married,

00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:57.390
the equal protection clause
comes from the amendment

00:31:57.390 --> 00:31:58.780
black folks fought.

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:00.980
You're in education.

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:03.230
Public finance
education in the South

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:06.670
was a result of free slaves
putting it in the Constitution.

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:09.500
So my point there--
black folks have always

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.355
fought for laws that everybody
in America has benefited from.

00:32:12.355 --> 00:32:13.480
CARMEN PEREZ: That's right.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.150
ROLAND MARTIN: So make the
point to folks who say,

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:19.880
but I don't have a place
in Black Lives Matter, when

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:22.380
if you change the laws
dealing with the cops,

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:23.849
it helps you too.

00:32:23.849 --> 00:32:25.890
STEVE PERRY: Well, you
know, it was David Walker,

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:28.810
in David Walker's Appeal, who
talked about the condition

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:31.510
of slavery being the worst.

00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:33.690
ROLAND MARTIN: Some say Latino.

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:34.810
You say Chicano.

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:36.720
There's a distinction.

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:38.510
CARMEN PEREZ: So
Hispanic is a term

00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:42.140
that was given to us
by the government,

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:45.110
and I don't
originate from Spain.

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:49.770
My people, who are Mexican,
are actually a rapeage.

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:55.290
So we didn't have this love
story about sitting on a panel,

00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:55.959
we fell in love.

00:32:55.959 --> 00:32:56.500
I don't know.

00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:58.450
But we are a rapeage of people.

00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:05.610
However, in 1843, there was
the Treaty of Guadalupe.

00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:07.110
So there is Chicanos.

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:11.550
There is Mexicanos that
were born in the Americas,

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:12.820
in North America.

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:15.330
So my father is 92 years old.

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:17.150
My great-grandparents
are from Texas.

00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:19.650
My great-great-grandparents
are from Texas.

00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:23.160
And so when the
US ended up taking

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:26.230
over Texas and California,
my great-grandparents

00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:28.630
became American citizens.

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:31.070
Unfortunately,
they were no longer

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:32.910
being able to keep their land.

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:35.360
So we are Chicanos because
we are a landless people.

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.250
But we are so very political.

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:39.350
We are politicized individuals.

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:42.140
The reason why there
are so many, I think,

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:45.190
Chicanos that can relate to the
African-American struggle-- I'm

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:48.380
not saying that we came
enslaved-- is the fact that we

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:52.150
are also incarcerated
at very large rates,

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:53.930
as African-Americans.

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:56.270
And so there's a difference
between a Mexicano

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:59.670
who just came to America
and has no connection

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:01.400
to the history here.

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:06.980
So for me, it's about learning
about Booker T. Washington,

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:09.949
learning about Marcus Garvey,
all these individuals.

00:34:09.949 --> 00:34:12.090
And so what I will
say, it's history.

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:13.800
It's the lack of education.

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.929
It's the fact that
a lot of individuals

00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:18.420
don't know the struggles.

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:20.239
Particularly in the
Latino community,

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:23.250
and maybe even in
the white community,

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:26.020
there's no connection to history
here in the United States.

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:27.420
ROLAND MARTIN: And I want
you to make a distinction

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:28.878
because the part
of this discussion

00:34:28.878 --> 00:34:33.210
when we talk about race--
when you say black,

00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:38.250
we're talking Alabama,
Mississippi, Georgia, Arkansas,

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:40.340
Texas, the Southern states.

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:41.969
That's what we're talking about.

00:34:41.969 --> 00:34:44.889
But when we talk about--
and I say Hispanic/Latino

00:34:44.889 --> 00:34:47.580
for a reason-- you're
talking about Cuban influence

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:48.489
in Florida.

00:34:48.489 --> 00:34:50.239
You're talking about
Dominican influence

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:54.210
and Puerto Rican influence in
New York, Chicanos in Texas,

00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:58.220
California You're dealing
there with nationality,

00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:01.540
as opposed to just this
group that is in America.

00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:04.610
That changes the discussion
when it comes to what

00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:05.810
are people fighting for.

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:06.550
Go ahead.

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:07.383
CARMEN PEREZ: Right.

00:35:07.383 --> 00:35:09.560
And so for me, I
always say I want

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:13.870
to remove the word Hispanic
from the census, because we

00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:15.310
don't come from Spain.

00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:16.947
Latino America,
you could say you

00:35:16.947 --> 00:35:18.280
could swallow a little bit more.

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:19.530
I say I'm Latina.

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:22.890
If I really want to have
people understand who I am,

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:23.672
I say I'm Chicana.

00:35:23.672 --> 00:35:26.160
And people will be like,
are you from Chicago?

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:27.650
No, I'm not from Chicago.

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:28.150
I'm Chicano.

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:29.460
ROLAND MARTIN: And most
people will actually

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:31.680
think Chicana means, oh,
you Latino from Chicago.

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:32.430
CARMEN PEREZ: Yes.

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:33.930
They actually do.

00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:37.740
But certainly, I think there's
this disconnection right?

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:40.140
And we've got to,
again, understand

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:41.270
who we're dealing with.

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.769
When.

00:35:41.769 --> 00:35:45.040
I'm talking about
black liberation,

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:51.230
I'm also looking at there are
1.9 Afro-Mexicanos in Mexico.

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:55.580
There's an erasure of
blackness in Latin America.

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:58.450
There's white-washing that
happens every single day when

00:35:58.450 --> 00:36:01.960
you turn on the telenovella,
and you see white people.

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:04.020
And the only people
that are people of color

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:08.140
are the servants or the maids.

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:10.440
And so I constantly talk
about this in regards

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:13.480
to my own people,
in the sense of we

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:17.160
are taught to glorify whiteness.

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.990
We are taught at
a very young age

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:23.300
that being moreno,
that being black,

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:27.100
is something not to be proud of.

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:30.900
And there's shade-ism
that happens in Latin

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:32.840
America every single day.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:36.790
And so for me, it's about
understanding that in my blood,

00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:38.710
there's African;
there's indigenous,

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:40.160
and there's European blood.

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:44.440
But the European blood
isn't because-- we

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.340
didn't have this love fest.

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:47.740
There was wars. .

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:50.960
There was the conquistadors--
Hernan Cortez--

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:53.450
that came to Mexico
with black slaves,

00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:56.840
with black people that
he then made into slaves.

00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:00.520
And and so for me, when we
talk about Black Lives Matter,

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:02.670
again, it is about power. .

00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:03.170
It's.

00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:05.390
About building collective power.

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:07.790
There are leaders all
over this country.

00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:12.100
We don't have just the
Malcolm Xs or the Dr. Kings.

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:13.780
It's a leaderful movement.

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:16.510
But what we want is
liberation for our people,

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:19.730
and we know that those currently
right now that are being

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:21.100
oppressed are black people.

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:23.580
And once Black Lives Matter,
then all lives matter.

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:24.910
ROLAND MARTIN: Dr.
Stovall, you earlier talked

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:26.000
about issue of power.

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:32.240
It's very interesting when
I listen to Jesse Williams

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:34.010
speak at the BET Awards.

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:37.310
And when we
mentioned freedom, he

00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:39.570
said that freedom is
somehow conditional here.

00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:41.850
She-- meaning Sandra
Bland-- would be alive

00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:44.780
if she hadn't acted so free.

00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:46.532
It's interesting to
me when I go back--

00:37:46.532 --> 00:37:48.740
Jeff you and I have had this
conversation as well-- I

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:53.790
go back, when I look at
more than three speeches Dr.

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:54.750
King gave.

00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:57.070
If you look at the
three books he actually

00:37:57.070 --> 00:38:01.890
wrote-- numerous speeches--
he rarely ever used

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:03.760
the word equality.

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:08.670
He always spoke of freedom. .

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:10.350
What's the difference?

00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:14.460
DAVID STOVALL: So I mean I think
when we talk about freedom,

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:18.110
and this is an equality, and
this is the thing, right?

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:22.722
So excuse this academic
thing happening.

00:38:22.722 --> 00:38:24.180
ROLAND MARTIN: You
are an academic.

00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:27.060
DAVID STOVALL: Right, right,
right, so they say, right?

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:29.450
Existential philosophers
say that anytime

00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:31.150
you have a conversation
of equality,

00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:34.980
the assumption is that things
are never equal, right?

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:39.000
And what that means is
when you're saying equal,

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.730
that's actually a term that is
actually assuming something.

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:47.430
It is assuming that
everyone has the same things

00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:49.560
to get the same things.

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:52.240
So when we talk about
an equal society,

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:54.090
that's not necessarily equal.

00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:58.990
It's always who has what,
and who has the least, right?

00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:03.340
Freedom is the capacity
to self-determine.

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:06.720
So when folks are talking
about their lives as mattering,

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:09.500
they're talking about a
call to self-determination,

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:12.070
a call that says
that my body is not

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:14.900
the receptacle for
gratuitous punishment,

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:19.090
that my body is not only my
own, but one that I can claim

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:21.660
and one that I actually
can move in the world

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:23.300
without persecution.

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:26.600
So now, this difference
between equality

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:30.390
is arguing that we all
need the same things.

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:33.500
That is the worst assumption.

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:37.210
Freedom says we have
to be courageous enough

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:39.730
to say, not only do we
need different things,

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:42.660
but we are willing to get
those different things

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:45.190
on our own terms.

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:48.020
And like Assata Shakur says,
freedom is something we

00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:49.590
don't know yet-- .

00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:51.880
we have a grand idea of.

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:55.300
And it is something that
we pursue relentlessly.

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:58.240
And in the relentless
pursuit of that freedom,

00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:02.230
we understand that our
bodies are in front of death

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:03.870
all the time when
that claim is made.

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:06.161
ROLAND MARTIN: Jeff, you
mentioned this relentlessness.

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:12.830
When the remake of "Roots" was
shown on the History Channel,

00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:15.600
that opening scene
of Kunta Kinte going

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:20.200
to the plantation-- he's
going, I only see three of them

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:22.200
and 100 of us.

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:25.236
How the hell are y'all
not taking them over?

00:40:25.236 --> 00:40:26.740
It was amazing to watch it.

00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:30.050
He was in this constant,
I'm fighting for my freedom.

00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:32.230
I just spoke at African
Arrival Day in Virginia,

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:34.630
where the first slaves
came to Point Comfort, now

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:36.752
Fort Monroe in Virginia--
this was on Saturday--

00:40:36.752 --> 00:40:38.190
where they recognize that.

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:40.810
And we have the
400th anniversary

00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:43.340
of remembrance in three years.

00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:46.810
But this constant
fight for freedom,

00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:50.805
that's the piece I don't think
a lot of Americans, including

00:40:50.805 --> 00:40:54.160
black folks understand--
that since 1619, we

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:58.370
have been in this constant
fight, every step of the way,

00:40:58.370 --> 00:41:00.020
whether it's siding
with the British

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:02.690
in the American Revolution,
whether it's coming out

00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:05.370
with Emancipation Proclamation--
this constant fight

00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:08.490
for freedom.

00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:10.150
JEFF JOHNSON: And
I think, Roland,

00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:14.900
even in the examples
you gave, those

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:21.150
are concrete examples of
institutional connection.

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:24.430
The fight for freedom
wasn't always about joining.

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:26.660
The fight for freedom
was remembering

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:28.650
I wasn't created for this.

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:30.560
So the songs that
I sing, the stories

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:33.040
that I tell my
children, the hope

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:37.700
that I give in this
ecosystem of hopelessness,

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:39.800
was all about
fighting for freedom.

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:42.970
And so, me helping you remember
your name, not the name

00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:45.250
given to you, but the
name that you have, me

00:41:45.250 --> 00:41:48.130
helping you remember
customs and creating customs

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:50.330
so that you are not
subjugated to what

00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:54.350
they tell you can practice--
all of that was about freedom.

00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:56.940
So you didn't have to lead a
slave revolt to be fighting

00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:58.620
for freedom on a daily basis.

00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:01.250
The fact that you
existed, waking up

00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:04.480
realizing this was not
what God meant for me to be

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:07.130
was a push towards freedom.

00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:10.820
I think the challenge, Roland,
as we talk about disruption,

00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:12.420
and we haven't talked
about this yet,

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:19.060
is we haven't dealt with the
reality of the consequences

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:20.840
of disruption.

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:23.790
Not the consequences of
perceived disruption,

00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:27.840
because we had a whole lot
of professional disruption

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:29.370
deceivers.

00:42:29.370 --> 00:42:31.100
ROLAND MARTIN:
Especially in this city.

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:32.100
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:34.330
ROLAND MARTIN: I'm
having a flashback.

00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:36.163
JEFF JOHNSON: There are
folks on television.

00:42:36.163 --> 00:42:38.400
There are folks in
organizations that

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:41.440
are paid to be
perceived as disruptors

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:43.720
but don't do any disrupting.

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:45.792
But people remember and
they know the stories--

00:42:45.792 --> 00:42:46.625
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:42:46.625 --> 00:42:47.110
ROLAND MARTIN: See, if
this was an all-black room.

00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:49.229
this would be
happening right now.

00:42:49.229 --> 00:42:50.020
I messing with you.

00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:50.520
Go ahead.

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:53.520
JEFF JOHNSON: So I
remember, because there

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:54.750
is a political side of this.

00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:56.333
There's a social
justice side of this.

00:42:56.333 --> 00:42:58.780
But there's also a corporate
institutional side of this.

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:03.780
And so I'm 43 years old and
remember the middle management

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:07.160
thing that corporate
America did that created

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:12.190
this ecosystem of black men that
could be in corporate America

00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:16.690
just high enough not
to feel marginalized,

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:18.555
but not high enough
to control anything.

00:43:18.555 --> 00:43:20.180
ROLAND MARTIN: VP of
community affairs.

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:20.860
STEVE PERRY: Always.

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:21.859
Or the Dean of Students.

00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:23.690
JEFF JOHNSON: When I
worked for the NAACP,

00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:26.273
we had one question we used to
ask black executives, which was

00:43:26.273 --> 00:43:29.610
how many white
people can you fire?

00:43:29.610 --> 00:43:30.747
I'm serious.

00:43:30.747 --> 00:43:31.580
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:32.780
JEFF JOHNSON: Because you
come with your big title,

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:34.430
and you're talking about all
these people, you can control.

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:35.000
ROLAND MARTIN: But do you
have P&amp;L responsibility?

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.940
JEFF JOHNSON: But if you
can't fire no white people.

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:37.600
ROLAND MARTIN: There you go.

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:39.725
JEFF JOHNSON: I'm not even
talking about the money,

00:43:39.725 --> 00:43:41.620
because you have black
pools of money, right?

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:43.947
And so you got your P&amp;L over
your black people stuff.

00:43:43.947 --> 00:43:45.530
But if you can't
fire no white people,

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:49.272
you really don't
have any importance.

scared, now, like he's

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:53.750

JEFF JOHNSON: Me and
boys used to joke

00:43:57.890 --> 00:44:00.780
that you could tell how
long somebody's dad had been

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:03.460
in corporate America
by how little bass

00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:06.840
they had left in their voice
and how little facial hair they

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:07.341
had.

00:44:07.341 --> 00:44:08.798
ROLAND MARTIN:
Damn, you said bass.

00:44:08.798 --> 00:44:11.362
JEFF JOHNSON: So there was
this piece where it was like,

00:44:11.362 --> 00:44:12.570
you roll up into the company.

00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:14.790
You're like, my name is Leroy.

00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:16.840
And I'm an intern
in the mail room.

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:21.840
And then hey, my name is
Leroy, and I'm an intern

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:23.400
in the finance department.

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:30.100
Hello, my name is Leroy, and
I'm the CFO of this corporation.

00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:32.100
And we laugh.

00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:36.880
But I saw the emasculation of
black men in corporate America

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:39.760
in the name of being
safe enough not

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:48.610
to make other people
uncomfortable about the power

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:53.100
that they brought just
by being black men.

00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:55.760
And the challenge that
I have is even now

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:59.670
we don't talk about the
consequence of disruption.

00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:02.460
So we create the
perception of disruption

00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:05.820
to make people feel like we're
really pissed off about stuff

00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:08.660
that we're not pissed off
about, because we're not really

00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:10.790
creating the
disruption, because even

00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:13.650
those that want
to see the change

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:16.500
are fearful of what has
happened to the disruptors.

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:18.530
So whether it was Nat
Turner or whether it

00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:21.660
was that guy that was a middle
manager in this corporation

00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:24.920
that just got too black that
one day, and as a result,

00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:27.510
he was minimized or
removed or fired,

00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:31.040
or that guy that came every day
and had to cut off the goatee,

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:33.470
because the goatee made somebody
else feel uncomfortable,

00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:35.650
or I dropped that
bass in my voice

00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:39.840
because my boss don't have it
in him, and as a result of it

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:43.470
he's intimidated every
time I'm my authentic self,

00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:45.060
we haven't talked
about that enough.

00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:48.270
And so there is a generation
that, even within Black Lives

00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:51.930
Matter-- and Carmen, tell me
if I'm wrong-- is operating off

00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:55.220
of a perception-- not
everybody-- but too many

00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:58.130
are operating off
perceptions of disruption.

00:45:58.130 --> 00:46:01.920
They say, how do we create
what looks like disruption,

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:04.890
but hasn't created
legitimate strategy that

00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:08.680
speaks to the dismantling
of institutions.

00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:13.040
That is risking more than
the perception of disruption

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:13.630
is risking.

feel, as a disruptor,

00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:28.830
that the media perceives
certain individuals as leaders

00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:30.970
within the Black Lives
Matter movement based

00:46:30.970 --> 00:46:32.134
on their followers.

You don't see these
individuals in the street.

ROLAND MARTIN: Based upon
their social media followers.

00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:37.740
CARMEN PEREZ: Social media
followers-- Twitter followers.

00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:38.340
ROLAND MARTIN: Not
actual followers.

00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:40.160
CARMEN PEREZ: So
these individuals

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:46.042
will get paid by corporations
to advertise whatever they're

00:46:46.042 --> 00:46:48.500
advertising on their shirts
while they're getting arrested.

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:53.260
But I will say,
as a disruptor, we

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:55.770
have several individuals
within our team

00:46:55.770 --> 00:46:58.720
in Justice League that have
different positions of power.

a gut punch at Dr. Stovall

we will look at how

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:09.600
to not only dismantle,
but infiltrate,

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:12.380
the systems that we're
trying to fight up against.

So if I was a disruptor
here in Google-- I'm joking.

I'm messing with y'all.

00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:21.250
I'm messing with y'all-- but one
of the things that I was being

00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:21.750
asked--

00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:23.155
ROLAND MARTIN: Security.

CARMEN PEREZ: --I
was being asked

00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:27.480
to do is I was taught to
do system accountability

00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:29.190
from within the system.

00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:30.270
So I learned.

00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:33.420
I went into the criminal
justice probation department

00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:36.990
to learn the language in order
to then come out and give

00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:38.710
that information back
to the community,

00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:41.320
so that we could then hold--

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:43.707
JEFF JOHNSON: The spook
that sat by the door.

00:47:43.707 --> 00:47:46.040
CARMEN PEREZ: And that's the
way in which my elders have

00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:46.990
taught me to do it.

00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:50.140
And then there's others that
will infiltrate, but then

00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:52.380
become that system.

00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:55.780
And I think that's what we
were trying to figure out,

00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:58.290
I think, sometimes, not only
in the Black Lives Matter

00:47:58.290 --> 00:47:59.875
movement, but in every movement.

while I was listening to-- I'm

00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:06.830
coming to you Steve-- Jeff
talk-- I use this phrase

00:48:06.830 --> 00:48:11.370
a lot, parking lot militants.

00:48:11.370 --> 00:48:14.067

some shit in the parking lot.

00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:17.450
ROLAND MARTIN: Oh
man, but then when

00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:19.720
you go back in that building,
to Jeff's point, what

00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:21.890
happened to your bass?

00:48:21.890 --> 00:48:23.570
And so, Steve, while
he was talking,

00:48:23.570 --> 00:48:25.720
he was talking about disrupting.

00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:31.510
I'm literally sitting here
remembering me and you at CNN

00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:36.230
and remembering cats telling
you to cut your hair,

00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:43.400
because it was too
wavy, and remembering

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:49.380
every show would get a readout
of voicemails that people left.

00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:52.170
In nearly every show, when I
was on Anderson Cooper's show,

00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:56.310
Paula Zahn's show, they would
come back and say, Roland,

00:48:56.310 --> 00:48:57.130
can you smile more?

00:48:57.130 --> 00:49:01.140
Can you smile more, because I
was kicking folks butts so bad,

00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:04.030
white folks watching
thought I was angry.

00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:08.620
Bill O'Reilly acting a fool
over here, and he's passionate.

00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:10.630
I'm passionate,
therefore, I'm angry.

00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:14.085
And I finally said,
if I smile anymore I'm

00:49:14.085 --> 00:49:16.310
going to be a damned mannequin.

00:49:16.310 --> 00:49:18.170
And so when you talk
about-- to Jeff's point

00:49:18.170 --> 00:49:20.610
about the flipside of
being a disruptor--

00:49:20.610 --> 00:49:24.190
the reality is, you will get
to the point where they say,

00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:25.330
all right. you know what?

00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:26.450
He too black.

00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:28.770
STEVE PERRY: So
there are disruptors,

00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:30.450
and there are commentators.

00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:34.090
And there are a lot of
people who are commentators.

00:49:34.090 --> 00:49:35.470
They can speak the speak.

00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:37.220
And they can present
themselves as if they

00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:38.890
are so radical and so focused.

00:49:38.890 --> 00:49:40.820
But asked them
ever, what have you

00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:44.485
disrupted other than a
conversation or dinner party?

00:49:44.485 --> 00:49:45.610
CARMEN PEREZ: That's right.

00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:47.680
STEVE PERRY: Like, what
really have you changed?

00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:51.090
ROLAND MARTIN: Did you ever
e-mail the CEO and push them?

00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:53.150
STEVE PERRY: There's that.

00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:58.000
One of the things I say,
typically, to African-Americans

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.340
who are on the come
up is live modestly,

00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:05.882
because too many
people who I know--

00:50:05.882 --> 00:50:08.340
they're laughing because they
know exactly what I'm talking

00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:10.720
about-- because the day
comes when your black ass is

about to be asked to leave.

00:50:13.170 --> 00:50:16.660
And if you care too
much about this job,

00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:19.730
then you have to
shut your mouth.

00:50:19.730 --> 00:50:21.820
If you think of
yourself as somebody

00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:25.500
who sees this a job,
and the only way

00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:27.980
that you will live or
maintain this lifestyle,

00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:29.540
you have to be silent.

To be a disruptor, you have
to accept you will be fired.

00:50:33.370 --> 00:50:35.060
You will be asked to leave.

00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:38.350
It is a condition of the
condition of those of us

to do something.

tired of people--

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:09.950

across the building
that you built?

Can I go to go sit down and
talk to the children whose lives

you've actually influenced?

00:51:23.350 --> 00:51:25.540
This is not a esoteric
policy conversation.

At some point,
there will be blood.

00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:30.120
There will be blood.

ago, all four tires on my car

00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:41.360
were slashed-- all four.

conversation for other people,

die incapable of learning,

broken, but because people

ain't disrupting nothing

00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:28.370
And everybody
trips the hell out.

00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:30.320
CARMEN PEREZ: I will
say, just to add,

00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:32.850
I think there's a
lane for everybody.

00:52:32.850 --> 00:52:34.300
There's a lane for everyone.

00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:36.550
There are those that
build the institutions.

00:52:36.550 --> 00:52:38.400
There's those that
work on policy.

00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:40.980
There are those that are
professional protesters.

00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:42.900
There are those
that are organizers.

00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:49.420
And one of the things that I
recently-- a lot of the work

00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:51.250
that we do is a
multi-pronged approach.

00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:54.060
I work, again, for the Gathering
for Justice and Justice League

00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:55.130
NYC.

00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:58.490
And ever since we
started working around

00:52:58.490 --> 00:53:01.910
the non-indictment
of Officer Daniel

00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:04.560
Pantaleo in the
killing of Eric Garner,

00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:06.470
you become a target,
because you're

00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:08.884
trying to disrupt something.

00:53:08.884 --> 00:53:10.800
ROLAND MARTIN: His point
with the tires, yeah.

00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:12.240
CARMEN PEREZ: You
become a target.

00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:15.720
And you get death threats.

00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:18.870
And you don't know-- you
get told by the mayor,

00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:23.510
you get a personal phone call
saying, you stop protesting.

00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:26.410
We put a moratorium
on protesting, right?

00:53:26.410 --> 00:53:29.150
And it's what you're
willing to do,

00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:31.520
and what you're
not willing to do.

00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:34.160
And so for me, it's
not about being silent.

00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:36.930
It's not about-- you talk about
the children and the lives

00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:40.720
of the people who you impact
because it's a life or death

00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:44.830
situation, not only for
them, but for yourself.

00:53:44.830 --> 00:53:48.240
Walking into prisons, you
get told before you walk

00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:50.790
in, and I've been doing
this for 20 years,

00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:54.370
we cannot negotiate your life.

00:53:54.370 --> 00:53:57.830
You got to understand that
you may not come out here.

00:53:57.830 --> 00:54:00.910
And what's interesting you
also have trolls, right?

00:54:00.910 --> 00:54:03.440
How many of you all got trolls?

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:05.780
I've got plenty of trolls.

00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:09.940
I'm an executive director
of an organization.

00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:17.320
And because I don't compromise,
and I say anything that I want,

00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:20.210
I don't get certain funding.

00:54:20.210 --> 00:54:22.350
I don't get certain
sponsorships.

00:54:22.350 --> 00:54:24.950
We make miracles happen
with rice and beans.

00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:26.500
For me, it's about
relationships,

00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:29.390
me calling Roland Martin
to come and host my gala.

00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:31.300
He's like all right,
sister, I got you.

00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:34.140
That's what it's about for me,
because at the end of the day,

00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:35.864
I'm not going to
compromise, and I'm not

00:54:35.864 --> 00:54:38.030
going to sell out the young
people that I work with.

00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:40.270
But I will say it
comes with a price.

00:54:40.270 --> 00:54:42.270
And sometimes that's
a deadly price.

00:54:42.270 --> 00:54:42.900
JEFF JOHNSON:
Roland, real quick,

00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:45.530
because I think I want to build
on what Carmen was saying.

00:54:45.530 --> 00:54:49.450
I think that because so often
we talk about disruptors

00:54:49.450 --> 00:54:51.990
through the lens of the
most aggressive disruptors,

00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:55.640
we negate those that are
playing on different parts

00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:57.620
of the chessboard.

00:54:57.620 --> 00:54:59.940
I remember, again
from a corporate side,

00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:01.940
I was a black student
union president,

00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:04.090
and I'm raising
hell on my campus,

00:55:04.090 --> 00:55:06.800
and we're addressing some
fundamental policy issues,

00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:09.490
and I'm looking at my dad
who's in corporate America,

00:55:09.490 --> 00:55:10.510
like, he a sellout.

00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:12.280
He's just getting paid.

00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:17.220
And he was a VP
of Human Resources

00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:19.280
and head of Affirmative
Action at the University

00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:20.786
of Cincinnati.

00:55:20.786 --> 00:55:23.550
And I didn't
understand the stakes

00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:27.190
until the University
of Cincinnati

00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:29.760
got audited for federal
formative action

00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:32.060
compliance for hiring.

00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:35.560
They gave him falsified
numbers to sign off on.

00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:37.920
He filed an obstruction
suit against them.

00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:38.840
He got fired.

00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:40.870
He was all of a
sudden incompetent.

00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:43.510
And it was then that
I said, wait a minute.

00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:46.020
When my dad was here,
more people of color

00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:48.440
got hired than got hired
when he wasn't there.

00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:51.710
There was better relationships
between labor and management

00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:53.650
when he was there
helping negotiate

00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:54.890
than when he wasn't there.

00:55:54.890 --> 00:55:56.500
The people there
got greater benefits

00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:58.630
when he was there than
when he wasn't there.

00:55:58.630 --> 00:56:00.940
I was looking through
the lens of this really

00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:02.900
aggressive, grassroots,
mobilization

00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:04.970
model as the only model.

00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:07.680
He was walking through the
shadows in corporate America,

00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:09.920
ensuring that people's
lives were better.

00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:14.240
And he still got caught as a
result of when the time came

00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:17.820
to decide whether or not I'm
going to continue to play

00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:19.620
this subversive
game, or whether I

00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:21.250
have to stop them
in their tracks,

00:56:21.250 --> 00:56:23.540
he decided to be the
ultimate disruptor.

00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:24.600
And he paid the cost.

00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:27.930
Six years later, his case got
kick backed from the US Supreme

00:56:27.930 --> 00:56:30.380
Court to the Sixth
Circuit Court of Appeals,

00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:34.290
where he had to take a
settlement, because the judge

00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:37.750
hearing the case was an
alum of the university

00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:40.610
and a former associate
of the firm representing

00:56:40.610 --> 00:56:43.450
the university and
wouldn't recuse herself.

00:56:43.450 --> 00:56:47.670
And so at some point, no matter
where you play disruptor,

00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:49.690
you come up against
the realities

00:56:49.690 --> 00:56:52.690
of the systematic
oppression that's real.

00:56:52.690 --> 00:56:54.550
And so until,
regardless of where

00:56:54.550 --> 00:56:56.650
we are on that chess
board, whether we're

00:56:56.650 --> 00:57:00.022
chipping away at it by being
inside of these systems,

00:57:00.022 --> 00:57:01.730
trying to do what we
can from the inside,

00:57:01.730 --> 00:57:04.150
or we're outside
trying to push as hard

00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:06.150
as we can to crack
them from the outside,

00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:09.540
if we're not playing chess,
then at the end of the day,

00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:12.040
we're risking people
on the outside that

00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:14.499
are willing to be aggressive
without playing an inside game

00:57:14.499 --> 00:57:15.581
that's more sophisticated.

00:57:15.581 --> 00:57:17.940
ROLAND MARTIN: I mentioned
a couple of books earlier.

00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:20.500
I'm very much a
reader, and as you

00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:24.730
were talking about
disruptors, revolutionaries,

00:57:24.730 --> 00:57:27.223
who might look different,
immediately came

00:57:27.223 --> 00:57:33.070
to mind former staff writer
of the "Chicago Defender," who

00:57:33.070 --> 00:57:35.720
John Sengstacke,
sends to Michigan,

00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:39.120
takeover the "Michigan
Chronicle," Louis Martin.

00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:41.624
The book is called "Walking
With Presidents-- Louis

00:57:41.624 --> 00:57:43.540
Martin and the Rise of
Black Political Power,"

00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:45.300
by Alex Poinsett.

00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:48.530
And perfect example--
brother working

00:57:48.530 --> 00:57:52.780
in the Kennedy administration,
Johnson administration.

00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:55.370
Some folks said, man,
you selling out. .

00:57:55.370 --> 00:57:59.130
And what he's doing is placing
folks in different positions,

00:57:59.130 --> 00:58:03.700
advising the president,
literally affecting power.

00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:08.610
Bob Brown accompanied Coretta
Scott King to the airport

00:58:08.610 --> 00:58:10.280
to get Dr. King's body.

00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:12.580
Nixon hires him in
the administration.

00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:15.829
He had no designated portfolio,
but was doing exactly what

00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:17.120
you were saying to folks there.

00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:18.790
But how you work it with Nixon?

00:58:18.790 --> 00:58:22.330
He's saying, but this is
what I'm doing inside.

00:58:22.330 --> 00:58:25.590
So Dr. Stovall, getting
people to understand

00:58:25.590 --> 00:58:31.680
that this idea of being a
revolutionary and a disruptor

00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:33.600
looks totally
different depending

00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:36.700
upon what the goal is--
is it important for folks

00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:39.790
to have the conversations to get
a better sense of that person

00:58:39.790 --> 00:58:41.930
as an individual
to go, oh, now, I

00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:44.200
see what you're about, as
opposed to simply making

00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:45.210
assumptions externally.

00:58:47.930 --> 00:58:50.400
DAVID STOVALL: Real talking,
to be totally confessional

00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:55.130
about this, I was the worst
in assuming things of folks,

00:58:55.130 --> 00:58:57.160
in terms of their appearance.

00:58:57.160 --> 00:59:00.990
So in terms of seeing someone,
I'm like, man, that chump.

00:59:00.990 --> 00:59:02.070
I'll rock him the face.

00:59:02.070 --> 00:59:02.820
Man, come on, man.

00:59:02.820 --> 00:59:04.290
He playing with me, right?

00:59:04.290 --> 00:59:08.380
And what I really
didn't understand

00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:11.820
was actually, folks who
look like that actually

00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:13.350
got me into grad school.

00:59:13.350 --> 00:59:14.960
Real talk, right?

00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:18.190
And I think the other
thing to understand--

00:59:18.190 --> 00:59:20.030
and the point that
everybody made--

00:59:20.030 --> 00:59:23.350
if you have made any type
of commitment to justice,

00:59:23.350 --> 00:59:26.200
it is never if they are coming.

00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:28.770
It is when they are coming.

00:59:28.770 --> 00:59:30.810
So you have to be prepared
for when they come.

00:59:30.810 --> 00:59:33.270
And I learned that
from folks who

00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:36.190
may not have the same
type of disposition,

00:59:36.190 --> 00:59:39.980
but also who are very clear
about how they understood

00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:42.700
the justice condition,
because I think that there's

00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:46.119
many ways for us to approach
what the justice condition is.

00:59:46.119 --> 00:59:48.410
When you were talking, the
first person I thought about

00:59:48.410 --> 00:59:50.370
was Ella Baker.

00:59:50.370 --> 00:59:51.810
Ella Baker was very clear.

00:59:51.810 --> 00:59:55.020
ROLAND MARTIN: One of the
greatest unknown organizers

00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:55.960
in history.

00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:57.790
DAVID STOVALL: And
what did she say?

00:59:57.790 --> 01:00:01.250
We are the ones we
have been waiting for.

01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:04.870
So what does it mean to
actually move in that light,

01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:07.630
because the thing is always
now-- and I love Dead Prez.

01:00:07.630 --> 01:00:09.250
Used to say this
all the time-- I

01:00:09.250 --> 01:00:12.370
don't care what you come to
the revolution looking like.

01:00:12.370 --> 01:00:14.340
I just want you to
come to the revolution.

01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:15.850
You could bespoked up.

01:00:15.850 --> 01:00:18.170
You could have it fried,
dyed, laid to the side.

01:00:18.170 --> 01:00:19.620
You could have a bunch of locks.

01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:21.880
You would have a fro as big
as the one me and my pops

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:22.421
used to rock.

01:00:22.421 --> 01:00:24.666
That doesn't even
matter, as long

01:00:24.666 --> 01:00:27.040
as you are there, and as long
as you are determining what

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.730
is that justice as condition.

01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:32.270
Because if we are able to agree
on that justice condition,

01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:34.910
we can now figure
out the numerous ways

01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:36.850
to move to make sure
that it happens.

01:00:36.850 --> 01:00:39.391
ROLAND MARTIN: I know you all
are going to get tired of this.

01:00:39.391 --> 01:00:41.690
But I have this book too,
which is phenomenal--

01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:44.840
"Ella Baker and the Black
Freedom Movement-- a Radical

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:47.000
Democratic Vision"
by Barbara Ransby.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.458
DAVID STOVALL:
Right up the street.

01:00:48.458 --> 01:00:51.690
ROLAND MARTIN: To understand
Ella Baker continuum--

01:00:51.690 --> 01:00:56.140
progressive politics in the
'40s, NAACP field secretary,

01:00:56.140 --> 01:01:00.920
is SCLC creator, SNCC creatot--
that's a continuum there

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:02.060
all throughout.

01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:03.662
We're going to go to questions.

01:01:03.662 --> 01:01:04.870
All right, we got microphone.

01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:07.027
Come on up.

01:01:07.027 --> 01:01:08.110
AUDIENCE: So Dr. Stovall--

01:01:08.110 --> 01:01:10.068
ROLAND MARTIN: You've
been taking notes, I see.

01:01:10.068 --> 01:01:13.560
AUDIENCE: I have
been You mentioned

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:16.120
a definition of white
supremacy that I've never

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:19.530
heard anyone articulate
in such an important way,

01:01:19.530 --> 01:01:21.570
and I think it's
really interesting.

01:01:21.570 --> 01:01:25.910
How do we support--
all of us-- how

01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:30.190
do we support what we're trying
to do here without raising

01:01:30.190 --> 01:01:34.190
the ire of that particular
group of people that are now

01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:36.470
out there supporting
people like Donald Trump?

01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:38.710
What's the balance, and
I think it goes back

01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:41.140
to your last point
of god, I'd like

01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:44.490
to find a way to do
this without alienating

01:01:44.490 --> 01:01:47.240
and sort of bringing out
the worst of the people who

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:50.750
feel intimidated now by those
of us who want to change.

01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:53.155
DAVID STOVALL: Well, I think
this is the thing right.

01:01:53.155 --> 01:01:54.840
And thank you for that question.

01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:57.140
I don't think that
should be our job.

01:01:57.140 --> 01:01:58.620
And I don't think that we can.

01:01:58.620 --> 01:02:01.360
Because I think
the misconception

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:04.930
is that we want to win
people over to our side.

01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:06.030
That's not it.

01:02:06.030 --> 01:02:09.360
The thing is we want to
recognize what this thing is.

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:12.510
We can disagree about it, but
I want folks to understand

01:02:12.510 --> 01:02:14.510
how this affects folks.

01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:16.300
What does it mean
in the day-today,

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:19.370
because this thing-- you can
argue all day with someone

01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:21.230
about their particular
disposition,

01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:23.900
but it's really this thing
around if you have made

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:26.160
a conscious decision to
the justice condition,

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.790
you have already become
confrontational before you've

01:02:28.790 --> 01:02:30.987
even had the conversation.

01:02:30.987 --> 01:02:32.320
I mean it's one of those things.

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:34.650
I mean, it's not about
being appeasing to folks.

01:02:34.650 --> 01:02:36.770
I mean, I think that's
the mistake we make.

01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:39.750
It's not about being
friendly enough.

01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:42.000
It's like, look, this
is happening now.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.340
If we're really about
where we stand on things--

01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:48.790
and this is another thing,
once people reveal themselves,

01:02:48.790 --> 01:02:53.640
now you know how to move,
because once that person shows

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:56.880
up, you say, OK,
that's that one.

01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:57.910
I need to go elsewhere.

01:02:57.910 --> 01:02:59.980
Here's the work,
because what we want

01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:02.050
to do, in this larger
justice condition,

01:03:02.050 --> 01:03:04.390
we want those folks to
show their ugly head.

01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:06.340
Now we know we're
dealing with right.

01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:09.590
It's harder with that
person smiles and now does

01:03:09.590 --> 01:03:11.210
the little passive
aggressive thing,

01:03:11.210 --> 01:03:13.080
and now the door is
closing, and they

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:16.600
got two AK-47s waiting for you.

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:18.430
So in Chicago, we used
to crack this joke.

01:03:18.430 --> 01:03:20.840
When you go to a
meeting with anybody

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:23.400
in the city of Chicago, the
mayor's office or whoever,

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:26.680
you have to understand that
there's a .38 on the table.

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:31.890
As soon as you turn your back,
someone's brains is blown out.

01:03:31.890 --> 01:03:36.370
Walk backwards once
you leave the table.

01:03:36.370 --> 01:03:40.590
And that sounds extreme, but
this thing around when we get

01:03:40.590 --> 01:03:43.420
caught into that idea
around conversion,

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:46.200
we obfuscate what
we're trying to do,

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:49.780
which is to identify
how this affects folks

01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:53.310
and then what this justice
condition is, and now, how

01:03:53.310 --> 01:03:55.510
we are committed to pursue it.

01:03:55.510 --> 01:03:59.940
Because I believe that all
those folks will now start--

01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:03.500
we always like to use
this term-- self-select

01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:04.610
and go elsewhere.

01:04:04.610 --> 01:04:06.651
ROLAND MARTIN: We also
make the mistake, I think,

01:04:06.651 --> 01:04:10.190
of trying to make
everybody comfortable,

01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:13.209
when the reality is this
is all uncomfortable.

01:04:13.209 --> 01:04:15.000
STEVE PERRY: At it's
core, it's disruptive.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.960
I mean, the expectation is
that the only way we will truly

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:20.030
become the country
who we set out to be

01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:23.200
or the person that you set out
to be is to change your habits.

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:25.430
The only way you're
going to lose weight

01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:28.060
is to change the way
you eat, increase

01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:30.580
your cardio, whatever it is.

01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:32.734
Change is by design disruptive.

01:04:32.734 --> 01:04:34.150
ROLAND MARTIN:
Well, first of all,

01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:36.350
you've got to acknowledge
that you want to change.

01:04:36.350 --> 01:04:37.870
STEVE PERRY: Well, there's that.

01:04:37.870 --> 01:04:41.090
But once you've done that,
once you've called for change,

01:04:41.090 --> 01:04:41.840
you have to do so.

01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:45.124
For instance, in
hiring, you have

01:04:45.124 --> 01:04:47.790
to look beyond the circumstances
that you typically look beyond.

01:04:47.790 --> 01:04:49.090
You have to look for
different skill sets.

01:04:49.090 --> 01:04:50.920
You have to be willing to
open your mind and heart

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.830
through the fact that somebody
may look at the problem

01:04:52.830 --> 01:04:53.670
differently.

01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:55.140
And so they may
not be an answer.

01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:57.760
There may be multiple answers,
and as a result of which,

01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.750
you become disruptive
to the hiring practice,

01:04:59.750 --> 01:05:01.790
thereby creating an
entirely new conversation

01:05:01.790 --> 01:05:03.650
within your organization.

01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:06.260
And so it's not just
about-- one of the problems

01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:08.220
I have, for instance,
with the Democratic Party

01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:10.180
is this notion of diversity.

01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:13.144
Yeah, the colors were different.

01:05:13.144 --> 01:05:14.560
But they all got
up there and said

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:17.570
some version of the same thing.

01:05:17.570 --> 01:05:19.600
So I didn't really
see diversity.

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:23.130
I saw a different colored people
and some different genders,

01:05:23.130 --> 01:05:24.660
of course.

01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:29.040
But at the end of the day,
there wasn't true diversity.

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:31.430
And so in order for us
to have the conversation

01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:34.870
around disruption, we have to
be comfortable with the idea

01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:36.590
that this disruption
is going to be

01:05:36.590 --> 01:05:39.184
at its core uncomfortable
for a spell.

01:05:39.184 --> 01:05:40.850
ROLAND MARTIN: It's
funny you said that,

01:05:40.850 --> 01:05:43.141
because Oprah Winfrey is on
the cover of the "Hollywood

01:05:43.141 --> 01:05:44.620
Reporter" Ava
DuVernay this week. .

01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:50.100
And Oprah says she has removed
diversity from her vocabulary

01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:52.670
because Ava has taught
her, no, forget diversity.

01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:54.170
We want inclusion.

01:05:54.170 --> 01:05:55.790
You want to be at the table.

01:05:55.790 --> 01:05:58.575
She said, not just diverse--
it's about inclusion.

01:05:58.575 --> 01:06:01.766
STEVE PERRY: And at the table
in a position where your voice

01:06:01.766 --> 01:06:03.140
matters as much
as anyone else's.

01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:05.306
There are times in which
I've been part of movements

01:06:05.306 --> 01:06:07.329
where they call me after
a decision has been

01:06:07.329 --> 01:06:08.620
made that we're having a march.

01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:10.660
And I'm like, what the hell?

01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:13.940
If I'm part of this,
shouldn't I been

01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:18.410
communicated with when you
were considering the action?

01:06:18.410 --> 01:06:20.840
Shouldn't my opinion
have mattered as much?

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:23.610
See, inclusion in
that sense, is when

01:06:23.610 --> 01:06:26.090
my voice matters
as much as anyone

01:06:26.090 --> 01:06:27.880
else's in the conversation.

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:31.460
And until such time as my voice
is seen-- at the start of this,

01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:34.660
I acknowledged that we don't
have a lot of women up here,

01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:37.860
because I think it's
important that it be clear

01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:42.000
that I recognize that, that
I'm not OK with the fact

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.900
that from a parity perspective
I'm calling and saying,

01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:47.080
what we need to do as
people, and I'm calling

01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:49.160
upon other people,
but on the same token

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:52.580
not acknowledging
my own conversation,

01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:56.590
that we in this stage, if
nothing else, in diversity

01:06:56.590 --> 01:06:58.720
of thought, would have
a diversity agenda here.

01:06:58.720 --> 01:06:59.780
ROLAND MARTIN: Let's
go to questions.

01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:01.340
Of course, folks
who are watching,

01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:03.150
you can also ask questions.

01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:05.050
So it's Ana Turner.

01:07:05.050 --> 01:07:08.780
How can corporations best
participate in racial justice

01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:12.940
without undermining
existing social movements?

01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:13.630
Who wants that?

01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:16.010
DAVID STOVALL: There is
a great science educator

01:07:16.010 --> 01:07:18.180
by the name of
Jomo Mutegi, who's

01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:21.050
at the University of
Indiana Indianapolis.

01:07:21.050 --> 01:07:22.420
ROLAND MARTIN: You're going to
have to spell that one later.

01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:23.253
DAVID STOVALL: Yeah.

01:07:23.253 --> 01:07:25.720
And Jomo always
makes this point.

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:28.390
He says, here's what you can do.

01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:33.360
He says, first,
you can apologize.

01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:42.230
Second, do not start to join or
make claims about a commitment

01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:45.460
to anything that you are
not willing to support.

01:07:45.460 --> 01:07:48.530
Third, get out of the way.

01:07:51.090 --> 01:07:53.490
So it's always
these things around,

01:07:53.490 --> 01:07:56.810
because a lot of times-- this
is a thing in education we often

01:07:56.810 --> 01:07:57.800
talk about this.

01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:02.400
The word help is temporary.

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:04.590
We're talking about
solidarity, which

01:08:04.590 --> 01:08:05.710
is a very different thing.

01:08:05.710 --> 01:08:07.410
It is a more contested word.

01:08:07.410 --> 01:08:09.340
It means something different.

01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:12.130
It means that you
have agreed to support

01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:16.460
something that will challenge
you in the support of it.

01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:18.189
So now I think that
becomes important,

01:08:18.189 --> 01:08:23.010
because I hate it when I hear
folks say, I just want to help.

01:08:23.010 --> 01:08:25.370
We don't need that.

01:08:25.370 --> 01:08:28.029
I want to be clear about
that, because all that is

01:08:28.029 --> 01:08:31.090
is temporary, and all
that is a feel good thing.

01:08:31.090 --> 01:08:32.720
What we want folks
to do is to be

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:35.340
able to challenge their
existence in this.

01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:37.510
We got to ask a different
set of questions,

01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:40.912
because I might even depart
at a different space,

01:08:40.912 --> 01:08:43.120
because when we look at the
language of this country,

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:45.220
we see something
different, not just

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:46.830
in the Emancipation
Proclamation,

01:08:46.830 --> 01:08:48.580
not just in the Constitution.

01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:51.960
We need to read stuff like
the Federalist Papers,

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:53.180
particularly.

01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:55.330
Like Federalist Papers--
as [INAUDIBLE] talks

01:08:55.330 --> 01:08:58.430
about-- Federalist
Papers 2, 10, and 22,

01:08:58.430 --> 01:08:59.880
that talks about
the United States

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:02.609
as being a country
in and of its space

01:09:02.609 --> 01:09:06.170
being preserved for white men.

01:09:06.170 --> 01:09:09.260
So now we begin to
ask those questions.

01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:10.399
It's not about us helping.

01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:13.300
It's how are we willing
to challenge ourselves

01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:17.080
in a very particular
way and then get out

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:19.130
of the way to let folks
who have committed

01:09:19.130 --> 01:09:20.930
to do this work do this work.

01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:22.210
ROLAND MARTIN: And first, about
what you're laying out, also,

01:09:22.210 --> 01:09:24.510
about understanding that
you're understanding

01:09:24.510 --> 01:09:26.720
how the nation was
constructed, which

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:29.390
means that you're understanding
the DNA of America.

01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:31.340
So when you actually
go through all of that,

01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:37.290
you can actually tie the
Federalist Papers to 2016.

01:09:37.290 --> 01:09:41.279
I just got an email-- and
he said it on Saturday

01:09:41.279 --> 01:09:43.819
when I was with him, Virginia
governor Terry McAuliffe,

01:09:43.819 --> 01:09:45.960
when he restored the
voting rights of 13,000

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:47.229
formerly incarcerated.

01:09:47.229 --> 01:09:50.109
What folks don't realize is
the law that prevented them

01:09:50.109 --> 01:09:54.770
from voting was literally
based upon a legislator or 1902

01:09:54.770 --> 01:09:57.740
who said, this is to
keep darkies from voting.

01:09:57.740 --> 01:10:00.250
And he said, I'm
restoring these rights,

01:10:00.250 --> 01:10:03.880
because the law was based
on a racist premise. .

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:07.930
But folks, in 2016, we're still
fighting to uphold that law

01:10:07.930 --> 01:10:11.680
but had no idea-- they
claim-- of the history.

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:12.350
Carmen.

01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:14.010
CARMEN PEREZ:
There's also what's

01:10:14.010 --> 01:10:15.520
called Solidarity Summit.

01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:19.250
There's about 40 of us that
travel across the country with

01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:23.470
OSI-- Open Society Institute--
and the Ford Foundation,

01:10:23.470 --> 01:10:27.990
and we actually do some
really deep digging around

01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:31.380
our personal cultures and
do cultural exchanges. .

01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:33.130
And I think that's
also important to do.

01:10:33.130 --> 01:10:34.890
And when you look
at-- one of the things

01:10:34.890 --> 01:10:39.510
that I know in any institution
is usually I'm the only Latina.

01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:42.190
I'm the only woman.

01:10:42.190 --> 01:10:48.430
Or I'm younger than
everybody by 10 or 20 years.

01:10:48.430 --> 01:10:52.132
And so I will say that one of
the things that I've learned

01:10:52.132 --> 01:10:54.590
is that people will say, well,
it's because people of color

01:10:54.590 --> 01:10:56.160
aren't qualified.

01:10:56.160 --> 01:11:00.450
We don't have qualified
people, so that we could

01:11:00.450 --> 01:11:02.417
hire them to do this work.

01:11:02.417 --> 01:11:03.750
And I think that needs to shift.

01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:06.420
You were talking about not
just diversity in color,

01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:11.890
but also diversity in
age, diversity in gender,

01:11:11.890 --> 01:11:14.440
in different levels.

01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:16.730
But it's not just about
being at the table.

01:11:16.730 --> 01:11:19.250
It's the fact that when
you're creating something,

01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:23.080
bring those that are impacted
or those that you're actually

01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:26.080
looking to serve to actually
be a part of that conversation,

01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:27.170
like you were saying.

01:11:27.170 --> 01:11:31.240
But I know for me, one of the
things I constantly look at

01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:34.680
is am I taking up
too much space?

01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:38.210
Especially being a Latina in
a Black Lives Matter movement,

01:11:38.210 --> 01:11:42.700
or being an older person
working with youth,

01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:45.500
am I taking up too much space?

01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:50.130
And also, am I giving
individuals the opportunity

01:11:50.130 --> 01:11:53.140
and also supporting and
cultivating their leadership,

01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:53.670
right?

01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:55.950
And it's also about
relationship building.

01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:57.859
It's not about, like,
oh, you know what?

01:11:57.859 --> 01:11:59.400
You know, I don't
have black friends,

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:01.940
so now I'm going to go
make some black friends

01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:04.850
and ask them every
race question.

01:12:04.850 --> 01:12:07.960
It's about you know
what, like I really

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:11.510
want to be intentional
about who I'm talking to

01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:14.020
and who I'm building
relationships with.

01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:17.154
Go ahead.

01:12:17.154 --> 01:12:18.820
But I just kind of
want to offered that,

01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:22.350
just because I also know there
are white people that do this

01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:26.610
work around Black Lives Matter,
and there are white allies. .

01:12:26.610 --> 01:12:31.200
And sometimes they
take up a lot of space.

01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:33.670
They're the ones that are
showing up to the protest.

01:12:33.670 --> 01:12:35.810
They're the ones that
are doing the chants.

01:12:35.810 --> 01:12:38.930
And sometimes you gotta
remind them of their space.

01:12:38.930 --> 01:12:41.540
And I sometimes don't want
to remind all white people

01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:43.610
of where they need to be.

01:12:43.610 --> 01:12:47.510
What I will say is that
they'll be out there fighting

01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:49.020
for the liberation
of black people,

01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:51.436
but when you go to their dinner
table, ain't nobody black.

01:12:51.436 --> 01:12:53.370
So I just kind of want
to point that out.

01:12:53.370 --> 01:12:54.270
JEFF JOHNSON: Real
quick, Roland,

01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:56.228
because I think that
there are a couple things.

01:12:56.228 --> 01:12:58.920
One is I think companies
have the ability

01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:02.220
to do two really easy
things-- well, not easy,

01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:03.400
but pragmatic things.

01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:06.750
One is create ecosystems of
conversation that traditionally

01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:08.080
didn't happen before.

01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:09.730
And so how do you
create ecosystems

01:13:09.730 --> 01:13:10.740
versus echo chambers?

01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:13.700
So often within
institutions, people are just

01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:14.940
shouting at each other.

01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:17.580
Sometimes they're shouting
at each other in silence.

01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:21.870
So when two black men get shot
by police and police officers

01:13:21.870 --> 01:13:25.150
get shot, people may not
be shouting at each other,

01:13:25.150 --> 01:13:26.720
but they're shouting
at each other.

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:29.460
So I know what side you're on.

01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:31.770
And we're walking by each
other in the hallway at work.

01:13:31.770 --> 01:13:33.470
And we ain't saying nothing.

01:13:33.470 --> 01:13:36.000
But I know you
support them cops,

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.020
or I know you support
them black folks.

01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:41.227
And we're shouting at each
other, but nobody's listening.

01:13:41.227 --> 01:13:43.560
And so how can you be courageous
enough as a corporation

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:46.310
to create ecosystems where
it's not about whether it's

01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:47.660
Blue Lives or Black Lives.

01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:50.300
It's how do we create
ecosystems in our firms

01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:53.720
that create space to have
difficult dialogue that

01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:57.915
doesn't become
judgemental or combative.

01:13:57.915 --> 01:14:00.160
And isn't about walking
away with agreement,

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:02.160
because I think so often
these conversations are

01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:04.950
about do we walk away agreeing
versus do we walk away

01:14:04.950 --> 01:14:06.160
better understanding?

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:08.790
The second thing is
how do we support

01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:12.870
the individual passions of our
employees without repercussion?

01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:14.810
And so as long as I'm
engaged in something

01:14:14.810 --> 01:14:18.330
that's not breaking
the law, can my company

01:14:18.330 --> 01:14:19.890
support me doing that?

01:14:19.890 --> 01:14:22.900
Third, how do we have
better conversations

01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:26.120
about the ecosystem of impact,
because, to Carmen's point,

01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:27.840
it's not necessarily
about Google

01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:30.990
showing up with Google shirts
at the Black Lives Matter rally.

01:14:30.990 --> 01:14:35.300
It's about where is
there an economic impact

01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:39.380
of a certain demographic of
customers of our corporations,

01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:43.290
and how do we engage them
in conversation or support

01:14:43.290 --> 01:14:45.810
in ways that are beyond
showing up at a rally?

01:14:45.810 --> 01:14:47.460
Where's the economic impact?

01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:49.840
And I think in the
movement, we don't always

01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:52.720
have economic impact-based
conversations.

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:56.660
So where is the
social venture impact

01:14:56.660 --> 01:14:59.550
opportunities for companies
to say, wait a minute.

01:14:59.550 --> 01:15:02.040
I'm not going to be on the
front line of this movement.

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:05.370
But I am going to support the
development of new schools

01:15:05.370 --> 01:15:08.320
that impact this community in
a way that reduces violence,

01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:10.280
because more opportunity
less violence?

01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:12.570
Or I am going to have
a conversation where

01:15:12.570 --> 01:15:16.120
why can't companies begin--
I'm confused about why

01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:20.890
in Chicago, there has not been
a public meeting of corporations

01:15:20.890 --> 01:15:23.510
about what's the economic
impact of violence

01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:25.794
to the city of Chicago,
where companies

01:15:25.794 --> 01:15:26.960
begin to say, wait a minute.

01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:30.420
We have a responsibility to
development of infrastructure

01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:31.780
and support in a city.

01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:32.910
I know I'm reaching.

01:15:32.910 --> 01:15:35.320
But what I'm saying
is she asked what

01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:37.950
were the potential solutions
of ways they can participate

01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:40.310
in racial justice
without undermining

01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:41.640
the existing social movement.

01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:43.090
Play your role.

01:15:43.090 --> 01:15:46.660
And your role is in the
impact of the economy.

01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:49.110
And so how do you do that
by having conversations

01:15:49.110 --> 01:15:52.980
with those that are impacted by
the economic impact of violence

01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:56.140
in Chicago or lack of
education in Baltimore.

01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:59.610
But I don't see those companies
feeling like they're invited

01:15:59.610 --> 01:16:04.280
or feeling the responsibility to
lead those discussions to talk

01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:07.600
about a whole another set
of ecosystem that impacts

01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:09.624
racial and social
justice without getting

01:16:09.624 --> 01:16:11.040
in the way of those
on the ground.

01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:13.373
ROLAND MARTIN: My answer to
this question is very quick.

01:16:13.373 --> 01:16:15.590
Before you decide
to get involved

01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:20.120
in some external movement,
look inside your company first,

01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:23.450
because it's just like my
biggest criticism of mainstream

01:16:23.450 --> 01:16:24.270
media.

01:16:24.270 --> 01:16:27.900
Mainstream media can't call
out the Republican Party

01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:30.280
when it comes to outreach
of black folks, when they

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:31.800
don't outreach to black folks.

01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:34.830
And so it's very hard for
you to say, oh, no, no, no,

01:16:34.830 --> 01:16:36.090
we support that.

01:16:36.090 --> 01:16:38.940
But then when you look inward,
you go, oh, wait a minute.

01:16:38.940 --> 01:16:41.970
So when Reverend Jackson
targeted Silicon Valley,

01:16:41.970 --> 01:16:43.520
he said, you can't
have officials

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:46.030
of Silicon Valley
writing checks that's

01:16:46.030 --> 01:16:49.330
supporting organizations, to
your point, wearing the shirts,

01:16:49.330 --> 01:16:52.610
but employing less than
1% of certain groups,

01:16:52.610 --> 01:16:55.740
and not just in science and
technology, when the reality is

01:16:55.740 --> 01:16:59.490
60% of all Silicon Valley jobs
don't even involve technology.

01:16:59.490 --> 01:17:02.560
It's your accounting firms,
law firms, advertiser firms,

01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:03.820
marketing firms.

01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:07.710
So any company, look at yourself
first before you go outside,

01:17:07.710 --> 01:17:09.090
because you might
get called out.

01:17:09.090 --> 01:17:10.890
Question here,
question here, then I'm

01:17:10.890 --> 01:17:14.190
going to another question
from an external audience.

01:17:14.190 --> 01:17:15.930
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.

01:17:15.930 --> 01:17:19.290
One of the things that I heard
that profoundly affected me

01:17:19.290 --> 01:17:24.260
from Tim Wise was that white
privilege is not about guilt,

01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:27.300
that white privilege is
about responsibility.

01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:28.990
And I think it's
tangentially related

01:17:28.990 --> 01:17:31.365
to what you were just talking
about-- that responsibility

01:17:31.365 --> 01:17:32.060
that we have.

01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:34.432
I'd love to hear your
thoughts about guilt

01:17:34.432 --> 01:17:36.390
versus responsibility
and that notion of trying

01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:39.080
to be comfortable, and
it's not possible really

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:41.000
to be comfortable,
that we really

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.110
need to be uncomfortable to
be able to be responsible.

01:17:44.110 --> 01:17:47.400
And that's not for our
own personal actions,

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:50.549
but for what has happened in the
country and around the world.

01:17:50.549 --> 01:17:51.840
I'd love to hear your thoughts.

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:53.030
ROLAND MARTIN: Two
folks-- tight answers

01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:54.280
in follow-up to that question.

01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:56.990
DAVID STOVALL: Super quick-- one
of the ways to actually engage

01:17:56.990 --> 01:18:00.940
that question is what
Brother Martin first said. .

01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:04.800
The conversation is far
with other white folks.

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:07.320
Clearly this thing
around when you

01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:11.290
are engaging with other white
folks about what this actually

01:18:11.290 --> 01:18:13.860
means, then you get another
set of conversations.

01:18:13.860 --> 01:18:15.510
So in addition to
Tim Wise, check out

01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:17.650
a guy named Paul Gorski.

01:18:17.650 --> 01:18:19.900
He's committed to
doing this work.

01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:24.240
And then what he talks about
is that type of conversation

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:27.150
is the in-house conversation
that other folks might not

01:18:27.150 --> 01:18:31.000
be privy to, But now will allow
you to think about how you move

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.670
and what you do moving forward,
because a lot of times it's not

01:18:34.670 --> 01:18:40.120
about going into the guilt
mode around making folks

01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:42.970
feel halfway decent
that you now recognize

01:18:42.970 --> 01:18:44.630
what's happened to them.

01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:46.800
It's really around what
do we say to each other,

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:48.295
recognizing this
thing to be true.

01:18:48.295 --> 01:18:50.170
ROLAND MARTIN: Another
person you mentioned--

01:18:50.170 --> 01:18:51.190
say the name again. .

01:18:51.190 --> 01:18:53.250
DAVID STOVALL: Paul Gorski.

01:18:53.250 --> 01:18:57.012
ROLAND MARTIN: Another person
you should YouTube is-- I'm

01:18:57.012 --> 01:18:59.690
trying to pull up her
name-- Jane Elliott.

01:18:59.690 --> 01:19:00.630
CARMEN PEREZ: Yes.

01:19:00.630 --> 01:19:01.650
Yes.

01:19:01.650 --> 01:19:04.090
ROLAND MARTIN: She did
this blue eye experiment

01:19:04.090 --> 01:19:08.700
on the Oprah show that
totally-- go look at her videos.

01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:11.160
And she goes right to
the heart of this issue.

01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:13.970
And she asks this question
of an all-white audience,

01:19:13.970 --> 01:19:16.590
how many of you
would trade places

01:19:16.590 --> 01:19:18.560
with a rich black person?

01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:20.640
And nobody raised their hand.

01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:23.100
She says that's white
privilege right there.

01:19:23.100 --> 01:19:25.470
And y'all ain't rich.

01:19:25.470 --> 01:19:26.171
Question.

01:19:26.171 --> 01:19:27.670
AUDIENCE: Thank you
guys for coming.

01:19:27.670 --> 01:19:29.580
This is really important.

01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:32.880
One of the biggest questions
that I have is what can I do?

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:36.480
What should I do that
demonstrates solidarity not

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:39.440
help, that is in the right
lane, that acknowledges

01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:43.582
that I am a white person, but
I still want to help with this?

01:19:43.582 --> 01:19:45.290
STEVE PERRY: Thank
you for your question,

01:19:45.290 --> 01:19:48.360
and I was waiting
for that question.

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:51.520
I think that you
have to first do

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:55.010
an assessment of your own
talents and interests.

01:19:55.010 --> 01:19:58.390
As Brother Johnson
said a little earlier,

01:19:58.390 --> 01:20:01.520
he talked about people
working in different spaces

01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:04.250
and the respect that we
have to have for that.

01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:06.900
And so whatever it
is that you think

01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:12.070
you could have an impact on
using your time and talents

01:20:12.070 --> 01:20:13.590
to make that happen.

01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:16.630
So for instance, if you
feel like your work was

01:20:16.630 --> 01:20:20.810
best with women, because
you're a woman, and for me,

01:20:20.810 --> 01:20:23.410
it would be about finding
an organization that looked

01:20:23.410 --> 01:20:25.030
to improve the lives of women.

01:20:25.030 --> 01:20:26.530
If it was about
writing about women,

01:20:26.530 --> 01:20:29.730
then you'd use your written
word to push that forward.

01:20:29.730 --> 01:20:32.720
I think any person that tells
everyone that they should do

01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:35.740
something in particular is
a person who's not learned

01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:38.260
and not compassionate and
doesn't understand that

01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:41.510
there's a beauty in the
intricacy of each one

01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:42.570
of our gifts. .

01:20:42.570 --> 01:20:45.710
And so I think what
we're tasked with

01:20:45.710 --> 01:20:50.110
is engaging your heart such
that your mind will follow

01:20:50.110 --> 01:20:52.410
and that you will use your
mind to think of the things

01:20:52.410 --> 01:20:53.220
that you could do.

01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:55.990
One of things I often think that
we all have an obligation to do

01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:58.130
is to involve
ourselves in what I

01:20:58.130 --> 01:21:00.860
refer to as
micro-political actions,

01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:02.710
meaning individual
tasks that will somehow

01:21:02.710 --> 01:21:06.880
improve the lot of
those people around you.

01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:09.670
And that may be something
as simple as volunteering

01:21:09.670 --> 01:21:12.710
on a school board
or working-- again,

01:21:12.710 --> 01:21:16.076
from my space-- with
children, to recognizing

01:21:16.076 --> 01:21:17.450
that at your
company there may be

01:21:17.450 --> 01:21:19.325
an affinity group, an
African-American group,

01:21:19.325 --> 01:21:21.360
or a Latino group, or
a gay straight alliance

01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:23.443
group, whatever the case
may be within the context

01:21:23.443 --> 01:21:25.580
of your company,
wherever you feel

01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:28.360
you could make the greatest
impact using your time

01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:31.192
and talents to do something.

01:21:31.192 --> 01:21:33.150
Other people are not
going to get caught up in,

01:21:33.150 --> 01:21:35.620
let's say, something that
is political and a big P

01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:36.560
political.

01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:38.530
Whereas, some people
may say, I don't

01:21:38.530 --> 01:21:40.530
want you to think that
because you did something

01:21:40.530 --> 01:21:43.880
at Google that that would
somehow be less than important.

01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:47.980
I would suggest to you that
there's a lot that you can do.

01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:50.770
It starts with you taking
an inventory, doing

01:21:50.770 --> 01:21:54.220
an audit of your time,
talents, and desires,

01:21:54.220 --> 01:21:57.422
and with all due haste,
not waiting another day,

01:21:57.422 --> 01:21:59.630
because I'll say this final
thing-- the fact that you

01:21:59.630 --> 01:22:02.070
guys are here is dope.

01:22:02.070 --> 01:22:03.597
And I say that
sincerely because I'm

01:22:03.597 --> 01:22:05.430
sure that they're going
to pay you no matter

01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:06.679
where you are in the building.

01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:13.870
But based upon the food that was
coming out of a sick cafeteria

01:22:13.870 --> 01:22:16.480
that you seem to have, y'all
could have spent a little more

01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:17.930
time there.

01:22:17.930 --> 01:22:20.720
The fact that you're
here leads me to believe

01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:22.430
that you want to do something.

01:22:22.430 --> 01:22:23.900
You want to be inspired.

01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:26.850
You want to find the
space in which you fit in.

01:22:26.850 --> 01:22:29.890
And the challenge that I
know that I have at times

01:22:29.890 --> 01:22:32.450
is, I want to answer your
question like in the way

01:22:32.450 --> 01:22:34.820
that I think you want it
answered, like a specific,

01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:37.360
you should tomorrow
morning go here.

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:38.990
But I don't know
the answer to that.

01:22:38.990 --> 01:22:43.080
But I do know tonight,
on your ride home,

01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:45.530
you can come up with a
solution, because that thing

01:22:45.530 --> 01:22:47.220
that's been peeing
inside your heart

01:22:47.220 --> 01:22:49.710
that you should do--
not should anymore.

01:22:49.710 --> 01:22:50.847
It's must.

01:22:50.847 --> 01:22:51.680
ROLAND MARTIN: Jeff.

01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:52.721
JEFF JOHNSON: Real quick.

01:22:52.721 --> 01:22:55.310
The other thing I
would say is listen,

01:22:55.310 --> 01:22:57.520
because I think a lot
of us in our desire

01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:02.430
to do good bring too many
assumptions to that process.

01:23:02.430 --> 01:23:04.970
I'll never forget taking a
bunch of college students

01:23:04.970 --> 01:23:07.880
to New Orleans
right after Katrina.

01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:11.110
And they were
incredibly well-meaning,

01:23:11.110 --> 01:23:14.220
but unbelievably arrogant.

01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:19.890
They thought they were saving
somebody on their spring break.

01:23:19.890 --> 01:23:23.300
And we had to tell them
before they engaged,

01:23:23.300 --> 01:23:25.390
the most important thing
you can do tomorrow

01:23:25.390 --> 01:23:28.590
is listen to what the
people tell you to do,

01:23:28.590 --> 01:23:30.830
because they already
have the answers.

01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:33.410
And if you are going to be
in solidarity with them,

01:23:33.410 --> 01:23:35.760
it's not about you coming
in with your brilliance

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:37.610
to tell them what they need.

01:23:37.610 --> 01:23:41.610
It's your humility coupled
with your brilliance that can

01:23:41.610 --> 01:23:42.937
be directed in the right way.

01:23:42.937 --> 01:23:45.270
ROLAND MARTIN: When we mentioned
the Barbara Ransby book

01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:47.720
on Ella Baker, that
was the one thing

01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:51.420
she told everyone at the
NAACP, SCLC, and the SNCC.

01:23:51.420 --> 01:23:52.795
She said, when
you go to Alabama,

01:23:52.795 --> 01:23:55.110
and you're going to those
sharecroppers, first of all,

01:23:55.110 --> 01:23:57.792
take off your damn college
clothes and put a overall on.

01:23:57.792 --> 01:24:01.086
And she said, and
listen to them.

01:24:01.086 --> 01:24:02.460
Forget the fact
that some of them

01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:04.360
have a third and
fourth grade education.

01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:07.910
She said, let them tell you what
they want to do and then say,

01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:09.660
I'm here to help
you achieve that.

01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:11.210
So that was one of her
biggest piece right there.

01:24:11.210 --> 01:24:12.584
Listen to what
they want to hear.

01:24:12.584 --> 01:24:13.930
Dory, you got something for me?

01:24:13.930 --> 01:24:16.320
All right, I'm going to
go to a question here.

01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:17.065
Let's go.

01:24:17.065 --> 01:24:18.440
AUDIENCE: Hey,
how are you doing?

01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:20.090
Thank you so much for coming.

01:24:20.090 --> 01:24:22.650
Being nine years here at
Google, having something

01:24:22.650 --> 01:24:26.039
like this occur is
really, really awesome.

01:24:26.039 --> 01:24:27.830
A lot of us talk about
it on the sidelines,

01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:29.940
but it's great to have
a premiere event here.

01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:31.280
And thank you for hosting and--

01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:31.580
ROLAND MARTIN: Glad to be here.

01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:34.410
AUDIENCE: And others,
[INAUDIBLE] for being here.

01:24:34.410 --> 01:24:36.650
I want to provide two
things that may be more

01:24:36.650 --> 01:24:37.990
for the fellow Googlers.

01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:40.330
One thing you can
do is definitely

01:24:40.330 --> 01:24:41.920
hook up with some of the ERGs.

01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:43.699
The ERGs are all open.

01:24:43.699 --> 01:24:45.240
ROLAND MARTIN: OK,
I ain't from here.

01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:46.330
What the hell is an ERG?

01:24:46.330 --> 01:24:47.788
AUDIENCE: Employee
resource groups,

01:24:47.788 --> 01:24:50.750
So Hola for Latinos, BGN.

01:24:50.750 --> 01:24:53.910
It's not exclusive to just
Latinos or just blacks.

01:24:53.910 --> 01:24:55.660
The diversity book
club is reading

01:24:55.660 --> 01:24:57.180
"Between the World and Me."

01:24:57.180 --> 01:24:59.610
We're going to meet
on that next week.

01:24:59.610 --> 01:25:02.050
Women Aat, Gayglers, et
cetera-- more than just

01:25:02.050 --> 01:25:03.990
going to the pride
party, actually talking

01:25:03.990 --> 01:25:05.990
about the issues.

01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:09.330
And then sometimes I known to
be a little disruptive, so what

01:25:09.330 --> 01:25:11.840
I would like to challenge
to my fellow Googlers

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:14.140
and Googler leadership
is we have cases

01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:17.520
where the mayor of Chicago
has graced our stage,

01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:19.180
where Kissinger has
graced our stage

01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:21.130
in Mountain View, et cetera.

01:25:21.130 --> 01:25:24.300
But let's also bring over
the other side of things.

01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:27.840
Let's bring the CTU
leadership to discuss

01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:29.560
why they think they
might have to go

01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:31.920
on strike in a couple
of weeks, because they

01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:35.060
value how they interpret--
maybe we don't all

01:25:35.060 --> 01:25:39.340
agree-- what they value
in terms of what families

01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:41.030
and children in Chicago need.

01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:44.330
How many of us live
in Chicago and feel

01:25:44.330 --> 01:25:46.840
so mixed about the
schools and how they're

01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:48.627
addressing that, et cetera?

01:25:48.627 --> 01:25:50.210
So let's hear some
of those viewpoints

01:25:50.210 --> 01:25:52.501
instead of just always having
the mayor and everyone we

01:25:52.501 --> 01:25:54.420
have to have good
relationships, but we

01:25:54.420 --> 01:25:55.544
have some other viewpoints.

01:25:55.544 --> 01:25:58.760
So let's challenge ourselves
to hear some of those.

01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:01.460
Same thing on other issues.

01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:02.910
There's gay groups.

01:26:02.910 --> 01:26:04.890
There's women's groups,
et cetera groups,

01:26:04.890 --> 01:26:07.580
that all have great
speakers, great partnerships

01:26:07.580 --> 01:26:09.830
and let's put them
out there, not just

01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:12.080
the mayor or the political
leadership, which might all

01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:13.100
kind of reflect one way.

01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:14.590
Let's hear out some of
the other viewpoints.

01:26:14.590 --> 01:26:16.465
ROLAND MARTIN: But also
I will say this here.

01:26:16.465 --> 01:26:18.716
Challenge groups about
what happens internally.

01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:28.180
The reason I say that, three
months ago, Michael Sam

01:26:28.180 --> 01:26:31.390
gave an interview with
a British magazine,

01:26:31.390 --> 01:26:36.740
and he said he faced more
racism from white LGBTers

01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:38.822
than he did black homophobia.

01:26:38.822 --> 01:26:41.940
It got virtually no coverage.

01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:44.087
I had a whole panel
of African-Americans

01:26:44.087 --> 01:26:46.670
who were gay and lesbian, and
we talked about that very issue.

01:26:46.670 --> 01:26:48.930
And I posed the
question, how could you

01:26:48.930 --> 01:26:53.010
have an equality movement
where you practice inequality?

01:26:53.010 --> 01:26:56.580
And I guarantee
you had Michael Sam

01:26:56.580 --> 01:27:01.390
said he faced a plethora
of black homophobia

01:27:01.390 --> 01:27:08.250
and love from white LGBT, CNN,
MSNBC, Fox News, ABC, CBS, NBC,

01:27:08.250 --> 01:27:11.710
would have all had panels, think
pieces in the "New York Times"

01:27:11.710 --> 01:27:13.110
on black homophobia.

01:27:13.110 --> 01:27:16.340
And again, that's one
of those discussions

01:27:16.340 --> 01:27:19.790
one can have among groups.

01:27:19.790 --> 01:27:22.710
The issue of colorism,
also, with African-Americans

01:27:22.710 --> 01:27:23.632
another major issue.

01:27:23.632 --> 01:27:25.090
STEVE PERRY: Before
you go forward,

01:27:25.090 --> 01:27:27.840
I was laughing to myself
as the gentlemen was

01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:30.192
talking about having
different groups here.

01:27:30.192 --> 01:27:31.650
One of things I
would encourage you

01:27:31.650 --> 01:27:34.127
also is have the other side.

01:27:34.127 --> 01:27:35.710
If you all are going
to have CTU here,

01:27:35.710 --> 01:27:37.110
I'm not saying you
call me, although--

01:27:37.110 --> 01:27:38.818
ROLAND MARTIN: Steve's
saying call Steve.

01:27:38.818 --> 01:27:42.117
STEVE PERRY: --although I will
come back in an ambulance.

01:27:42.117 --> 01:27:43.700
ROLAND MARTIN: Steve
would drive here.

01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:44.760
STEVE PERRY: Damn right.

01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:46.810
But for real.

01:27:51.250 --> 01:27:54.330
The important point is to
have a valid and meaningful

01:27:54.330 --> 01:27:56.400
counterpoint to some
of those conversations,

01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:58.530
because one of things
that happened sometimes

01:27:58.530 --> 01:28:01.370
is if you're not familiar with
the topic, the person who's

01:28:01.370 --> 01:28:03.760
presenting the topic whose
job it is to present the topic

01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:05.920
and always make it seem
like it makes more sense.

01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:09.320
I want to use that
just really quick.

01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:10.960
So for instance,
let's say you were

01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:13.370
to bring in the conversation
around the Chicago Teachers

01:28:13.370 --> 01:28:16.680
Union saying they're
going to strike again.

01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:19.190
I would suggest you also
bring in some parents,

01:28:19.190 --> 01:28:21.200
some other individuals
who are going

01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:23.900
to be hurt badly when
such a decision is made,

01:28:23.900 --> 01:28:27.140
and on through, not
just the usual suspects,

01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:29.620
But individuals who are
impacted by whatever

01:28:29.620 --> 01:28:30.680
the conversation is.

01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:34.172
So that what you end up doing is
creating a robust conversation

01:28:34.172 --> 01:28:36.130
from which individuals
who are being introduced

01:28:36.130 --> 01:28:38.088
to the topic for the
first time, could actually

01:28:38.088 --> 01:28:40.120
have the opportunity
to hear, wait a minute.

01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:42.340
I never really thought
of it that way,

01:28:42.340 --> 01:28:44.080
regardless of what the topic is.

01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:46.440
You see a diversity
of thought up here.

01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:48.350
We haven't spent
enough time that you

01:28:48.350 --> 01:28:50.052
would see the breadth
of the diversity,

01:28:50.052 --> 01:28:51.510
but I think you've
heard it in just

01:28:51.510 --> 01:28:54.093
some of the slight conversation
that you've heard that there's

01:28:54.093 --> 01:28:55.750
a diversity of thought here.

01:28:55.750 --> 01:29:00.040
And I don't know the others as
well as I know Jeff and Roland.

01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:01.620
If the three of
us were in a, room

01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:04.410
you'd hear the diversity
really quickly.

01:29:04.410 --> 01:29:05.619
ROLAND MARTIN: And real loud.

01:29:05.619 --> 01:29:06.410
STEVE PERRY: Right.

01:29:06.410 --> 01:29:08.357
JEFF JOHNSON: From them two.

01:29:08.357 --> 01:29:10.440
ROLAND MARTIN: Yeah, like
you have never got loud.

01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:11.234
OK, all right.

01:29:11.234 --> 01:29:12.900
STEVE PERRY: What
you'd hear from Roland

01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:14.691
would be the loudness
of his pocket square.

01:29:14.691 --> 01:29:17.240
CARMEN PEREZ: I also want to
add I really love the panel

01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:19.160
conversation and having a host.

01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:23.290
But there is a model called the
world cafe, where you actually

01:29:23.290 --> 01:29:25.360
do panel conversations,
and then you

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:27.950
break out into
smaller conversations,

01:29:27.950 --> 01:29:29.730
and then bring it
back to the room.

01:29:29.730 --> 01:29:31.970
And when I talk about
relationship-building,

01:29:31.970 --> 01:29:34.930
one of the things-- you
said it perfectly-- I

01:29:34.930 --> 01:29:38.240
always tell people, don't go
start other organizations.

01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:42.180
Tap into what you do
really well and offer that

01:29:42.180 --> 01:29:44.720
to an organization
that's around you,

01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:46.870
because you could teach
somebody a discipline.

01:29:46.870 --> 01:29:48.810
You can't teach
them to have heart.

01:29:48.810 --> 01:29:52.540
And you want people who have
heart to come and volunteer

01:29:52.540 --> 01:29:53.490
for you or offer you.

01:29:53.490 --> 01:29:58.190
But also you could donate to
organizations, keeping it $1.

01:29:58.190 --> 01:30:01.800
There are organizations that
also need financial resources,

01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:04.440
but like I said, you know, I
think it's really important

01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:07.760
to also build relationships
among yourselves,

01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:10.615
because you guys all have
to work with one another. .

01:30:10.615 --> 01:30:11.530
ROLAND MARTIN: I got
less than two minutes.

01:30:11.530 --> 01:30:12.363
Question right here.

01:30:12.363 --> 01:30:13.060
Go right ahead.

01:30:13.060 --> 01:30:13.950
Go ahead.

01:30:13.950 --> 01:30:14.840
AUDIENCE: Dr. Perry,
I'm going to give you

01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:17.131
a little bit of an opportunity,
because my question was

01:30:17.131 --> 01:30:20.305
for you, a lot of what
our Chicago office does

01:30:20.305 --> 01:30:23.650
the most of is around
education out on the community.

01:30:23.650 --> 01:30:28.160
So what are some of the things
that you see specifically

01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:29.872
within the institutions?

01:30:29.872 --> 01:30:31.330
What are the main
changes you would

01:30:31.330 --> 01:30:33.400
like to see that have the
biggest impact quickly?

01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:35.650
STEVE PERRY: Thank you the
most important thing for me

01:30:35.650 --> 01:30:36.870
is school choice.

01:30:36.870 --> 01:30:39.560
Allow the parents to make those
micro-political decisions.

01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:40.680
This is still a democracy.

01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:42.350
A parent should not be
forced to send their child

01:30:42.350 --> 01:30:44.100
to a school in which
the people working it

01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:46.200
would never send their
children to Start there.

01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:48.325
The second thing is recognize
that the conversation

01:30:48.325 --> 01:30:50.324
around education in the
United States of America

01:30:50.324 --> 01:30:52.070
is driven by employment,
not education.

01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:54.300
That's why these are essentially
are boards of employment,

01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:55.300
not boards of education.

01:30:55.300 --> 01:30:58.010
The system is designed to
ensure that individuals

01:30:58.010 --> 01:30:59.720
who work in it stay employed.

01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:02.810
There's a shift in the
paradigm of professionalism.

01:31:02.810 --> 01:31:05.330
Unlike generations
from the past, where

01:31:05.330 --> 01:31:09.410
this generation of
professionals do not necessarily

01:31:09.410 --> 01:31:11.410
value job security.

01:31:11.410 --> 01:31:12.820
You value the product.

01:31:12.820 --> 01:31:15.330
And that doesn't happen in the
traditional public education

01:31:15.330 --> 01:31:16.870
system at the level it should.

01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:20.780
In fact, it's longevity that
gets you the greatest reward,

01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:22.057
as opposed to productivity.

01:31:22.057 --> 01:31:23.640
And so you have to
take the same model

01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:26.870
that you use here, that is
in, fact working, not just

01:31:26.870 --> 01:31:31.430
here but Uber and Airbnb,
where you're seeing

01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:33.280
a product that's meaningful.

01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:35.090
So you, as consumers,
whether or not you

01:31:35.090 --> 01:31:37.359
have children in the system,
you are in fact consumers

01:31:37.359 --> 01:31:39.650
because at the end of the
day, to Brother Jeff's point,

01:31:39.650 --> 01:31:41.630
you're going to
either employ or not

01:31:41.630 --> 01:31:43.760
employ Chicago Public
Schools; graduates.

01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:46.580
So there needs to be a
push from organizations

01:31:46.580 --> 01:31:48.290
such as this to push
for the very things

01:31:48.290 --> 01:31:49.790
that you want for
your own children,

01:31:49.790 --> 01:31:51.627
were you to have them,
if you have them,

01:31:51.627 --> 01:31:53.710
and that is to have access
to a quality education.

01:31:53.710 --> 01:31:56.850
I ask you to ask for nothing
more and nothing less.

01:31:56.850 --> 01:31:59.210
To what Brother
Stovall was saying,

01:31:59.210 --> 01:32:01.420
sometimes the conversation
is about equity.

01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:03.800
And freedom means that some
people need a little bit more

01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:05.591
in order to get equal,
because for so long,

01:32:05.591 --> 01:32:06.680
they have not gotten that.

01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:11.240
So for me, the bottom line
is if this school is so good,

01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:14.570
then no child should ever have
to be forced to attend it.

01:32:14.570 --> 01:32:16.830
They will attend it
because they wish to.

01:32:16.830 --> 01:32:20.650
School choice provides families
with the same opportunity that

01:32:20.650 --> 01:32:23.480
has been provided to the wealthy
and white Americans forever,

01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:25.611
because for the first
time in American history,

01:32:25.611 --> 01:32:27.860
we're actually having a
conversation about poor people

01:32:27.860 --> 01:32:29.910
who are saying, where are you
sending your child to school

01:32:29.910 --> 01:32:30.480
this year?

01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:34.890
That was a conversation that for
generations was confined only

01:32:34.890 --> 01:32:36.210
to the well-to-do.

01:32:36.210 --> 01:32:41.000
So I'm saying, with all due
haste, push as hard as you can

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:44.020
for school choice, school
choice, school choice,

01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:47.770
because that is the only
strategy that will provide

01:32:47.770 --> 01:32:49.450
for access to a
quality education

01:32:49.450 --> 01:32:52.680
within the lifetime
of the children who

01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:54.550
are, in fact, in school.

01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:57.100
ROLAND MARTIN: I will
give you another book.

01:33:00.130 --> 01:33:04.520
This is probably one of
the most important books

01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:06.320
I have ever read.

01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:09.550
You will be blown away
by the first 50 pages.

01:33:09.550 --> 01:33:13.560
"The Education of Blacks
in the South, 1860-1935"

01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:15.760
bu James A. Anderson,
a professor right

01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:18.140
here in Illinois--
University of Illinois.

01:33:18.140 --> 01:33:20.640
Took him 10 years
to do that book.

01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:22.920
And he lays out
that not only that--

01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:27.030
the first collective bargaining
was freed slaves, where

01:33:27.030 --> 01:33:32.230
after slavery, plantation owners
wanted them to work the land,

01:33:32.230 --> 01:33:34.780
and they said, we will only
agree to work the land,

01:33:34.780 --> 01:33:37.500
if you build a school
on the grounds.

01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:39.660
That was collective
bargaining. .

01:33:39.660 --> 01:33:40.980
Go ahead, Doctor.

01:33:40.980 --> 01:33:41.680
DAVID STOVALL:
Just something real

01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:43.096
quick around this
thing around it.

01:33:43.096 --> 01:33:44.930
We made depart on
this moment, but I

01:33:44.930 --> 01:33:49.960
want us to be clear about
when we talk about education,

01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:54.090
there is an assumption
that is very dangerous.

01:33:54.090 --> 01:33:56.570
One of the assumptions
that is very dangerous

01:33:56.570 --> 01:34:01.270
is that education works like
you all do in businesses.

01:34:01.270 --> 01:34:04.160
And this is why it's dangerous.

01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:09.870
Models of efficiency tell us
that we can do a lot of things

01:34:09.870 --> 01:34:12.790
very well and sanguine.

01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:15.740
We don't learn like that.

01:34:15.740 --> 01:34:22.580
So education can be effective,
but it's not always efficient

01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:24.870
in the general
sense of efficiency.

01:34:24.870 --> 01:34:29.290
And I think there's a common
assumption or misconception

01:34:29.290 --> 01:34:32.360
that if something is working
smoothly, that it's working.

01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:34.600
That is not the case.

01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:38.570
We have to have spaces
that support young folks

01:34:38.570 --> 01:34:42.520
in the ways in which
they learn, because this

01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:46.170
is a big contention,
because a lot of times folks

01:34:46.170 --> 01:34:49.990
can drop in communities and
say, here's this new thing.

01:34:49.990 --> 01:34:51.920
And you've had a ton of shit.

01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:53.090
And here's this new thing.

01:34:53.090 --> 01:34:56.212
But all it really is new. .

01:34:56.212 --> 01:34:58.420
They haven't talked about
what this thing is actually

01:34:58.420 --> 01:34:59.600
putting forward.

01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:03.130
So a lot of times you get these
situations where families,

01:35:03.130 --> 01:35:06.330
their desperation is played
on, and opposed to saying,

01:35:06.330 --> 01:35:09.440
here's what we're going to
do in partnership with you,

01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:11.600
it's opposed to you've had shit.

01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:12.579
Here's this new thing.

01:35:12.579 --> 01:35:13.120
I don't know.

01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:15.470
It's at least not that
thing that you've had.

01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:17.750
And I think that thing
becomes critically important

01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:20.630
when we talk about
educational spaces,

01:35:20.630 --> 01:35:23.570
because that piece
around being affective

01:35:23.570 --> 01:35:26.670
based on the community's
needs is critical.

01:35:26.670 --> 01:35:30.395
Anything else is a projection
of the larger colonial project.

01:35:30.395 --> 01:35:32.020
STEVE PERRY: I think
one of the things,

01:35:32.020 --> 01:35:34.890
also, to keep in mind as we
have that conversation is

01:35:34.890 --> 01:35:38.380
that the reason why parents
are running screaming

01:35:38.380 --> 01:35:40.510
from these schools is
because in many cases

01:35:40.510 --> 01:35:42.536
they went to those
schools as well.

01:35:42.536 --> 01:35:44.410
And their grandparents
went to those schools.

01:35:44.410 --> 01:35:47.120
And they were
under-served by them.

01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:50.900
And so no one should
consider opening anything,

01:35:50.900 --> 01:35:53.530
whether it be any
type of organization

01:35:53.530 --> 01:35:55.720
in a community that doesn't
take into consideration

01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:57.290
the integrity of the community.

01:35:57.290 --> 01:36:01.890
On the same token, no one
should also stop the parents

01:36:01.890 --> 01:36:04.990
from doing what
they must do to go

01:36:04.990 --> 01:36:06.246
to the best schools they can.

01:36:06.246 --> 01:36:08.370
There are children who have
attended my schools who

01:36:08.370 --> 01:36:11.160
I know for a fact do not
live in the catchment areas.

01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:12.400
I know it.

01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:14.700
I know they're using
somebody else's address,

01:36:14.700 --> 01:36:17.420
and I will never tell.

01:36:17.420 --> 01:36:21.290
It is not going to happen,
because I'd rather them break

01:36:21.290 --> 01:36:24.740
a law that is unjust than to do
something as unjust as to put

01:36:24.740 --> 01:36:26.470
abide by the law.

01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:29.670
We have a set of laws that have
been put in place that started

01:36:29.670 --> 01:36:32.460
with the various segregation
of neighborhoods,

01:36:32.460 --> 01:36:35.120
the creation of ghettos,
that have fostered

01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:38.270
the failures of
millions, literally

01:36:38.270 --> 01:36:43.090
millions, of children-- millions
who've done nothing wrong other

01:36:43.090 --> 01:36:45.470
than to be born in
the wrong zip code.

01:36:45.470 --> 01:36:48.360
And so what we hear too
often in the conversation

01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:52.100
around education is
about employment.

01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:55.030
We do not hear
about the children.

01:36:55.030 --> 01:36:58.540
And you you'll hear diversionary
tactics about testing

01:36:58.540 --> 01:37:02.210
and privatization and other
notions that somehow are meant

01:37:02.210 --> 01:37:04.170
to take your eye off the ball.

01:37:04.170 --> 01:37:06.490
But at the end of the
day, if you are so blessed

01:37:06.490 --> 01:37:09.191
to be a parent, you will
pray the same prayer

01:37:09.191 --> 01:37:11.440
over your children that every
single person has prayed

01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:14.250
regardless of religion or type--
that your child does better

01:37:14.250 --> 01:37:14.982
than you.

01:37:14.982 --> 01:37:17.190
And one of the most important
things that you will do

01:37:17.190 --> 01:37:20.020
is to decide on the school
that they will attend.

01:37:20.020 --> 01:37:25.250
And we have seen these schools
fail-- great, fantastic,

01:37:25.250 --> 01:37:27.310
amazing, teachers
in some of them,

01:37:27.310 --> 01:37:30.240
fantastic principals
in some of them.

01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:34.340
But for whatever the case
may be, they're not winning.

01:37:34.340 --> 01:37:40.050
And I, for one, would never want
to be even slightly responsible

01:37:40.050 --> 01:37:42.210
for keeping in place
any policies that

01:37:42.210 --> 01:37:45.530
will send one child one
day to a failed school.

01:37:45.530 --> 01:37:48.470
I'll say this final point.

01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:51.430
Of the hardest things to see--
and anybody up who's ever

01:37:51.430 --> 01:37:55.400
seen this knows this--
is the see a child who's

01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:59.030
given up on school,
the dead stare

01:37:59.030 --> 01:38:01.580
that comes over the face of a
seventh grader who recognizes

01:38:01.580 --> 01:38:05.400
that there's just no hope for
her or him in this institution,

01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:07.260
and that they have
in fact essentially

01:38:07.260 --> 01:38:10.780
been broken-- intentionally
broken, so much so

01:38:10.780 --> 01:38:14.890
that their self-esteem is shot,
versus the time when you see

01:38:14.890 --> 01:38:16.850
the child who's four
or five years old

01:38:16.850 --> 01:38:20.600
who's super-duper excited
about school, just

01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:25.430
can't wait to come
to school and learn.

01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:29.090
Why is it that we would ever
keep in place an institution

01:38:29.090 --> 01:38:33.060
that has promised to destroy
the children most in need--

01:38:33.060 --> 01:38:35.710
black, Latino, poor, more
specifically, African-American

01:38:35.710 --> 01:38:36.210
boys?

01:38:36.210 --> 01:38:39.050
Why would we ever send
another human being to that

01:38:39.050 --> 01:38:41.519
and call ourselves
a humane society?

01:38:41.519 --> 01:38:42.560
It's not about resources.

01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:44.270
It's not about how
much a school costs,

01:38:44.270 --> 01:38:47.260
because we spend the most
amount of resources locking

01:38:47.260 --> 01:38:50.420
those very same little boys up.

01:38:50.420 --> 01:38:55.480
The issue is about the quality
of the institution, which

01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:59.570
starts with a respect for
the community, no doubt,

01:38:59.570 --> 01:39:02.380
but also the anticipation
that every single child who's

01:39:02.380 --> 01:39:04.374
in the building is
fricken amazing,

01:39:04.374 --> 01:39:05.790
and they're going
to do everything

01:39:05.790 --> 01:39:07.950
they can to make that possible.

01:39:07.950 --> 01:39:10.616
CARMEN PEREZ: I just wanted
to add a cost analysis to what

01:39:10.616 --> 01:39:11.740
he was saying, in regards--

01:39:11.740 --> 01:39:13.030
ROLAND MARTIN: This is going
to be your final comment.

01:39:13.030 --> 01:39:14.300
CARMEN PEREZ: Yeah, sorry.

01:39:14.300 --> 01:39:18.640
It cost $125,000
in New York state

01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:23.730
to lock a young person up per
year, versus $10,000 from K

01:39:23.730 --> 01:39:26.950
to 12 to educate them.

01:39:26.950 --> 01:39:30.330
So I just wanted to-- because
what he's talking about

01:39:30.330 --> 01:39:33.620
is providing education
opportunities for young people

01:39:33.620 --> 01:39:35.950
so that they could thrive
and not end up in the system

01:39:35.950 --> 01:39:39.330
that I'm working in and seen
those young people at my table.

01:39:39.330 --> 01:39:43.100
And so we see young people--
as young as 10 years old--

01:39:43.100 --> 01:39:46.950
incarcerated in a
detention center.

01:39:46.950 --> 01:39:49.140
And the clothes
doesn't even fit them.

01:39:49.140 --> 01:39:51.900
And it's because they
don't have anything else.

01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:53.190
They don't have hope anymore.

01:39:53.190 --> 01:39:54.690
DAVID STOVALL: And
let us not forget

01:39:54.690 --> 01:39:57.469
the rising number of
young girls of color who

01:39:57.469 --> 01:39:58.510
are in those institutes--

01:39:58.510 --> 01:39:59.760
STEVE PERRY: It's frightening.

01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:01.970
DAVID STOVAL: It's critical,
because that population

01:40:01.970 --> 01:40:04.060
has actually increased
300% since 1970.

01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:05.810
STEVE PERRY: It's not
slowing down at all.

01:40:05.810 --> 01:40:07.240
CARMEN PEREZ: 500.

01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:11.062
DAVID STOVALL: So we have
to put that on the table.

01:40:11.062 --> 01:40:12.770
ROLAND MARTIN: That's
your final comment?

01:40:12.770 --> 01:40:13.170
DAVID STOVALL: Yes, sir

01:40:13.170 --> 01:40:15.320
ROLAND MARTIN: Jeff Johnson,
you can close us out.

01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:17.910
JEFF JOHNSON: Great book--
"Why Should White Guys Have

01:40:17.910 --> 01:40:24.350
All the Fun?" by Reginald
F. Lewis, first person

01:40:24.350 --> 01:40:27.930
to negotiate a billion dollar
deal in corporate America,

01:40:27.930 --> 01:40:31.760
and speaks a lot about what
we've been talking about today.

01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:33.670
Second of all, I
don't want to leave

01:40:33.670 --> 01:40:35.580
without-- there's a
question up here that

01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:37.954
says is it possible that women
are under-represented here

01:40:37.954 --> 01:40:39.470
because the language
of disruption

01:40:39.470 --> 01:40:41.570
and maybe the movement
isn't inclusive?

01:40:41.570 --> 01:40:44.850
There was discussion about
mid-level, mid-tier corporate

01:40:44.850 --> 01:40:46.710
jobs for black men
being emasculating,

01:40:46.710 --> 01:40:49.150
but where do black women
fit into that conversation?

01:40:49.150 --> 01:40:51.320
Simple answer is yes.

01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:56.000
And I think Carmen and
others, many in this room,

01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:00.630
have been fighting feverishly
to make sure that we challenge,

01:41:00.630 --> 01:41:03.610
I think, some of the sexism
and misogyny that existed

01:41:03.610 --> 01:41:06.560
within civil rights and
the black power movements

01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:08.660
from a people of
color perspective,

01:41:08.660 --> 01:41:12.970
but broadly as it relates to
movements for social change.

01:41:12.970 --> 01:41:14.900
And we're constantly
challenging it.

01:41:14.900 --> 01:41:16.960
And even us bringing
it up in the beginning,

01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:20.370
saying, why is there only
one sister on the panel,

01:41:20.370 --> 01:41:21.624
is part of it.

01:41:21.624 --> 01:41:23.040
But the other piece
is, how are we

01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:27.950
building pipelines of leadership
and voices of sisters,

01:41:27.950 --> 01:41:31.130
especially within the movement,
where we don't immediately

01:41:31.130 --> 01:41:34.470
go to the brother who
is on TV the most,

01:41:34.470 --> 01:41:36.910
versus the sister who's
doing the better work?

01:41:36.910 --> 01:41:38.350
So I think that's part of it.

01:41:38.350 --> 01:41:41.610
Last but not least, I think that
one of the biggest challenges

01:41:41.610 --> 01:41:43.960
with our discussions around
diversity and inclusion

01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:47.170
from a corporate perspective
is even saying inclusion

01:41:47.170 --> 01:41:49.470
is the goal isn't big enough.

01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:51.700
The goal is community,
because if you

01:41:51.700 --> 01:41:54.720
have diversity and inclusion,
that just means that you're

01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:57.030
diverse enough to
check off boxes

01:41:57.030 --> 01:41:59.800
and inclusionary enough to
invite people to the table,

01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:01.900
but not deliberate
enough to make sure

01:42:01.900 --> 01:42:04.720
that those people at the table
feel like they're represented

01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:07.550
in all facets of the
DNA of the institutions

01:42:07.550 --> 01:42:08.610
that we're a part of.

01:42:08.610 --> 01:42:12.440
And only then do we
really have community.

01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:15.200
ROLAND MARTIN:
Couple of points--

01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:20.480
you don't have to
be of the same tribe

01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:23.560
to help elevate somebody else.

01:42:26.310 --> 01:42:30.170
Carmen knows this, because I've
actually told her and Linda

01:42:30.170 --> 01:42:36.930
and Tamika that I will use
my platform to elevate y'all.

01:42:36.930 --> 01:42:40.830
Not that I am against
some of the other people,

01:42:40.830 --> 01:42:43.060
but I'm in control of my stuff.

01:42:43.060 --> 01:42:44.990
And I get to pick who
I want to elevate,

01:42:44.990 --> 01:42:47.450
and I'm recognizing--
to Jeff's point-- who's

01:42:47.450 --> 01:42:48.960
actually doing the work.

01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:50.920
Some folks they're hype.

01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:52.930
Some folks actually do the work.

01:42:52.930 --> 01:42:56.420
And so that's important, because
even in corporate America

01:42:56.420 --> 01:42:58.620
you will talk to some
African-Americans, Latinos,

01:42:58.620 --> 01:43:02.160
Asians who will tell you
there was somebody white

01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:05.310
who was their best benefactor,
who supported them just

01:43:05.310 --> 01:43:05.970
because.

01:43:05.970 --> 01:43:09.727
You will find somebody black who
will say it was another sister,

01:43:09.727 --> 01:43:11.560
and it was a brother
who was being elevated.

01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:15.260
And so we look at the
individual and begin to say,

01:43:15.260 --> 01:43:17.070
you know, I'm going
to invest in you,

01:43:17.070 --> 01:43:19.040
because I think you
can do something.

01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:20.640
The last point is there here.

01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:23.830
Y'all are a part of a company--
folks in the room and also

01:43:23.830 --> 01:43:28.130
those who are watching-- that
have been revolutionaries,

01:43:28.130 --> 01:43:33.010
that have been disruptors, that
have literally changed multiple

01:43:33.010 --> 01:43:37.430
industries over the
last 10 years. .

01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:38.870
And the thing that
I think we have

01:43:38.870 --> 01:43:41.574
to think when we look at, what
can we do-- because people

01:43:41.574 --> 01:43:44.240
always say what can we do, and I
always use this example-- there

01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:48.300
literally are more people
sitting in this room

01:43:48.300 --> 01:43:51.530
right now than there
were sitting in a church

01:43:51.530 --> 01:43:57.990
basement in Montgomery in 1955.

01:43:57.990 --> 01:44:03.180
The Montgomery bus boycott we
know historically was 381 days.

01:44:03.180 --> 01:44:05.675
It was never designed
to be a 381-day boycott.

01:44:05.675 --> 01:44:09.040
It was actually a
one-day boycott.

01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:12.460
And 50,000 black folks
didn't get on the bus,

01:44:12.460 --> 01:44:18.500
and they went, hell, we
can go for two, then three.

01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:22.209
And actually, if you look at
the original list of demands,

01:44:22.209 --> 01:44:24.000
originally they didn't
even call for an end

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:25.580
to segregated busing.

01:44:25.580 --> 01:44:28.335
They just asked for better
respect to black bus riders.

01:44:28.335 --> 01:44:30.933
Can you hire a few
more black bus drivers?

01:44:30.933 --> 01:44:34.050
Those were the initial demands.

01:44:34.050 --> 01:44:36.820
Out of Montgomery
led the lawsuit,

01:44:36.820 --> 01:44:40.770
Supreme Court ruling, then
they said, well, what else?

01:44:40.770 --> 01:44:43.470
Then they went Albany, Georgia.

01:44:43.470 --> 01:44:45.310
Then they were Selma
and Birmingham.

01:44:45.310 --> 01:44:48.350
And then they went to cities all
across the South, four college

01:44:48.350 --> 01:44:49.640
students, freshman.

01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:51.890
Didn't ask anybody's permission
at North Carolina A&amp;T,

01:44:51.890 --> 01:44:53.348
they just chose to
say, we're going

01:44:53.348 --> 01:44:55.520
to go integrate
this lunch counter.

01:44:55.520 --> 01:44:59.884
That led to it spreading like
wildfire all across the South.

01:44:59.884 --> 01:45:02.300
Imagine somebody sending a
tweet, and then all of a sudden

01:45:02.300 --> 01:45:03.750
it literally goes across.

01:45:03.750 --> 01:45:05.010
That's what that was.

01:45:05.010 --> 01:45:06.619
The point I'm
making is this here,

01:45:06.619 --> 01:45:08.285
that got us the Civil
Rights Act of '64,

01:45:08.285 --> 01:45:10.650
Voting Rights Act of '65,
Fair Housing Act of '68.

01:45:10.650 --> 01:45:12.900
That got us Arthur Fletcher
putting affirmative action

01:45:12.900 --> 01:45:16.590
in place when Nixon
became president in 1969.

01:45:16.590 --> 01:45:21.350
The point there is a handful
of people literally changed

01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:21.850
the world.

01:45:21.850 --> 01:45:26.520
If you go to Serbia,
there's an MLK drive.

01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:28.420
There's one in India.

01:45:28.420 --> 01:45:31.340
Lech Walesa, the solidarity
movement in Poland in 1980,

01:45:31.340 --> 01:45:33.580
they were singing
"We Shall Overcome."

01:45:33.580 --> 01:45:35.820
In Eastern Europe, they were
singing lift every voice

01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:37.430
and sing.

01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:40.310
The Arab Spring,
they were signs,

01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:43.250
I am a man, which are the
exact same signs black man were

01:45:43.250 --> 01:45:46.240
wearing in Memphis in 1968.

01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:52.240
So the point there is a handful
of people in a church basement

01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:55.770
literally has
impacted the world.

01:45:55.770 --> 01:45:58.240
And so you might not think
it, but if you look around

01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:02.310
in this room, you actually
have the capacity,

01:46:02.310 --> 01:46:06.230
based upon a collective
action, based upon commitment,

01:46:06.230 --> 01:46:10.390
based upon vision, based
upon being a disruptor,

01:46:10.390 --> 01:46:16.120
to change the world, just
with the people sitting

01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:17.550
in this room.

01:46:17.550 --> 01:46:20.740
To Steve's point,
what are you prepared

01:46:20.740 --> 01:46:24.830
to do when you leave this room?

01:46:24.830 --> 01:46:29.647
Dr. Steve Perry, Carmen Perez,
Jeff Johnson, Dr. Stovall.

01:46:29.647 --> 01:46:30.813
JEFF JOHNSON: Roland Martin.

01:46:30.813 --> 01:46:32.521
ROLAND MARTIN: Round
of applause, please.

01:46:32.521 --> 01:46:37.156
[APPLAUSE]
