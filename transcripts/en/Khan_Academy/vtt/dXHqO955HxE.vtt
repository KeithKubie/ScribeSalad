00:00:00.764 --> 00:00:04.253
- [Voiceover] What fraction
of the circle is shaded red?

00:00:04.253 --> 00:00:07.105
So let's see, this circle is divided into

00:00:07.105 --> 00:00:11.272
one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight equal parts,

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:15.887
and of those eight equal
parts seven are shaded red.

00:00:15.887 --> 00:00:20.054
So, we can say that seven
out of eight are shaded red,

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:23.022
and this isn't how we
traditionally seen fraction

00:00:23.022 --> 00:00:23.883
when we've written them.

00:00:23.883 --> 00:00:26.439
When we've written them
we've written it like this.

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.574
We have written seven
over eight are shaded red.

00:00:30.574 --> 00:00:32.089
And actually, let me do it in that color,

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:33.618
oh, I don't have that exact,

00:00:33.618 --> 00:00:35.359
let me get closer to an actual red color.

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:38.893
So, we could literally say seven out of,

00:00:38.893 --> 00:00:41.094
and then we need like a grey color was,

00:00:41.094 --> 00:00:42.015
was the non-shaded.

00:00:42.015 --> 00:00:46.302
Seven out of a total eight are shaded red.

00:00:46.302 --> 00:00:50.155
Are shaded red, that's how
we're used to seeing it,

00:00:50.155 --> 00:00:52.771
but sometimes, or usually
when we type it in

00:00:52.771 --> 00:00:55.082
there's no way to write
the seven over the eight,

00:00:55.082 --> 00:00:58.915
so instead, instead we
write seven over eight.

00:00:59.964 --> 00:01:03.800
Over eight are shaded red,
or seven out of eight.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.953
So, let's do that.

00:01:04.953 --> 00:01:06.551
Go back to what we we're doing.

00:01:06.551 --> 00:01:08.032
So, seven out of eight are shaded red.

00:01:08.032 --> 00:01:09.224
Let's check our answer.

00:01:09.224 --> 00:01:11.513
Let's do two more of these.

00:01:11.513 --> 00:01:13.636
What fraction of the bar is shaded red?

00:01:13.636 --> 00:01:16.454
So, the bar has one, two, three, four,

00:01:16.454 --> 00:01:19.938
five, six, seven, eight,
nine equal sections,

00:01:19.938 --> 00:01:22.253
and eight of them are shaded red.

00:01:22.253 --> 00:01:25.711
So, we can say that eight
out of nine are shaded red,

00:01:25.711 --> 00:01:28.666
or eight-ninths, or eight over nine.

00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:30.166
Let's do one more.

00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:33.729
What fraction of this
circle is shaded red?

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.715
So, we have one, two, three, four,

00:01:35.715 --> 00:01:39.101
five, six, seven, eight,
nine equal sections.

00:01:39.101 --> 00:01:39.934
Did I count that right?

00:01:39.934 --> 00:01:40.767
Let me count again.

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:42.487
One, two, three, four, five,

00:01:42.487 --> 00:01:45.417
six, seven, eight, nine equal sections,

00:01:45.417 --> 00:01:48.218
and of those one, two, three, four,

00:01:48.218 --> 00:01:50.633
five, six, seven are shaded red.

00:01:50.633 --> 00:01:54.800
So, seven out of nine, or
seven-ninths are shaded red.
