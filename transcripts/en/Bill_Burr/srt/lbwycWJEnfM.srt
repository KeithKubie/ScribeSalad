1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,510
Hey, what's going on?

2
00:00:03,511 --> 00:00:07,140
It's Bill Burr and it is the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,350
February 8th,

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,130
2010 one day after Superbowl 44.

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,590
Well, I'm usually, I don't begin
my podcasts with a warning,

6
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:24,570
but I'm going to this week. Um, if
you live anywhere near Indianapolis,

7
00:00:24,571 --> 00:00:28,830
you want to shut this
thing off right now. Okay?

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:34,100
If you one of those fantasy
football playing douchebags
with your stats and your

9
00:00:35,851 --> 00:00:38,880
Peyton manning poster hanging
above your fucking bed,

10
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,300
you want to shut this thing
off right now. All right?

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,590
Because this podcast is dedicated
to you guys. You fucking cons.

12
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,540
Who I've been telling you for the last
five fucking years that Peyton manning is

13
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:56,130
overrated. I even went off on him last
week. Last week I went off on that guy.

14
00:00:56,131 --> 00:01:01,131
And you cannot believe the emails that
I got from people all just fucking,

15
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:03,780
not only defending Peyton Manning,

16
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,640
but brushing off Tom Brady and
his three Superbowl rings as if,

17
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,810
Oh, you can plug anybody into that
system, you know? But Peyton man, Ooh,

18
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,580
Peyton, Manny who paint Manny, he threw,

19
00:01:14,581 --> 00:01:17,220
he threw for 50 fucking
touchdowns during what?

20
00:01:17,221 --> 00:01:20,310
He threw five touchdowns against
the fucking Buccaneers in November.

21
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,440
I said it last week.

22
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,610
Peyton manning is irregular season
statistical juggernaut. Alright?

23
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,300
If you want to know who the fuck that
guy is, if you're still confused,

24
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,170
the fuck is there an
invasion. You hear that shit?

25
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,170
That's what happens
out here in fucking la.

26
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,020
Somebody probably just
robbed a convenience store.

27
00:01:40,021 --> 00:01:44,580
They got a little overboard out here,
dude, I'm telling you right now,

28
00:01:44,581 --> 00:01:47,040
if you wanna know who Peyton manning is,
you wanna know who that fucking guy is.

29
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,520
Picture this. If Dan
Marino fucked Brett Farve,

30
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:55,080
their baby would be Peyton
manning. That's who he is. Okay?

31
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,140
And this asshole had only
one one fucking time.

32
00:01:58,141 --> 00:02:01,620
His whole career and all these
analysts on TV. It was ridiculous.

33
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:05,040
They're all going, you know, I'm
telling you right now, you know,

34
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,910
if he wins here, you're, you're,

35
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,820
you're arguably looking at one of the
greatest quarterbacks of all time because

36
00:02:11,821 --> 00:02:16,650
of what? Based on what? Based on
what his regular season stats.

37
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,210
This guy fucking chokes every year in
the fucking playoffs. He's only won once.

38
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,080
He's only won once and everybody's just
fucking talking about it and all you

39
00:02:25,081 --> 00:02:29,610
assholes. Who fucking emailed me this
week? Where are you emails now? Huh?

40
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,050
I emailed each one of you,

41
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,890
every one of you fucking back and I
never heard it from you. You know,

42
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,810
maybe you still fucking stunned.

43
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,930
Maybe you're still fucking
confused so you know what?

44
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,771
You know what I'm going to do?

45
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:44,460
Just for all of you fucking idiots out
there who think that Peyton manning is

46
00:02:44,461 --> 00:02:49,020
the greatest fucking guy ever.
Totally disrespecting Tom Brady.

47
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,660
I mean, Tom Brady has to wear, you know,

48
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,690
he has to wear a fucking welder's
mask at night to go to sleep.

49
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:58,230
That's how fucking bright his room is
from those three championship rings.

50
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:02,380
And you guys still him, the analysts
on TV still disrespect them.

51
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,020
They never talk about him the way
they talk about Peyton, Manny,

52
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:08,710
all that accounts is what the
fuck you do in January. You know,

53
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,870
nobody talks about Terry Bradshaw.

54
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,710
You guys haven't watched super
bowl 10 it's up on fucking youtube.

55
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:18,640
Watch that game. Terry Bradshaw.
If you looked at his numbers,

56
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,330
you fucking stat boy pussies. If
you looked at his numbers on paper,

57
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:25,100
you wouldn't think the guy was shit.
You'd be like, well Peyton, man, he,

58
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,600
he's like twice as good as this guy.
He's closing in on 50,000 yards.

59
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:32,270
All Bradshaw has a 25,000 yards.
Yeah, in four fucking rings.

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,930
Super Bowl. 10 Terry Bradshaw Fades back
to pass in the fourth fucking quarter,

61
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,380
gets knocked unconscious,
gets a concussion. Okay,

62
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,150
and on that play that he got a concussion,

63
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,870
he throws a 50 yard strike to Lynn
Swan for the go ahead. Fucking score.

64
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,513
All right.

65
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,700
That's what the great ones do and nobody
ever brings up Terry Bradshaw. He,

66
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:55,000
what the fuck has he ever done by
other than when for fucking Superbowls.

67
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,120
So just in case you guys are still
confused about your boy Peyton Manning,

68
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,060
I'm going to read you some of his
stats. The stats that fucking count.

69
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,233
All right?

70
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,980
Yeah, we go the greatest
quarterback of all time.

71
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:12,730
I got a little music for
you this week. All right.

72
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:19,210
December 30th I'm such an
obnoxious ass. This is Carly Simon,

73
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:22,900
by the way, sing and nobody
does it better. You know,

74
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,250
this is what all the analysts have been
singing for the last fucking 10 years of

75
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:30,810
this guy's career.
December 30th all right.

76
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,900
Kicks ass in the regular
season. Dolphins beat the colts.

77
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:38,890
2117 overtime wildcard game,
oh, whatever, whatever.

78
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,590
That's his first trip to the
playoffs. He'll get better.

79
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:48,030
2002 colts lose 41 nothing in a playoff
route against the New York jets,

80
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,970
j e t s jets, jets, jets.

81
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,090
This is the greatest
quarterback of all fucking time.

82
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:57,700
Potentially with one fucking ring.

83
00:04:57,701 --> 00:05:02,110
Everybody tune in and watch to see
how he does against the sakes. That's,

84
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,440
look how we did January 8th,

85
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,580
2004 cold slews 24 14 to
the New England patriots.

86
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,200
Greatest fucking quarterback,
potentially a better one fucking ring.

87
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,190
You see his footwork?
He's on unbelievable.

88
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,830
I'll tell you his hand eye
coordination. He's got the pedigree.

89
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,570
January 60 2005 colt again,
lose to the Patriots,

90
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:30,250
20 to three greatest fucking
quarterback off all fucking time.

91
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:36,130
January 15th, 2006 cults
lose to this Steelers.

92
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,830
21 to 18 greatest quarterback of all time,

93
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,400
and right around then people start
going, oh, is this another Dan Marino?

94
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,720
But no. The next year he finally
fucking shows up. Finally grows a Dick,

95
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,980
comes back 21 points down against the
Patriots, winters for a super bowl,

96
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:56,920
and then I'm thinking, okay,
he's a fucking man now, right?

97
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,320
I'm gonna see some Montana
Shit. I'm going to see some,

98
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,030
some fucking Terry Bradshaw. I'm
going to see some time fucking Brady.

99
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,250
What's he doing in the
next year? He loses at home

100
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,710
to the San Diego chargers. All right.
Maybe you had a fucking hangover,

101
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,800
maybe at a fucking hangover.
What's he do in the next year?

102
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Greatest quarter fucking quarterback ever
loses to the eight and eight chargers

103
00:06:22,191 --> 00:06:26,720
at fucking home, right? And hear the song.

104
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,690
This is what these fucking analysts
would just continue to sing.

105
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,230
He's the new bread farm bread.

106
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:37,460
Barb can do no wrong throws against
his body over the fucking middle.

107
00:06:37,461 --> 00:06:39,980
And what does Tom Jackson
say? Well, you know,

108
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:41,720
he's never been afraid to lose the game.

109
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,440
He fucking blow it the most
shows vikings purple nuts,

110
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,880
right into the fucking ground and they're
still fucking rubbing his god Damn

111
00:06:49,881 --> 00:06:54,050
Mississippi Cock. I'm sick
of it. So here you go.

112
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,930
He goes up against the lowly saints.

113
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,090
They've never won a fucking thing in 40
fucking years of being in the league.

114
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,960
What's going to be the difference?
Peyton manning. I'll tell ya,

115
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:10,310
I gotta go with Peyton Manning. Oh,
pate. Manning Peyton Manning's that.

116
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:15,110
Peyton manning lost the fucking
game yesterday. The final drive.

117
00:07:15,111 --> 00:07:16,880
I got a question for
you. Indianapolis fans.

118
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,500
This Tom Brady throw a pick six
at the end of the super bowl,

119
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,320
there's Joe Montana.
Throw a fucking pick six.

120
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,020
Does Terry Bradshaw does.

121
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:30,920
Ben Roethlisberger one of the
most overlooked quarterbacks
of all times sitting

122
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:33,350
at home with fucking two rings.

123
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,580
Does he know he doesn't? Alright,

124
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,440
so fuck all you fucking idiots out in
Indianapolis. There you go. How was that?

125
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:46,430
Did you like that right in your fucking
ass. God bless the saints everybody.

126
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:46,760
Huh?
