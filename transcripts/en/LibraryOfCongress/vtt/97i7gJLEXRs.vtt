00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.130
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Good morning.

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:04.880
My name is Colleen Shogan.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.380
And I'm the Deputy Director
of our outreach unit here

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.900
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.590
And it's my privilege
to welcome you

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.250
to the 18th annual
National Book Festival.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.890
As you may know, the Library

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.740
of Congress is the largest
library in the world.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.040
We have millions of books.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.340
Manuscripts.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.640
Photographs.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.940
Newspapers.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.240
Maps. Comics.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.540
And other items in
our collection.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.050
We're thrilled that
you're here today with us.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.330
We also invite you to come
visit us on Capitol Hill.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.640
Or online at loc.gov.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.880
Today we welcome author James
Swanson to the teen stage.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.980
He is the award-winning author
of the best-selling page turner

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.680
"Manhunt, the 12-Day Chase
For Lincoln's Killer."

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.540
He also wrote a YA
adaptation for "Manhunt" along

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.560
with a young adult
nonfiction book

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.840
on the Kennedy assassination.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.800
His most recent book, the book
we're going to hear about today,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.640
is "Chasing King's Killer."

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.070
Which is about the murder
of Martin Luther King,

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.210
Jr. I just finished James's
book a few weeks ago.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.240
It's a terrifically
detailed account

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.800
of the unfortunate
circumstances leading

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.620
to the King assassination.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.140
There's a lot of true
crime detail in the book.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.440
Including sketches.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.030
Diagrams. Photographs.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.120
And maps. Which help the
reader understand what happened

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.030
on that fateful day in 1968.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.470
We learn a great deal about
Martin Luther King, Jr. His roll

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.290
as a leader of the
civil rights movement.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.920
"Chasing King's Killer" also
provides fascinating details

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.710
about how the assassin, James
Earl Ray, used disguises

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.720
and other tricks to
allude the police

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.360
and the FBI after the murder.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.920
This is a real page turner.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.200
I started reading the book
one night before going to bed,

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.020
and I finished it next day.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.320
And that's the sign of
a very, very good book.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.210
Please join me in welcoming
to the teen stage one

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.680
of the best historical
crime writers

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.510
in the United States
today, James Swanson.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:08.500
[ Applause ]

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.410
&gt;&gt; James L. Swanson:
Thank you, Colleen.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.280
It's great to be back at
the National Book Festival.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.580
This is my fifth time here.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.950
And I love coming here to meet
all of you and meet the readers.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.530
So why did I write this book?

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.390
This is the final
book in my trilogy

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.330
on American assassinations.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.770
About Abraham Lincoln.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.070
John F. Kennedy.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.580
And Martin Luther King.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.080
And I focused on these
three great American heroes.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.880
It's not that I'm obsessed
with death and violence.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.890
But rather key moments of
change in American history.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.570
When something happens, and
everything changes overnight.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.210
And nothing is ever
the same again.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.410
This book is also set in
the turbulent 1960s America.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.650
For those who remember
or those who don't,

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.700
those were the years
of the Vietnam War.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.090
The race to the moon.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.480
Civil unrest.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.240
Riots in the streets.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.640
And assassinations.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.200
Not just of Dr. King.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.550
But of Malcolm X.
President Kennedy.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:11.850
Robert Kennedy.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.260
It was a tumultuous,
confusing time.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.440
The book covers Martin
Luther King's entire life,

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.190
from childhood to his adulthood.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.790
But it especially
focuses on his last years.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.590
So this is not just
a book about death.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.040
It's about a great life
and a heroic life too.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.550
For me this is probably
the most personal

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.020
of these three books
of this trilogy.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.630
I remember the night that
Martin Luther King was killed.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.590
In the riots that followed, my
father drove me through parts

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.140
of our home town Chicago,
that had burned to the ground.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.950
Until recently, parts of
our city had never recovered

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.160
in the last 50 years since
the death of Dr. King.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.670
I remember going to
our local post office

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.830
and seeing reward posters
for the assassin pinned

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.130
to the bulletin board.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.480
Posters which I now
have in my collection

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.630
and which I share
with you in the book.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.910
So this book, probably
more than the other two,

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.030
is my way of bringing
the past that I lived

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.900
through as a boy to
a new generation.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.980
And the reason I write books
for children and for teens is

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.610
that I don't think you
have to be spectators

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.690
or observers of history.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.750
You can actually be part of it.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.080
Young people were a
very important part

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.710
of the civil rights movement.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.680
Just as they're involved
in it today.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.480
So where does the book begin?

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:42.050
It begins in 1958, ten years
before King's assassination.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.050
And it begins with a stabbing.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.050
A little known episode
in King's life.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.080
King was just becoming
famous for his leadership

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.300
of the 1955 Montgomery
bus boycott.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.040
And he was in New York City
to promote his first book,

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.340
"Strive Toward Freedom."

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.420
And it was going so well.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.550
He was at a department
store in Harlem.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.710
He was sitting at a desk,
and he was signing books.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.010
And then a well-dressed
middle-aged black woman

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.310
approached him.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.610
She fit right in with the crowd.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:13.910
Nothing looked bad.

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.410
And she said, are you
Martin Luther King?

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.460
And he looked up and
said, well, yes, I am.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.840
And with that she drew a letter
opener, but it was razor sharp

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.930
like a miniature samurai sword.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.230
She pulled it out of her bag.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.530
She raised it up
high in the air.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.880
And plunged it into his chest.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.310
And she stabbed him so hard
that the handle broke off.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.110
And the blade stayed
embedded in his chest.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.040
It looked like it was
right where his heart was.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.280
Immediately there
was panic and chaos.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.540
Someone reached for the
blade to pull it out.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.840
But then someone
shouted, don't do that.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.980
You'll kill him if
you pull it out.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.280
It was true.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.620
As doctors would find out
later, the blade was so close

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.030
to King's aorta that any
movement, even coughing

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.490
or a sneeze, could have
led to his instant death.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.450
But he didn't die.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.410
King woke up hours later
in a Harlem hospital.

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.550
He had survived.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.970
He would live.

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.740
So why do I begin the book here,

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.480
ten years before the
main story of the book?

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.690
I begin here because
King's life could have been

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.190
over before it ever
really began.

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.720
If he had been killed
in that stabbing,

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.990
we might not even remember the
name of Martin Luther King.

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.060
The woman's name
was Izola Curry.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:40.340
And she was deemed later
to be mentally ill.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.230
She was charged with attempted
murder, but she spent the rest

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.710
of her life in mental
institutions.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.010
And she's one of the last
survivors of this whole tale.

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:54.720
She died just three years
ago in her late 90s in 2015.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.830
But by then she'd really
forgotten what she had done

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.690
and how she almost
changed history forever.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.210
Upon Martin Luther King's
release from the hospital,

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.190
he asked that there be
no vengeance against her

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.170
and that she not be punished.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.440
But that she get
support and understanding

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.910
for the treatment she needed.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:19.350
But if she had succeeded, how
would our world be different?

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.690
We might ask, what would the
world, what would America be

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.580
like without that crucial decade

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.520
of Martin Luther
King's leadership?

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.450
What great words would
have gone unspoken?

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:34.540
What great deeds would
have gone undone?

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.990
Martin Luther King had just
narrowly escaped death.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.950
And from that moment on,

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.610
he thought he was
living on borrowed time.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.020
So what about King's
life in these ten years,

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.680
in this short decade
from 1958 to '68?

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:53.510
It was a year filled, a
decade filled with excitement.

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:55.970
Turmoil. Great success.

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:57.570
Great setbacks.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:02.880
In 1963, Martin Luther King led
the famous march on Washington

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.210
that climaxed at the
Lincoln Memorial.

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:08.890
Where he spoke to a
crowd of 250,000 people.

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:10.710
And said, I have a dream.

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:14.660
In 1964, he received
the Nobel Peace Prize.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.950
And worked hard for
civil rights legislation

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:18.940
that would pass soon.

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:20.240
The Civil Rights Act.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.540
The Voting Rights Act.

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:25.550
In 1965, he led the
famous march from Selma

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:28.160
to Montgomery, Alabama.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.410
Those were years of
challenge and change

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.870
for Dr. King and all Americans.

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:37.140
In 1967, he took a major
stand against the Vietnam War.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:41.160
But by the late 1960s,
King's leadership

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.660
of the civil rights movement
was increasingly challenged

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:46.540
by younger more radical leaders.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.040
King faced a number of
failures and setbacks,

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.800
and these discouraged him.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.650
King experienced
great self-doubt.

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:59.410
And he began to wonder, was
he the right man to continue

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:00.740
to lead this movement?

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.450
Was he the right
man for the job?

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:08.340
Then on April 3, 1968,
King was in Memphis,

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.810
Tennessee to support the
city sanitation workers

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:15.210
who were striking for
better working conditions.

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:17.810
King was exhausted
from extensive travel.

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:21.340
He was faced with a mounting
burden of inner doubt

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:24.580
about his own abilities
as a leader.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:28.500
He was sick with a sore
throat and a fever.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.520
And that night there
was a massive storm

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.240
with pouring rain and thunder.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:36.090
And the last thing he
wanted to do was go outside

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:37.940
and go and give a speech.

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.240
But he did.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.850
At 8:30 p.m., King appeared
at the Mason Temple and spoke

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:46.660
to an overflowing
crowd of 3,000 people.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:51.780
And in this speech, arguably
the best of his life,

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:54.420
he summarized his life
and highlighted something

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.870
that had happened to
him ten years before.

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:00.950
He told the audience
how he'd been stabbed

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:04.390
by Izola Curry a decade before.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.360
He revealed that, as he
recovered from that attack,

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.940
he had received a letter
from a young white girl.

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.930
A ninth grade student
who had read

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:16.130
about what had happened to him.

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:18.750
And in her letter,
King said she wrote.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:22.690
I read that, if you'd
sneezed, you would have died.

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:25.140
I'm simply writing
you to say that I'm

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.810
so happy you didn't sneeze.

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:31.330
King repeated her
words, and he said,

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:35.090
I'm so glad I didn't sneeze.

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:36.480
He said, if I had sneezed,

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.830
I couldn't have been
there at Selma.

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:39.640
I couldn't have been in
the march on Washington.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.190
I couldn't be here tonight.

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:45.430
He appreciated how he lived in
the last decade and the years

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:50.370
of progress, though not
perfect, that had been made.

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:53.730
King ended the speech by saying
what I think are his finest

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:55.030
public remarks.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:58.290
Even greater than the
march on Washington.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:03.460
So he said, like anybody, I
would like to live a long life.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:08.350
Longevity has its place, but I'm
not concerned about that now.

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:11.060
I just want to do God's will.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.820
And he's allowed me to go

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.250
up to the mountain,
and I've looked over.

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:18.470
And I have seen the
promised land.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.340
I may not get there with you.

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:22.250
But I want you to
know tonight that we

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:24.860
as a people will get
to the promised land.

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:28.400
And I'm so happy tonight.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.980
I'm not worried about anything.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.590
I'm not fearing any man.

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:38.010
Mine eyes have seen the glory
of the coming of the Lord.

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:39.910
Then he collapsed into the arms

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:42.120
of his best friend,
Ralph Abernathy.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:45.610
Later Abernathy said, I've
never seen him better.

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:48.540
But he should have
feared one man.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:53.140
A few miles away a man waited
at a seedy hotel with a rifle.

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:58.580
The next day Martin Luther King
would be dead, assassinated

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:00.670
by perhaps the most
unlikely killer.

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:05.480
An escaped convict and petty
criminal named James Earl Ray.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.780
So who was this Ray?

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.840
He had grown up diet
poor in Missouri

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:13.350
in a family of career criminals.

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:16.730
Strangely, he was just the
kind of underprivileged,

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:21.120
uneducated child that Martin
Luther King would have wanted

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.420
to help.

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.040
By Ray's teenage years,

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.070
he was living the life
of a failed criminal.

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:30.380
He was in and out of jail
until in 1959, he was sentenced

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.280
to a 20-year term for robbery.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.330
And if he had served
that entire sentence,

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:38.010
we never would have
heard of James Earl Ray.

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:44.260
Except in 1967, he escaped.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.930
So why did he want to
kill Martin Luther King?

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:50.230
James Earl Ray did not escape
from prison with a plan

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:52.720
to assassinate Dr. King.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:57.550
No, he escaped to reinvent
himself and forge a new life.

00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:59.190
He traveled to Canada.

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:01.430
Mexico. And California.

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:04.180
He took professional
bartending lessons.

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:05.480
Dance classes.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.050
And locksmithing courses.

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:12.880
The one thing he did not
do is stalk Dr. King.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:19.210
For exactly one year from
March 1967 to March 1968,

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:22.150
Ray enjoyed his new life.

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:25.910
There's no evidence he even
thought about Dr. King.

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:29.440
That all changed when
King flew to Los Angeles

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:34.450
and gave a speech near
Disneyland on March 16th, 1968.

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:39.000
The next day on March
17th, King flew home.

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:43.690
But on that same day,
James Earl Ray packed

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:48.220
up all his belongings, got
in his Mustang sports car.

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:52.230
And drove all the way across
the country from California,

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:54.360
ultimately to Memphis,
Tennessee.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:59.590
And on the way he
bought a rifle.

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:02.700
Something in Ray had changed.

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.340
Like a caged homing pigeon
or hibernating animal,

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:09.110
Ray responded to an inner
call that only he could hear.

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:12.900
It would direct his movements
for the next three weeks.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.310
It was though a silent
alarm had rung inside him,

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:18.530
summoning him South.

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:25.710
By April 3rd, 1968, Ray was in
Memphis, where Dr. King was.

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:27.670
That night King spoke
at the Mason Temple

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:29.780
and gave that great speech.

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:33.080
The next morning Ray found a
rooming house with a direct view

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:37.810
of the Lorraine Hotel,
where King was staying.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.570
But Ray's room didn't have a
clear view of the Lorraine.

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:42.810
The windows were on
in the wrong place.

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:47.120
It would have been
impossible to attack Dr. King.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.670
So Ray went to a common
bathroom down the hall.

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:52.670
He punched out the
window screen.

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.510
But the window itself was stuck.

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:57.230
There were just a few inches at
the bottom that were still open.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:02.810
Just enough space to poke
out the barrel of a rifle.

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:05.660
But even then, the view
wasn't completely clear.

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:07.500
So Ray had to stand
in the bathtub

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.320
to get an unobstructed
view of King's room.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.420
When Dr. King finally
emerged from his hotel room

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:15.690
around six o'clock for dinner,

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:18.920
James Earl Ray was
watching and waiting.

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:22.310
As King stood on the balcony
outside his room and looked

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:23.850
down at his friends
in the parking lot.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:26.220
And spoke to them
about going to dinner.

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:27.760
James Earl Ray got
him in the sights

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:31.690
of his telescope
and fired one shot.

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:36.470
The bullet hit Dr. King
in the right cheek.

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:37.770
Entered his neck.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.070
Severed arteries.

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:40.920
Crashed through his spine.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.690
People watching yelled,
Dr. King has been shot.

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:47.160
He was immediately
rushed to the hospital.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:51.140
But an EKG show he
had no heart function.

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:52.440
Doctors tried valiantly

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.360
to resuscitate him
for almost an hour.

00:15:54.360 --> 00:16:00.420
But at 7:05 p.m., only one
hour after he was shot,

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:03.050
he was pronounced dead.

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:04.350
Martin Luther King, Jr.,

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:07.500
the great civil rights
leader was gone.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:10.850
So what about his assassin?

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:14.230
Unbelievably, after the
murder James Earl Ray escaped

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:16.470
and disappeared.

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:20.130
Speeding away in his Mustang,
he fled the murder scene

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:22.320
without a moment to spare.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.620
One minute after he
escaped, the police showed

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:28.040
up at the door where he escaped.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.400
And they would have
captured him on the spot,

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.460
but he escaped just
in the nick of time.

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:34.870
His escape launched
the biggest manhunt

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:37.770
in the history of the FBI.

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:41.630
Three thousand agents, half
the entire FBI were put

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:44.270
on the chase to find the killer.

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:45.570
To identify who he was.

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:48.700
No one knew the man named James
Earl Ray had killed Dr. King.

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.400
They only knew that
an unknown man.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:52.900
It took weeks.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.960
Ray eventually made
his way to Canada.

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.410
Then to England and Portugal.

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:58.880
And finally back to England
when he couldn't arrange passage

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:03.580
to Africa, where he hoped to
become a paid mercenary in one

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:06.790
of the white-ruled governments.

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:08.530
In fact, it was only
a slip of fate

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:10.920
that his passport was double
checked at Heathrow Airport

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:15.590
in London on June 8th, 1968,
leading to his eventual arrest.

00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:21.310
It took 106 days from
King's assassination

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:25.060
to raise extradition from
England to the United States.

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.780
And, in fact, it
was only 15 months

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:30.240
since Ray had escaped
from prison.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.410
One of history's most
shocking possibilities is that,

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:38.740
if James Earl Ray had
escaped to Africa,

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:41.040
he probably would have
disappeared for good.

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.410
And the murder of Dr. King would
have escaped justice forever.

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:48.210
But he was caught.

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:51.930
Ray spent the rest of
his life in prison.

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:59.490
He survived Martin Luther King
by 30 years, dying in 1998.

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:02.140
So what should we take
away from this story?

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:06.270
For those of us who remember
it, it's hard to believe

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:11.000
that it's been 50
years, 1968 to 2018,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.230
that doctor King was killed.

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:19.420
If he was alive today, and
that's not inconceivable,

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:22.250
he would be 89 years old.

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:24.400
He was only 39 when he died.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.400
Such a young man.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.860
But he might still be
alive, leading the charge

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:33.910
for equal rights
and fair treatment.

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:36.370
How we could have
benefited from five decades

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:38.890
of his continued leadership.

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:42.220
Imagine if he was
here all that time.

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:44.870
What would Dr. King
say to us today?

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:50.570
I think he might ask us to turn
to something he said in 1965

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:52.900
when he stood on the steps of
the state capital in Montgomery,

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:58.550
Alabama, after the successful
march from Selma to Montgomery.

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:01.730
Standing there he
asked a question

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:04.600
that still reverberates today.

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.880
Dr. King said, how
long will it take?

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.980
He said, how long will prejudice
blind the visions of men?

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.820
Darken their understanding
and drive bright-eyed wisdom

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.790
from her sacred throne?

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:20.530
How long will justice be
crucified and truth bear it?

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:23.800
And you know what he said?

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.690
Dr. King said, how long?

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:30.490
Not long. Because the arc
the moral universe is long,

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:32.520
but it bends towards justice.

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.090
And he repeated that
phrase over and over again.

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:36.490
How long will it take?

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:37.790
How long will it take?

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:39.980
And then he gave the answer.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:43.810
Certainly much progress
has been made,

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:46.090
that doctor King
would say that today.

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:50.710
But he would also say even
more needs to be done.

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:54.780
So I ask you today, and I
think that Dr. King would say

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:58.680
to us now, how long
will it take?

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:02.210
And with that I thank you.

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:04.080
And would love to
take questions.

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.590
So please ask.

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:08.510
Thanks.

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:26.420
Okay, not yet.

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:27.720

&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.320
Sorry.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.620
&gt;&gt; James L. Swanson: Yeah.

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:33.340
&gt;&gt; I was just wondering, did
you ever get any like blow back

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:35.960
from like publishers or
even parents for writing

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:39.410
about assassinations for young
adult and middle grade readers?

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:42.150
I really enjoyed your
books by the way.

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:44.360
&gt;&gt; James L. Swanson:
Strangely, not really.

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:49.480
I talked to a lot of young
readers, including my two boys,

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.950
when I wrote my first
assassination book on Lincoln.

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:53.250
They were seven and nine.

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:56.380
And one boy said,
readers want blood.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:00.320
And the other boy
said, and knives.

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:03.360
Also, here's why I don't
get blow back from parents.

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.530
And I've discussed this with
parents, with kids and adults.

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:10.060
I also asked my friend
Congressman John Lewis

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.940
about this, who wrote a
wonderful forward to the book.

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:15.570
And I said, you know,
I don't want to look

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:17.920
like I'm exploiting
the death of Dr. King.

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.890
He said, no, tell the
story like it was.

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:22.190
Tell it like it happened.

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:23.670
It's a real story.

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:24.970
It's not fiction.

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:30.570
Martin Luther King was killed in
a horrible way by a racist man.

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:32.000
A wife lost her husband.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.600
Children lost their father.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.830
So part of the violence
in my books is real.

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:41.580
I don't want kids to think
it's fun or it's not real.

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:43.730
Or that violence doesn't
have consequences.

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:45.680
I also set it in the
context of history

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.160
and what really happened.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:50.940
And so that's why young people
and parents and teachers

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:55.210
and librarians have told me they
appreciate the vivid realism

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:56.510
of my books.

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:57.950
But they don't find it salacious

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:00.260
or exploitive for
its own purpose.

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:02.180
So people have been
very accepting

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:04.720
of the way I write the books.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.020

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.320

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.030
&gt;&gt; Hi, I just wanted
to thank you quickly

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:11.330
for writing the books.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:12.990
I remember in seventh grade
we were assigned to read it.

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:14.730
And it was really a
breakthrough for me

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:18.260
because it's what got me really
interested in American history.

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:22.000
I was just wondering about
"Chasing Lincoln's Killer."

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.160
Was it difficult to
sort of adapt "Manhunt"

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.940
into something for young adults.

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:29.240
[ Multiple Speakers ]

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.540
&gt;&gt; It was.

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:31.840
It was. In my ignorance
I thought,

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.340
oh, this will be so easy.

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:35.520
I'll just edit down
the adult book

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.450
into a little young adult book.

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:41.110
"Manhunt" was about
140,000 words long.

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:44.260
And "Chasing Lincoln's
Killer," I think was

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:46.950
about 30, 32,000 words long.

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:49.740
I was quickly disabused
of how easy it would be.

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:52.390
And I felt like I had to
really write a new book.

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:55.040
I just couldn't edit it down.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.940
I really needed to
write it for teens.

00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:01.340
So I wrote it really for
my boys or the boy I was.

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:05.640
I think one reason I enjoy
writing books for teens is,

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:08.700
in many ways I'm still
the kid I always was.

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:11.750
That has advantages
and disadvantages.

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:15.640
But I mentioned how I would
want to read the story.

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:17.760
And the main difference
between writing for teens

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.500
and adults is you
cannot dumb it down.

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:21.800
They always know.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:25.150
I knew when I was a kid, and
you kids in the audience know it

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:26.710
when adults are speaking
down to you.

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:29.130
Or when they're concealing
something from you.

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:30.880
The main thing is you
have to take out some

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.930
of the tertiary characters.

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:36.350
You have to take out maybe
some of the irony or some

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:38.590
of the incongruities
or the foreshadowing.

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:41.570
So I really had to
rewrite the book entirely

00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:42.870
for a younger audience.

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:44.640
It's not easy to do.

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:49.280
And I've done other young adult
books based on adult books.

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.940
And I learned my
lesson the first time.

00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:52.780
That you really have
to write a new book

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:55.690
that speaks to a teen audience.

00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:57.240
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.540
&gt;&gt; James L. Swanson: Yes.

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:01.650
&gt;&gt; Hi, I was going to ask you
how do you get into the point

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:05.500
of view of the assassin
who's like so evil?

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:06.800
&gt;&gt; James L. Swanson: How
do I get into the point

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.200
of view of the assassin?

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:11.450
Well, in the case of Lincoln
and certainly the case

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:13.410
of James Earl Ray, all my books.

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:15.980
The heroes are these great
heroes of American life.

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:17.410
Abraham Lincoln.

00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:18.710
John Kennedy.

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:20.010
And Martin Luther King.

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:23.200
And by the end of the book, I
want it to be absolutely clear

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.690
that those people and what
they stood for are the heroes

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:28.740
and guiding principles
of the book.

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:32.400
But in the case of
John Wilkes Booth,

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:35.710
I want you to know what it's
like to be in the saddle,

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:37.260
galloping away on an escape.

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:40.180
To know what it's like to
be a wounded, hunted man.

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:42.400
To know what it's like to
think, you think you're going

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.070
to be a great hero to the South.

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:47.040
But then read the newspapers
that say you're a devil.

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.340
You've done evil.

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:53.910
And in the case of James
Earl Ray, he was a cipher.

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:55.240
He was a racist.

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:58.790
He killed one of the greatest
men in American history.

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:04.650
But I want you the reader
to decide how evil they are.

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:06.140
The bad they've done.

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:08.600
How great King and
Kennedy and Lincoln are.

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:13.040
And so I don't say in the book
Booth is evil or Booth is bad.

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.460
I want you the reader to come

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:16.940
to your own conclusion
that that is true.

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:19.180
So I want to give you the facts.

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:20.860
Put you in the position
of Lincoln.

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:22.660
To put you in Booth's position.

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:23.960
And Ray's position.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:28.660
And I'm confident that young
readers will have the judgment

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:31.540
and discernment to know who
the heroes of the books are

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:33.820
and who the bad men are.

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:35.980
I think it would be a mistake
to start a book by saying,

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:38.370
you know, the evil John
Wilkes Booth, you know,

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:39.970
on page one or page two.

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:43.840
I want you to see him and know
him and judge him yourself.

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.630
So that's kind of
the technique I use.

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:48.030
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:49.330
&gt;&gt; James L. Swanson: Yes.

00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:50.630
&gt;&gt; I was wondering,
are you going

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:54.110
to write any more young adult
books about American history?

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:55.410
&gt;&gt; James L. Swanson: I am.

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:59.760
I'm working on a book with
Henry Lewis Gates from Harvard.

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.980
And we're writing a book
on what I think is one

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:04.610
of the greatest untold
African-American history

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:05.910
stories ever.

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:07.400
And we're doing an
adult book of that.

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.770
And we're also doing
a young adult book

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:12.590
for my publisher Scholastic.

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:16.710
And I'm working on a few
other young adult books also.

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:18.690
But that's probably
going to be the next one.

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:19.990
I really enjoy doing them.

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:21.580
Because I love going
to the schools.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:24.210
I love getting the letters
from the young readers.

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:27.210
So I get a lot of personal
satisfaction from doing that.

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:30.250
So I want to keep
writing young adult books.

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:31.550
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:32.850
I love your books.

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:34.150
&gt;&gt; James L. Swanson:
Oh, thank you.

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:35.450
Yes.

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:36.750
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:39.980
I think it's possible with
a lot of study to see some

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:42.910
of the motivations
of John Wilkes Booth

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:44.210
and Lee Harvey Oswald.

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:46.490
Sort of understand why
they did these things.

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:52.280
James Earl Ray, I'm curious of
your opinion about motivation.

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:56.210
Because racism doesn't seem
to have been what drove him

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:58.230
around through his
criminal career.

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:01.190
I've heard rumors, I'm not sure
how the historians have treated

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:03.730
them, about their being
a pot money people used

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:05.050
to gossip about in the South.

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:07.540
That if you killed King,
there'd be some people

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:09.090
to pay you off or something.

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:12.040
What do you think
drove James Earl Ray?

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.560
&gt;&gt; James L. Swanson:
Well, James Earl Ray is

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:17.320
in many ways a mystery
or a cipher.

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:21.210
He himself loved the fact that
people couldn't remember him.

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:23.150
They couldn't remember
that they had met him.

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:26.370
He had that every-man look.

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:27.670
We know this.

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:30.320
James Earl Ray was
a lifelong racist.

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:33.860
But that was common at
that time, in that place.

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:36.860
Millions of his fellow Americans
shared his racial views.

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:38.320
He was never part of the Klan.

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.580
He never participated
in racial violence.

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:43.550
He never seemed to obsess
with Martin Luther King.

00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:46.930
And so, when he escaped from
prison, we know he didn't escape

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:49.660
for the purpose of
hunting Dr. King.

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:53.490
And he always wanted
live in the shadows.

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:56.780
We don't know what went on
in his mind when King came

00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:00.250
to California, and then Ray
drove across the country

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:01.640
and murdered him
three weeks later.

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:05.220
I don't believe it
was a conspiracy.

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:08.350
There's no evidence that it was.

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:11.020
He didn't seem to have
personal hatred for Dr. King.

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.250
There were rumors that
a wealthy white man

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:17.150
in the South had put a
$50,000 bounty on King's head.

00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:19.540
But if that's true, how
could Ray have ever collected

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:20.840
that reward?

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.140
Would he have just showed
up at his door and said,

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:23.440
hello, I'm the wanted man.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.140
Where's my money?

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:28.620
After studying Ray
for a long time,

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:31.930
I think Ray in the end
wanted to be something

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:35.550
or do something worthwhile.

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:37.900
He thought he'd be a hero to
racists if he killed King.

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.490
He thought he'd be remembered.

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:41.980
So I think Martin Luther
King was the vehicle

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:44.530
through which James Earl
Ray could achieve a place

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:45.830
in history.

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:48.170
The frustrating thing is,
although Ray lived for 30 years

00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:51.440
and he plead guilty initially,
he tried to retract that plea.

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:54.250
For 30 years he claimed
he didn't do it.

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:56.310
There are dozens and
dozens of pieces of evidence

00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:57.610
that proved it was him.

00:28:57.610 --> 00:28:59.520
He claimed he wasn't
even the triggerman,

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.240
not just conspirators sent him.

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.340
He claimed he didn't
fire the rifle.

00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:04.640
Evidence proves that he did.

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:07.310
So the great frustration
is, although he lived

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:11.990
for three decades, Ray
never told us why he did it.

00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:14.330
He never would admit
that he did do it.

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:15.810
So it's one of the
great mysteries.

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:19.330
But I think of all the evidence
indicates that Ray did it

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:21.640
for personal significance
or achievement.

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:26.130
To see that somehow he had
made a mark in the world.

00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:29.060
That's my best guess.

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:30.360
Yes.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:31.730
&gt;&gt; Two part question.

00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:35.400
First part, with your
books on King and Kennedy,

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:38.150
did you get any feedback
from the families?

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:39.800
Because you, obviously, with
Lincoln that was a long,

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.500
long time ago, but
these are still families

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:44.730
that are alive and in existence.

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:46.190
And the King family,
particularly,

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:48.090
has watched over
their father's legacy.

00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:51.350
So any feedback from them?

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:52.650
&gt;&gt; James L. Swanson:
No, I did not.

00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:58.030
The Kennedy family prefers not
to discuss the assassination.

00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:01.060
And, in fact, they don't like
to mark November 22nd, 1963.

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:04.570
They prefer to celebrate
John Kennedy's birthday.

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:08.860
And so they're not really
interested in the assassination.

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:12.490
I have talked to a number
of John Kennedy's friends.

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:15.310
And I know Clint Hill, the
heroic secret service agent

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:18.220
who leaped on the car to
shield Jackie Kennedy.

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:22.300
And these people have been
very complimentary of the book

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:25.160
and my take on John Kennedy.

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:30.070
I have heard talk to Lyndon
Johnson's family about my books.

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:33.230
And I think LBJ is
a great unsung hero

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:34.530
of civil rights in America.

00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:36.780
And I'm a big fan of
the Lyndon Johnson.

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:40.690
And they've appreciated
my take on LBJ.

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:45.250
I've not heard from
the King family.

00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:47.840
The King family, in large part,

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:51.040
belive there's was a massive
U.S. government conspiracy

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.450
to murder their father.

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:54.160
And there's a shocking
photograph of one

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:57.480
of Dr. King's sons visiting
James Earl Ray in prison.

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:01.280
Reaching out his hand to
shake the hand of the man who,

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:04.950
in fact, without a doubt
murdered his father.

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:07.390
But I've not heard
from them directly.

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:11.480
It's unfortunate that they've
had this contact with the man

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:12.850
who killed their father.

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:14.960
But I've not heard from them.

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:17.360
&gt;&gt; And then the second part,
and you just alluded to that.

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:24.190
Did the King family, with their
background, do they forgive?

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:26.500
&gt;&gt; James L. Swanson: Well,
one of Kings son's said,

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:29.120
we believe you did
not kill our father.

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.990
And so there was not
really forgiveness

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:34.240
because he said, we
don't believe it.

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.690
That I do not believe is true.

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:38.720
James Earl Ray was the assassin
of Dr. Martin Luther King.

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:42.470
I think that's proven
without any doubt whatsoever.

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:45.270
The conspiracy theories
are interesting.

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:46.970
They're a world unto themselves.

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:50.320
And I do address the conspiracy
theories in the books.

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.040
We want to believe them.

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:54.340
Because we believe that,

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:56.390
if someone like Martin Luther
King can be struck down,

00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:57.760
John F Kennedy.

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.590
What hope do we have for order
and planning in our lives

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:03.810
if great men of history can
be struck down randomly?

00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:06.330
We want to believe there's
a larger pattern behind our

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:08.670
misfortunes or terrible
things in the world.

00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:11.230
It's so natural, the
human impulse to want

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:14.080
to believe these
conspiracy theories.

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.710
But they're most often not true.

00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:19.010
&gt;&gt; Great. Thank you.

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:20.310

&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:22.910
I have a process question.

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:25.870
So as a nonfiction writer,
how do you take primary

00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:28.030
and secondary source,
historical sources

00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:31.400
and weave those into your books?

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:32.700
&gt;&gt; James L. Swanson: The
thing I'm most interested

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:37.480
in is the objects and documents
and artifact themselves.

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:38.930
In this book I include a lot

00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:41.160
of original documents
and artifacts.

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:43.400
Like mourning buttons
that people would put

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.650
on their clothes to
remember Dr. King.

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:49.600

00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:58.660
You should listen to him
when you read this book.

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:00.970
It's, you're losing a
lot if you don't listen

00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:02.920
to his words as you
read the book.

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:06.790

seen photographs.

And then showing
them to the reader.

Those are the most
important sources to me.

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:22.580
The original magazines.

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:23.880
The newspapers.

I really want to immerse myself
back in that world and feel

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:31.350
like I'm living back
in that time.

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:34.800
That's probably the
key method that I use.

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.100
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:38.280
&gt;&gt; Excuse, can I
ask my question?

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:39.580
&gt;&gt; James L. Swanson: Yes.

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:43.810

why was he allowed to go to the
prison to talk to his killer

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:49.150
in 1997 the year before he died?

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:51.520
Why did they allow
him to do that?

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.430
&gt;&gt; James L. Swanson: Well,
James Earl Ray was allowed

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:55.700
to receive visitors in prison.

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:59.600
And Dexter King requested
to visit James Earl Ray

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.750
for the purpose of telling Ray

00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:04.100
that he didn't believe
he killed his father.

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:06.670
So no one could really
prevented that.

00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:08.440
Ray was allowed to
receive visitors.

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.340
Dexter King wanted to see him.

that he would do that?

00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:26.730

Ray did murder his father.

The King family is wrong
about that, sad to say.

00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:33.420
James Earl Ray was the man
who killed Martin Luther King.

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:43.220
&gt;&gt; James L. Swanson: Well,

00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:44.520
all I can say is the
evidence suggests it.

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:45.830
But there's one more question,
and we're running out of time.

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:47.130
So can I take your question.

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:48.430
&gt;&gt; Yes, please.

00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:49.730
And thank you so much.

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:52.110
I think that authors
really are seekers of truth.

00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:54.130
But I always wonder.

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:56.730
Is there a moment of doubt
when you find your words

00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:58.260
to express what you saw

00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:00.280
and maybe the words
what you research.

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:03.000
And maybe the words are not
deep enough or strong enough?

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.330
How do you get past,
if it happens to you?

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:07.960
How do you get past that moment
of doubt in the process and art

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.950
of expressing the
truth you found?

00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:12.180
&gt;&gt; James L. Swanson:
Well, in other words,

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:14.590
express it more clearly?

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:15.890
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:17.190
&gt;&gt; James L. Swanson: Or fully?

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:18.490
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:19.790
&gt;&gt; James L. Swanson: Okay.

00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:21.090
Well, I think we all
suffer from that problem.

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:22.390
And I agree with
what Steven King said

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:23.690
in his wonderful
book on writing.

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:24.990
King said, even the best of us,

00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:26.290
and I don't say I'm
the best of us.

00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:29.180
King himself says he's
not the best among us.

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:33.070
King says, all writers
experience the frustration

00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:35.810
of knowing that the words
that appear on the page,

00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:37.540
no matter how many drafts we do.

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:39.630
How many times we rewrite it.

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:44.930
We often feel that the words we
write don't fully express the

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:46.750
emotions we feel.

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:49.090
And I think it's just
endemic to be a writer

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:51.040
where we always think
we can do it better.

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:54.550
Be more precise or express the
feelings of us or others better.

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:57.000
It's one of the frustrating
things about writing books.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.850
You always ask yourself,
could I have done that better?

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:04.070
&gt;&gt; Well, thanks for the
courage to be an author.

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:05.370
&gt;&gt; James L. Swanson: Yeah.

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:08.030
&gt;&gt; I read in your "Chasing
Lincoln's Killer" that,

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:10.250
when you were young, that
your grandmother gave you an

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:12.780
engraving of the
Derringer pistol.

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:15.700
How did you get into
the assassinations

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:19.300
of great American heroes?

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:21.430
&gt;&gt; James L. Swanson: Well,
with Lincoln, there was,

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:23.170
I was born on Lincoln's
birthday.

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:25.520
And I studied Lincoln
since I was a boy.

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:28.950
I barely remember the
Kennedy assassination.

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:30.350
And I wanted to write
about things

00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:31.650
that happened in my lifetime.

00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:33.130
I loved writing about Lincoln,

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:35.180
but we don't know
anyone who knew Lincoln.

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:37.120
We can't talk to
someone who knew Lincoln.

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:39.850
I could talk to people who
were friends of John Kennedy.

00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:42.240
I could meet people who were
friends of Martin Luther King.

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:44.150
And I wanted to write
about things

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:45.450
that happened in my lifetime.

00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:49.410
Where I could still talk to the
people who lived through it.

00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:51.910
And I think we've run out
of time; is that right?

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:53.560
So thank you very much.

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:55.560
