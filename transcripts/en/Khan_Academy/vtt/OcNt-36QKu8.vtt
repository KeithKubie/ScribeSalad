00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.090
You are traveling in some type
of a strange fantasy land.

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.530
And you're trying
to get to the castle

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.600
up here to save the
princess or the prince

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.700
or whomever you're
trying to save.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.010
But to get there, you
have to cross this river.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.125
You can't swim across it.

00:00:14.125 --> 00:00:15.356
It's a very rough river.

00:00:15.356 --> 00:00:16.730
So you have to
cross this bridge.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.510
And so as you approach the
bridge, this troll shows up.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.540
That's the troll.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.910
And he says, well, I'm
a reasonable troll.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:24.910
You just have to pay $5.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.826
And when you look a
little bit more carefully,

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:28.960
you see that there
actually was a sign there

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.440
that says $5 toll
to cross the bridge.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.120
Now, unfortunately
for you, you do not

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.400
have any money in your pocket.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.890
And so the troll says,
well, you can't cross.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.650
But you say, I need to really,
really get to that castle.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.220
And so the troll says, well,
I'll take some pity on you.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:53.640
Instead of paying the $5,
I will give you a riddle.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.130
And the riddle is this.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.870
And now, I'm speaking
as the troll.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.150
I am a rich troll
because I get to charge

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.090
from everyone who
crosses the bridge.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.900
And actually, I only
accept $5 or $10 bills.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.800
It's a bit of a
riddle why they accept

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.800
American currency in
this fantasy land.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.060
But let's just take
that as a given for now.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.200
So I only take $5 or $10 bills.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.100
I'm being the troll.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.760
Obviously, if you give me a
$10, I'll give you $5 back.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.190
And I know, because I count
my money on a daily basis.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.280
I like to save my
money as the troll.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.270
I know that I have a
total of 900 bills.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.200
So let me write that down.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:41.090
I have a total of 900 bills, a
total of 900 $5 and $10 bills.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.869
And he says, because
I'm very sympathetic,

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.660
I'll give you another
piece of information.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.740
He says, if you were to
add up the value of all

00:01:51.740 --> 00:02:02.910
of my money, which is all in
$5 and $10 bills that I have,

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:10.000
I, speaking as the troll about
dollars bills, is $5,500.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.940
This is a rich troll.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.810
And so the riddle
is-- exactly, exactly.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.000
And if you give the wrong
answer and if you're not

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.185
able to solve it
in 10 minutes, he's

00:02:20.185 --> 00:02:21.400
just going to push
you into the river

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.990
or do something horrible to you.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:37.344
He says, exactly how many 5's
and 10's do I, the troll, have?

00:02:37.344 --> 00:02:39.510
So the first thing I'm going
to have you think about

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.595
is, is this even a
solvable problem?

00:02:41.595 --> 00:02:43.220
Because if it's not
a solvable problem,

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.970
you should probably
run as fast as you can

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.370
in the other direction.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.014
So now, I will tell you, yes,
it is a solvable problem.

00:02:50.014 --> 00:02:52.555
And let's start thinking about
it a little bit algebraically.

00:02:52.555 --> 00:02:55.440
And to do that, let's
just set some variables.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.347
And I will set the
variables to be

00:02:57.347 --> 00:02:58.930
what we're really
trying to solve for.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.050
We're trying to solve for the
number of $5 bills we have

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.320
and the number of $10
bills that we have.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.110
So let's just define
some variables.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.580
I'll say f for 5.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:20.200
Let's let f equal the number
of $5 bills that we have.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.400
And I'll use the same idea.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:30.990
Let's let t is equal to the
number $10 bills that we have.

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.775
Now, given this
information, and now

00:03:32.775 --> 00:03:34.400
I'm not sure if I'm
speaking as-- well,

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.640
let's say I'm still
speaking as the troll.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.840
I'm a very sympathetic
troll, and I'm

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.180
going to give you hints.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.400
Given this information and
setting these variables

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.670
in this way, can I represent
the clues in the riddle

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:44.580
mathematically?

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.240
So let's focus on
the first clue.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.180
Can I represent this clue that
the total of 900 $5 and $10

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.150
bills, or can I represent
that mathematically,

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.870
that I have a total of
900 $5 and $10 bills?

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.400
Well, what's going to
be our total of bills?

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.310
It's going to be the number of
5's that we have, which is f.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.530
The number of 5's
that we have is f.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.150
And then the number of
10s that we have is t.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.160
The total number of 5's
plus the total number

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.160
of 10s, that's our
total number of bills.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.959
So that's going to
be equal to 900.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.580
So this statement, this
first clue in our riddle,

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.670
can be written
mathematically like this

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.490
if we defined the
variables like that.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.790
And I just said f for 5,
because f for 5 in t for 10.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.780
Now, let's look at
the second clue.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:38.210
Can we represent this
one mathematically given

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.790
these variable definitions
that we created?

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.420
Well, let's think separately
about the value of the $5 bills

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.440
and the value of the $10 bills.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.500
What's the value of
all of the $5 bills?

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.100
Well, each $5 bill is worth $5.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.170
So it's going to be 5 times
the number of $5 bills

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.820
that we have.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.610
So if I have one $5
bill, it will be $5.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.560
If I have 100 $5 bills,
then it's going to be $500.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.180
How ever many $5 bills,
I just multiply it by 5.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.060
That's the value
of the $5 bills.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.440
Let me write that down.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:18.330
Value of the $5 bills.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.600
Now, same logic.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.030
What's the value
of the $10 bills?

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.750
Well, the value of
the $10 bills is just

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.030
going to be 10 times
however many bills

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.847
I have-- value of the $10 bills.

00:05:31.847 --> 00:05:33.930
So what's going to be the
total value of my bills?

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.100
Well, it's going to be
the value of the $5 bills

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.472
plus the value of the $10 bills?

00:05:40.472 --> 00:05:42.180
And he tells me what
that total value is.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.489
It's $5,500.

00:05:43.489 --> 00:05:45.030
So if I add these
two things, they're

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:50.700
going to add up to be $5,500.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.380
So this second statement we
can represent mathematically

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:59.720
with this second
equation right over here.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.900
And what we essentially
have right over here,

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.840
we have two equations.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.780
Each of them have two unknowns.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.680
And just using one
of these equations,

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.084
we can't really figure
out what f and t are.

00:06:10.084 --> 00:06:12.000
You can pick a bunch of
different combinations

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.450
that add up to 900 here.

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.410
You could pick a bunch of
different combinations, where

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.300
if you work out all the
math, you get $5,500.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.650
So independently,
these equations,

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.440
you don't know what f and t are.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.580
But what we will see over
the next several videos

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.060
is that if you use both of
this information, if you

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.590
say that there's
an f and a t that

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.760
has to satisfy both
of these equations,

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.420
then you can find a solution.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.040
And this is called a
system of equations.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:48.550
Let me write that down--
system of equations.
