00:00:08.331 --> 00:00:10.580
ANKUR KOTWAL: So here we are
on the Code the Road bus,

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.163
and it's a really
exciting time for us

00:00:12.163 --> 00:00:16.079
because it is the 10-year
anniversary of the Maps API.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.320
We're going to be traveling
across the country

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.990
to hear about how the Google
Maps API has helped developers

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.269
to build great apps and
build their businesses on it.

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.602
ASHLEY SMITH: The road trip
is going to be really great.

00:00:26.602 --> 00:00:28.980
We have a 1959 GM
bus that's going

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.190
to be driving from here
all the way to Disney.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.366
We have some really
cool stops, 14.

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.740
We have one with
Harley Davidson.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.031
We have one with Sesame Street.

00:00:36.031 --> 00:00:38.301
We're all really excited
to go to these places.

00:00:38.301 --> 00:00:39.634
It's a whole month long.

00:00:39.634 --> 00:00:40.550
We have fun flamingos.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.789
It's going to be a good time.

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:44.080
TRICIA DESJARDINS: We're here
at our first stop at I/O,

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.774
and the developer
feedback has been amazing.

00:00:46.774 --> 00:00:49.190
MALE SPEAKER 1: Have any of
you used the Maps APIs before?

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.590
MALE SPEAKER 2: My [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.100
MALE SPEAKER 1: Oh, fantastic.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.470
FLORIAN BERTELE: The
Code the Road bus

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.120
is like a rolling museum.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.350
It houses a couple of really
cool demos of our partners

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.032
using the Maps API and
their applications.

00:01:00.032 --> 00:01:02.156
MONICA HERMAN: One of the
great things about Google

00:01:02.156 --> 00:01:04.072
is that it connects
people all over the world.

00:01:04.072 --> 00:01:08.132
And our postcards are sort
of our retro throwback way

00:01:08.132 --> 00:01:11.120
to show how we used
to do that before.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.610
It's really been a
hit with everyone

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.606
that's come by the bus.

00:01:14.606 --> 00:01:17.096
We've been really impressed to
see how many people actually

00:01:17.096 --> 00:01:20.582
participated and sent postcards
to their families and friends.

00:01:20.582 --> 00:01:22.076
ALL: Road trip!

00:01:22.076 --> 00:01:23.590
TRICIA DESJARDINS:
Next stop, Logan.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.213
MONICA HERMAN: Whoo!
