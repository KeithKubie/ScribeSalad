00:00:00.425 --> 00:00:02.426
What I want to introduce
you to in this video

00:00:02.426 --> 00:00:06.429
is the idea of a Keynesian Cross.

00:00:06.429 --> 00:00:09.349
This is one of the tools of
analysis of Keynesian thinking

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:12.131
which is really the idea
that maybe every now and then

00:00:12.131 --> 00:00:13.933
the GDP, when it's at equilibrium,

00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:15.374
isn't at an optimal state.

00:00:15.374 --> 00:00:17.736
It's operating well below potential

00:00:17.736 --> 00:00:19.667
and the way that we might be able to get.

00:00:19.667 --> 00:00:21.736
If you are a follower
of Keynesian thinking,

00:00:21.736 --> 00:00:23.007
the way that we can get it closer to,

00:00:23.007 --> 00:00:24.869
potential closer to full employment

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.459
is by somehow affecting
aggregate demand in some way.

00:00:28.459 --> 00:00:29.262
What we'll see is,

00:00:29.262 --> 00:00:31.668
we're going to build up our
Keynesian Cross analysis

00:00:31.668 --> 00:00:34.996
based on what we understand
from the consumption function.

00:00:34.996 --> 00:00:36.834
We're going to first start thinking about

00:00:36.834 --> 00:00:38.932
planned expenditures.

00:00:38.932 --> 00:00:40.329
We're going to think about what happens

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.062
when planned expenditures
deviates from actual output,

00:00:44.062 --> 00:00:46.928
from actual expenditures, right over here.

00:00:46.928 --> 00:00:48.600
This is very similar to
what we're done before

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.401
but we're actually thinking
of it in terms of planning.

00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:52.529
Let's say we have planned expenditures,

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:54.746
expenditures planned

00:00:54.746 --> 00:00:57.535
and we could just write the components

00:00:57.535 --> 00:00:59.063
of aggregate expenditure here.

00:00:59.063 --> 00:01:01.759
Well, you're going to
have consumer spending,

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:04.196
you're going to have investment.

00:01:04.196 --> 00:01:05.600
I'm going to be careful here,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.201
I'm going to call it planned investment.

00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:10.858
This is exactly what firms
are looking to produce.

00:01:10.858 --> 00:01:12.729
The reason why I differentiate this here

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:14.928
is because, if for whatever reason,

00:01:14.928 --> 00:01:17.755
aggregate expenditure
is less than they expect

00:01:17.755 --> 00:01:20.082
then they might build up inventories

00:01:20.082 --> 00:01:22.262
and those inventories get
counted as investments.

00:01:22.262 --> 00:01:24.596
Those would be excess
inventories above and beyond

00:01:24.596 --> 00:01:25.793
the planned inventories.

00:01:25.793 --> 00:01:28.793
If actual demand is higher than expended

00:01:28.793 --> 00:01:30.834
then it might eat in to inventories

00:01:30.834 --> 00:01:32.502
and when inventories are eaten into

00:01:32.502 --> 00:01:34.498
it actually takes away
from planned investments

00:01:34.498 --> 00:01:36.004
there would actually be kind of a,

00:01:36.004 --> 00:01:38.335
you would be eating into
the total investment

00:01:38.335 --> 00:01:39.129
in that situation.

00:01:39.129 --> 00:01:40.533
That's why I'm going to differentiate

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:43.996
between planned investment
and actual investment.

00:01:43.996 --> 00:01:47.672
Then of course, you
have government spending

00:01:47.672 --> 00:01:50.392
and then finally you have net exports.

00:01:50.392 --> 00:01:54.086
For the sake of the analysis
of the Keynesian Cross,

00:01:54.086 --> 00:01:56.595
once again, this is a
super over simplification,

00:01:56.595 --> 00:02:00.382
we're going to assume that
at any given level of GDP

00:02:00.382 --> 00:02:03.382
or aggregate output that
these are all constant.

00:02:03.382 --> 00:02:05.123
That these are not really dependent

00:02:05.123 --> 00:02:07.259
on aggregate output or GDP

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.592
which is of course a
huge over simplification.

00:02:09.592 --> 00:02:11.004
If we were to plot any of these

00:02:11.004 --> 00:02:15.595
versus aggregate income

00:02:15.595 --> 00:02:18.058
we'd say that they are really a flat line.

00:02:18.058 --> 00:02:23.860
Maybe planned investment might
look something like that.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.592
Maybe government spending
would look something like that.

00:02:26.592 --> 00:02:28.831
No ways at some level that's preplanned,

00:02:28.831 --> 00:02:31.596
it's exogenous to our model.

00:02:31.596 --> 00:02:33.079
It's not dependant in any way.

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:34.525
It's an external factor.

00:02:34.525 --> 00:02:35.605
Assuming it's fixed,

00:02:35.605 --> 00:02:37.666
it's not dependent on aggregate income.

00:02:37.666 --> 00:02:40.004
So government spending
looks something like that

00:02:40.004 --> 00:02:42.797
and net exports, maybe it
looks something like that.

00:02:42.797 --> 00:02:45.690
The one factor that you can imagine

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.433
because I said we're going to build

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:47.758
on top of the consumption function

00:02:47.758 --> 00:02:51.465
that we're going to assume
is driven by aggregate income

00:02:51.465 --> 00:02:53.764
is consumption right over here.

00:02:53.764 --> 00:02:56.535
The way that this thing will look,

00:02:56.535 --> 00:02:58.401
the way that this thing will look

00:02:58.401 --> 00:02:59.518
is you have ...

00:02:59.518 --> 00:03:04.055
So let me draw another
plot right over here,

00:03:04.055 --> 00:03:05.583
draw another plot.

00:03:05.583 --> 00:03:07.920
We have aggregate income,

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.980
that is going to be our
independent variable

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:16.290
and then over here we can
just view this as expenditure.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.186
If we were just to plot consumer spending,

00:03:19.186 --> 00:03:20.389
we've seen that before

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:22.510
especially if we assume a
linear consumption function.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.762
What we've studied in the last few videos

00:03:24.762 --> 00:03:27.257
is all linear consumption functions

00:03:27.257 --> 00:03:29.193
and depending on how you write it,

00:03:29.193 --> 00:03:30.590
but they all look something like this.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.526
They have a positive
vertical axis intercept

00:03:34.526 --> 00:03:37.193
and they have upward
slope that is less than 1.

00:03:37.193 --> 00:03:39.927
Consumption by itself would
look something like this,

00:03:39.927 --> 00:03:41.459
this would be consumer spending

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.928
as a function of aggregate income.

00:03:45.928 --> 00:03:47.675
Then if you all all of
these constants to it

00:03:47.675 --> 00:03:54.529
then your graph for aggregate
planned expenditures

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:55.758
would look something like this.

00:03:55.758 --> 00:03:57.862
if you added just in net exports

00:03:57.862 --> 00:03:59.033
it would get a little bit higher

00:03:59.033 --> 00:04:00.004
because these are constant.

00:04:00.004 --> 00:04:01.284
Any point you would add this much,

00:04:01.284 --> 00:04:03.036
if you add government a
little higher than that

00:04:03.036 --> 00:04:05.037
and if you add all of them
including planned investments

00:04:05.037 --> 00:04:06.535
you might get something that looks,

00:04:06.535 --> 00:04:08.134
and I'll do it in this
color right over here,

00:04:08.134 --> 00:04:13.665
you might get something
that looks like this.

00:04:13.665 --> 00:04:16.954
I'm just starting off
with consumer spending.

00:04:16.954 --> 00:04:20.328
I'm using a linear consumption function,

00:04:20.328 --> 00:04:21.363
you don't have to,

00:04:21.363 --> 00:04:22.732
but it makes the Keynesian Cross analysis

00:04:22.732 --> 00:04:25.465
a lot more cross like
and easier to analyse.

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:28.069
If you add all what we
assumed to be constant things

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:31.613
and aggregate expenditures
is going to be up here.

00:04:31.613 --> 00:04:33.037
This right over here

00:04:33.037 --> 00:04:36.006
is aggregate planned
expenditures I should say.

00:04:36.006 --> 00:04:40.132
Now, we know from the
circular flow in the economy

00:04:40.132 --> 00:04:44.205
that when an economy is at equilibrium,

00:04:44.205 --> 00:04:48.200
your aggregate output is equal
to your aggregate expenditures

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.402
or your aggregate expenditures

00:04:49.402 --> 00:04:51.465
is equal to your aggregate income.

00:04:51.465 --> 00:04:53.871
Really, at an equilibrium,

00:04:53.871 --> 00:04:56.039
these two things are going to be equal.

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:58.203
We can actually plot a line
that shows all the points

00:04:58.203 --> 00:04:59.468
that those are equal.

00:04:59.468 --> 00:05:02.930
That would be a line that
has essentially a slope of 1

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.599
where Y is always equal to expenditures.

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:10.537
It might look something like this.

00:05:10.537 --> 00:05:13.036
This is where the name
Keynesian cross comes from

00:05:13.036 --> 00:05:14.948
because essentially you
have planned expenditures

00:05:14.948 --> 00:05:18.069
and then right over here you
have the equilibrium line

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:19.622
or what I call the equilibrium line

00:05:19.622 --> 00:05:21.931
because these are all points where income

00:05:21.931 --> 00:05:23.802
is equal to expenditure.

00:05:23.802 --> 00:05:25.676
Right over here, income
is equal to expenditure.

00:05:25.676 --> 00:05:27.121
Income is equal to expenditure.

00:05:27.121 --> 00:05:29.949
When you look at aggregate
planned expenditures

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:32.136
or you can even view
this as aggregate demand

00:05:32.136 --> 00:05:34.864
as a function of aggregate income.

00:05:34.864 --> 00:05:36.198
This is actual point

00:05:36.198 --> 00:05:39.801
where the actual economy is at equilibrium

00:05:39.801 --> 00:05:44.081
where expenditures are actually equal to,

00:05:44.081 --> 00:05:46.726
where expenditures are
actually equal to output.

00:05:46.726 --> 00:05:48.864
Actually, it's a little bit
skewed the way I drew it

00:05:48.864 --> 00:05:51.195
but these actually
should be like a square.

00:05:51.195 --> 00:05:53.083
Actually, let me see if
I can draw a little bit

00:05:53.083 --> 00:05:55.078
clearer than that.

00:05:55.078 --> 00:05:57.462
Just so it will actually
looks like a 45 degree line.

00:05:57.462 --> 00:06:02.926
It should really be a 45
degree line like that.

00:06:02.926 --> 00:06:04.866
That seems a little bit better.

00:06:04.866 --> 00:06:08.258
That's the point at which
we are at equilibrium.

00:06:08.258 --> 00:06:09.419
Actually, I don't like that

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:11.196
because it makes it a little
bit harder to analyse.

00:06:11.196 --> 00:06:12.799
But hopefully you get the idea.

00:06:12.799 --> 00:06:14.401
This should be a line
that's where expenditures

00:06:14.401 --> 00:06:16.597
is equal to aggregate income.

00:06:17.443 --> 00:06:19.733
Like this so it intersects at a point

00:06:19.733 --> 00:06:21.938
that's a little bit
easier for me to analyse.

00:06:21.938 --> 00:06:25.664
Now, this is where the Keynesian Cross

00:06:25.664 --> 00:06:27.112
becomes a kind of interesting tool

00:06:27.112 --> 00:06:28.852
because we could start to think about

00:06:28.852 --> 00:06:30.653
what happens in situations.

00:06:30.653 --> 00:06:35.487
This is an equilibrium level of GDP.

00:06:35.487 --> 00:06:37.314
What happens if for whatever reason

00:06:37.314 --> 00:06:39.587
that aggregate income

00:06:39.587 --> 00:06:41.650
is higher than that equilibrium level?

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.181
Let's think about scenario.

00:06:43.181 --> 00:06:44.919
Let's say we're over here.

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:46.522
Let me do that in magenta.

00:06:46.522 --> 00:06:48.250
Let's say we're over here.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.451
Let's call that Y1.

00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:51.586
What is going on?

00:06:51.586 --> 00:06:54.323
What is going on right over here at Y1?

00:06:54.323 --> 00:06:56.582
Over here, the aggregate output

00:06:56.582 --> 00:06:58.317
which is the same thing
as aggregate income

00:06:58.317 --> 00:06:59.983
is right over here.

00:06:59.983 --> 00:07:02.121
Well, this is the actually
planned expenditures,

00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:03.659
is right over here.

00:07:03.659 --> 00:07:06.919
All of these excess. All of these excess

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:09.711
above the planned demand,

00:07:09.711 --> 00:07:12.253
these are essentially going
to be inventories building up.

00:07:12.253 --> 00:07:15.582
The economy is producing
more than it actually needs,

00:07:15.582 --> 00:07:17.913
inventories are going to build up.

00:07:17.913 --> 00:07:20.335
Firms are not selling
all of their products

00:07:20.335 --> 00:07:22.332
and that excess built up inventory

00:07:22.332 --> 00:07:24.256
is going to be reflected in investment.

00:07:24.256 --> 00:07:27.372
In this case, this delta.

00:07:27.372 --> 00:07:29.918
This delta is going to be added
to your planned investment

00:07:29.918 --> 00:07:32.314
to get what the actual
investment might be.

00:07:32.314 --> 00:07:35.320
When an economy is at that state

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.147
then firms would say, "Oh my god!

00:07:37.147 --> 00:07:39.117
"We're building inventory
more than we expected.

00:07:39.117 --> 00:07:40.507
"We're not selling our products.

00:07:40.507 --> 00:07:41.919
"We're going to lower output

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:46.265
"so there's a natural
feedback mechanism for the GDP

00:07:46.265 --> 00:07:47.812
"to go back to equilibrium."

00:07:47.812 --> 00:07:49.234
Let's think about what happens

00:07:49.234 --> 00:07:51.384
if it's below that equilibrium point.

00:07:51.384 --> 00:07:53.920
Let's say that GDP is,

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.067
let's call that right over here.

00:07:56.067 --> 00:07:57.588
This is Y2.

00:07:57.588 --> 00:07:59.064
Actually, I could write it as a subscript.

00:07:59.064 --> 00:08:00.383
I don't know, I wrote a superscript there.

00:08:00.383 --> 00:08:03.649
We could call this Y2.

00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:08.911
Over here, aggregate demand
at this level of output

00:08:08.911 --> 00:08:11.662
is more than what's actually being output.

00:08:11.662 --> 00:08:13.265
People want more goods and services.

00:08:13.265 --> 00:08:14.526
Right over here,

00:08:14.526 --> 00:08:16.264
this is a deficit of output

00:08:16.264 --> 00:08:17.795
and so this shows that people

00:08:17.795 --> 00:08:19.597
will be digging into inventory.

00:08:19.597 --> 00:08:21.062
That the existing inventories

00:08:21.062 --> 00:08:22.928
or the existing investment was not enough.

00:08:22.928 --> 00:08:25.265
Or, I guess another way to think it,

00:08:25.265 --> 00:08:27.661
essentially, inventories
will be contracting.

00:08:27.661 --> 00:08:30.062
Let's say business was constant.

00:08:30.062 --> 00:08:33.080
I had a lemonade stand,
I just keep an inventory

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.161
of 5 cups of lemonade on hand

00:08:35.161 --> 00:08:37.126
and I sell a cup every hour.

00:08:37.126 --> 00:08:39.326
If all of a sudden people
start buying 2 cups an hour

00:08:39.326 --> 00:08:41.862
my inventory is going to
start getting depleted

00:08:41.862 --> 00:08:43.266
and so this is what's reflected.

00:08:43.266 --> 00:08:47.537
Actual output is below what's demanded.

00:08:47.537 --> 00:08:49.158
When firms start seeing

00:08:49.158 --> 00:08:50.742
that their inventories
get depleted, they say,

00:08:50.742 --> 00:08:51.478
"Oh my god!

00:08:51.478 --> 00:08:53.199
"I don't want to run out
of my goods and services.

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:55.131
"Let me start producing more."

00:08:55.131 --> 00:08:56.129
Then when we're talking about inventories

00:08:56.129 --> 00:08:57.800
we're really talking about goods.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.463
So let me produce more.

00:08:59.463 --> 00:09:01.546
So output will once again

00:09:01.546 --> 00:09:04.638
want to naturally go
to that feedback point.

00:09:04.638 --> 00:09:06.221
Hopefully that makes
a little bit of sense.

00:09:06.221 --> 00:09:08.608
In the next few videos we'll
be using the Keynesian Cross

00:09:08.608 --> 00:09:12.200
to think about the
Keynesian line of reasoning.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.220
If you change one of these,

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.220
how that might affect the
new equilibrium level of GDP.
