MATT BRITTIN: Are you
having a good day?

00:00:10.546 --> 00:00:11.379
AUDIENCE: Yes!

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:12.170
MATT BRITTIN: Yeah?

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.961
CAROLINE WEBB: Well,
why are you here then?

00:00:13.961 --> 00:00:15.860
MATT BRITTIN: A good
day-- we're going

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.720
to tell the author what
to put in the book.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.619
A good day is often one
fueled by sunshine, isn't it?

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:21.410
CAROLINE WEBB: Yes.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.240
MATT BRITTIN: So
that's a helpful thing.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.750
So I'm really delighted
to have Caroline here.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:25.930
Thank you for joining us.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.340
Caroline and I worked together
in a pointy-headed consulting

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.482
company many years ago.

00:00:30.482 --> 00:00:31.940
I've just about
recovered, I think,

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.362
but we'll find out
more in a second.

00:00:34.362 --> 00:00:36.320
Caroline's got an amazing
background, initially

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.545
as an economist
and a consultant,

00:00:37.545 --> 00:00:39.128
and then spend a lot
of time, I think,

00:00:39.128 --> 00:00:42.670
working with organizations
on performance.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.617
And we'll learn more about
what she's been doing.

00:00:46.617 --> 00:00:48.200
It's great to have
such a big turnout,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.290
and I'd really like to have
quite a lot of this session

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.860
with you asking questions about
what you see-- struggling with.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.320
There might be things that
are particular to Google--

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.570
for example, being on
a late-night video call

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.950
with California.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.450
I struggle to
maintain my energy,

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.209
and I'm sometimes cranky.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:08.175
I read an advance copy of
Caroline's book, and one

00:01:08.175 --> 00:01:10.550
of things she talk about in
there is, when you're cranky,

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:11.230
say, you know what?

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.688
I'm a bit tired, and I might
be coming across a bit cranky.

00:01:13.688 --> 00:01:14.520
Apologies.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.980
And I did that, and it turns
out that was really helpful.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:17.591
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:17.591 --> 00:01:19.090
So I'm now no longer
the grumpy guy.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.290
I'm the guy who's understandably
tired, because it's

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.440
midnight in London.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.679
So on that note, Caroline.

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:25.720
CAROLINE WEBB: Fantastic.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.370
MATT BRITTIN: Can I just
start by asking you,

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.090
what does a good day look like?

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.225
What does a good day look like?

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:33.850
CAROLINE WEBB: Well,
one of the reasons

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.992
I wrote the book
was that as you say,

00:01:35.992 --> 00:01:37.450
I used to work a
lot with companies

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.033
to help them shift their culture
in a more positive direction.

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:43.350
And I found that the best
way to actually find out

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.990
what was really going
on under the hood

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.170
was often to simply ask
three simple questions.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.720
What's a good day for you?

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.340
What does a bad day look like?

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.048
And how do you get
more of the good days?

00:01:53.048 --> 00:01:57.097
So the book is built around the
things that I heard, obviously.

00:01:57.097 --> 00:01:58.430
MATT BRITTIN: What did you hear?

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.846
CAROLINE WEBB: So
what did I hear?

00:01:59.846 --> 00:02:02.220
I heard we want to
be sure that we're

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.970
working on the right things.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.960
We want to be sure that
we are being productive

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.380
in pursuit of those priorities.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.840
We want to-- because you
get to the end of the day

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.270
and you feel like you've
tackled only the urgent, rather

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.660
than the important,
there's a sense of a gap.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.250
And you feel, over time, that
something is really missing.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.410
There's definitely something
about just knocking the ball

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.880
out of the park on the tasks.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.992
But there's lots of
different colors to that.

00:02:28.992 --> 00:02:31.429
There's the interaction, the
quality of the interaction,

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:33.220
is feeling that you're
at your best-- even,

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.721
perhaps, when you're 12 o'clock
on a video conference call.

00:02:37.721 --> 00:02:39.220
And then there's
feeling that you're

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.830
having impact with everything
that you're saying and doing.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.800
And then there's just the
kind of topping up the tank,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.300
you know?

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.160
How do you make sure that
you've got the resilience

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.570
to deal with the ups and
downs, and that you've

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.690
got the energy to leave
you, at the end of the day,

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.940
feeling like you've got a
little bit left in the tank.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.270
So these were the things that
came through again and again

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.160
and again.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.920
And it's less about saying,
oh, the job is amazing.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.515
Because of course
you want to be-- you

00:03:07.515 --> 00:03:09.330
want to be in a
great job, of course.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.590
But so many people are
in really great jobs,

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.260
and the day-to-day
existence is wearing a bit

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.970
miserable from time to time.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:19.570
Stressful.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:20.320
MATT BRITTIN: Yep.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.560
CAROLINE WEBB: Yeah, so.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.150
MATT BRITTIN: Maybe we
should ask the audience.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.510
What does a good day look like?

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.600
What kind of things make
a good day for you guys?

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.540
AUDIENCE: Progress.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.520
CAROLINE WEBB: Progress, right.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.680
MATT BRITTIN: Progress.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.270
Making progress.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.690
What else?

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:31.630
AUDIENCE: Good discussion.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:32.490
CAROLINE WEBB: Good discussion.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:33.340
AUDIENCE: Work with good people.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.840
MATT BRITTIN: Work
with good people.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.120
Anything else?

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.704
AUDIENCE: Fun.

00:03:36.704 --> 00:03:37.870
MATT BRITTIN: Have some fun.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.170
That's wasn't on your list.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.475
CAROLINE WEBB: Energy.

00:03:39.475 --> 00:03:39.780
MATT BRITTIN: Energy.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.321
CAROLINE WEBB: I
talked about energy.

00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:42.800
Yeah, I mean,
people are-- I mean,

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.530
Google is very, very fun, right?

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.930
So energy, for you,
definitely looks like fun.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.119
Energy at the pointy-headed
management consulting firm

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:51.410
maybe looks a little different.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.190
Just saying.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.773
MATT BRITTIN: So you
spent some time--

00:03:53.773 --> 00:03:56.610
and obviously, as you say in
the book, and you just said,

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.090
you're kind of asking people
those basic questions.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.840
What's a good day?

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.704
What's a bad day?

00:04:00.704 --> 00:04:02.120
How could you have
more good days?

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.200
It's usually a kind of
coaching approach, I guess.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.991
CAROLINE WEBB: Yes.

00:04:04.991 --> 00:04:06.580
MATT BRITTIN:
What, then, led you

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.784
to bringing that together with
a bunch of research and science?

00:04:09.784 --> 00:04:11.450
CAROLINE WEBB: Well,
I was an economist.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.410
And the reason I'd
gone into economics

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.599
is because I thought
it was a human science.

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:19.390
I thought it was a
rigorous way of thinking

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.720
about human potential.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.160
And over time, the human bit
of that kind of really faded.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.650
I mean, the work got
more and more technical.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.060
And so I actually
went into consulting

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.185
because I wanted to focus
on organizational change.

00:04:31.185 --> 00:04:35.570
But I never lost the interest
in an evidence-based approach,

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.320
which I guess many of in
the room would also support.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.261
And so much in the field of
human development and coaching

00:04:43.261 --> 00:04:45.510
and so on-- there's a little
bit of an arm-waving kind

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.120
of feel to it.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.375
And yet there's so
much amazing evidence

00:04:49.375 --> 00:04:51.289
that comes out of
neuroscience, psychology,

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:52.330
and behavioral economics.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.360
It often just doesn't make
the leap from the labs

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.960
into real life.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.300
And I found that I'd be talking
to a client about why they

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.310
might want to think
about how to give

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.400
their team a bit more
autonomy, and talking to them

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.160
about the psychological research
on the importance of autonomy

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.660
as a motivating
force, would do more

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.100
to shift their micromanaging
behavior than any staff survey

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.470
results.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.410
Understanding the science
and the rigor underneath it.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.550
So over time, I just
realized that there

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.880
was a huge opportunity to help
people embrace changes which

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.360
were going to make them more
effective-- and happier,

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.960
frankly.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.950
MATT BRITTIN: That might be
one of the reasons I found

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.840
the book interesting,
is as Googlers,

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.900
we're all about
understanding the facts.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:41.280
CAROLINE WEBB: Yeah.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.155
MATT BRITTIN: And I
think there is sometimes,

00:05:43.155 --> 00:05:45.730
you feel that coaching
and some of the things you

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.270
read about how to perform
well are a bit, as you said,

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.800
arm-wavy.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.230
That's a good phrase.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:51.610
But you've drawn on psychology.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.200
You've drawn on
behavioral economics.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.740
You've drawn on neurology.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.660
Can you tell us a bit more about
what they call, technically,

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.487
"the science bit"?

00:05:58.487 --> 00:05:59.320
CAROLINE WEBB: Yeah.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.550
I mean, these are
all disciplines

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.980
that basically look at
how and why we think,

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.727
feel, and behave as we do.

00:06:09.727 --> 00:06:11.560
And actually, all three
of those disciplines

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.000
have parts which
don't focus on that.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.480
So I look at the
behavioral neuroscience,

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.130
the behavioral psychology,
and the behavioral economics.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.970
I mean, the boundaries
between the three

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.810
are very, very blurry, if anyone
is in this space in this room.

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.720
I have a friend called Molly
who-- she's a neuroscientist.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.720
I mean, there's no doubt
she's a neuroscientist.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.870
But she works on topics
that are very focused

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:42.010
on areas that psychologists have
explored for years-- altruism.

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:45.310
And yet she also has worked
in behavioral economics labs.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:46.920
So she introduces
herself sometimes

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.520
as a behavioral economist.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.860
So there's this sort
of mass of people

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.250
who are just interested in
really explaining why you might

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.750
feel tired at 12:00 PM on a
video conference call, why that

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.674
might make you feel grumpy.

00:06:59.674 --> 00:07:01.590
MATT BRITTIN: I'm quite
grumpy normally, but--

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:02.240
CAROLINE WEBB: Are you?

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:02.780
MATT BRITTIN: But
even more grumpy.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:03.090
CAROLINE WEBB: No you're not.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:03.625
MATT BRITTIN: Yep, that's true.

00:07:03.625 --> 00:07:04.590
It's all a front.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:05.392
CAROLINE WEBB: No.

00:07:05.392 --> 00:07:06.100
MATT BRITTIN: OK.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.900
So let's just introduce
some of the concepts,

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.150
and I think people will be
familiar with some of them.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.770
We'll maybe go from there
to how you apply them.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.059
The two-system brain.

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:14.850
CAROLINE WEBB: Yes.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:16.340
MATT BRITTIN: What is that?

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:21.340
CAROLINE WEBB: So we have lots
of systems in the brain that

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.090
interact, lots and lots.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:24.580
And actually, a
systemic approach

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.121
to describing the
way the brain works

00:07:26.121 --> 00:07:29.215
is much more the way
that neuroscientists now

00:07:29.215 --> 00:07:30.590
talk about the
brain, rather than

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.520
a specific piece of the brain
doing one specific task.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.670
There's almost no part of
the brain where you can say,

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:39.060
this part of the
brain does this.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.060
So we take a systemic
approach these days.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.390
And two big
systems-- the names I

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:46.190
give them are deliberate
system and automatic system.

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.510
So the deliberate
system is the part

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:52.670
of the brain that's responsible
for you listening to us right

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:53.170
now.

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:54.740
So it's conscious attention.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.170
It's conscious reasoning.

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:59.320
It's self-control.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.610
It's what's stopping you
from standing up and saying,

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:03.100
I don't agree!

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.500
Or frowning when
you're actually trying

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.640
to be really positive
in a conversation.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.830
It's emotional self-regulation.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:13.270
It is also planning
and forward thinking.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:16.450
So it's all the grown-up
stuff, basically.

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:19.030
The problem is that it's
quite limited in capacity.

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:21.610
So it can only do
one thing at a time.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:22.611
It's comparatively slow.

00:08:22.611 --> 00:08:23.693
MATT BRITTIN: Can I check?

00:08:23.693 --> 00:08:25.944
So is it true that it can
only do one thing at a time?

00:08:25.944 --> 00:08:26.734
CAROLINE WEBB: Yes.

00:08:26.734 --> 00:08:29.010
MATT BRITTIN: So multitasking
is multi-failing, is it?

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:30.218
CAROLINE WEBB: Multi-failing.

00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:32.484
I wish I'd spoken to you
before I wrote the book.

00:08:32.484 --> 00:08:33.387
That's a good phrase.

00:08:33.387 --> 00:08:34.220
Yeah, multi-failing.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:35.270
MATT BRITTIN: The
second edition.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:36.103
CAROLINE WEBB: Yeah.

00:08:36.103 --> 00:08:36.955
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:40.640
So, yeah.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:41.549
So the brain.

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:45.302
So the conscious, deliberate
system can only single-task.

00:08:45.302 --> 00:08:47.260
MATT BRITTIN: And that
applies in both genders?

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.000
Just to check.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.330
CAROLINE WEBB: Yeah,
you know, that often--

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:49.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.673
That often comes up.

00:08:50.673 --> 00:08:51.360
Yes, absolutely.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:51.710
MATT BRITTIN: Yeah?

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:52.543
CAROLINE WEBB: Yeah.

00:08:52.543 --> 00:08:54.240
MATT BRITTIN:
That's good to know.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.480
CAROLINE WEBB: And-- and
there's fascinating research

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.310
that suggests the more confident
you are that you can multitask,

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:00.600
the worse you are at it.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.450
Because you've
lost-- yeah, I know.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:03.365
Because you're all
thinking, you're

00:09:03.365 --> 00:09:05.531
sitting there thinking,
yeah, but I'm the exception.

00:09:05.531 --> 00:09:06.460
I'm the exception.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:08.870
And actually, there's
some evidence out there

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:10.230
on supertaskers.

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:14.850
There are a few people
whose brains are different.

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:19.369
But I-- I never like mentioning
it, because as soon as you do,

00:09:19.369 --> 00:09:21.410
a bunch of people in an
audience like this think,

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:22.409
yeah, I'm a supertasker.

00:09:22.409 --> 00:09:24.134
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:24.134 --> 00:09:26.550
But the truth is it's a really
small proportion of people.

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.080
It's a tiny, tiny proportion.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.580
And for most of us
in this room, when

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.612
we try to do more than
one thing at once,

00:09:33.612 --> 00:09:35.820
our deliberate system is
actually switching attention

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:36.750
from one thing to another.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.624
It's doing it so fast,
you didn't realize it,

00:09:38.624 --> 00:09:42.460
but in those switches, you
lose time and mental energy.

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.740
Which is why you actually are
slower in performing a task,

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.780
and you make between two and
four times as many errors

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:50.120
when you multitask.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.760
So, yes.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:52.880
Where were we?

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.550
MATT BRITTIN: So we were talking
about the two-system brain.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:55.100
CAROLINE WEBB:
Deliberate system.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.660
MATT BRITTIN: I wanted us
to talk a bit about that,

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.368
and then what implications
it has-- yeah.

00:09:58.368 --> 00:09:59.640
So what's the other one?

00:09:59.640 --> 00:09:59.840
The reptile one?

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.465
CAROLINE WEBB: So
the automatic system.

00:10:01.465 --> 00:10:02.614
Well, it's not just that.

00:10:02.614 --> 00:10:07.104
I mean, it's the unsung
hero, because we're not

00:10:07.104 --> 00:10:07.770
conscious of it.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.430
So by definition, it's below
the level of our consciousness.

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:14.390
And it's doing so much
to lighten the load

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:15.790
on the deliberate system.

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:18.570
It's filtering out most
of what you see and hear

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.660
around you, to make sure that
your deliberate system, which

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.380
can only process
part of reality,

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:27.990
only gets to see or
hear part of reality.

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:30.990
Which means the automatic
system is editing everything

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:32.295
that you experience.

00:10:32.295 --> 00:10:33.230
MATT BRITTIN: So
this is the thing--

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:34.430
those who've seen
the video on YouTube,

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.679
where you're asked to count
the number of ball passes.

00:10:36.679 --> 00:10:37.800
Have you seen this one?

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.010
And at the end of
the video, it says,

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:39.970
so did you see the gorilla?

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:40.790
CAROLINE WEBB: Yeah.

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:41.345
MATT BRITTIN: If you
haven't done that,

00:10:41.345 --> 00:10:42.580
it's really worth doing.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:43.210
That's what's going on there--

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:43.733
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:10:43.733 --> 00:10:46.232
CAROLINE WEBB: That's what's
going on all the time, in fact.

00:10:46.232 --> 00:10:48.310
So there's another
study, which is

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:52.970
an homage to that study, which
had a bunch of radiologists

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:56.470
at Harvard go through
a stack of lung scans.

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:58.180
Sadly, genuine lung scans.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:03.420
And their job is to
spot abnormalities.

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.040
On the last of the
lung scans, there

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.150
was a picture of
a gorilla printed.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:12.622
How many of the radiologists
saw the gorilla?

00:11:12.622 --> 00:11:13.367
AUDIENCE: Zero?

00:11:13.367 --> 00:11:14.950
CAROLINE WEBB: Well,
it's not far off.

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:19.080
83% of the radiologists
did not see the gorilla,

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.945
even though eye-tracking devices
showed that they look directly

00:11:21.945 --> 00:11:25.870
at it, and even though the
gorilla was 44 times the size

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:29.280
of the average lung nodule.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.610
Why did they not
see the gorilla?

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:34.540
Because the automatic
system decides

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.540
what to filter out based
on what you've decided

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.092
is already important,
what's top-of-mind for you.

00:11:39.092 --> 00:11:40.925
So whatever you've
decided is your priority,

00:11:40.925 --> 00:11:44.770
your aim, whatever is your
attitude or your assumptions,

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:47.690
will shape what you see
and hear consciously.

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:49.120
Head explodes moment, right?

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.440
I mean, this means
that you are all

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.535
experiencing only part of
reality at any given time.

00:11:54.535 --> 00:11:56.118
MATT BRITTIN: I've
started to lose it.

00:11:56.118 --> 00:11:57.034
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:57.034 --> 00:11:57.644
So--

00:11:57.644 --> 00:11:58.810
CAROLINE WEBB: Stay focused.

00:11:58.810 --> 00:11:59.870
Stay focused.

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:01.960
MATT BRITTIN: So there's
an awful lot of science,

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:02.870
and some of it quite
recent, I think,

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:04.286
around understanding
those things.

00:12:04.286 --> 00:12:08.590
But what are the implications
of that particular body

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:10.967
of work for how we understand
how to have a good day?

00:12:10.967 --> 00:12:11.800
CAROLINE WEBB: Yeah.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:12.060
Yeah.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.430
And I suppose this
is what I try to do.

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:15.810
This research has been out
there for quite a long time.

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:18.130
But the implications are
quite practical and quite real

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:19.640
for us.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:22.781
It means that if we
take a moment before--

00:12:22.781 --> 00:12:24.780
and it really only has
to be like five seconds--

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:29.380
before we go into a meeting or
a conversation, or even a task,

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.610
and say, OK, what's
most important to me?

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:33.749
What really matters in this?

00:12:33.749 --> 00:12:35.790
Check in with your attitude
and your assumptions,

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:39.200
because you know that's
going to shape your reality.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.190
And then decide, well, what do
I really want to notice in this?

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:43.950
So imagine you go
into a conversation

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:45.920
with someone you think
is a bit of a jerk.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.795
I mean, I know that would
never happen here, right?

00:12:48.795 --> 00:12:51.170
Imagine you're going into a
conversation with someone who

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:53.211
you think is going to be
a bit grumpy, let's say.

00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:58.360
And, yeah, well.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:02.060
And you know that
going in and assuming

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.180
they're going to be
a jerk means you're

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:08.010
going to see everything that
confirms that they are a jerk.

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:11.240
If you decide to notice every
opportunity for collaboration,

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:15.730
or sign that they are
actually a human being,

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:18.252
you'll see and experience
the conversation differently.

00:13:18.252 --> 00:13:19.960
So that's what I call
setting intentions,

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.360
because you have to give
these things a label.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.380
That's the label I give it.

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:23.910
MATT BRITTIN: Now setting
intentions and that concept,

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:25.666
is it confirmation
bias, where you're

00:13:25.666 --> 00:13:27.540
expecting to see something,
and therefore you

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:28.470
pick up all the instances?

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:30.360
Just like when you hear a
word for the first time,

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.600
and it suddenly seems to be--

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.850
CAROLINE WEBB:
Everywhere, exactly.

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:33.360
Absolutely.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.040
And the umbrella term
for the fact that we only

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.145
perceive part of reality
is selective attention,

00:13:38.145 --> 00:13:40.020
for those of you who
like this sort of thing.

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:41.030
Selective attention.

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:42.738
And there are a bunch
of different biases

00:13:42.738 --> 00:13:45.150
that sit underneath it--
inattentional blindness,

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:47.359
confirmation bias,
being two of them.

00:13:47.359 --> 00:13:49.400
MATT BRITTIN: And then
another concept-- so we've

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.691
got the two-system brain and
the neurology behind that.

00:13:51.691 --> 00:13:53.910
Another system-- the
concept you talk about

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:56.405
is defending and discovering.

00:13:56.405 --> 00:13:57.259
CAROLINE WEBB: Yes.

00:13:57.259 --> 00:13:58.550
MATT BRITTIN: What is all that?

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:00.675
CAROLINE WEBB: So you know
when you're freaking out

00:14:00.675 --> 00:14:02.140
and you're not
thinking as clearly?

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:02.650
That's that.

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:04.890
I mean, that's essentially
what we're talking about.

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:08.190
So our brains-- the
automatic system,

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:09.800
apart from filtering
out reality so

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.580
that our deliberate
system doesn't

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:14.600
crash in the face of all
the information around us,

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.910
it also keeps us safe.

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:19.130
And one of the ways it does
that, it has a system which

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:21.440
responds to threats.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.200
And what happens is
that it perceives

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.220
a threatening
environment, it launches

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.770
something which
you probably know

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:29.927
of as a fight-or-flight
response.

00:14:29.927 --> 00:14:32.010
It turns out there's also
a freeze response, which

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:34.820
is where you're kind of trying
to figure out what's going on.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.670
And when you do
that, when you're

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.900
in that defensive mode, when
your brain is responding

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:44.570
to keep you safe, it's diverting
some attention, some energy,

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:49.230
from your prefrontal cortex to
this basic defensive response.

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:52.550
So the result is, as
you're faced with a threat,

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:54.540
you're actually getting
slightly dumber,

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:57.515
even when the threat is as small
as having your toes trodden

00:14:57.515 --> 00:15:00.120
on a little bit, or being
faced with a task that just

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.950
feels a bit insurmountable.

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:05.750
So if we can become a lot
more attuned to when we're

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:10.021
in defensive mode and have a
few tricks to get ourselves out

00:15:10.021 --> 00:15:11.520
of defensive mode,
we make ourselves

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:12.911
smarter when we really need to.

00:15:12.911 --> 00:15:14.910
MATT BRITTIN: So I found
this really interesting

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:16.360
in the context of work.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.860
Because you're often
in a situation,

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:20.860
in a meeting or something,
where you feel, whoa.

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:22.640
I haven't got credit
for what I've done,

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:23.990
or they don't understand.

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.300
CAROLINE WEBB: Yeah.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.290
MATT BRITTIN: And you can
see yourself going into it.

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:27.250
When you're conscious
of it, you can see

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:28.470
yourself going into that mode.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:29.690
And you're saying then,
you're getting dumber.

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:30.340
CAROLINE WEBB: Yeah.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:31.040
It's a shame, right?

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.956
Because it's often at
the moment you most need

00:15:32.956 --> 00:15:34.830
to rise to the challenge.

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:37.430
MATT BRITTIN: So what can I
do when I'm in that situation?

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:38.780
This is me, midnight.

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:39.560
CAROLINE WEBB:
Hypothetically, yeah.

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.740
MATT BRITTIN: There's 15
people at the other end.

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.100
They're all joking and
they're not paying attention

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:44.445
to what I need to get done.

00:15:44.445 --> 00:15:45.278
CAROLINE WEBB: Yeah.

00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:47.290
Well, I think there's
one thing generally

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:51.090
that you can do in meetings
and conversations, which

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:55.475
is to say-- and it's a really
super quick way of getting out

00:15:55.475 --> 00:15:56.980
of defensive mode,
is to say, what's

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:58.770
the ideal situation here?

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:01.120
And what's my first
step towards that?

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.860
So if you're feeling
underappreciated,

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:07.150
it's just having to go-to
question in your pocket.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:09.760
Like, OK, what do I really
want to have happen here?

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.875
What's the ideal situation?

00:16:11.875 --> 00:16:14.640
And what's the smallest
first step towards that?

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.340
I think that really helps.

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.860
I think another
general thing I would

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:21.010
say about getting yourself
out of defensive mode

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:24.370
is if you can sprinkle a
few rewards around yourself,

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:26.120
then that is a very
good way of engaging--

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:26.820
MATT BRITTIN: What
is that, chocolates?

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:26.980
What do you mean?

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.703
CAROLINE WEBB:
Well, do you know,

00:16:28.703 --> 00:16:32.780
it kind of-- so the reward
system does respond to food

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.160
and other very physical--

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.360
MATT BRITTIN: This is the
other end from defend.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.140
This is now into discovering.

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:38.296
CAROLINE WEBB: Right.

00:16:38.296 --> 00:16:39.630
So this is discovery mode.

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:42.430
So this is where your brain
is more focused on rewards

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:44.110
than it's focused on threats.

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:45.790
So rewards-- of course, yes.

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:48.449
I mean, chocolate
is-- it stands there.

00:16:48.449 --> 00:16:49.490
MATT BRITTIN: That works.

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:50.281
CAROLINE WEBB: Yes.

00:16:50.281 --> 00:16:53.020
But obviously in
the work context,

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.150
more profound rewards
are more powerful.

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:58.130
So thinking about
the fact that we

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:01.590
are very social animals, a sense
of connection and belonging

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:03.500
is very rewarding to us.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.329
Thinking about the fact that
we're intellectual animals,

00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:11.150
a sense of interest and
novelty is very powerful.

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:16.520
So a great question, to give
yourself one of those rewards,

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.950
is to say, what can
I learn from this?

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:23.050
When you're in that moment,
what can I learn from this?

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:26.910
It stimulates the neurochemistry
or reward by saying, OK,

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:29.440
I'm going to find something
interesting in this.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.649
And just by doing
that, you can often

00:17:31.649 --> 00:17:33.690
do enough to pull yourself
out of defensive mode.

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:34.310
MATT BRITTIN: Oh, definitely.

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:36.550
For me, anyway, being
aware when that's happening

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:37.300
is really helpful.

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:37.510
CAROLINE WEBB: Yeah.

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:39.540
MATT BRITTIN: I can say, OK, I
can see what's happening here.

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:40.331
I'm getting dumber.

00:17:40.331 --> 00:17:41.760
I need to stop.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:44.680
But then also when you're in the
position of sometimes putting

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.560
somebody, inadvertently,
in a defensive position,

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.020
you can try to pull them out
of it by offering a reward.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:50.920
I've noticed people doing this.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:51.930
There's people
here, in meetings,

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:53.290
who are really good
at saying, yeah,

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:54.600
you know, Matt made a
great point earlier,

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:55.474
and blah, blah, blah.

00:17:55.474 --> 00:17:58.040
I've no idea what point I
made, but I just feel good.

00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:58.432
CAROLINE WEBB: Absolutely.

00:17:58.432 --> 00:17:58.824
Absolutely.

00:17:58.824 --> 00:17:59.373
MATT BRITTIN: And so
I'm like, great, yeah,

00:17:59.373 --> 00:18:00.210
I'm going to agree with that.

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:02.420
CAROLINE WEBB: Another category
of rewards is absolutely--

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:03.290
MATT BRITTIN: It's
true, isn't it?

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:04.250
CAROLINE WEBB: --making
people feel good.

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:05.010
MATT BRITTIN: It works.

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:06.468
CAROLINE WEBB: It
really does work.

00:18:06.468 --> 00:18:08.780
It works because another
category of rewards

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:11.540
is sort of about
our self-respect.

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:14.940
And big things that sit
under that-- competence.

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:15.620
Autonomy.

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:18.200
Having a sense that you
know what you're doing,

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.860
and you've got space to do it.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.410
So, absolutely.

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:23.980
Showing appreciation is
one of the quickest ways

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.671
of getting someone
out of defensive mode

00:18:25.671 --> 00:18:27.170
and into what I
call discovery mode.

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:27.590
MATT BRITTIN: Yeah.

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:29.173
Anybody who's a
parent will know that.

00:18:29.173 --> 00:18:30.040
CAROLINE WEBB: Yeah, yeah.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:30.700
Well done.

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:31.200
Well done.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:31.900
MATT BRITTIN: That was great.

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:32.500
CAROLINE WEBB: That was great.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:33.999
MATT BRITTIN: Now
put your shoes on.

00:18:33.999 --> 00:18:35.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:41.215
And then the third piece-- so
we had the discover and defend,

00:18:41.215 --> 00:18:42.090
the two-system brain.

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:44.305
The third piece that
you make great play of

00:18:44.305 --> 00:18:47.219
is really the connection
between our mind and our body.

00:18:47.219 --> 00:18:49.010
And again, sort of
obvious, but you kind of

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:51.880
expect, somehow, at work
to be able to perform fine

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:55.000
regardless of sleep
and exercise and so on.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.380
Well, that's what this is about.

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:57.463
CAROLINE WEBB: Absolutely.

00:18:57.463 --> 00:19:00.800
So I think we all know
that when we're underslept,

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:01.820
we're not as smart.

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:04.600
And I think we know that
it's hard to be witty when

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.810
we're-- when we're
short of sleep.

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:12.230
We know, in some sense,
that there is a connection.

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:14.640
But we so often
treat our bodies as

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.700
if they're just kind of
nice-looking containers

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:18.330
for our brain.

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:21.050
You know, that maybe
we look after ourselves

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:24.090
purely for aesthetic reasons.

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:27.670
And actually, the evidence is
just mounting, year after year,

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:31.840
on just how-- so for
example, you're a sportsman.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:35.110
It turns out you don't
have to be a rower in order

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:37.510
to get the cognitive
benefits of exercise.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.460
20 minutes is enough.

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:42.320
20 minutes of aerobic
activity of some sort.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.750
Oh, but it turns out,
actually, even 10 minutes

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:47.630
is going to boost your
focus and attention

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:49.230
and your emotional resilience.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.210
Oh, it turns out, actually,
you can break it up

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:54.070
into even smaller chunks.

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:57.240
So the research is becoming
very, very encouraging

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.560
for people-- you
know, busy people who

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.020
find it hard to fit this
stuff into their days.

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:03.500
MATT BRITTIN: And it can be
as simple as just getting

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:04.890
up and walking
around, not having

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:06.649
meetings that last
more than 45 minutes

00:20:06.649 --> 00:20:07.940
or an hour, that kind of thing?

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.130
CAROLINE WEBB: Yes, I
love that, by the way.

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:10.950
So I have been
advocating for quite a

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:13.735
while this idea of
setting meetings

00:20:13.735 --> 00:20:16.110
that are shorter than hour or
shorter than the half-hour.

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:20.450
And I just saw recently that you
have the Speedy Meetings that's

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:21.790
now in Google Calendar.

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:22.960
I mean, hats off.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.543
MATT BRITTIN: It
books short meetings.

00:20:24.543 --> 00:20:27.131
Doesn't mean to say the meetings
end up-- it's all nudge,

00:20:27.131 --> 00:20:27.630
I think.

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:29.880
CAROLINE WEBB: Yeah, it is
a very, very helpful nudge.

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:33.670
Because what we also know about
the deliberate system is that

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:38.060
it-- it gets better
at taking decisions

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:40.040
when it's had a break.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:44.840
So the longer that it is
since you've had a break,

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:48.330
the less good the quality of
your choices and decisions are.

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:51.840
That's been shown with judges
sitting on a parole board.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.034
It's been shown with--

00:20:53.034 --> 00:20:54.450
MATT BRITTIN: So
you're better off

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:56.340
going before the judge
earlier in the day, are you?

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:57.164
CAROLINE WEBB: Definitely.

00:20:57.164 --> 00:20:57.990
MATT BRITTIN: OK.

00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:59.770
CAROLINE WEBB: I mean, just
in case that's ever relevant.

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:00.180
MATT BRITTIN: Could be useful.

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:01.170
CAROLINE WEBB: And if
you've got a big day--

00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:02.180
MATT BRITTIN: That's
certainly my job.

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:03.320
CAROLINE WEBB: If you've
got a big decision

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.696
that you need to make,
make it after a break,

00:21:05.696 --> 00:21:06.820
rather than before a break.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.276
If you need any reminding that
taking breaks is important,

00:21:13.276 --> 00:21:14.650
remember that your
brain is doing

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:16.770
a lot of encoding
and consolidation

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:19.490
in the period where it
steps away from a task.

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:21.860
Downtime is not laziness.

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:25.390
Downtime is actually like a
pit stop for a racing car.

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:27.370
MATT BRITTIN: And is
it real, the notion

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:30.160
that I get all my best
ideas when I'm in the bath,

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.370
or when I'm walking or
cycling, that kind of thing?

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:33.740
CAROLINE WEBB: No, it is real.

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:37.140
I think there's a lot of, still,
research into exactly what goes

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:40.634
on, something called the default
mode network in the brain.

00:21:40.634 --> 00:21:42.050
I said there were
lots of systems.

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:45.540
So everybody in neuroscience
it interested in the fact

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:48.200
that there is this part of the
brain that is active when we're

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.210
not apparently doing anything.

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:53.760
There's definitely
plenty of evidence

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.970
to suggest that when people
step away from a task

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:59.450
and then return to it, we
come back with fresh insight.

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:04.590
So I have a waterproof
pad in the shower-- which,

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:08.040
I know, I'm probably revealing
too much. anyway, there we are.

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.534
I have a waterproof pad in
the shower because that time--

00:22:10.534 --> 00:22:12.575
MATT BRITTIN: That's where
the ideas come to you.

00:22:12.575 --> 00:22:14.080
CAROLINE WEBB: That
liminal space, yeah.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:14.460
MATT BRITTIN: Liminal?

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:15.530
What does that mean?

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:17.190
CAROLINE WEBB: In
between things.

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:17.900
Yes.

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:19.525
MATT BRITTIN: Spaces
in between things.

00:22:19.525 --> 00:22:20.740
OK, that sounds good.

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.880
And then, so taking all
of these things together,

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.730
and all the observation of all
the kind of crazy organizations

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:27.271
that you've worked
in, you've sort of

00:22:27.271 --> 00:22:30.630
tried to draw out some
general tips, ideas, thoughts,

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:32.820
on how we can have a better day.

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:34.340
So what are the key concepts?

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:35.756
You've mentioned
some, but tell us

00:22:35.756 --> 00:22:37.860
a bit more about-- you
know, what's the toolkit?

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:40.790
CAROLINE WEBB: Well,
I always struggle

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:41.890
when people ask me that.

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:44.060
Because I did try
to make this book

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:46.340
a book that covers everything.

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:53.310
So there are so many tips and so
many pieces of advice in there.

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:56.520
I do think that this setting
intentions thing is really

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:57.450
at the foundation.

00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:02.047
Because if you can shape the way
that reality feels, you know,

00:23:02.047 --> 00:23:02.880
that's pretty great.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.320
I mean, it can change the way
that every conversation feels.

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:06.570
MATT BRITTIN: Can you
give us a sort of story

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:07.660
or an example of that?

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:08.660
Just bring that to life.

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:09.618
So what does that mean?

00:23:09.618 --> 00:23:11.570
CAROLINE WEBB: Yeah,
well, actually, this

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:14.310
might involve someone you know.

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:16.040
I don't know whether
you knew him or not.

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:19.560
So the time that this
came home to me was-- I

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.940
had a meeting-- I was
on a project I didn't

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:23.395
want to be on, basically.

00:23:23.395 --> 00:23:25.180
I don't know if any
of you have ever had

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:27.730
that situation happen to you.

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:30.850
I was on a project that I
knew was a good thing to do,

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:32.300
but I wasn't excited about it.

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:37.270
And I was working alongside
a colleague called Lucas.

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:40.090
I call him Lucas.

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:42.260
And he was gung-ho
about the project.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:44.930
And he was, if you
can picture, kind

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:49.110
of tall, wiry,
German, well-dressed.

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:50.430
Very excited.

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:53.830
And it was the first day that
we were meeting the clients.

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:58.005
And we were in this long,
dark room with low ceilings,

00:23:58.005 --> 00:23:59.672
but less pleasant
than this, obviously.

00:23:59.672 --> 00:24:01.130
And it was a video
conference room.

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:02.990
And I realized that the
clients weren't even there.

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.920
They were on-screen.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.960
It was a kick-off
meeting with the clients,

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.590
but they were actually
not even in the room.

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:10.027
I was grumpy about being there.

00:24:10.027 --> 00:24:11.860
I thought it was a
terrible, terrible set-up

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:13.440
to start the project.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:16.180
And I struggled, I have to say.

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:17.520
I thought it was a bad meeting.

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:22.152
I saw lots of people frowning,
lots of kind of disagreements.

00:24:22.152 --> 00:24:24.360
And I thought it was such
a bad meeting that I really

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.030
felt like I had to
call it out and speak

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:29.800
to Lucas about this terrible
start to the project.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:33.850
And when I did that, I had this
really strange conversation.

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:36.237
And it basically went like this.

00:24:36.237 --> 00:24:37.820
I thought that was
a terrible meeting.

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:40.199
This, this, this,
then this happened.

00:24:40.199 --> 00:24:42.240
I don't know what you're
talking about, Caroline.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.740
This, this, this,
and this happened.

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:45.040
He'd seen progress.

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.210
He'd seen smiles.

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:48.510
He even reminded me of times
that people had laughed.

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:50.620
I had no recollection of it.

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:51.400
I mean, none.

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.550
I mean, we had
different personalities,

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:56.490
so there was a little
bit of that, but no.

00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:59.700
It was-- it was a
huge eye-opener.

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:01.340
And it was actually
after that I really

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:05.820
started thinking about applying
the science, to actually--

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:07.202
what would it
actually look like,

00:25:07.202 --> 00:25:08.660
to think about
selective attention?

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:09.860
MATT BRITTIN: So the
smiles and all that,

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:11.100
that was the gorilla for you.

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:12.130
CAROLINE WEBB: That
was the gorilla.

00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:12.480
MATT BRITTIN: You were
looking for all the negative.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.150
CAROLINE WEBB: I was looking
for all the negativity.

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:16.615
I was looking for every
frown, every confirmation

00:25:16.615 --> 00:25:19.310
that I was right, that this
was a terrible idea, probably

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:22.250
a dumb project, and by the way,
could I have some more coffee?

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:24.771
You know?

00:25:24.771 --> 00:25:25.270
Yeah.

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:28.409
So that was actually a
big wake-up call for me.

00:25:28.409 --> 00:25:30.200
MATT BRITTIN: And so
given that experience,

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.741
what would you have
done differently?

00:25:31.741 --> 00:25:33.310
What do you do differently now?

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:34.460
CAROLINE WEBB: Yeah, so
what I do differently

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:36.000
is I do this little routine.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.010
I mean, I would've
said my real aim here

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:45.300
is to make a contribution to
the warmth and connection that's

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:45.907
possible here.

00:25:45.907 --> 00:25:47.490
Because I was being
put on the project

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:48.917
because I do all
the people stuff.

00:25:48.917 --> 00:25:50.500
MATT BRITTIN: They
used to have people

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.460
who only did people stuff,
because everybody else was so

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:53.720
bad with people, didn't they?

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:54.330
Remember that?

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:54.790
CAROLINE WEBB: That's right.

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:56.100
And I'm an economist, right?

00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:59.540
So I was being put on
there as the people person.

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:00.970
So, yeah.

00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:02.150
I should've refocused.

00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:04.820
I would have refocused, and I
did, in subsequent meetings.

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:08.105
My aim here is to
bring what's missing.

00:26:08.105 --> 00:26:10.730
I would have checked in-- and I
do check in-- with my attitude.

00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:12.400
If I'm really
grumpy, I check in.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.020
I say, OK, is this
going to serve me?

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:15.978
Because it is going to
shape what I experience.

00:26:15.978 --> 00:26:18.470
And I say, mmm, no.

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:19.564
Can I park it?

00:26:19.564 --> 00:26:21.480
Is there a way of
challenging any assumptions?

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:24.440
And the assumption would
have been to challenge,

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:27.030
it's a terrible way to
set up a client project

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:29.560
to have a video conference.

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:33.090
But yeah, but maybe we would
have taken a month longer

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:33.985
to meet in person.

00:26:33.985 --> 00:26:34.310
MATT BRITTIN: Yeah.

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:35.920
CAROLINE WEBB: I mean, it
seems obvious now, right?

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.050
But if you come in
with a certain mindset,

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:40.080
you perceive everything
in a certain light.

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.930
So now, every day, I mean,
before I come on stage,

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:44.520
I think, OK, what
really matters?

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:45.940
You know, where am I at?

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:47.250
What do I want to notice?

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:49.360
And the thing I
probably do most often

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:52.600
is when I'm feeling a bit
stressed, if I'm on my way

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.290
into work, I'll say, OK,
let me notice two or three

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:56.450
good things.

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:58.190
Because then once
that's top-of-mind,

00:26:58.190 --> 00:26:59.776
then I'll see more.

00:26:59.776 --> 00:27:01.900
So that's a really good
way of resetting your mood.

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:03.600
MATT BRITTIN: That's
really interesting.

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:06.340
OK, so I want to come to
you, and have any questions

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:07.050
or thoughts?

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:10.729
Or like therapy, like
any little things.

00:27:10.729 --> 00:27:12.770
I feel like I'm in therapy
now, so I'm slightly--

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:15.150
CAROLINE WEBB: You can talk
about a friend's situation,

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:15.825
if you want to.

00:27:15.825 --> 00:27:17.200
MATT BRITTIN: But
while you think

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.540
about that, another
thing that struck

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:22.170
me is this concept
you have of sort

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:24.240
of assuming the best of
people in situations.

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.240
CAROLINE WEBB: Oh, yeah.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.790
MATT BRITTIN: I talk a lot
about this with our teams.

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:28.780
It's very easy in our
organization, which

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:31.240
is multifunctional
and multifaceted,

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.450
to just go, oh, if only
those guys over there

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:37.270
could get their shit
together, then I'd be fine.

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:38.840
And why on Earth
are they doing that?

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:39.881
They must be idiots.

00:27:39.881 --> 00:27:42.380
And then you sort of have to
remind yourself-- and we remind

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:44.430
each other-- that actually,
everybody's good and smart,

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:46.340
and they're probably doing
that with good intention.

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:46.770
CAROLINE WEBB: Yeah,
well-intentioned.

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:48.610
MATT BRITTIN: The impact
on you might be different.

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:49.620
So just talk about
how to handle that.

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:50.185
CAROLINE WEBB: Yeah,
that's a good point.

00:27:50.185 --> 00:27:51.601
So there's something
in psychology

00:27:51.601 --> 00:27:53.360
called a fundamental
attribution error.

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.360
It's a great title.

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:54.580
I mean--

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:55.600
MATT BRITTIN: Fundamental--
I'm going to write that down.

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.690
Fundamental attribution error.

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:57.035
CAROLINE WEBB: Yes.

00:27:57.035 --> 00:27:58.700
It's often capitalized, as well.

00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:00.560
Fundamental Attribution Error.

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:02.540
So remember your
deliberate system

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:04.057
doesn't have much capacity.

00:28:04.057 --> 00:28:05.515
Remember that your
automatic system

00:28:05.515 --> 00:28:08.300
is trying to keep things
simple as much as possible.

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.620
One of the biggest
simplifications it makes

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:17.350
is it says, OK, if you're
not getting stuff done today,

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:21.410
it's simpler for me to assume
that you're just no good

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:25.190
than it is to say, I wonder
what might be going on with her?

00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:27.060
It takes less mental energy.

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:31.080
So the fundamental attribution
error describes the phenomenon

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:34.190
that when we aren't
firing on all cylinders,

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:36.800
we think about the situation
and the circumstances that's

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:37.532
created that.

00:28:37.532 --> 00:28:39.990
When we see someone else who's
not firing on all cylinders,

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:42.820
we say, OK, you're no good.

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:46.400
And it's simple, but it's
also easy to challenge,

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:48.260
which is just simply
to say-- the phrase I

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.100
use is, "Good person;
bad circumstances."

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.350
It's to get into the habit,
when you see someone who's

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:55.290
doing something
dysfunctional or isn't where

00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:58.670
you want them to be,
is to say, OK, good

00:28:58.670 --> 00:28:59.760
person; bad circumstances.

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.930
Which looks, in practice,
like-- what on Earth

00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:03.254
could be creating this?

00:29:03.254 --> 00:29:04.670
And you can have
some fun with it.

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:07.240
Because the story
that you make up

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.490
doesn't even have
to be true to shift

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:11.180
your behavior towards them.

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:12.670
Which is likely,
then, to not put

00:29:12.670 --> 00:29:13.980
them so much on the
defensive, which

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:15.146
will improve their behavior.

00:29:15.146 --> 00:29:17.030
You get into a nice
virtuous circle.

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:18.571
MATT BRITTIN: That
sounds intriguing.

00:29:18.571 --> 00:29:22.164
So tell me, what's a story
you make up about somebody?

00:29:22.164 --> 00:29:23.330
Without being too revealing.

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:26.247
CAROLINE WEBB: No,
I mean, if you're

00:29:26.247 --> 00:29:28.080
dealing with someone
who's really difficult,

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.475
then thinking about, I
wonder what kind of childhood

00:29:30.475 --> 00:29:31.530
they had?

00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:34.280
And having some fun
with that, you know?

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:37.670
What can possibly have
created this attention

00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:41.490
to the font size on this slide?

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:45.115
What happened to
them in school at 11?

00:29:45.115 --> 00:29:46.990
And as soon as you start
thinking about that,

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:48.620
you've got a slight
smile on your face,

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:51.450
and then you're feeling
better about-- you know,

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:54.370
you're chuckling to yourself
about some teacher throwing

00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:56.630
a pen at their
head or something.

00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:59.390
And then your demeanor shifts.

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:01.490
And then you end up
in a different place,

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:02.550
because they're less--

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:05.302
Because if you're
aggravated, you're

00:30:05.302 --> 00:30:07.010
going to put them on
the defensive, which

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:08.830
will mean that all
of the functions

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:10.640
of their deliberate
system will decline.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.362
So self-control,
thinking-- they'll

00:30:13.362 --> 00:30:15.070
become dumber and less
nice to be around.

00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:16.220
MATT BRITTIN: So by
assuming the best,

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:18.580
you can help other people
be their best, as well.

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:18.710
CAROLINE WEBB: Yeah.

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:20.232
And that does sound
a Pollyanna-ish.

00:30:20.232 --> 00:30:22.440
I mean, I have had people
say, oh, you're just trying

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.731
to say that everyone's amazing.

00:30:23.731 --> 00:30:25.084
I'm not.

00:30:25.084 --> 00:30:26.750
MATT BRITTIN: So how
do you have to have

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:29.686
these kind of situations
where somebody's showing up

00:30:29.686 --> 00:30:30.810
and-- what were you saying?

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:32.384
Good person; bad circumstances?

00:30:32.384 --> 00:30:34.300
How many times does that
happen before you go,

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:36.079
actually, bad person.

00:30:36.079 --> 00:30:37.370
Good person; bad circumstances.

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:38.410
Good person; bad circumstance.

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:39.150
Good person; bad circumstance.

00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:40.315
Oh, fundamentally, they're bad.

00:30:40.315 --> 00:30:40.720
CAROLINE WEBB: You know what?

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:40.810
Whatever.

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:41.670
Yeah.

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:44.530
So actually, there is a
section in the book for that.

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:45.820
MATT BRITTIN: Oh?

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:47.820
CAROLINE WEBB: What
I say is sometimes

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:49.920
it takes too much effort
to dig the good out.

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.550
And there does
come a point where

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:55.110
it's helpful to just
minimize your exposure.

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:59.750
And if you can't do that, then
to think systematically about,

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:02.560
how do you reduce the
sense of threat to them?

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.060
You know, what are
the ways that you

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:06.356
can make them feel more
competent, more autonomous?

00:31:06.356 --> 00:31:08.730
And you do this with people
who are senior to you, right?

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:10.320
How do you make them feel good?

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:13.210
How do you make sure that
you're being super clear

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:17.040
so that-- uncertainty is a
threat to most people's brains.

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:19.002
How do you minimize uncertainty?

00:31:19.002 --> 00:31:21.210
So there are a number of
really quite tactical things

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:22.320
you can then flip into.

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:23.950
MATT BRITTIN: If you have
somebody who you're stuck with,

00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:26.400
who you just have a sort
of fundamental underlying

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:27.190
problem with,
you're saying, like,

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:28.357
manage that as best you can.

00:31:28.357 --> 00:31:29.648
CAROLINE WEBB: Yes, absolutely.

00:31:29.648 --> 00:31:31.565
And there's lots that
we know about reducing

00:31:31.565 --> 00:31:32.590
a sense of threat.

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:34.215
And as I say, there's
basically a list,

00:31:34.215 --> 00:31:35.930
a checklist you can go down.

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:36.620
MATT BRITTIN:
That's in the book.

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:38.270
CAROLINE WEBB: It
is, apparently, yeah.

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:40.311
MATT BRITTIN: Anybody any
questions, suggestions,

00:31:40.311 --> 00:31:42.361
scenarios, or advice
that they need?

00:31:42.361 --> 00:31:43.860
If you can take the
mic, then great.

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:44.939
If not, just shout out.

00:31:44.939 --> 00:31:45.480
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:46.410
CAROLINE WEBB: Hello.

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:48.750
AUDIENCE: Based on what
you said about multitasking

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:51.280
and how we can't really do
that, what are your thoughts,

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:54.410
or do you have any data,
on people's effectiveness

00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:57.150
in meetings where
nowadays, everyone's

00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:59.040
got a laptop and a
phone, and sort of

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.020
doing multiple things
at the same time.

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:01.750
Is that working?

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:02.590
Or is it--

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:04.570
CAROLINE WEBB: No,
it really doesn't.

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:07.019
And there's a challenge,
because a lot of people,

00:32:07.019 --> 00:32:09.560
and I'm sure many of you, like
to take notes on your devices.

00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:16.530
If you-- I mean, I'm a
great fan of airplane mode.

00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:19.410
I've long been a fan
of using technology

00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:23.420
to deal-- to improve our
relationship with technology.

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:26.890
You know, I did a podcast
earlier on this week

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:28.790
where the discussion
was exactly that.

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:30.460
Is technology bad?

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:32.710
And I was like, no,
technology is neutral.

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:35.970
Every time technology
advances, like the post office,

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:41.520
and the phone, and even back
as far as the printing press,

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:43.920
people say, oh my goodness,
this is disastrous.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:46.250
It's going to ruin our
relationships and our ability

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:47.960
to concentrate.

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:49.850
But then what happens
is that we get better.

00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:53.050
We learn how to
use the technology.

00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:55.310
So I think that if
people are in meetings,

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:58.590
it is really helpful to have
them close their laptops.

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:01.050
If they do want to
take notes on a device,

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:02.230
to put it on airplane mode.

00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:08.300
I actually have a-- I use
a smartphone daycare box--

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:12.400
or smartphone creche, in
the UK-- which I invite

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.710
people to put their phones in.

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:16.340
I was running a
workshop on Tuesday

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:20.910
where I just put this box, and
I wrote "Smartphone Daycare."

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:24.630
And the people afterwards
said, we didn't put our phones

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:26.840
in the box, but it
gave us the prompt

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:28.417
to just leave them in our bags.

00:33:28.417 --> 00:33:29.500
MATT BRITTIN: Interesting.

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.400
CAROLINE WEBB: And it was
enough to just remind people

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.691
that there was a different
quality of conversation that

00:33:33.691 --> 00:33:36.325
was going to happen if we
weren't constantly distracted.

00:33:36.325 --> 00:33:37.116
MATT BRITTIN: Yeah.

00:33:37.116 --> 00:33:40.250
How much more stupid do we get
when we're trying to multitask?

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:43.680
CAROLINE WEBB: Well, between two
and four times as many errors

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:44.570
is pretty bad, right?

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:45.950
MATT BRITTIN: Two to four
times as many errors?

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:46.250
CAROLINE WEBB: Yes.

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:46.630
Yeah.

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:47.260
MATT BRITTIN: Wow.

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:48.218
OK, that's interesting.

00:33:48.218 --> 00:33:49.203
CAROLINE WEBB: Yes.

00:33:49.203 --> 00:33:50.760
AUDIENCE: So I know Caroline.

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.480
I've been at some of these
workshops she's talking about,

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.271
so I've employed a lot
of these techniques.

00:33:54.271 --> 00:33:55.962
It's good to refresh myself.

00:33:55.962 --> 00:33:57.920
I wondered if you could
talk about authenticity

00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.400
a little bit, and transparency.

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.164
Because I think we
all-- a lot of us

00:34:01.164 --> 00:34:03.080
strive to be very authentic
in our leadership.

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:06.225
And yet some of these things
can seem a little bit cerebral.

00:34:06.225 --> 00:34:08.100
And so when you're having
these interactions,

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:09.683
how do you kind of
balance out wanting

00:34:09.683 --> 00:34:11.580
to be authentic
with sort of doing

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:14.193
all this microprocessing in your
head about what's happening?

00:34:14.193 --> 00:34:15.359
MATT BRITTIN: Good question.

00:34:15.359 --> 00:34:17.230
CAROLINE WEBB: It's
a good question.

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:20.429
I think whenever we stretch
ourselves to do something new,

00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:22.469
there's something
about that that feels

00:34:22.469 --> 00:34:24.870
inauthentic-- by definition.

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:28.250
As soon as you try a new
technique, or a new way

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:31.179
of running a meeting, or a
new way of planning a project,

00:34:31.179 --> 00:34:34.110
it feels a bit--
mm-- uncomfortable.

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:37.060
And when we were
kids and we were

00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:39.980
trying to learn to
ride a bike, we pedaled

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:41.600
and we pedaled and we fell of.

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.600
We pedaled and we
pedaled and we fell off.

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.989
We kept on trying
until it worked out.

00:34:47.989 --> 00:34:50.000
In the days before
the fact that you

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.300
could get song lyrics
on the internet,

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:55.714
you used to try and
learn the song lyrics.

00:34:55.714 --> 00:34:58.130
You're way too young to know
what I'm talking about, but--

00:34:58.130 --> 00:34:59.080
MATT BRITTIN: I remember that.

00:34:59.080 --> 00:34:59.850
CAROLINE WEBB: You
remember, yeah.

00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:01.140
And you're like, you're
listening, you're listening,

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:03.100
and you're trying
to write it down.

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:07.340
The persistence we had as kids
was gorgeous and remarkable.

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:09.530
And everything we know
about neuroplasticity

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:11.620
suggests that
repetition really is

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:15.520
what strengthens neural pathways
associated with a new behavior.

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:18.410
So there's a little bit
of that moment where

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:20.070
you're trying
something new and it

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:23.560
is going to feel inauthentic,
because it's new.

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:26.890
And I suppose what I would say
is at that point, stay focused

00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:28.970
on your good intentions.

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:30.510
Don't worry if it
doesn't work out

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:33.560
the first time-- or the
second time or the third time.

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.186
Ask yourself the
rewarding question,

00:35:35.186 --> 00:35:36.810
which is, what am I
learning from this?

00:35:36.810 --> 00:35:38.640
What am I learning from this?

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:40.170
And the rewarding
question, which

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:41.945
is what's working about this?

00:35:41.945 --> 00:35:44.280
And what can I do
more of next time?

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:47.700
So I suppose I'm encouraging you
to hold that space where things

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:49.600
feel a bit inauthentic
and know that that's

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.910
part of the learning
process of any sort.

00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:52.470
MATT BRITTIN: That's fantastic.

00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:54.630
Because basically, you're
saying we're all developing,

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:56.750
and therefore you're always
going to be trying new things.

00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:57.026
CAROLINE WEBB: Yeah.

00:35:57.026 --> 00:35:58.790
And I think everyone
in this room

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:01.425
is the sort of person who
wants to learn new things.

00:36:01.425 --> 00:36:03.220
And there is that
sort of discomfort

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:05.680
when you're out of
your comfort zone.

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.954
And I believe that
the sorts of questions

00:36:07.954 --> 00:36:10.120
that you can ask yourself
about, what am I learning,

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:12.140
what worked about
that, helps you not

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:13.797
to get into your terror zone.

00:36:13.797 --> 00:36:14.880
MATT BRITTIN: Terror zone.

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:15.710
Anybody else?

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:16.960
Any other questions?

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:17.549
[INAUDIBLE]

00:36:17.549 --> 00:36:18.090
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:19.840
Thanks very much.

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:21.520
So a lot of what
you talk about is

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:22.770
what we can do as individuals.

00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:24.890
And I wondered if
you had top tips,

00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:27.990
when you were talking to either
teams or even organizations,

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:31.107
of what the top tips for
a group are, basically.

00:36:31.107 --> 00:36:31.940
CAROLINE WEBB: Yeah.

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:33.776
It's a really great question.

00:36:33.776 --> 00:36:35.150
I did write about
the individual,

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:40.170
because I do think that it's
very hard to be a great leader

00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:42.550
unless you're managing yourself
as effectively as you're

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:44.355
managing your teams
and your organizations.

00:36:46.836 --> 00:36:48.210
I quite strongly
believe that all

00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:50.670
of the techniques that
we're talking about today

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:53.630
can be used with teams.

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:55.980
It does take a
little bit of a step

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:59.530
to decide that you're going
to run a meeting, perhaps

00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:01.845
which you run every week,
in a slightly different way,

00:37:01.845 --> 00:37:03.220
and thinking, oh
everyone's going

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:05.150
to say, why are we
starting by talking

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:07.196
about what the
ideal is, and what

00:37:07.196 --> 00:37:08.320
the steps are towards that?

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.865
We just need to fix the problem.

00:37:10.865 --> 00:37:12.990
But I strongly believe that
all of these techniques

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:14.340
can be applied.

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:17.050
In fact, they become much
stronger and much more powerful

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:19.530
when they become team norms.

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:21.610
And I think you guys
are very experimental.

00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:23.230
You're willing to
try new things,

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:28.200
and you're known for being very
exploratory in figuring out

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:31.440
what can help people
be at their best.

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:34.670
So I would encourage you to
try these things in your teams,

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:38.285
to see what changes in the
quality of the discussions

00:37:38.285 --> 00:37:38.955
that you have.

00:37:38.955 --> 00:37:40.080
MATT BRITTIN: That's great.

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:43.830
Other questions or thoughts?

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:46.580
So I have a question
about productivity,

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:48.930
just as Dave's trying to make
his way to the microphone.

00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:50.884
You talk about
productivity in the book.

00:37:50.884 --> 00:37:52.300
We haven't really
touched on that.

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:53.800
How can we all be
more productive,

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:54.820
apart from not multitasking.

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:55.280
CAROLINE WEBB: Single tasking!

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:56.330
MATT BRITTIN: Single
tasking's the best thing?

00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:56.870
CAROLINE WEBB: Oh, it's--

00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:57.020
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:58.310
MATT BRITTIN: But there's
also-- you mentioned something

00:37:58.310 --> 00:38:00.381
about the sort of switching
costs between tasks,

00:38:00.381 --> 00:38:01.630
as well, which is interesting.

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:03.240
So like doing batches
rather than doing

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:04.620
individual emails,
that kind of thing.

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:05.550
CAROLINE WEBB: I think
as far as you-- yeah,

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:06.690
that's another good point.

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:09.360
So when we're talking
about single-tasking--

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:12.225
we've talked, so far, about
going offline, staying offline.

00:38:12.225 --> 00:38:13.600
But actually,
there's another way

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:15.020
that you can reduce
the switching costs.

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:16.020
You really have read the book.

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:16.330
This is wonderful.

00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:17.730
MATT BRITTIN: I really
have read the book.

00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:19.370
I don't do this when
I don't read the book.

00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:20.040
CAROLINE WEBB: I know,
but it's wonderful.

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:20.940
It feels-- yeah.

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:23.180
So the other thing
that you can do

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:25.100
to reduce the amount
of time your brain

00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:28.029
is switching from one
thing to the other--

00:38:28.029 --> 00:38:29.320
actually, let me try something.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.720
Can I try something
with the audience?

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:31.170
MATT BRITTIN: Yes.

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:31.530
Yes.

00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:32.210
They're not me.

00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:32.660
CAROLINE WEBB: Yeah, yeah.

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:33.584
That's all right.

00:38:33.584 --> 00:38:35.500
MATT BRITTIN: Don't put
me in the threat zone.

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:36.120
Put them.

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:37.965
You're in the fear
zone now, audience.

00:38:37.965 --> 00:38:38.840
Get in the fear zone.

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:41.570
CAROLINE WEBB: You don't have
to get up or do anything much,

00:38:41.570 --> 00:38:42.220
I promise.

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:46.250
So if you say 1-2-3-4-5-6-7
as quickly as you can,

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:48.771
on my mark-- and
with some energy.

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:51.170
CAROLINE WEBB: OK.

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:55.760
Then you say A-B-C-D-E-F-G,
similarly energetic.

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.632
AUDIENCE: A-B-C-D-E-F-G.

00:38:57.632 --> 00:38:58.810
CAROLINE WEBB: Fantastic.

00:38:58.810 --> 00:38:59.360
So crisp.

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:00.900
Like a cult. Wonderful.

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:03.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:03.970
OK.

00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:06.335
Now I'd like you
to mix the two up.

00:39:06.335 --> 00:39:09.710
I'd like you to say
A1, B2, C3, D4-- which

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:12.680
should take, basically,
the same amount of time.

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:13.980
OK?

00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:14.920
Go.

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:17.270
AUDIENCE: A1, B2, C3, D4--

00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:19.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:20.222 --> 00:39:22.222
CAROLINE WEBB: I love the
fact you just gave up.

00:39:22.222 --> 00:39:24.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:26.860
MATT BRITTIN: Epic fail.

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:27.620
Why?

00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:28.411
CAROLINE WEBB: Why?

00:39:28.411 --> 00:39:31.150
Because you're switching
from numbers to letters

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:32.750
to numbers to letters.

00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:34.850
And so the advice
that comes out of that

00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:38.000
is the more you can batch
similar types of tasks

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.482
together, the quicker you
will get through them.

00:39:40.482 --> 00:39:41.190
MATT BRITTIN: Oh.

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:43.924
CAROLINE WEBB: So
for me, I like to-- I

00:39:43.924 --> 00:39:45.840
like to think about
different zones in my day.

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:47.780
Doesn't always work,
because obviously,

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:48.970
you have unexpected stuff.

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:51.900
But being a late-night
person, I actually

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:55.440
find that my peak time for
creative, thoughtful work

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:56.540
is actually the afternoon.

00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:58.456
You will never see that
anywhere written down,

00:39:58.456 --> 00:40:02.840
because all of the advice is
tuned for early-morning people.

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:05.800
But I know that, and so I
do my meetings and calls

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.970
in the morning.

00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:10.540
And it doesn't always
work quite like that,

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:12.420
but that's what I aim for.

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:14.970
And then I also
have email blitzes

00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:16.345
in the morning
and the afternoon.

00:40:16.345 --> 00:40:18.520
I stay online,
except when I'm going

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:20.950
offline to do my deep thinking.

00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:23.670
But I really blitz my
email, morning and evening.

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:26.896
And that just reduces
the time it takes.

00:40:26.896 --> 00:40:27.812
MATT BRITTIN: Top tip.

00:40:30.706 --> 00:40:32.580
AUDIENCE: So much of
what you talked about is

00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:34.170
having a good day at work.

00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:36.920
Obviously the other part
of having a good life

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:39.210
is what goes on outside of work.

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:41.100
What are the key things
you've discovered

00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:45.410
which you think are transferable
to life outside of work

00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:47.814
and difficult social situations?

00:40:47.814 --> 00:40:49.480
Personally thinking
of the school gates,

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:52.216
which seems to be the most
toxic environment I've ever

00:40:52.216 --> 00:40:52.800
encountered.

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:55.740
You know, what--

00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:57.989
MATT BRITTIN: You have got
children, just to be clear.

00:40:57.989 --> 00:40:59.546
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:00.528 --> 00:41:02.365
Just to be clear.

00:41:02.365 --> 00:41:02.990
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:06.370
I wasn't browsing, no, man.

00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:09.199
What-- in the terror
zone here, by the way.

00:41:09.199 --> 00:41:10.240
CAROLINE WEBB: Excellent.

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:11.690
AUDIENCE: What could I
transfer, and particularly

00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:13.890
help my good lady wife with,
who seems to experience

00:41:13.890 --> 00:41:15.329
that more than I do?

00:41:15.329 --> 00:41:16.870
CAROLINE WEBB: It's
a great question.

00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:18.470
Actually, you know,
the book at one point

00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:20.303
was called "How to Have
a Good Day at Work."

00:41:20.303 --> 00:41:25.020
But because it became so
obvious that all of this advice

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:29.460
is just as relevant with your
families and your friends,

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:32.470
we reframed it, actually.

00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:34.970
The examples in the book are
about professional situations,

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:36.840
but "good person;
bad circumstances,"

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:41.197
incredibly helpful in
family situations, right?

00:41:41.197 --> 00:41:43.780
Someone is behaving in a certain
way, and you think, OK, well,

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:45.420
what might have
happened with them?

00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:50.350
And actually, I have to
say, lots of my clients

00:41:50.350 --> 00:41:55.540
say that they test things
out on their children

00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:58.660
before they start to use
them with their colleagues.

00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:01.860
So there was a
particular pattern

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:06.140
I started to see of men talking
about their relationships

00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:08.470
with their teenage daughters.

00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:12.030
And specifically, they
often homed in on the advice

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:14.885
about giving them autonomy.

00:42:14.885 --> 00:42:16.885
Which, of course, doesn't
look like just saying,

00:42:16.885 --> 00:42:19.930
you know, just do it
you want, darling.

00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:22.590
But asking them
questions, rather

00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:24.910
than telling them what to do.

00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:27.700
Saying, what do you think is
the right way to go about this?

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:29.180
What makes you think that?

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:31.510
What would be another approach?

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:34.390
And the fact is that
the things that we've

00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:37.030
been talking about today are
very deep and very universal.

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:39.660
So the power of
autonomy works even

00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:44.042
with a 13-year-old girl,
or a 15-year-old girl.

00:42:44.042 --> 00:42:46.220
Hard to believe, perhaps.

00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:49.552
But these things are
very translatable.

00:42:49.552 --> 00:42:50.760
MATT BRITTIN: Recognize that.

00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:53.652
Is that-- any follow-up?

00:42:53.652 --> 00:42:55.110
AUDIENCE: I'm very
happy with that.

00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:57.443
Interestingly, I often try
some of these things at home,

00:42:57.443 --> 00:43:00.680
and my wife's stock response is
now, "Don't try and Google me."

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:03.259
CAROLINE WEBB: Oh my
gosh, that's funny.

00:43:03.259 --> 00:43:04.800
AUDIENCE: But yeah,
I'll keep trying.

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:05.610
CAROLINE WEBB: You need
to find someone else.

00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:07.073
Try it on your children.

00:43:07.073 --> 00:43:08.444
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:08.444 --> 00:43:10.110
AUDIENCE: She's much
more pliable, yeah.

00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:14.275
CAROLINE WEBB: There's a client
of mine who is an Italian guy,

00:43:14.275 --> 00:43:17.880
and he has a small child.

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:18.640
Very small.

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:22.860
And his wife was concerned
that he wasn't speaking

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:25.320
as early as they were hoping.

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:31.110
And so Francesco
said, I'm going to try

00:43:31.110 --> 00:43:34.280
this approach of really
listening and then playing

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:38.340
back what the child is saying,
and then adding one or two

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:41.610
new words into what I'm saying.

00:43:41.610 --> 00:43:44.530
So using what they've said,
but then adding a few words.

00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:46.950
So giving this child
a sense of competence

00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:49.590
because you're using the same
words, and then sort of just

00:43:49.590 --> 00:43:52.510
stretching them slightly
by adding in a few more.

00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:57.550
And it did accelerate the little
one's language acquisition

00:43:57.550 --> 00:43:58.800
after that point.

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:01.220
I think these things are so
fundamental and so basic.

00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:02.181
So yes, have a go.

00:44:02.181 --> 00:44:03.180
MATT BRITTIN: Thank you.

00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:03.490
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:04.490
MATT BRITTIN: Thank you.

00:44:04.490 --> 00:44:05.760
Any other questions?

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:09.112
I want to talk a little bit
more about the mind-body energy

00:44:09.112 --> 00:44:09.820
thing, if we can.

00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:11.864
We talked a bit about
productivity earlier.

00:44:11.864 --> 00:44:14.030
Are there things that we
can notice about ourselves,

00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:15.610
or others, in that respect?

00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:17.010
And how do we keep up?

00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:19.260
You know, the energy that
we need-- particularly here,

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:20.030
I think-- is quite high.

00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:20.360
It's fast-paced.

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:22.120
There's lots of change
all the time, et cetera.

00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:23.280
How can we deal with that?

00:44:26.285 --> 00:44:28.660
CAROLINE WEBB: I do think
that-- well, I mentioned breaks

00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:30.320
earlier on.

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:32.380
I do think being
smart about planning

00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:36.700
strategic breaks is important
as you look across the day.

00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:39.300
I do think taking every
single opportunity

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:41.300
to do a tiny bit of
physical exercise--

00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:44.300
I mean, for me, honestly,
I'm not a gym type of person.

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:47.677
So walking, walking
as fast as I can,

00:44:47.677 --> 00:44:50.010
going for a walk around the
block, even going for a walk

00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:51.470
up to a different floor.

00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:52.380
MATT BRITTIN: So can
I check in on this?

00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:54.140
So there's something
about just, like,

00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:56.910
moving which helps you kind
of process things and stuff.

00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:57.240
CAROLINE WEBB: Yeah.

00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:57.946
MATT BRITTIN: Then--
but you're also

00:44:57.946 --> 00:44:59.680
sort of saying exercise,
which is a notch up,

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:00.360
it's not just that.

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:01.925
There's something about
elevating your heart rate

00:45:01.925 --> 00:45:04.140
and your breathing that's
more than just moving.

00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:04.480
CAROLINE WEBB: It can be.

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:07.360
I mean, you know, the evidence
is really encouraging in this.

00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:12.660
I read this paper where the
scientists were saying--

00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:15.320
it was actually quite sort
of colloquial language

00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:19.740
for a research paper,
saying, more exercise

00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:23.030
is better than less, but less
exercise is better than none.

00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:26.490
Just this general sense
that any activity is useful

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:27.340
and stimulating.

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:29.090
So the problem is
often when you kind

00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:30.839
of-- especially this
time of year, and you

00:45:30.839 --> 00:45:32.910
have these sort of New
Year's resolutions.

00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:34.880
The risk is, you've
set them here.

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:39.260
And when you fail,
you get this feeling

00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:41.280
of threat and disappointment.

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.320
It's the opposite of reward.

00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:45.590
And then the reason
that that's an issue

00:45:45.590 --> 00:45:47.210
is that reward is motivating.

00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:50.090
That's the way the reward
system works in the brain.

00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:51.802
So you have a small success.

00:45:51.802 --> 00:45:53.010
You feel good about yourself.

00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:55.240
You feel motivated to
try the next thing.

00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:57.610
So I would always
encourage people to set

00:45:57.610 --> 00:45:59.430
very small, manageable goals.

00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:02.410
What is it that I actually
think I can really do today?

00:46:02.410 --> 00:46:03.910
And then achieve
that, feel great,

00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:05.743
and then do a tiny bit
more, if you want to.

00:46:05.743 --> 00:46:08.550
But it's always much
better to do that,

00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:10.430
from the perspective
of neuroscience,

00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:12.280
than it is to start
big and work back.

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:14.780
MATT BRITTIN: Now, we're getting
close to being out of time.

00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:16.363
There's so much we
haven't touched on.

00:46:16.363 --> 00:46:19.180
But one other area that
we've touched on a bit,

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:20.930
and we haven't gone
into so much depth on,

00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:24.590
is the relationships that
we have around the place,

00:46:24.590 --> 00:46:27.010
and how what you talked
about, in terms of the way

00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:30.090
the brain operates and so
on, affects relationships.

00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:31.800
What are the things
that you've learned

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:35.534
and that you advise
us in that area?

00:46:35.534 --> 00:46:36.950
CAROLINE WEBB:
Well, we've touched

00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:39.160
on a lot of the things
that are relevant.

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:43.570
So your intentions will shape
the way you perceive people.

00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:47.220
The extent to which you
present a threat to them,

00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:50.300
or reward to them, will
make a big difference

00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:51.927
to their behavior.

00:46:51.927 --> 00:46:53.510
But there are other
things in the mix.

00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:56.990
There are very sort of fun
and strange things in the mix.

00:46:56.990 --> 00:47:00.590
I mean, you all know,
if we come on stage

00:47:00.590 --> 00:47:05.140
and we had been really
visibly grumpy and stressed,

00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:06.424
what would have happened?

00:47:06.424 --> 00:47:08.090
There would have been
this ripple effect

00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:10.423
where you'd all have been,
like, what-- what's happened?

00:47:10.423 --> 00:47:11.494
What's going on?

00:47:11.494 --> 00:47:13.660
Same thing if you're in a
meeting and someone grumpy

00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:14.160
comes in.

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:16.450
It just kind of settles
this cloud over the room.

00:47:16.450 --> 00:47:18.800
So research suggests that
you're absolutely right,

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:23.470
that within five minutes,
people's emotions sync up,

00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:25.930
even when you're not
working on the same thing.

00:47:25.930 --> 00:47:29.970
And even when you don't
even talk to each other.

00:47:29.970 --> 00:47:32.590
There's lots of disagreement
in the behavioral sciences

00:47:32.590 --> 00:47:33.970
about why this happens.

00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:34.680
Because--

00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:35.660
MATT BRITTIN: So it
definitely happens, facts,

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:35.916
but we don't know why.

00:47:35.916 --> 00:47:37.220
CAROLINE WEBB: But it
definitely happens.

00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:39.550
I mean, so there are some who
believe it's mirror neurons.

00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:41.010
Problem is, mirror
neurons haven't

00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:42.680
been found in human beings.

00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:44.617
The research has
been done in monkeys.

00:47:44.617 --> 00:47:45.200
There's some--

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:45.860
MATT BRITTIN: Sorry, hang on.

00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:46.859
That sounds interesting.

00:47:46.859 --> 00:47:48.610
So monkeys have got
something we haven't?

00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:50.651
CAROLINE WEBB: No, we
almost certainly have them,

00:47:50.651 --> 00:47:55.510
but the research involves
invasive explorations which

00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:56.870
have not been done in humans.

00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:57.200
MATT BRITTIN: Right.

00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:58.074
CAROLINE WEBB: Right.

00:47:58.074 --> 00:47:59.180
So--

00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:00.700
MATT BRITTIN: Is that something
about telepathy, is it?

00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:01.360
Or--

00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:01.490
CAROLINE WEBB: Yeah.

00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:04.390
I mean, you'll read a lot in
the popular press about mirror

00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:06.474
neurons, and the existence
of mirror neurons.

00:48:06.474 --> 00:48:08.140
The truth is that you
can really wind up

00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:10.360
a neuroscientist very quickly
by talking about mirror neurons.

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:10.610
MATT BRITTIN: OK.

00:48:10.610 --> 00:48:11.450
Great.

00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:13.275
CAROLINE WEBB: But
even without that--

00:48:13.275 --> 00:48:14.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:14.760
Yes.

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:17.700
Even without that, we know from
psychology, years and years

00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:19.200
of research, that
there is something

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:20.280
called theory of mind.

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:22.220
We have this ability
to empathize.

00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:25.110
We have this ability to perceive
the possibility someone else

00:48:25.110 --> 00:48:28.180
has a mind different to ours,
after the age-- well, there's

00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:31.620
a particular age, as a child,
where you start to imagine

00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:33.200
someone is different to you.

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:37.340
Some executives have never
quite got there, but yes.

00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:39.510
There's definitely
this idea that we

00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:42.240
are built social animals,
we are built to sync up

00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:43.690
with people around us.

00:48:43.690 --> 00:48:46.800
So just knowing that the way
you go in to a conversation

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:51.086
has an enormous effect
on the people around you.

00:48:51.086 --> 00:48:53.449
And there have been
times when I've

00:48:53.449 --> 00:48:54.990
been in a meeting
that's going south.

00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:57.610
And there's a point
where I think, well,

00:48:57.610 --> 00:49:00.280
I can get irritated
or worried about this,

00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:03.390
or I recognize that I can be a
little bit of a force for good

00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:06.590
at this moment, whatever the
science is underneath it,

00:49:06.590 --> 00:49:10.160
and say, OK, what do I want
to radiate into the room?

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:14.010
And just try and bring something
to mind that actually puts you

00:49:14.010 --> 00:49:14.640
in that state--

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:16.181
MATT BRITTIN: This
whole thing about,

00:49:16.181 --> 00:49:18.910
you know, if I smile, then I
become happier, that's true,

00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:19.410
isn't it?

00:49:19.410 --> 00:49:20.534
CAROLINE WEBB: Yeah, it is.

00:49:20.534 --> 00:49:22.610
I mean, again, there's
this sort of two-way flow

00:49:22.610 --> 00:49:25.030
in the central nervous
system, which is quite weird.

00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:28.160
So when we're happy,
we tend to smile.

00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:30.590
When we relax, we tend
to breathe deeply.

00:49:30.590 --> 00:49:33.470
When we're confident,
we tend to stand tall.

00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:35.970
And it seems that the
relationship goes the other way

00:49:35.970 --> 00:49:36.660
around, as well.

00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:38.780
So when we mimic the
activities associated

00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:41.990
with being happy,
relaxed, and confident,

00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:44.360
we-- again, debate
on exactly how

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:47.140
this works-- our brain
interprets that as a signal

00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:49.550
we can be happy,
confident, and relaxed.

00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:51.090
And so smiling, yes.

00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:53.730
A little bit of-- you know,
finding a reason to smile,

00:49:53.730 --> 00:49:56.244
even if it's a bit lame,
can quickly end up--

00:49:56.244 --> 00:49:58.160
MATT BRITTIN: Now I'm
very self-conscious now.

00:49:58.160 --> 00:49:59.160
CAROLINE WEBB: No, yeah.

00:49:59.160 --> 00:49:59.674
I know.

00:49:59.674 --> 00:50:00.880
Hey.

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:01.610
MATT BRITTIN: There's
some great training

00:50:01.610 --> 00:50:03.720
I think some people have done
called "Taking the Stage,"

00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:04.820
which we run it,
which is brilliant.

00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:06.390
And it's actually
partly about that.

00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:06.720
CAROLINE WEBB: Is it?

00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:07.720
MATT BRITTIN: It's
like, how do you

00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:10.135
kind of fake presence, which
then gives you the confidence

00:50:10.135 --> 00:50:10.410
to--

00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:10.820
CAROLINE WEBB: Right.

00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:12.260
Quickly becomes a
self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:12.800
MATT BRITTIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:14.090
It's really, really powerful.

00:50:14.090 --> 00:50:14.490
CAROLINE WEBB: Absolutely.

00:50:14.490 --> 00:50:15.320
MATT BRITTIN: Powerful stuff.

00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:15.500
OK.

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:16.874
Well, look, I
mean, I think we're

00:50:16.874 --> 00:50:18.340
almost completely out of time.

00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:20.620
Thank you, everybody, for
coming and joining us today.

00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:21.280
It's a great book.

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:22.050
I recommend the read.

00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:23.210
And thank you very
much, Caroline Webb.

00:50:23.210 --> 00:50:23.810
CAROLINE WEBB:
Thank you so much.

00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:24.410
Thank you.

00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:26.860
