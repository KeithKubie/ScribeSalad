that the only thing I could do would be
 

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:06.160
that the only thing I could do would be
to express my doubts and reactions and

to express my doubts and reactions and
 

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:11.020

circumstantial argument it's quite
 

00:48:34.490 --> 00:48:38.830
circumstantial argument it's quite
striking that the can

hundred people were killed it was it was
 

00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:46.480

not raised as a big man it was raised by

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:46.490
not raised as a big man it was raised by
 

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:48.190
not raised as a big man it was raised by
France which on that point was more

00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:48.200
France which on that point was more
 

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:50.770
France which on that point was more
coherent consistent than the US but it

00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:50.780
coherent consistent than the US but it
 

00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:52.900
coherent consistent than the US but it
was not raised by the US as a big as a

big issue before they were sub for 100
 

00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:57.400
big issue before they were sub for 100
people and so that weakens the case

00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:57.410
people and so that weakens the case
 

00:48:57.410 --> 00:49:00.130
people and so that weakens the case
because it confuses the issue of

00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:00.140
because it confuses the issue of
 

00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:01.960
because it confuses the issue of
chemical weapons and the issue of the

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:01.970
chemical weapons and the issue of the
 

00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:05.920
chemical weapons and the issue of the
mass killings in in Syria and if it's

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:05.930
mass killings in in Syria and if it's
 

00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:08.490
mass killings in in Syria and if it's
the issue of mass killings obviously

00:49:08.490 --> 00:49:08.500
the issue of mass killings obviously
 

00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:10.330
the issue of mass killings obviously
conventional weapons have killed many

00:49:10.330 --> 00:49:10.340
conventional weapons have killed many
 

00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:13.720
conventional weapons have killed many
more people in very horrible ways and

00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:13.730
more people in very horrible ways and
 

00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:18.720
more people in very horrible ways and
have seen it then chemical weapons have

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:18.730
have seen it then chemical weapons have
 

00:49:18.730 --> 00:49:20.590
have seen it then chemical weapons have
chemical weapons may have killed maybe

00:49:20.590 --> 00:49:20.600
chemical weapons may have killed maybe
 

00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:23.440
chemical weapons may have killed maybe
one percent compared to the other

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:23.450
one percent compared to the other
 

00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:26.140
one percent compared to the other
weapons and so that raises the question

00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:26.150
weapons and so that raises the question
 

00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:29.200
weapons and so that raises the question
of the multiplicity of motives for

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:29.210
of the multiplicity of motives for
 

00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:33.010
of the multiplicity of motives for
intervening in Syria and that

00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:33.020
intervening in Syria and that
 

00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:36.010
intervening in Syria and that
multiplicity of motives like in

00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:36.020
multiplicity of motives like in

alternative pleading weakens the case

00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:38.530
alternative pleading weakens the case
 

00:49:38.530 --> 00:49:42.340
alternative pleading weakens the case
rather than strengthen it and it brings

00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:42.350
rather than strengthen it and it brings
 

00:49:42.350 --> 00:49:45.670
rather than strengthen it and it brings
me to the second point which is will

I'm a dog am not advocating for that by

I'm a dog am not advocating for that by
 

00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:18.700
I'm a dog am not advocating for that by
the way but it's certainly not

00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:18.710
the way but it's certainly not
 

00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:21.040
the way but it's certainly not
considered so there is the idea of sort

if you're not prepared to escalate
 

00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:33.130
if you're not prepared to escalate
you're not credible and so if you send a

the conflict one has to be clear is it

the conflict one has to be clear is it
about creating a military stalemate that

about creating a military stalemate that

would tell you that war is not something
that you find you and that the reality

that you find you and that the reality
 

00:51:19.339 --> 00:51:23.890
that you find you and that the reality
is that use of force will harden the

00:51:23.890 --> 00:51:23.900
is that use of force will harden the

is that use of force will harden the
positions of the parties give hope to

00:51:27.010 --> 00:51:27.020
positions of the parties give hope to
 

00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:29.349
positions of the parties give hope to
the opposition that indeed there is a

the opposition that indeed there is a

the opposition that indeed there is a
military solution it will not

00:51:30.849 --> 00:51:30.859
military solution it will not
 

00:51:30.859 --> 00:51:36.069
military solution it will not
precipitate a negotiation it will lead

00:51:36.069 --> 00:51:36.079
precipitate a negotiation it will lead
 

00:51:36.079 --> 00:51:38.410
precipitate a negotiation it will lead
to further military support on the other

00:51:38.410 --> 00:51:38.420
to further military support on the other
 

00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:40.900
to further military support on the other
side so it will lead to a protracted

00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:40.910
side so it will lead to a protracted
 

00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:43.230

conflict not to an accelerated
negotiation now let's imagine for one

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:47.210
negotiation now let's imagine for one
 

00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:49.480
negotiation now let's imagine for one
second that there was the support for a

00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:49.490
second that there was the support for a
 

00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:52.990
second that there was the support for a
massive intervention a la Iraq and

00:51:52.990 --> 00:51:53.000
massive intervention a la Iraq and
 

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.150
massive intervention a la Iraq and
indeed it's possible to bring down Assad

00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:55.160
indeed it's possible to bring down Assad
 

00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:57.220
indeed it's possible to bring down Assad
it could be done in a matter of weeks

00:51:57.220 --> 00:51:57.230
it could be done in a matter of weeks
 

00:51:57.230 --> 00:52:00.460
it could be done in a matter of weeks
I'm sure there's no question about that

00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:00.470
I'm sure there's no question about that
 

00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:05.470
I'm sure there's no question about that
now would the result be a good result it

00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:05.480
now would the result be a good result it
 

00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:09.370

going about this well I don't know if
you want to answer this but I mean

01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:10.260
beds or many beds and now good that's
just sometimes how it is and if I agree

01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:10.270
just sometimes how it is and if I agree
 

01:16:10.270 --> 01:16:12.660

but rather Fanning the flames then then
 

01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:24.600
but rather Fanning the flames then then
that's a serious problem and in this

01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:24.610
that's a serious problem and in this
 

01:16:24.610 --> 01:16:28.920
that's a serious problem and in this
case well I mean I would I think that

01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:28.930
case well I mean I would I think that
 

01:16:28.930 --> 01:16:30.780

01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:33.500
there are other kinds of sanctions I
think that there are there should be a

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:33.510

know the only way that this is going to

01:16:51.780 --> 01:16:51.790
know the only way that this is going to
 

01:16:51.790 --> 01:16:56.310
know the only way that this is going to
be solved is it that's done and so yeah

01:16:56.310 --> 01:16:56.320
be solved is it that's done and so yeah
 

01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:58.560

ways to go forward I think if we had had
 

01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:26.000
ways to go forward I think if we had had
that discussion 18 months ago some

community of the p5 could have produced
 

01:18:34.330 --> 01:18:37.410
community of the p5 could have produced
results and I think the the rhetoric of

01:18:37.410 --> 01:18:37.420
results and I think the the rhetoric of
 

01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:39.750
results and I think the the rhetoric of
intervention and the sort of shadow

01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:39.760
intervention and the sort of shadow
 

01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:43.790

what we have it so far but also will
spill over throughout the region and

entail at some point elections there's

an electoral calendar of Syria that

01:19:59.350 --> 01:19:59.360
an electoral calendar of Syria that
 

01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:01.500
an electoral calendar of Syria that

01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:07.960
2014 and legislative election in 2016
now of course it's hard to imagine the

01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:07.970
now of course it's hard to imagine the
 

01:20:07.970 --> 01:20:10.270
now of course it's hard to imagine the
present circumstances how that would

01:20:10.270 --> 01:20:10.280
present circumstances how that would
 

01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:14.680

take place the sequence is something

01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:14.690
take place the sequence is something

take place the sequence is something
that pleases the Syrian government

01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:16.400
that pleases the Syrian government
 

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:18.220
that pleases the Syrian government
because they believe they would win the

because they believe they would win the
 

01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:20.710
because they believe they would win the

have a harder time with the digestive
election so there's a room there for

01:20:26.370 --> 01:20:26.380
election so there's a room there for
 

01:20:26.380 --> 01:20:30.100
election so there's a room there for
discussion adjustments but when you

01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:30.110
discussion adjustments but when you
 

01:20:30.110 --> 01:20:32.800
discussion adjustments but when you
think of how the Cambodian situation was

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:32.810
think of how the Cambodian situation was
 

01:20:32.810 --> 01:20:36.990

they were not easy group and

they were not easy group and
nevertheless one man in this event REE

01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:46.210
nevertheless one man in this event REE

laid the foundation for something that
 

01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:52.710
laid the foundation for something that
is far from perfect but that certainly

ended a horrible period in the history

01:20:57.310 --> 01:20:57.320
ended a horrible period in the history
 

01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:01.540
ended a horrible period in the history
of Cambodia so I think the possibility

01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:01.550
of Cambodia so I think the possibility
 

01:21:01.550 --> 01:21:04.510
of Cambodia so I think the possibility
of the City Council coming together is

01:21:04.510 --> 01:21:04.520
of the City Council coming together is
 

01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:08.350
of the City Council coming together is
not an in complete pie in the sky I

01:21:08.350 --> 01:21:08.360
not an in complete pie in the sky I
 

01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:11.110
not an in complete pie in the sky I
think it's it's a real possibility I

01:21:11.110 --> 01:21:11.120
think it's it's a real possibility I
 

01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:14.740
think it's it's a real possibility I
think if that doesn't happen probably

01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:14.750
think if that doesn't happen probably
 

01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:16.390
think if that doesn't happen probably
the alternative scenario further

01:21:16.390 --> 01:21:16.400
the alternative scenario further

the alternative scenario further

fragmentation of Syria leading to
fragmentation of the region and a

redrawing of the math of the Middle East

01:21:21.610 --> 01:21:21.620
redrawing of the math of the Middle East
 

01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:23.740
redrawing of the math of the Middle East
is the most likely and it's catastrophic

01:21:23.740 --> 01:21:23.750
is the most likely and it's catastrophic
 

01:21:23.750 --> 01:21:25.690

any time and so I think they're aware of
 

01:25:40.570 --> 01:25:44.040
any time and so I think they're aware of
that and there would be other ways to to

that and there would be other ways to to
 

01:25:44.050 --> 01:25:46.109
