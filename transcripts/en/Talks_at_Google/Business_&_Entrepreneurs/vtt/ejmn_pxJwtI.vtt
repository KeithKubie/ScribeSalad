00:00:05.928 --> 00:00:09.386
[MUSICAL SOUND EFFECT]

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.370
SPEAKER 1: Hello, and
welcome, everyone.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.080
We have a very
special guest with us

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.630
here today, all the
way from Montreal.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.290
Chances are, if you've enjoyed
the writings of Warren Buffett,

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.390
if you've heard
[INAUDIBLE] speak here,

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.990
you are very likely going
to enjoy the message

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.380
that Francois Rochon has
to share with us today.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.810
He is one of the investors
whose letters I highly admire.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.120
I love reading all of
your communications.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.610
I love the clarity
in your thoughts.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.340
And the special thing
for us, as Googlers,

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.600
is, this is one of the
most successful value

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.256
investors in the world today
who started off as an engineer.

00:01:00.256 --> 00:01:03.310
So without giving
away too much, I'd

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.132
like to welcome Francois Rochon.

00:01:07.132 --> 00:01:10.534
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:12.467 --> 00:01:14.800
FRANCOIS ROCHON: So thank you
very much for inviting me.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.680
I'm really honored to be here.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.070
And I wanted to
do a presentation,

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.650
and I call it "The
Art of Investing."

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.440
So yes, I was trained
as an engineer.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.400
I also had a very
big passion for art.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.700
So when I started
Giverny Capital--

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.500
probably, you've
guessed that Giverny

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.750
is the name of the city
where Claude Monet lived.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.770
And so you see a little
painting of Claude Monet

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.110
on the first slide.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.380
So the art of investing,
I call it the art

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.640
of going beyond the numbers.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.500
So I got the idea, really,
by reading Peter Lynch's book

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.580
"One Up on Wall Street."

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.890
And he said that
investing in stocks

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.080
is an art more than science.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.960
And you know, people
that were trained

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.340
to think very rigidly,
to quantify everything,

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.160
it's a big disadvantage when
you invest in the stock market.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.260
So we're going to
start with that.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.190
And so as an engineer,
I was trained

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.200
with a scientific education.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.790
So we're trained to
develop a rational mind.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.520
You need to understand numbers.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.960
And I think it's
a big advantage.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.330
Because there's a lot
of financial belief

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.150
that-- you know, people that
are trained in the finance

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.270
business, I think they learn
things that, I believe,

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.950
are not really scientific.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.240
And we don't need to
unlearn those things.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.960
But at the same time, a
scientific education, I think,

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.210
has some of disadvantages when
it comes to the stock market.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.920
We're trained to look at
past numbers on the belief

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.040
that the future will be similar.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.120
Humans, sometimes, they
don't behave like atoms.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.990
So you have to understand
that the financial world is

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.650
a very strange world.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.750
And when you train to
think very rigidly,

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.820
it's hard, sometimes, to
understand what's happening.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.570
And as a scientific, we're
trained not to judge,

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.920
but to gather facts.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.390
And judgment is a big part of
the stock investing process.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.230
And also, we're trained to
be very precise and right.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.100
But investing is about being
unprecise-- imprecise--

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.580
and also accepting
that you will be wrong

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.130
30%, 35%, 40% of the time.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.190
And that's a good ratio.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.760
So I wanted just to put a quote
by one of the great engineers

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.110
of all time, Nikola Tesla.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.870
And he said that
"instinct is something

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.310
that is important in science.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.170
It transcends knowledge."

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.730
And I think that's a
very interesting quote.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.540
But at the same time, there's
a big difference between art,

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.290
science, and alchemy.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.550
And you know, during
many centuries,

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.950
alchemists tried to
change lead in gold.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.430
And that's not really science.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.220
And so this idea that I have a
great feeling about that stock,

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.230
that's not really art.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.710
Neither it is investing.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.560
It's really just being lazy.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.550
So if you want to be an
artist in the investing world,

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.460
well, you want to
master that art.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.580
So you want to first choose
an art that you really love.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.620
You want to study the
masters of that art.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.270
And also, it's important
that, as master paints,

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.140
investor invests.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.130
So you want to be
active in your art.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.660
And you want, also, to
develop your own style,

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.090
have an independent mind, and
always strive for improvements.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.580
And I have this
quote by Woody Allen.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.070
And he said that "in order
to be a jazz musician,

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.690
you have to listen to jazz.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.820
And it's an act of love."

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.450
You listen to music not
because you want to learn it,

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:59.980
but because you enjoy it.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:05.380
And gradually, through kind
of a system of osmosis,

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.830
it learn into you.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.370
I think any art that
you want to learn,

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.360
you have to go to it
through an act of love.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.270
And I have this
quote by Jim Collins.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.830
And he said that "you can either
follow a paint-by-number kit

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.710
approach to life,
or you can decide

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.330
you want to create
your own masterpiece."

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:34.039
And in the investing world,
if you want to be original,

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:35.830
you have to accept
that, probably, you will

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.580
be different from the others.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.820
And you'll probably have
to be eccentric, rash,

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:43.690
unconventional.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.202
And that's a quote by
John Maynard Keynes.

00:05:46.202 --> 00:05:48.660
He wrote a book called "The
State of Long-Term Expectation"

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.590
in 1936.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.100
And it is the long-term
investor that, in practice,

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.420
will be very different
from the others,

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.300
and probably criticized
at some point.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.210
Because "it is in the
essence of his behavior

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.300
that he'll be eccentric, rash,
and unconventional in the eyes

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.260
of the average opinion."

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.810
That means that if you
want to obtain better

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.910
results in the stock
market, you have

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.350
to be able to stand on your own.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.210
And you'll be different than
the typical crowd of investors.

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.630
And that's sometimes
hard to-- it's fun

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.550
when you look at that picture.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.680
But it's sometimes
a little hard.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.230
Because you have to
be different and have,

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.890
sometimes, a very contrarian
opinion than the average

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:33.070
view on the-- either a stock
or the stock market in general.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.100
So let's look at the
results of money managers

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.470
in general in our
investing world.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:42.270
So that's the normal bell
curve of the typical results

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:43.800
as investors.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.530
And this line here
is the S&amp;P 500.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.560
And the S&amp;P 500 is
not right in middle

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:54.060
for the very simple reason
that managers charge fees.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:59.750
So from scratch, they start
from, probably, 1% or 2%

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.210
behind the S&amp;P 500.

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:05.640
So just because of that,
the S&amp;P 500 probably

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.980
beats out 85% of investors.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:13.240
So you want, always,
to think what not to do

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.140
if you want to beat the index.

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:19.250
So if you want to beat
the normal distribution,

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:20.750
what do you want not to do?

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:24.080
Well, if you think the
same way as most investors,

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.240
and you have the
same time horizon,

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.830
you'll probably end up
with the same results.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:32.000
So also, if you own
lots of companies,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.790
it's very hard to
differ from the index.

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:38.300
And I would add to that, if
you believe that you're smarter

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.760
than the others, and you can
predict the stock market,

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.490
I think it's a road to failure.

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:49.120
So what do you want to do if you
want to beat the normal curve?

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.250
Well, so far, the
last 24 years, we've

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:56.480
probably been in the
top 1% of investors.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:00.420
So let's hope it's not
pure luck and that we

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:03.090
do have an investment
approach that

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:05.020
helps out to beat the index.

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.030
So what do we do?

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.420
We try to think for ourself.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:14.280
We try to own very
few selected companies

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.250
and develop the right
behaviors, which

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:17.550
I'll go through a little later.

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:22.240
But these are rationality,
humility, and patience.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.970
So perhaps we can go to our
stock selection process.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.280
So that's the
science part of it.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.540
So we start with the financial
strength of the companies.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.090
We want companies that have
higher return on capital, that

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:35.940
have grown their earnings
per share, that also,

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:38.100
at the same time, have
a strong balance sheet.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.080
So the debt to profit
ratio, usually you

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.289
would want something like
less than four times.

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:45.830
And we want a business
model that is very solid.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:48.810
So we want companies that
are market leaders, that

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:52.290
have competitive advantage,
and low cyclicality.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:54.550
And a competitive advantage
is very important.

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:58.230
And I'll go back to that
point a little later.

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:01.590
The management
team-- so we want,

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:05.760
you know, the CEO, the CFO,
the high management team,

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.550
to own lots of shares
in the company.

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.400
So you want a high
level of ownership,

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.510
so they're really in
the same boat as we are.

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:18.720
We want managers that have good
capital allocation skills, they

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.030
make constructive
acquisitions, and you know,

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:24.930
they really think long-term
when they make investments.

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:27.210
And then we have
market valuation.

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:31.380
So we want to stock that
we'll purchase at a level

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.380
that we can double our
money over five years, which

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.020
is something like
15% annual return.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.410
So without being very precise--

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:42.020
because we know
that, probably, it's

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.610
an illusion when you
try to be too precise--

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:47.760
we try to have a view of
what we think the company can

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.080
earn in five years.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.560
And it's going to help us to
modelize what kind of valuation

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:56.584
we can expect during that time.

00:09:56.584 --> 00:09:58.680
A few words about art--

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:03.750
first, I want to say that
and beauty are, in some ways,

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:04.950
interrelated.

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:08.100
And you know, very few money
managers talk about beauty,

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.540
but I think it's important.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.460
How do you define beauty
in the investment?

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:15.810
Well, we say that beauty,
usually, to our eyes,

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:17.310
is something that is rare.

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.050
We usually find
something beautiful

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:22.830
when it's something
that we seldom see.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:27.870
And something that is
unique, we never see.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:31.650
So it's really the rarest
of all the beauties.

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:34.470
And I always-- sometimes,
when I read an annual report

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:36.420
and look at the
numbers, when I have

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:40.920
these feelings that, wow,
this is a beautiful company,

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.670
it returns high
return on capital,

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:46.640
it has much better margin than
their competitors, you know,

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.100
there's something that
lights up in my mind.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:54.270
So what you want is to find
what I call masterpieces.

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:57.390
And they have one quality,
they're rare and unique.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:00.000
So I've taken some
example in the art world--

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.780
so the "Mona Lisa," a Rothko
painting, a Vincent van Gogh

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.350
painting.

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:07.980
And if you want to take
some example of business

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.680
masterpieces, well, I've
gone through the history

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.530
of the capitalist
world, mostly in the US.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:17.010
And we can start with, probably,
one of the first technology

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:20.730
company in the 1880s
called National Cash

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:22.820
Register, that you've
probably heard about.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:25.260
Hewlett-Packard,
that, many years ago,

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:32.250
was a very innovative company,
Apple, IKEA, T.J.Maxx, Geico,

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:36.130
the insurance company owned by
Berkshire, "Washington Post,"

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:39.420
H&amp;R Block, Dun &amp;
Bradstreet, Gilette,

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:42.210
McDonald's, Starbucks, I
think all these companies--

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:43.890
and we could
certainly add Google

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:46.860
to that lot-- these are
business masterpieces.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.680
So you want to study
those kind of businesses

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.830
and see, what do they
have that was so unique.

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.725
And usually, the uniqueness,
in either their product,

00:11:55.725 --> 00:11:57.830
or their service,
or the culture,

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:00.290
is the equivalent of
having a moat that

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:03.600
protects your castle,
your enconomic castle,

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.610
from invaders, which
are competitors.

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:08.190
So that's the key thing.

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:11.900
You want to own a moat with
lots of crocodiles and piranhas

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:18.240
in it so competitors don't
want to come near your castle.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:23.490
So if we could resume kind of
what we look for in a company,

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:25.860
it's really three things--

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:29.520
the competitive advantages,
which we could say

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:33.690
is the artistic part of that,
the financial strength, which

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:36.700
is really the science part,
and the management team.

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.220
And this is where
judgment comes into play.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:42.090
It's very important to be
able to judge management.

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:44.730
And you know, that's kind
of a subjective thing when

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:46.800
you're talking about judgment.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.540
But you know, I always say--

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:51.750
I have this phrase that,
when you meet management,

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:56.450
you ask yourself, would I like
this man to marry my daughter.

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:59.190
And if their answer
is yes, it's probably

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:01.880
a good man to be partner with.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:05.630
So we end up with something
like 125 stocks that

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:07.130
fits our criterias.

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:09.950
And the one that we do
buy for the portfolio

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:12.080
are the ones that
fit our criterias

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.260
in terms of market valuation--
if we can buy at a price,

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.780
today, that we hope
we can earn something

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:21.220
like 14% going forward, yearly.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:25.590
So perhaps, just
take a few examples

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:27.120
to illustrate our approach.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:30.810
Well, one company I think is
very unique is Walt Disney.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.640
They have great brand name.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.105
They own the Star
Wars franchise.

00:13:35.105 --> 00:13:38.880
They own, of course, all those
historical stars like Mickey

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.620
Mouse and Winnie the Pooh.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.240
And they bought Marvel
a few years back.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.070
And you know, I always
say that Mickey Mouse

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:48.690
has three great qualities.

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:53.410
First, he is highly popular
and known all around the world.

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:55.260
Second, he is immortal.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.360
And the third, he has no agent.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.760
So you really own your star.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:03.690
And that's a great
thing for Disney.

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:06.060
And the uniqueness of
business model of Disney

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:12.590
is that they have these big
movie blockbusters, like

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:14.830
"Alice in Wonderland" in 1951.

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:18.460
And then, 50 years later,
they can redo a new version

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.010
and make money again
with the same name.

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:23.710
And they did that recently
with "The Jungle Book."

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:26.740
They released the first
animated version 1967,

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:29.270
and they did a real
live version last year,

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:30.910
which was also a big success.

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:33.430
So it's kind like
opening an oil field

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.020
where you take all the oil.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:36.940
And 50 years later, you
go back to the field,

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:40.170
and there's even more
new oil to take out.

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:42.740
And you don't need to
spend money on capital

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:46.270
and pay people to
guard you field.

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:49.860
It's really an extraordinary
business model.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:54.110
We bought that stock probably
11, 12 years ago, I think,

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:55.070
in 2005.

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:57.110
We paid about $24.

00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:00.830
And it was the day that
Bob Iger was named CEO.

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:02.660
And we've owned it since then.

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.900
So there was a period when
the stock did not do much.

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:09.420
As you can see, for four years,
the stock didn't do very well.

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:11.300
But earnings kept growing.

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:12.380
And we were patient.

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:16.010
And if you look over the 12
years we've owned the stock,

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:18.950
earnings have grown
about 13% annually.

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:21.560
And in the end, the stock
has more than quadrupled.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:29.400
So if you're patient, and
companies grew their value,

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.230
eventually the
stock will follow.

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.630
I want to take another
example of a stock that's been

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:36.030
a while in portfolio, CarMax.

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:38.470
It's been, 10 years,
in the portfolio.

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:43.610
And as you can see, earnings per
share have grown at about 16%

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:46.830
annually since we
bought it in 2007.

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:50.350
And the stock has
done very similar,

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:53.500
even though the P/E ratio is
a little lower today than when

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:54.840
we first bought it.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:57.450
We first bought it
in the summer 2007.

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:02.370
At that time, the P/E
ratio was about 24 times.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:05.340
We bought more shares
in 2011 at 14 times,

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:08.160
and more shares in 2016,
again, at 14 times.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.230
And today the stock is
above 18 times earnings.

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:13.980
So even though the
P/E ratio has been

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:17.220
reduced a bit over the years,
the stock has done pretty well.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:21.780
It's done about 13% annually
even though earnings

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.060
grew about 16% annually.

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:27.710
And that's about 5%
better than the S&amp;P 500.

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:29.645
Dividend included,
it has down about 8%

00:16:29.645 --> 00:16:31.680
annually over the last decade.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.680
So it's been a good investment.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.310
I want to say a few words
about a competitive advantage.

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:42.450
As investors at Giverny, what
kind of competitive advantage

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:43.230
can we have?

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:48.930
Well, first, I think it's three
things, patience, humility,

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:51.830
and rationality.

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:56.470
Humility-- I think we
do believe that it's

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:59.230
impossible to predict
macroeconomic events.

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:02.220
So we don't try to predict them.

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:06.280
Also, one key
element is to focus

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.859
on your circle of
competence and to know where

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:11.410
the limit of that circle is.

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:14.230
And thirdly, we want to
recognize our mistakes

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:17.890
when we do them and always try
to improve our stock selection

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:19.790
process.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:22.240
A few words on the
timing of purchases--

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:26.000
Woody Allen said that 80%
of success is showing up.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.550
And so that's one
of the main reasons

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:30.890
we always want to be
invested in the stock market.

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:34.120
Because we believe that
owning great companies,

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.840
not trying to predict
the stock market,

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:39.350
is the key thing
to be able to beat

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:41.150
the index over the long run.

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:44.270
And by always striving
for improvement,

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:47.420
we try to study our
mistakes in details.

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:49.910
So each year, on
an annual letter,

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:53.750
we have this yearly metals that
we give to our best mistakes.

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:57.110
And it's a very popular
part of our annual letter.

00:17:57.110 --> 00:18:00.830
I don't know why, because
it's very painful.

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:03.320
But I think that's
very important

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:06.410
if you want to continue
to improve yourself.

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:08.290
A few words on rationality--

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:10.220
we try not to be
affected when others

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.170
make more money
than us in stocks,

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:14.660
because there's always fads.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:16.400
And you know, we
don't get into fads.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:20.390
So sometimes we'll be
different from what's

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:23.520
going on in the very popular
part of the stock market.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.420
But you know, we try to
be rational and say, well,

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:27.830
if we don't really
understand it,

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:33.200
if we don't think that's a good
area where our capital should

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.000
be invested, we just
stay away from it.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.340
And we try to be impervious
to the stock market

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:39.780
quotation in the short run.

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:41.780
So it takes a lot
of rationality,

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.610
because the stock market
can be very, very volatile.

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:51.110
So we try to always be
calm and try to always

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:54.870
have the eye on the long-term
horizons of the company we

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:56.030
purchase.

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:58.640
And we accept that we
don't know the future.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:03.320
And we try to focus
on part of the process

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.820
that we can control.

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:08.120
It's really, like I said, to
look for companies that we

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.100
understand, that we
believe, that have

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:12.050
a competitive advantage.

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:14.990
And you know, we accept that you
don't know exactly how things

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:16.370
will work out.

00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:19.910
But you know, if you own great
companies with great managers,

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:22.860
eventually you should be OK.

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:26.910
And that comes up to something
we put out a few years back.

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:29.100
I call it the rule of three.

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:32.460
It's really to accept that, one
year out of three, the stock

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:35.280
markets will decline
about 10% or more.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.300
One stock purchase out of three
will not perform as expected.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:42.490
And one year out of three,
you'll underperform the index.

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:45.300
And the best managers
usually underperform

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:46.660
one year out of three.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:50.850
So it's still a very ambitious
rule, a group of rules.

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:54.870
But if you accept that
from the start, when you'll

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:57.570
have some bad years on
some bad investments,

00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:59.670
you'll be better
prepared psychologically

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:02.580
to deal with that.

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.940
And a few words on
patience-- well,

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:07.840
I have this saying that
"patience is not the ability

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:11.650
to wait, but the ability to keep
a good attitude while waiting."

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:14.710
So what's the good attitude
in the investment world?

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:17.794
It's really to focus on what's
happening in the company,

00:20:17.794 --> 00:20:19.210
not what's happening
to the stock.

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:22.100
And that's sometimes
a hard thing to do.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.730
But if you go back to
the example of CarMax,

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:26.560
CarMax stock, over
the last decade,

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:27.560
has been quite volatile.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.490
It went down 25% a few times.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:33.880
But if you look at the
earnings over those 10 years,

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.870
it's been a pretty
stable business.

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:37.810
So if you just focus
on what's happened

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.780
to CarMax over
the last 10 years,

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:44.650
I think, besides 2009,
earnings went up every year.

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:48.340
And it grew earnings by
more than 16% annually.

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:52.120
So just focus on that, and
forget about the stock price

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:55.770
movements, you'll be OK.

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:58.780
But I want to say another
word about patience.

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.180
That's not the same
thing as being stubborn.

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:05.440
And sometimes we fail to
recognize mistakes we make.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:09.250
So I like to think
about the analogy of,

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:12.550
how do you get a
frog to be cooked.

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:16.570
If you put it in boiling water,
it will jump out of the bowl.

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:20.050
So what you do, you
put it on mild water

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:22.100
and slowly increase
the temperature.

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:23.830
And you know, the
frog won't get out.

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:25.780
Because you always
think, well, things

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:29.960
are getting a little hotter, but
they'll cool down eventually.

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:33.190
And you know, it never cools
down and eventually get cooked.

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:36.280
So what you want is
not to buy a stock

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:39.440
and, you know, earnings
are a little disappointing,

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.240
the fundamentals start to
deteriorate, the stock go down.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.050
But you don't want
to sell at a loss.

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:49.510
So when investment
doesn't work very well,

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:53.170
I try to focus on what's
happening to the company

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:57.580
to be sure that I'm not
getting cooked like a frog.

00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:59.700
And that's really important.

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:02.380
And there's a big
difference in knowing

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:06.880
when to keep your shares because
the fundamentals warrant it,

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.950
and recognize you
made a mistake,

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:11.260
and just get out of that stock.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.200
And that's a big
difference between being

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.660
patient and stubborn.

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:21.380
So to summarize
what differentiates

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:26.120
an artistic investor, I would
say the conventional investor,

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:28.370
the typical investor
in the stock market,

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:31.070
either professional
or amateur, it's

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:33.890
really the focus
on market quotes.

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:35.862
They are short-term oriented.

00:22:35.862 --> 00:22:37.320
They have an opinion
on everything,

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:40.280
and they try to predict
when to buy stocks.

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:43.640
And they cannot
resist the latest fad.

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.580
So I would say the
unconventional investor,

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:49.630
while he focuses
on intrinsic value,

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:52.010
he has a long-term horizon.

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:55.340
He's agnostic about many,
many things, including

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:58.860
where the stock market will be
in a few weeks or a few months.

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:02.510
And at the same time, he doesn't
try to predict when to buy,

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:05.210
but the focuses
more on what to buy.

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:09.410
And I would say the right
verb is what to own.

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:13.620
And of course, he resists the
fans and the popular beliefs.

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:16.370
And it's easy to write
in a presentation,

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:18.230
but it's harder
on the day-to-day

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:21.150
to resist what's
been very popular.

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:24.320
So that takes a lot of
independence of thought,

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.010
I believe.

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:30.570
So a wise investor must be able
to kind of balance many things.

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:33.210
So I talked about
the love for the art.

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:36.060
But at the same time, you
want to be very rational.

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:38.680
You don't want to fall
in love with stocks.

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.220
You want us always be rational.

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:44.860
You want to have a very
large field of knowledge

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:47.470
and look at many,
many companies.

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:49.500
But at the same time,
you want to focus

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:51.510
on your circle of competence.

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:53.137
You want to be open-minded.

00:23:53.137 --> 00:23:54.720
But at the same time,
you have to have

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.350
independence of thoughts.

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:59.560
You want to be able
to value the business.

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.850
But at the same, time, like
I said in this presentation,

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:05.090
you want to be able to
go beyond the numbers.

00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:06.390
So it's just not numbers.

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:08.970
If it was just
numbers, mathematicians

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:10.750
would all the billionaires.

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:14.170
So of course, it takes
a little more than that.

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:15.390
You have to have patience.

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:18.600
But at the same time, you don't
want to get cooked like a frog.

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.729
And finally, you
want discipline,

00:24:20.729 --> 00:24:22.520
but you want to be able
to break the rules.

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.260
So I always say
that the discipline

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:28.050
is to follow your
own rules, but wisdom

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:29.850
is to know when to
break your own rules.

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:33.000
So sometimes we've bought
some stock that didn't really

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.830
fit our criterias.

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:37.770
But you know, we made a
judgment call that we believe,

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:39.870
most of the time,
either the business

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:42.420
has, really, something
special or the management

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:46.410
has, really, something
special, or ideally, both.

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:49.264
So finally, to summarize
in one sentence,

00:24:49.264 --> 00:24:51.055
"To obtain better
results than the others,"

00:24:51.055 --> 00:24:53.220
I would quote John Templeton.

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:55.260
He said that "you have
to do something different

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:56.770
from the others."

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:59.350
And at Giverny Capital,
what do we do differently?

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:01.840
Well, first, we
think independently.

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.470
We own very few
selected companies.

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:06.750
We have a very
long-term horizon.

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:10.890
I mean, I think, on average,
we own our stocks seven years.

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:14.200
And the typical investor on
Wall Street's at seven months.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:18.990
So that's kind of
a 12-to-1 ratio.

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:22.230
And also, we try to develop
the right behaviors.

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:26.600
We want to be rational,
humble, and patient.

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.185
So that concludes
the presentation.

00:25:29.185 --> 00:25:30.060
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:30.810
Thank you so much.

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:31.945
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:31.945 --> 00:25:32.662
Fantastic.

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:38.470
So folks, I want to read
something for you guys.

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:40.990
I think you might
find this interesting.

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:45.520
So "Good businessmen or
businesswomen are like artists.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:48.130
They have to do something
with passion, something

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:50.680
innovative and
unique that will last

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:54.460
and that will inspire others.

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:57.550
In the final process,
I try to figure out

00:25:57.550 --> 00:26:01.570
how much this marvelous
company should be worth and try

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:06.160
to buy it in the market at half
of what I believe it should

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:10.360
trade in five years if
everything goes as planned,

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:14.070
which is about 15% a year."

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:18.440
So these two paragraphs
are from an interview

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:23.870
of Francois in the year 2005.

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:26.420
And I'm sure it's
kind of obvious

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:30.050
how consistent your philosophy
has been over the years.

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:31.100
It's remarkable.

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:36.500
It's sort of, the
Francois Rochon of 2005

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.140
would have probably given
the same talk in very similar

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:41.370
words, as I can tell.

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:43.610
So what I want to
ask you is, has it

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:47.450
been easy for you to follow
this approach consistently?

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:50.360
Has it been tested
over the years?

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:53.780
Have there have been times where
you've questioned how you've

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:56.164
thought about these things?

00:26:56.164 --> 00:26:57.830
FRANCOIS ROCHON: Yeah,
it's been tested.

00:26:57.830 --> 00:27:01.700
Because like I said, we have
to accept that we underperform

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:02.960
one year out of the three.

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:06.730
And you know, in the good
years, it's easy to say.

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:10.240
But when those bad years
happen, it's really painful.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:14.000
And you know, when you
have some partners--

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.670
well, the word you
use for clients--

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:20.390
you have to explain to them,
well, why you have a bad year.

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:22.050
And it sometimes can be tough.

00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:24.500
And it can last
more than one year.

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:26.280
It can be two or
three years in a row.

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:31.630
So that's-- I think it takes
a lot of conviction that

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:34.150
you're on the right path, and
you're doing what you think is

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:36.140
best for, you know,
your partners.

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:42.210
And I think, if the
principles are sound,

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:45.220
eventually they will work out.

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:48.340
So again, the
importance of patience--

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:51.260
I think that's probably the most
important quality you need when

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:53.190
you invest in the stock market.

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:55.980
SPEAKER 1: So to people who
are listening to this talk--

00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:58.100
there might be young
graduate students, people

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:00.420
who are getting into the
investing profession,

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:05.391
or a lot of individual investors
like ourselves who are saying,

00:28:05.391 --> 00:28:06.390
this is a good approach.

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:07.650
Maybe I want to try it.

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:10.830
And you know, they could
have a couple of bad years

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:11.710
to start off with.

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:13.940
And what is your advice there?

00:28:16.804 --> 00:28:18.220
FRANCOIS ROCHON:
I think there's--

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:21.180
patience, also, it's
important, of course.

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:24.590
But I think there's a
quality behind patience,

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:26.790
and it's humility.

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:29.445
You have to accept that
you'll make some mistakes.

00:28:29.445 --> 00:28:32.080
And there's always things
that you can learn.

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:35.610
And I would say that the
greatest quality of Warren

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:37.700
Buffett is not
necessarily intelligence,

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:38.640
it's the humility.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.950
I mean, he's the greatest
investor of all time.

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:42.630
He's the greatest of all.

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:45.390
But he's still
very humble, always

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:47.410
looking to improve and learn.

00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:49.530
And I think that's
his greatest quality.

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:56.660
He's 87 years old, and he's
still striving for new learning

00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:57.330
everyday.

00:28:57.330 --> 00:28:59.520
You always want to
learn new things

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:00.910
and understand new things.

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:05.910
And if you have
those qualities, I

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:08.622
think you'll succeed in
almost anything you do.

00:29:08.622 --> 00:29:10.080
SPEAKER 1: That's
very interesting,

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.930
because he has been quoted
to have said, in interviews,

00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:16.254
that if you have an IQ of
160, you might be better off

00:29:16.254 --> 00:29:17.420
giving 10 points to someone.

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:19.930
FRANCOIS ROCHON: Well, I
think he said selling, selling

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:20.690
some points.

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:22.570
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, selling, sure.

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:24.120
Thank you.

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.380
Yeah.

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:27.840
So you do believe that
it's more than the IQ.

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:29.700
It's the behavioral
traits, after a point,

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:30.450
that are critical.

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:31.366
FRANCOIS ROCHON: Yeah.

00:29:31.366 --> 00:29:33.150
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:37.500
So any advice to individual
investors, young investors

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.500
who might not be professional
investors like yourself?

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.650
What are some best practices
that one can adopt?

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:50.400
FRANCOIS ROCHON: I think, first,
you have to look for a company

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:51.600
that you can understand.

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.790
Because there's many,
many companies out there.

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:55.590
There's, you know,
thousands and thousands.

00:29:55.590 --> 00:30:00.210
And it's hard to really
understand all those companies.

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:03.040
And some are just
very, very complicated.

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.460
So you're trying
to play a hard game

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:09.510
when you want to be able
to value every company.

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:12.600
You play an easier game
when you're very selective,

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:15.950
and you just go for the company
that you can understand.

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:20.010
And it goes back to the
analogy of Ted Williams,

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:22.350
that he wanted to wait
for the perfect pitch that

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:25.050
was in the sweet spot zone.

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:28.470
And I think that's the beautiful
thing about the stock market.

00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:30.680
And Warren Buffett said
that many, many years ago,

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:33.630
that investing is the
greatest business of all,

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:36.570
because that's the
one you can choose

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:38.220
the ball you want to hit.

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:41.400
So you have the luxury
of standing at the plate.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.470
And you know, we're waiting
for the perfect ball.

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:45.100
There's no called strike.

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:47.250
And that's, I think,
the most beautiful thing

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:48.480
in the investment business.

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:52.470
But at the same time, it's
a very competitive investing

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:53.560
world.

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:55.460
So there are some
disadvantages too.

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:59.880
But if you have the right
behavior, the right approach,

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:06.360
and you're very patient and very
selective, I think, in the end,

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.342
you'll succeed.

00:31:07.342 --> 00:31:08.580
SPEAKER 1: Great.

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:11.160
So in your presentation,
Francois, you said,

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:13.080
you know, there's an
element of beauty.

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.850
Sometimes you recognize it.

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:17.610
And you also say that there
is science and mathematics

00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:18.990
of investing.

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:22.800
And I was wondering if you could
take one company as an example.

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:27.710
One of the logos on your
slides was, I think, Starbucks.

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:28.627
FRANCOIS ROCHON: Yeah.

00:31:28.627 --> 00:31:30.751
SPEAKER 1: And I'm sure,
like a lot of people here,

00:31:30.751 --> 00:31:32.090
I recognize the company.

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:35.660
So can you describe what you
see in terms of the qualitative,

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:37.230
the beauty-like aspects?

00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:38.930
And you know, like
you said, what

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:41.254
are the earnings potentials
five years from now?

00:31:41.254 --> 00:31:42.170
FRANCOIS ROCHON: Yeah.

00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:45.450
Well, Starbucks,
I looked at it--

00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:48.540
I think the first
time was in 1994.

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:51.500
And I thought that
was a unique business.

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:57.260
And I remember coming to the US
in the early '90s and drinking

00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:58.150
coffee in hotels.

00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:00.940
And it was, you
know, bad coffee.

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:05.254
And I said, well, if you go
in Italy, you are in France,

00:32:05.254 --> 00:32:06.170
you have great coffee.

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:08.520
But you come to the greatest
country in the world,

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:10.345
and you drink bad coffee.

00:32:10.345 --> 00:32:12.020
I said, this didn't make sense.

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:14.840
And when I first tried
Starbucks, I said,

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:19.240
well, these people are on to
something, and they'll do well.

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:25.250
And I remember, I mean, Howard
Schultz was a very ambitious

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:28.730
and a very driven CEO.

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:31.640
And he was very confident
that it could be--

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:34.430
Starbucks could have
thousands, and thousands,

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:38.445
and thousands of coffee
stands everywhere

00:32:38.445 --> 00:32:40.030
in US and in the world.

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:45.570
And I thought it
was indeed possible.

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:46.430
And the only thing--

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:48.440
SPEAKER 1: Is their coffee
better than Tim Hortons?

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.940
FRANCOIS ROCHON:
Oh yes, I think so.

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:52.690
But you know, I want
to be patriotic here

00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:55.010
and say Tim Hortons is
a great company also,

00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:56.020
because it's Canadian.

00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:59.300
But you know, if I
had to have coffee,

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:00.860
I would go with Starbucks.

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:02.930
And you know, the
only thing that

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:05.690
prevented me to
invest 23 years ago

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:07.400
was that P/E ratio of Starbucks.

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:10.220
And I remember it was
trading at 40 times earnings.

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:12.740
And you know, that was
way too high for me.

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:14.780
But I don't know, I
didn't look lately,

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:15.890
because it's too painful.

00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:18.326
But the stock is probably
100-fold since then.

00:33:18.326 --> 00:33:21.460
So it's been a wonderful
company here, a wonderful stock.

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:23.094
And never owned it.

00:33:23.094 --> 00:33:24.760
SPEAKER 1: So what
P/E ratio-- you know,

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:26.140
40 is maybe too expensive.

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:28.067
But what might be
a P/E ratio where

00:33:28.067 --> 00:33:30.582
it would merit your attention?

00:33:30.582 --> 00:33:32.290
FRANCOIS ROCHON: Well,
with some insight,

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:36.010
I would say that 40 times
earnings in '94 was cheap.

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:39.600
Because you know, it didn't at
all discount the future growth

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:40.690
to come.

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:42.700
But you want a big
margin of safety.

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:46.750
And I think it was in
1949 that Ben Graham said

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:50.440
that the cornerstone of
intelligent investing

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:52.460
is a margin of safety.

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:55.720
So if you pay a
very P/E ratio, you

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:59.280
don't have as much safety as
if you pay a lower P/E ratio.

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:01.720
But is it 20?

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:02.810
Is it 25?

00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:04.580
Is it 15?

00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:07.982
That's where judgment comes
into play to help you decide.

00:34:07.982 --> 00:34:08.690
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:10.106
I think I'm trying
to sort of make

00:34:10.106 --> 00:34:14.590
it more practical for people
who are listening, just to--

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:19.219
I think, today, it's like
23, 24 times P/E ratio.

00:34:19.219 --> 00:34:23.670
And would that sort of a
metric bring it-- you know,

00:34:23.670 --> 00:34:25.580
you said you had 125.

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:28.650
Would it come up in those for
you to look at, for example?

00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:31.100
FRANCOIS ROCHON: Well, I
think the management is great.

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:33.230
I think the business
model is great.

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:36.830
Just have to ask yourself,
where it is today,

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:40.699
will they be able to continue
to grow at a superior growth

00:34:40.699 --> 00:34:44.699
rate going forward, which
I would define 12% or more.

00:34:44.699 --> 00:34:48.020
I mean, every company,
even the greatest companies

00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:50.060
in the whole history,
they come to a point

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:52.590
where they hit maturity,
and it's harder

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:55.730
to grow at a high growth rate.

00:34:55.730 --> 00:35:00.830
So I mean, growing earnings
at 8%, or 9%, or 10%,

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:02.350
that's still quite
an achievement.

00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:10.040
But it's not as exciting of
growing at 15% or more a year.

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:12.561
So it's going to be, probably,
harder for Starbucks,

00:35:12.561 --> 00:35:14.310
but I've been saying
that for a few years.

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:16.010
I've been wrong so far.

00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:18.530
SPEAKER 1: So maybe let's just
take a step back, Francois.

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:20.750
For the audience here,
what are some areas

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:24.350
in the market where you do see
both the elements of beauty

00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:26.300
and that of value today?

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:29.270
FRANCOIS ROCHON: Well, I think
we took the example of CarMax.

00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:32.150
And I think that's a
company that, I believe,

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:36.750
can grow by about 15%
annually for many, many years.

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:38.092
SPEAKER 1: Revenues or earnings?

00:35:38.092 --> 00:35:39.800
FRANCOIS ROCHON: Well,
probably earnings.

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:41.970
Revenue is going to
be closer to 10%.

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:47.090
But with some margin expansion
and some buyback of shares,

00:35:47.090 --> 00:35:50.760
I think they can obtain that 15%
growth in earnings per share.

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:53.070
And it trades at
18 times earnings.

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:56.090
So the P/E ratio is
similar than the market.

00:35:56.090 --> 00:36:00.375
But I think their growth profile
is probably twice as good.

00:36:00.375 --> 00:36:02.180
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:05.090
I have a couple of
questions just, typically,

00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:07.940
we ask all of our guests.

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:11.030
What are some of your favorite
managers or businesspeople

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.764
that you look at?

00:36:11.764 --> 00:36:13.430
And then the second
part of the question

00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:15.300
is, what are some
books, you know,

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:17.900
investing and non-investing,
that you've enjoyed that you

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:19.340
might want to share with us?

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:22.940
FRANCOIS ROCHON:
Well, managers--

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:26.040
well, I have a deep
respect for Mark Leonard

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.800
at Constellation Software.

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.630
I think he's really--

00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:30.700
he's an artist.

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:33.090
I mean, he's really unique.

00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:36.190
He's really original.

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:39.605
And he has a very, very
long-term horizon on everything

00:36:39.605 --> 00:36:40.662
he does.

00:36:40.662 --> 00:36:43.690
And I think Constellation
Software, which, you know,

00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:48.350
is a Canadian
company is, I think--

00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:50.270
I hope it continues to be.

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:52.850
But if you looked at it today,
it's really a masterpiece.

00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:56.700
It's really something quite
unique, and a great culture,

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:58.577
and great artists at the helm.

00:36:58.577 --> 00:37:00.410
SPEAKER 1: It's interesting
you bring it up,

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:02.480
because it's a
technology company.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:05.330
Typically, value
investors, they've

00:37:05.330 --> 00:37:08.780
had this rough interaction
with being in technology

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:10.490
versus not being there.

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:12.830
And also, it's one of
those companies that

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:16.580
has grown by acquisitions,
which, again, value investors

00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:17.600
tend to shy away from.

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:19.160
So how do you look
at those two aspects?

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:19.970
FRANCOIS ROCHON:
Well, I would say

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:21.500
there's many ways to get rich.

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:24.440
So some, it's Starbucks.

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:27.090
It's just having one
concept, and they clone it

00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:28.370
a thousand times.

00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:31.970
And other companies-- I mean,
Berkshire Hathaway, that's

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:35.150
an example of a company
that grew by acquisition.

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:37.760
It's a holding
company that now have,

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.860
we could say,
hundreds of divisions.

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:43.830
So there's many ways
to-- and I mean,

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:46.610
McDonald's, for many years,
had just like Starbucks,

00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:50.630
one concept that they
had to clone many times.

00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:55.130
So I think that, in the
end, what really counts is--

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:57.470
over, let's say, a
decade, it's the growth

00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:59.830
in earnings per share.

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:03.600
So if you have a
great business model,

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:07.900
if you have great management,
a great of return on capital,

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:13.800
it will translate into earnings
per share growth, which

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.710
will translate into a
stock that will go up.

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:21.020
So if you pay a reasonable
price, and the earnings

00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:23.000
per share quadruple
over a decade,

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.567
there's a good chance that
the stock will do the same.

00:38:25.567 --> 00:38:27.650
SPEAKER 1: How do you apply
the earnings per share

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:30.290
concept to a company like--
you know, Berkshire, you

00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:33.530
mentioned-- but even Markel,
for example, an insurance

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:36.950
company where you may
not realize the earnings,

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:40.310
because you know, they're just
piling up on the balance sheet?

00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:41.636
FRANCOIS ROCHON: Yeah.

00:38:41.636 --> 00:38:44.210
Well, in terms of for
Berkshire or Markel,

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:47.960
probably a price to
book is a better--

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:49.430
it's not perfect,
but it's probably

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:50.620
a better-- way to value.

00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:53.360
And you use a ratio.

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:58.940
I think, for both companies,
1.5 or 1.6 times book value

00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:00.170
would make sense.

00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:03.270
Because that's the
nature of their business,

00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:05.450
that the earnings
are more erratic.

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:08.675
So you have to value
them some other way.

00:39:08.675 --> 00:39:12.162
So you have to adapt to the
business model of the business.

00:39:12.162 --> 00:39:14.120
SPEAKER 1: Francois, we
had one of our guests--

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.162
they brought up a very
interesting concept.

00:39:16.162 --> 00:39:18.620
They said, you know, you look
at all these great companies,

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:21.830
and you recognize
that there is a moat.

00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:24.320
And you know, over the
past 10 or 15 years,

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:26.540
they've displayed
that in their numbers.

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:28.970
And then you sit back
and ask yourself,

00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:32.770
the future may not necessarily
be identical to the past.

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:36.710
So they said what really matters
is that the moat be growing.

00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:39.780
It doesn't matter whether
it's small or big.

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:42.500
So how do you
think about growing

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:46.900
moats, or emergent moats,
versus established moats?

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:49.960
FRANCOIS ROCHON: That's very
hard, because moats always

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:50.880
keep changing.

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:56.230
And I remember, a few
years back, Charlie Munger

00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:57.640
said that--

00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:01.360
I asked a question to
Charlie about moats

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:04.450
and all those great
companies that seem

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:07.690
to see their moat shrinking.

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:10.570
And he said, well, I
know all those moats are

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:12.540
getting filled with sand.

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:16.920
And so I asked
him, which company

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:19.290
do you think has
an expanding moat?

00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:21.160
And that was six
years, seven years ago.

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.052
And he said, Google.

00:40:22.052 --> 00:40:23.010
SPEAKER 1: Interesting.

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:26.740
FRANCOIS ROCHON: I think
that's an incredible company.

00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:30.660
And I remember thinking, well,
I knew about Google, of course.

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:34.280
But I said, well, I should
take a new look at it.

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:39.090
And we bought shares in
2011 after that comment.

00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:40.920
So we were lucky.

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:44.190
Because at that time, the
P/E ratio was 15 times.

00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:46.620
So if it would have been
a few points higher,

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:51.930
we probably would have passed
and missed an increase of 400%

00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:52.860
since then.

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:57.150
So there's always new
companies with moats.

00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:59.460
Some are expanding,
some our shrinking.

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:01.650
So we have to
follow that closely.

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:05.040
But if I had to
choose one criteria

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:09.230
to help me decide what's
the direction of the moat,

00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:10.570
it's the managers.

00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:14.380
I mean, those moats are
not built by angels.

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:15.650
They're built by human beings.

00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:19.660
So what makes a
moat grow, I think,

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:23.370
is something in the
culture of the company.

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:26.670
And those things doesn't
come from thin air.

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:30.040
It comes from the top management
that builds that culture.

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:33.760
And then it translates into
a moat, and then high return

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:36.950
on equity for the shareholders.

00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:39.400
SPEAKER 1: So when you look
at the high returns of equity

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:41.260
over the last 10
years, do you say

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:43.540
it was because of the culture?

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:47.810
Or are there other things beyond
just the numbers that you try

00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:50.500
and study to identify
whether this is a culture you

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:52.120
want to be associated with?

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:53.911
FRANCOIS ROCHON: Well,
there's many things.

00:41:53.911 --> 00:41:56.830
It's really, what's the
nature of the products, what's

00:41:56.830 --> 00:41:58.030
the nature--

00:41:58.030 --> 00:42:00.880
you know, the funny
thing with Google,

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:03.760
it was not the
first company that

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.450
had a search engine
on the internet.

00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:05.760
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.801
FRANCOIS ROCHON: It was
the last one that come up

00:42:07.801 --> 00:42:09.670
with a new search engine.

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:12.190
But this one was
better than the others,

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:15.860
thinking Yahoo, or
AltaVista, or Excite, Lycos,

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:18.940
all those first companies
that had search engines.

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:22.350
So sometimes, it's
the first arrival.

00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:24.990
And sometimes, strangely,
it's the last arrival.

00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:32.000
So that's a tough
thing with investing.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.310
Every story is
new and different.

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:35.580
So you have to--

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:38.060
when I said it's important
to have an open mind,

00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:42.170
it's because if you have
this very strict frame

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:44.870
to analyze companies, probably,
you miss lots of things.

00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:46.880
Because every situation is new.

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:50.360
And the future is all the
world's uncharted territory.

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:54.080
So you have to have
some principles.

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:56.300
You look for certain things.

00:42:56.300 --> 00:43:01.220
But in the end, you have
to judge every situation

00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:04.120
differently and by
their own parameters.

00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:06.680
And if you look
at our portfolio,

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:08.460
we own something
like 25 companies.

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:14.480
And I think the reasons
we invested in those 25

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:16.170
differ very much from
one to the other.

00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:18.170
Sometimes it's really
because of the management.

00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:21.950
Sometimes it's really because we
think the brand is very solid.

00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:24.500
And sometimes we
think the company has

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:27.500
lots of room to grow, and
it's just like a Starbucks,

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:31.572
where they just have to
clone the concept that they

00:43:31.572 --> 00:43:37.850
have built. So
there's no one recipe.

00:43:37.850 --> 00:43:39.850
It's really to have
an adaptive mind

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:42.440
and trying to understand
the nature of the business

00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:44.052
you want to invest into it.

00:43:44.052 --> 00:43:46.010
SPEAKER 1: So that leads
into my next question,

00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:48.850
actually, which is, when
do you decide to sell?

00:43:48.850 --> 00:43:52.310
Your said your average holding
period is about seven years,

00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:54.300
and you invest in
quality companies.

00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:56.420
And you know, you gave
the example of CarMax,

00:43:56.420 --> 00:44:00.230
which you have been holding
on for several years.

00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:02.734
But you sold a company like
Intel, if I remember correctly.

00:44:02.734 --> 00:44:03.650
FRANCOIS ROCHON: Yeah.

00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:05.316
SPEAKER 1: So can you
talk about how you

00:44:05.316 --> 00:44:07.100
think about selling companies?

00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:09.300
Because you think of
yourself as a partner.

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:12.372
So it must be an emotional
process as well maybe.

00:44:12.372 --> 00:44:14.330
FRANCOIS ROCHON: Yeah,
we try to remove emotion

00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:15.350
from the process.

00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:18.780
But it's never easy,
because we're human beings.

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:19.940
So we're emotional.

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:21.120
So we have to accept that.

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:25.010
And sometimes accepting
it and going beyond,

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:30.390
well, that's why we have
those rules or processes that

00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:31.560
helps to make a decision.

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:34.960
And there's really four
reasons we'll sell a stock.

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:36.960
The first one-- if we
realize we made a mistake.

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:37.990
And that happened.

00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:40.090
And I don't know the ratio.

00:44:40.090 --> 00:44:44.040
It's probably one out of three
or four stocks that we buy,

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:46.440
for some reason,
we've made a mistake.

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:48.960
And the thing to
do is just sell.

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:50.820
Accept that it's
part of the process,

00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:56.430
and you're a human being,
and it's a tough world.

00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:59.370
So when you've made a
mistake, you just sell and go

00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:01.546
into some other investment.

00:45:01.546 --> 00:45:03.420
The second reason-- it's
a little different--

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:05.970
is that you didn't
really make a mistake,

00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:08.846
but the nature of the
business has changed.

00:45:08.846 --> 00:45:10.220
There's a new
competitor, there's

00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:14.540
a new economic environment,
there's new technology.

00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:18.480
Whatever has changed in the
industry or the company itself,

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.310
it's not as great as when
you first purchased it.

00:45:21.310 --> 00:45:23.580
So when you realize
that, you have to sell.

00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:25.620
And it can be a year
after you bought it

00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:27.950
or 10 years after you bought it.

00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:32.590
The third one is probably
when I look at this situation

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:36.000
and I don't agree with
a management decision.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.730
Usually, it's a big acquisition.

00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:41.910
And when I feel that I
don't agree with management,

00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:43.500
I just sell.

00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:46.650
I mean, I have this
saying that if I

00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:50.850
had to resume, in one
sentence, what investing is,

00:45:50.850 --> 00:45:54.600
it's you become partner
with the top management.

00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:56.310
If you don't trust
them anymore, there's

00:45:56.310 --> 00:45:57.670
no reason to be a partner.

00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:59.010
So we sell.

00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:01.770
And the fourth reason, which is
probably the most common one,

00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:05.770
we just found an investment that
we think has better prospects.

00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:09.250
And so we sell A to buy B, not
necessarily because there's

00:46:09.250 --> 00:46:11.520
a problem with A. But
it's just that we think

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:14.367
that B will be more rewarding.

00:46:14.367 --> 00:46:14.950
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:17.050
And finally, before we let
it out to the audience,

00:46:17.050 --> 00:46:20.710
I want to talk about my favorite
part of your annual letters,

00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:23.260
which is those medals.

00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:25.210
And correct me if my
memory is failing me,

00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:27.304
but was Valeant
one of the metals?

00:46:27.304 --> 00:46:28.220
FRANCOIS ROCHON: Yeah.

00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:28.480
Yeah.

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:30.100
It was a-- yeah,
it was a mistake.

00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:32.200
We were lucky, because
we did make money

00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:33.440
with that investment.

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:35.060
But it turned out
to be a mistake.

00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:37.930
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, so can
you talk to the audience,

00:46:37.930 --> 00:46:39.760
explain the medals
a little bit more,

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:43.060
and tell us how you give a
medal, even to something you

00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:45.490
call a mistake, and still
make money out of it?

00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:47.200
FRANCOIS ROCHON:
Well, I would say

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:51.280
there's a difference between
being good and lucky.

00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:52.520
So we were lucky there.

00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:54.720
So that was still a mistake.

00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:58.960
Basically, well, we
make many mistakes.

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:03.070
And we only choose to
three to give medals to,

00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:04.690
bronze, silver, and gold.

00:47:04.690 --> 00:47:09.630
And most of the time, the
mistakes our omissions.

00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:12.160
Starbucks is an example
as a company that

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:14.590
fits all our criteria,
and we decided

00:47:14.590 --> 00:47:19.120
not to buy for, sometimes,
a simplistic reason.

00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:23.320
And you miss, you
know, a 10,000% gain

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:25.480
over 25 years for that reason.

00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:31.450
So we try to give medals to
the most costly mistakes.

00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:34.420
And the most costly
are usually omissions.

00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:36.480
Sometimes it's like Valeant.

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:38.850
That was a stock
that we did purchase.

00:47:38.850 --> 00:47:41.820
And we made a mistake.

00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:44.320
Well, in the case
of Valeant, I think

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:46.630
we have a lot of confidence
in the management.

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:50.080
And also, at the same time,
they had much more debt

00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:53.350
than we were usually
willing to live with.

00:47:53.350 --> 00:47:58.220
And we did kind of an
exception to our rules.

00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:00.980
And it turned out
that it was a mistake.

00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:01.930
So--

00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:05.890
SPEAKER 1: But you got out way
before a lot of the other--

00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:08.960
FRANCOIS ROCHON: Yeah, but
the selection was a mistake.

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:14.090
So it turned out, in the
end, financially, it was OK.

00:48:14.090 --> 00:48:16.570
But that's still a mistake.

00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:18.060
And that's the hard part.

00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:21.280
When you look at your mistakes,
you want to be very objective

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:24.040
and say, well, this is a
mistake for those reasons.

00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:27.790
But some stocks that I
didn't purchase that went up

00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:31.184
100 times, but I really
didn't understand,

00:48:31.184 --> 00:48:32.350
that's not really a mistake.

00:48:32.350 --> 00:48:34.870
It's just that you
decided that this

00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:37.690
was outside your circle of
competence, and you missed it.

00:48:37.690 --> 00:48:39.490
But that's not really a mistake.

00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:42.220
It's a mistake when it was
in your circle of competence,

00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:45.820
and for some reason, you didn't
go through with the purchase.

00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:48.010
Or it's a mistake
when you thought

00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:50.180
that the company was in
your circle of competence,

00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:51.910
and in the end, it was not.

00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:54.830
So that's basically
the two reasons

00:48:54.830 --> 00:48:59.440
a mistake will be in the
chapter of the annual letter.

00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:02.410
SPEAKER 1: It's interesting
you separate luck and outcome,

00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:05.320
which is what one of
our previous speakers,

00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:08.630
Michael Mauboussin, talks
about, you know, skill and luck.

00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:11.406
And then, Howard Marks
also says that, you

00:49:11.406 --> 00:49:13.480
know-- when he was
here, he said, you know,

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:16.210
what will happen might
be different from what

00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:17.000
should happen.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.975
So you need to decouple
them in your thinking.

00:49:19.975 --> 00:49:21.100
But thank you very much.

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:22.990
With that, let me open
it up to the audience

00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:27.535
if we have any
questions for you, OK?

00:49:27.535 --> 00:49:29.030
Folks, any questions
for Francois?

00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:30.172
Yeah?

00:49:30.172 --> 00:49:31.130
AUDIENCE: Hi, Francois.

00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:32.040
FRANCOIS ROCHON: Hi.

00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:33.670
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for the excellent talk.

00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:34.560
FRANCOIS ROCHON: Thank you.

00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:36.893
AUDIENCE: I've been reading
your letters over the years,

00:49:36.893 --> 00:49:38.060
and it's really excellent.

00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:39.726
One of the questions
I wanted to ask you

00:49:39.726 --> 00:49:42.980
was, you were showing us
this chart about Walt Disney

00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:45.780
and buying it at 24
times earnings, right?

00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:47.790
How do you pay up
for good businesses?

00:49:47.790 --> 00:49:50.760
Because the times when
these businesses are

00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:53.460
available with this
margin of safety

00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:55.680
is maybe when something
is wrong, maybe

00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:58.780
when the market rightly or
wrongly thinks that something

00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:00.155
is off.

00:50:00.155 --> 00:50:02.280
And if that's not the case,
then how do you pay up?

00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:05.100
But if that's the case, how do
you separate what the market is

00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:08.040
thinking versus reality?

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:10.800
FRANCOIS ROCHON: We try to
focus on the very long term.

00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:15.030
So we try to look five
years in the future.

00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:19.410
And we come up with
our best judgment,

00:50:19.410 --> 00:50:23.430
what we believe the earnings per
share should be in five years.

00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:28.270
So let's say, Disney,
when we bought in 2005,

00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:31.450
we said, well, we think this
company can earn $3 a share

00:50:31.450 --> 00:50:32.670
in five years.

00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:37.650
And then, if you think that
the fundamentals will still

00:50:37.650 --> 00:50:41.010
be good past those five
years, we say, well,

00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:46.360
it probably will warrant a P/E
ratio of, let's say, 20 times.

00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:49.630
So that gives you a $60
stock in five years.

00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:54.090
So if you can buy the
stock at $30 or less today,

00:50:54.090 --> 00:50:57.320
and you're right on
the $60 in five years,

00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:03.000
you should be rewarded earnings
something like 15% annually.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:07.200
The earnings that
the company has today

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:09.030
is not really relevant to that.

00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:13.080
So if they earn $1
this year, it looks

00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:14.650
a little pricey at 30 times.

00:51:14.650 --> 00:51:18.030
But if you have a long-term
horizon and you're focusing

00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:19.680
on where the stock will be--

00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:24.089
or the earnings will be--
in five years, in the end,

00:51:24.089 --> 00:51:24.630
you'll be OK.

00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:28.170
So having this long-term
horizon, I believe,

00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:32.620
helps you to defocus on
the P/E ratio of today.

00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:34.180
And it goes the other way.

00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:36.600
If you find a cheap
stock, but you

00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:40.500
look five years in the future
and you don't see any growth

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:43.169
prospects, there's
no real reason

00:51:43.169 --> 00:51:45.460
to believe that the stock
will be higher in five years.

00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:47.700
It can be higher in three
months just because the P/E

00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:49.070
has gone from 10 to 12 times.

00:51:49.070 --> 00:51:51.770
But we don't try to
invest for three months,

00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:54.437
we try and invest for
at least five years.

00:51:54.437 --> 00:51:55.431
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:51:59.705 --> 00:52:01.830
AUDIENCE: I thank you very
much for the great talk.

00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:03.120
And welcome to Google.

00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:04.120
FRANCOIS ROCHON: Thanks.

00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:05.680
AUDIENCE: So I have a question.

00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:08.300
Considering, now, the
current market conditions,

00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:12.090
there's a lot of warning
by people about the risk.

00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:15.480
And there are a lot of fund
managers returning funds

00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:17.490
to the investors.

00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:22.180
So I wonder, what do you think
about the market in general?

00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:25.420
And what's the risk and the
expected return for the, maybe,

00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:26.550
next five, 10 years?

00:52:26.550 --> 00:52:27.530
Thank you.

00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:30.510
FRANCOIS ROCHON:
Yeah, well, of course

00:52:30.510 --> 00:52:34.350
it's not as exciting for an
investor today as it was,

00:52:34.350 --> 00:52:37.980
let's say, in 2009, when stocks
were really, really cheap.

00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:39.600
But you know, it
was scary then too.

00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:45.360
So I always try
to kind of defocus

00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:48.540
what's happening to the market
and more focus on the companies

00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:51.000
that we own in the portfolio.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.100
And when we look
at our portfolio,

00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:56.760
and we've got this group
of 25 companies that,

00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:58.740
we're pretty
confident that they'll

00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:01.560
grow their earnings
by at least 10% to 12%

00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:04.230
in the next five years,
and their P/E ratio,

00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:09.864
seems reasonable, there's no
reason, I think, to be worried.

00:53:09.864 --> 00:53:12.030
I don't know what the market
will do in the next six

00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:13.975
months, a year, or two.

00:53:13.975 --> 00:53:16.350
But I think the companies we
own, in the next five years,

00:53:16.350 --> 00:53:18.140
will do OK.

00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:20.210
And if you look at the
general stock market,

00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:22.340
we don't have views in general.

00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:25.010
But we think that
companies can continue

00:53:25.010 --> 00:53:28.640
to grow their earnings per
share at, say, 5% to 7%

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:30.950
annually in the next five years.

00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:33.540
And you add a dividend to 2%.

00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:37.310
So even though there's no P/E
changes over the next five

00:53:37.310 --> 00:53:41.120
years, well, that would
translate into a total return,

00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:43.980
for stocks, from 7% to 9%.

00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:47.570
So it's not as exciting
as eight years ago.

00:53:47.570 --> 00:53:51.675
But still, it's pretty decent
returns when you compare that

00:53:51.675 --> 00:53:54.760
to bonds, which probably yield
something like less than 2%

00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:56.830
over the next five years.

00:53:56.830 --> 00:54:02.190
So it's not extraordinary
exciting to find opportunities.

00:54:02.190 --> 00:54:05.760
But I think the returns will be
decent, mostly for the stocks

00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:09.077
we own, and probably the
stock market as well.

00:54:09.077 --> 00:54:09.910
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:11.701
SPEAKER 1: We have one
question over there.

00:54:15.321 --> 00:54:16.570
AUDIENCE: Thanks for the talk.

00:54:16.570 --> 00:54:18.080
I actually have a
couple of questions.

00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:19.520
The first one is,
I was just look--

00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:21.061
I don't know if it's
accurate or not.

00:54:21.061 --> 00:54:22.830
I was just looking
at your holdings.

00:54:22.830 --> 00:54:25.810
And I noticed you have
MasterCard, you have Visa.

00:54:25.810 --> 00:54:29.020
MasterCard, you have, like, I
think, a position of $210,000,

00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:32.290
whereas Visa, you have, like,
a position of $35 million.

00:54:32.290 --> 00:54:34.870
I'm just wondering why you
bother keeping MasterCard,

00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:37.006
with such a low
number, rather than--

00:54:37.006 --> 00:54:38.880
because it won't even
move the needle, right?

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:40.296
Why not just put
it all into Visa?

00:54:40.296 --> 00:54:43.320
Because they seem to
track each other anyways.

00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:44.660
So that's the first question.

00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:46.870
FRANCOIS ROCHON: Yeah,
well, that's a very easy--

00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:49.150
we prefer Visa, obviously.

00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:51.890
And MasterCard, we own a few
shares just to follow it.

00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:54.830
But we think both
companies are great.

00:54:54.830 --> 00:54:56.850
These are fantastic businesses.

00:54:56.850 --> 00:54:58.510
We prefer Visa.

00:54:58.510 --> 00:55:00.740
And MasterCard, just
to follow the company,

00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:02.590
we have a few shares.

00:55:02.590 --> 00:55:04.739
SPEAKER 1: Is that
because of Visa Europe?

00:55:04.739 --> 00:55:06.280
FRANCOIS ROCHON:
No, just in general,

00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:09.700
I think Visa is an
extraordinary business.

00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:15.330
And I think it's hard to
say, because MasterCard

00:55:15.330 --> 00:55:16.380
is a great business too.

00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:20.225
But I think Visa has a
little something more.

00:55:20.225 --> 00:55:21.600
AUDIENCE: And the
second question

00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:24.210
is, in terms of the
big tech stocks,

00:55:24.210 --> 00:55:27.110
right, I noticed
you have Google.

00:55:27.110 --> 00:55:28.530
So thank you.

00:55:28.530 --> 00:55:29.780
But just curious--

00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:31.740
FRANCOIS ROCHON:
Well, thank you.

00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:34.365
AUDIENCE: I was wondering if you
could maybe give your thoughts

00:55:34.365 --> 00:55:35.790
on Apple, why you don't own it.

00:55:35.790 --> 00:55:39.152
Because I mean, personally,
I own a position in it,

00:55:39.152 --> 00:55:40.860
because I think it's
got a low valuation.

00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:43.350
And it's got a very
good moat around it,

00:55:43.350 --> 00:55:45.940
especially with all the
services added to it.

00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:47.746
So just curious on
your thoughts on that.

00:55:47.746 --> 00:55:49.620
FRANCOIS ROCHON: Yeah,
well, obviously, Apple

00:55:49.620 --> 00:55:53.810
could be in the section of
mistakes, because I mean,

00:55:53.810 --> 00:55:56.160
it's up, what, 50 times
in the last decade

00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:57.370
or something like that.

00:55:57.370 --> 00:55:59.100
So it's been a great investment.

00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:00.107
It's a great company.

00:56:00.107 --> 00:56:01.440
I mean, I can't argue with that.

00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:04.410
And the valuation
does look very low.

00:56:04.410 --> 00:56:06.690
And I think they do have a moat.

00:56:06.690 --> 00:56:10.470
And probably, five years
ago, I wasn't that convinced

00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:13.320
that the moat was that large.

00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:16.565
And it turned out that it
is a very solid business.

00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:19.950
And I think--

00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:21.840
I don't know exactly
the number, but I think,

00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:26.600
today, 10% of their revenues
are service-based and recurring.

00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:29.820
And as it get a larger
part of their revenues,

00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:32.460
I think that moat
will be expanding.

00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:36.150
Still, a large part of
their revenues and earnings

00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:38.640
come from selling new products.

00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:42.240
And when you have to sell
something new every two

00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:47.790
or three years, there's a risk
that you'll miss a product

00:56:47.790 --> 00:56:49.860
launch, or something
will not exactly

00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:51.870
satisfy the customer
for whatever reason.

00:56:51.870 --> 00:56:54.390
Or you just have the
risk, also, of having

00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:56.910
another company that comes
up with a new and improved

00:56:56.910 --> 00:56:57.940
product.

00:56:57.940 --> 00:57:00.550
So I think, if you
compare Apple and Google,

00:57:00.550 --> 00:57:03.930
I think, Google's business
is more stable, and more

00:57:03.930 --> 00:57:07.670
entrenched, and more recurring.

00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:10.950
And I think the moat is
larger in Google than Apple.

00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:12.950
That doesn't mean Apple
is not a great business.

00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:15.590
And you have to ask yourself--

00:57:15.590 --> 00:57:19.570
at that price, the P/E
ratio difference is so high.

00:57:19.570 --> 00:57:21.950
I think Apple
trades at 15 times,

00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:23.840
and Google is probably 25 times.

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:25.206
SPEAKER 1: What about Visa?

00:57:25.206 --> 00:57:26.850
FRANCOIS ROCHON:
Visa is close to 30.

00:57:26.850 --> 00:57:29.717
SPEAKER 1: So isn't'
that too high?

00:57:29.717 --> 00:57:31.800
FRANCOIS ROCHON: Well, I
remember, many years ago,

00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:35.030
Philip Fisher wrote,
in his book that--

00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:37.410
"Common Stocks and
Uncommon Profits"--

00:57:37.410 --> 00:57:40.900
the further in the future
you can see growth,

00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:43.440
the higher the P/E
ratio you can pay.

00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:46.620
So in terms of Visa,
I think you can

00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:52.770
see the company having the most
protected for many, many years.

00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:55.870
It's hard to figure out
who could hurt them.

00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:58.990
And you can see many,
many years of growth.

00:57:58.990 --> 00:58:02.220
So I think that warrants
a high P/E ratio.

00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:06.900
But of course, it was better
in 2010 when we bought it.

00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:09.840
I think we paid, I don't
know, 15 times earnings.

00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:13.530
So obviously, we had a much
larger margin of safety then

00:58:13.530 --> 00:58:15.304
than we have today.

00:58:15.304 --> 00:58:16.470
AUDIENCE: I've got one more.

00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:17.920
FRANCOIS ROCHON: I don't know
if that answers your question.

00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:18.340
AUDIENCE: Yeah it does.

00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:19.070
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, go ahead.

00:58:19.070 --> 00:58:20.820
AUDIENCE: Maybe--
because I noticed

00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:24.390
one of your largest holdings
is Berkshire Hathaway as well.

00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:26.275
And they've taken a
big position in Apple.

00:58:26.275 --> 00:58:27.150
FRANCOIS ROCHON: Yeah

00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:28.590
AUDIENCE: So
indirectly, you actually

00:58:28.590 --> 00:58:30.690
probably own more shares of
Apple through your holdings--

00:58:30.690 --> 00:58:30.990
FRANCOIS ROCHON: There you go.

00:58:30.990 --> 00:58:32.010
AUDIENCE: --of Berkshire
Hathaway than Apple.

00:58:32.010 --> 00:58:34.620
I don't know if you look
into that, that, you know,

00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:35.520
I own this company.

00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:36.900
And it already
gives me exposure.

00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:38.040
So I won't own it separately.

00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:39.090
Do you think about that?

00:58:39.090 --> 00:58:43.200
FRANCOIS ROCHON: Well,
that's not really a reason.

00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:45.645
Of course, when we own
Berkshire, we own Apple,

00:58:45.645 --> 00:58:50.700
and we own Coca-Cola, and we
own Geico, and some Burlington

00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:53.790
Northern Santa Fe, and
Precision Castparts.

00:58:53.790 --> 00:58:57.690
And BNSF and Precision
Castparts was in the portfolio

00:58:57.690 --> 00:58:58.530
a few years back.

00:58:58.530 --> 00:59:02.330
So we're still shareholders.

00:59:02.330 --> 00:59:04.380
But you know, if we
thought that Apple

00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:08.820
was a good purchase for
us today, owning Berkshire

00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:10.729
wouldn't be a
reason not to do it.

00:59:10.729 --> 00:59:12.270
SPEAKER 1: So
Francois, when you look

00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:16.200
at something like Visa
or Apple, your portfolio

00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:17.310
has low-debt companies.

00:59:17.310 --> 00:59:20.340
Sometimes they might
even have excess cash.

00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:22.170
So when you look
at the P/E ratio,

00:59:22.170 --> 00:59:23.760
do you take the cash out?

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:24.450
How do you--

00:59:24.450 --> 00:59:26.700
FRANCOIS ROCHON: Yeah, you
should do that, I think so.

00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:31.080
Because I mean, that's cash that
could be returned to investors.

00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:33.390
It's a little harder
for Apple or Google,

00:59:33.390 --> 00:59:37.020
because a lot of those
cash is in other countries.

00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:39.540
Sometimes a little
complicated to get back

00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:42.190
in the US, the cash, and
give it to shareholders.

00:59:42.190 --> 00:59:45.470
But in the end, in
some way or the other,

00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:48.420
this cash will be
returned to shareholders,

00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:52.230
I hope, and should be
taken out of the valuation.

00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:54.450
But what you want
to do is really do

00:59:54.450 --> 00:59:58.350
the sum of what you
expect the cash to be

00:59:58.350 --> 01:00:02.250
generated by the company in
the future discounted to today.

01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:04.540
And then you add the
cash that is today.

01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:06.242
So you get a proper valuation.

01:00:06.242 --> 01:00:06.950
SPEAKER 1: Right.

01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:08.220
Well, it makes sense.

01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:11.441
With that, Francois, thank you
so much for being with us here

01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:11.940
today.

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:12.380
FRANCOIS ROCHON: Thank you.

01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:14.610
SPEAKER 1: Really enjoyed your
presentation and your talk.

01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:16.410
And thank you all for being
such a great audience.

01:00:16.410 --> 01:00:16.910
Thanks.

01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:18.810
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:19.410 --> 01:00:20.610
It's so nice to have you.

01:00:20.610 --> 01:00:22.160
Thanks.
