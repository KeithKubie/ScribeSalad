00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.790
What would the DOM be like without CSS?

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.890
Well, as you can see here with the sample page that you've been using,

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.560
it's pretty boring.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.760
But luckily, you can access and modify CSS with jQuery pretty easily.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.470
Now, you should be careful because changing CSS with JavaScript or

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.190
jQuery means adding inline CSS.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.730
See, right here it says that jQuery modifies the element's style property.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.850
This isn't a good way of building a site, but sometimes it's needed.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.280
In this lesson, we'll use it, but in the real world, you should always think

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.598
about whether you should solve your problem with CSS or jQuery.

00:00:40.598 --> 00:00:45.770
The .css( ) method is similar to the .adder( ) method that we just saw.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.560
One method signature will get the value of the CSS property,

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.460
while another signature will set the value of the CSS property.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.560
Using .css, can you set the font size of all the article-items to 20 pixels?
