well it turns out that there is in fact

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849
well it turns out that there is in fact
 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.089

very clear links I think between

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.099
very clear links I think between
 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.070
very clear links I think between

across time why does this happen

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220
across time why does this happen
 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.220

with differences in health promoting and
 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:19.280
with differences in health promoting and
health damaging behavior the other

health damaging behavior the other
 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.740
health damaging behavior the other
possibility is that there may be

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750
possibility is that there may be
 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.509
