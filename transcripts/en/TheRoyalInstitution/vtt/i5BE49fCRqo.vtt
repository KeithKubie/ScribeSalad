00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.830
What do we eat? Does it matter?
Absolutely. OK, so, and...

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.990
We have to eat healthier, we have to think
about food

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.180
but we have to get away from calorie counting.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.520
And the reason why we have to get away from
calorie counting

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.950
is because I think it's an imperfect, no nay,
its' a lousy science.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.030
Because we never consider caloric availability
when we are dealing with calories.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.880
What do I mean by that?

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.710
If you eat a 100 calories of sugar, and you
actually eat it or drink it,

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.520
you will be probably get a 100 calories of
sugar out.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.750
Into your body, because your base level of
fuel is sugar.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.600
If you had 100 calories of sweetcorn, corn
on a cob,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.649
and you peeked into the loo the next day,

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.400
you'll know that you have absorbed nowhere
near a 100 calories of sweetcorn.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.070
Yet, if you take 100 calories of sweetcorn,
dry it,

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.469
pound it into a flour, turn it into a flour
tortilla and eat it.

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:08.170
Then you'll get a lot more calories out of
the exact same amount of corn.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.380
So here we have a situation where you go to
Tesco's, whatever,

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.859
other supermarkets are available, where you
actually go:

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:17.709
100 calories of sugar, 100 calories of corn
and 100 calories of a flour tortilla.

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:22.130
It's exactly 100 calories but they all have
different caloric availability.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.539
You could take the difference between a steak

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:27.619
and a mince that's been put into a lasagne
and cooked for four hours.

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.340
So you have a steak that's been cooked rare
400 calories versus that.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.329
That is always going to be calorically, the
steak, less available.

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.289
So what you eat does matter. OK.

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:42.829
So in other words just calorie counting doesn't
help us in any way,

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.369
the quality of the calorie does matter.

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.569
When the calorie is absorbed, it is a unit
of energy, it's an SI unit...

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:53.279
well that's not an SI unit, a mega Joule is
an SI unit,

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:56.740
but it's a unit of energy that is, yes, every
calorie is equal.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.149
But because we can't get at all the calories,
some calories are more equal than others.

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:02.129
So yes, what you eat matters.
