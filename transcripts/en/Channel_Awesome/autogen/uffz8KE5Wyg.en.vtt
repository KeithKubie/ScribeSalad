constantly inserting yourself like that
 

00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:31.300
constantly inserting yourself like that
that's why it's funny because

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:31.310
that's why it's funny because
 

00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:33.100

by the logic that you're shouting at it
 

00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:40.090
by the logic that you're shouting at it
and I think that's what they discovered

00:43:40.090 --> 00:43:40.100
and I think that's what they discovered
 

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:42.670
and I think that's what they discovered
and they perfected so well and I think

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:42.680
and they perfected so well and I think
 

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:45.910

fitting it in the pauses whenever a
character is talking and there's a

00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:47.120
character is talking and there's a
 

00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.310
character is talking and there's a
little pause in there and trying to fit

00:43:48.310 --> 00:43:48.320
little pause in there and trying to fit
 

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.410
little pause in there and trying to fit
it in there real fast is really good

it in there real fast is really good
 

00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:51.370
it in there real fast is really good
because that's sort of like you know

00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:51.380
because that's sort of like you know
 

00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:52.900
because that's sort of like you know
when somebody's saying something and you
