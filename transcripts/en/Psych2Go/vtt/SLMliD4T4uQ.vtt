00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.530
Do you ever wonder what sets apart confident positive people from those who feel insecure and pessimistic

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.229
It's not a matter of winning the genetic lottery

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:21.229
Instead it's a matter of self. Love if we don't take the time to appreciate who we are

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:29.000
It becomes second nature to put ourselves down instead of building ourselves up. Are you wondering why you've been so down in the dumps lately?

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.869
Here are eight signs of emotional self-harm You should recognize

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.529
One: you run away from your emotions

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.429
Do you often reject reality for what it is an escape with drugs, alcohol ,or shopping sprees?

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.450
It's perfectly normal to be afraid when we're stressed out about life

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.140
But don't run away from your emotions when they're trying to tell you something

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.079
Dr. Stephen Stastny believes that feelings are more physiological than psychological

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.480
They send action signals to your muscles and organs, which prepare your body to do something

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.839
you need to heal. when you don't confront your emotions, you also run the risk of putting off your psychological needs

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:16.189
Some questions you can ask yourself are why am I feeling this way? And is there anything I can do about the situation?

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.549
It's good to recognize the things that upset you so you can understand them better through self-reflection

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.608
Two: you are ashamed of who you are

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.479
Dr. Lynn Margulis says that shame underlies destructive behavior. It's an awful experience

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.089
The individual goes when they feel bad about themselves

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:41.869
Unlike guilt which is propelled by our conscience after doing something wrong. Shame is actually more dangerous

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:46.458
Because it doesn't need to be situational. When you feel bad about who you are

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:50.329
You also start to believe that you don't deserve a healthy relationship

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.669
Support from your friends or a job that fulfills you when in fact you do

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:00.319
Three: you belittle your own progress and accomplishments

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:04.308
It's one thing to never grow comfortable and continue setting goals

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:09.139
But it's an entirely different story when you don't give yourself credit for how far you've come

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.890
You're hurting yourself

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:18.650
When you bask in emptiness after working hard to achieve something instead of two getting the time to practice gratitude for your own hard work

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.019
One way to appreciate yourself is remind yourself of one thing. You're proud of each day

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.350
It's also good to take some time off to relax and look back on how far you've come in the last couple of years

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.579
This can prevent you from being too fixed on fulfilling the next checkpoint and be grateful for your prior achievements

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.180
For you internalize your conflicted emotions

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.240
This is different from avoiding your emotions

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:52.399
you know what's bothering you but you refuse to get help from others when you build walls up whether it's being dismissive of therapy or

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.969
Alienating yourself altogether from your family friends and partner. You're only taking a bigger hole for yourself

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:07.579
Dr. Breen brown highlights the importance of vulnerability which is the ultimate driving force of happiness.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.639
In the long run, it's good for your health when you become more open and trusting

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.299
Five: you constantly feel bad for yourself

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.610
William Shakespeare said it best pain is inevitable suffering is optional

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.399
It's okay to feel sad and disappointed when things don't always work out the way we had hoped

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.289
But when you sulk in self-pity, it doesn't change the outcome or help you get better

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:38.629
Instead of jumping to abrasive conclusions. Like I deserve to feel bad or be punished take a further step and ask yourself

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.410
Why you're beating yourself up?

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.389
Bottom line you always have a choice. So make it a worthwhile one

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.649
Six, you don't prioritize taking care of yourself

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:55.339
Do you practice bad habits, like skipping meals smoking not drinking enough water and consuming alcohol

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.669
Research shows that all of these can trigger and worsen. Your anxiety peer pressure sucks

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:08.179
It might seem cool and harmless when everyone else is getting drunk every weekend or sharing a pack of cigarettes

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.550
But when it comes down to your emotional well-being

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.040
You won't feel good when you crawl into bed late at night and wonder how things got so messed up

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.799
surround yourself with supportive

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.399
Motivated and confident individuals who are passionate about life

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.429
Although it's good to let loose every once in a while

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.700
Being around people who exercise hell the habits can remind us to stay focused on our goals

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:39.459
Seven: you are self-sacrificial. Are you a people-pleaser? Do you have a hard time saying? No when others ask you for favors?

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:46.749
Helping others can be fulfilling but not when you are always going the extra mile that can leave you Moody stressed and exhausted

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:53.349
It's okay to cancel plans and take occasional days off if you feel like you need to stay home and recharge

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.049
You deserve to feel appreciated, too

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.590
Eight: you refuse to let things go

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.010
Holding grudges is the root of all misery

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:09.100
It's okay to be mad at someone if they lied or cheated you after all you trusted them, right?

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.929
But when you let that anger persist instead of actually trying to resolve the issue at hand

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.160
You ignore your ability to regulate your emotions in a healthy fashion.

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.209
Dr. Frederic Neumann calls this exaggerated willfulness

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:28.720
He believes that this is what causes some people to commit crimes such as shooting a stranger when they cut them in line

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.570
When you only think about yourself, you're not necessarily thinking about the consequences of your own actions

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:41.379
