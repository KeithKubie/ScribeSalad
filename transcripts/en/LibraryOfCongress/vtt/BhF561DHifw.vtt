00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.270
&gt;&gt; I'm so delighted that
Michele Troy is able to be here.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.830
She earned a BA in philosophy
from Boston College and went

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:41.430
on to earn an MA in English as
well there and received a PhD

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.520
from Loyola University in Chicago.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:52.350
She has worked for many years
in the field of modernist.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.600
She's currently a professor,
English, at Hillyer College,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.030
University of Hartford, where
she also directs the honors

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.480
program there.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:13.260
Today she will be speaking about a
subject that dovetails and is drawn

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.310
from actually her current book
that just came out from --

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.010
a little bit ago --
sorry about this.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.790
Strange Bird: The Albatross
Press and the Third Reich.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.200
It was published by Yale
University Press of this year.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.500
Thank you.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.500
[ Applause ]

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.490 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michele Troy: Okay, thank you all
so much for being here and thanks

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.080
to Sabrina and Eleanor
for inviting me to come.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.710
Thanks also to the Library
of Congress for engineering

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.190
that fire drill that made my
afternoon a little spicier

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.310
and made me decide my talk was
in fact ready to go as it was.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.730
So you're going to get what I have.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.060
So basically I'm here to
talk about a publishing house

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.750
that few people beyond book
collectors, a couple of scholars,

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.210
and some, you know, print
culture studies aficionados

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.230
like yourselves know about.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.560
Most people don't.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.780
So in one sense we can imagine
I think that we're digging

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.640
up a piece of lost history.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.920
So, you know, it's like on those
TV shows where someone holds

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.070
up an artifact and tells
you the story behind it.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.080
So this is our artifact
for the moment,

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.820
It's a Brave New World
by Aldous Huxley.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.330
You'll know the novel, of course.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.670
But this version was printed in
Nazi Germany in English in 1933,

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.760
again in 1935, and
then again in 1938.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.890
So the hidden story of
Albatross behind a volume

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.020
like this involves a lot
of different threads.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.110
I mean, British American
books in the Third Reich.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.410
We have censorship.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.710
We have propaganda.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.010
We have books in wartime.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.260
Also the paperback revolution.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.570
But there's also something
else that you

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.620
as print culture studies people
may find fascinating that I also do

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.340
after all these years which is
that it was both a true innovator

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.640
in the paperback revolution

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.040
and it was also a really
interesting political player

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.550
in a very fraught political
time in Europe.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.020
In fact, its design,
the way that I see it,

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.710
was really integral to
its political agenda.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.600
And by the end of my talk, you'll
understand what I mean by that.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.060
I'm going to start with a
broad sketch of Albatross,

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.570
for those who may not
be as familiar with it.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.700
I'm going to talk a little bit
about the sleuthing process I had

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.990
to do in various archives.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.410
And from there we'll move
to the strange entanglement

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.600
between Albatross and
Hitler's Germany,

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.100
and also its relevance
actually within the history

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.620
of print culture studies.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.210
So I hope as I go on, you'll
understand why I chose

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.550 position:56%
as my title Strange Bird: The
Albatross Press and the Third Reich.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.020 position:56%
Albatross was really a strange bird.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.290
It was a complete cultural
outsider to the Third Reich.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.430
But it became more and more
of an economic insider.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.320
And so it was this position riding
the line that makes Albatross sort

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.880
of useful to Nazi authorities
but also really suspect as well.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.520
And they manipulate that, Albatross
does, to their own advantage.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.380
Okay, so moving forward.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:18.810 position:56%
For me the story of Albatross begins
here at the French National Library.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.730
Erica and I were talking
about this in line.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.730
In the reading room, I was
sitting there doing research

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.240
on something entirely different --

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.600
which is one of these ways
that research happens, right?

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.080
I was tracking the reception
of DH Lawrence in Europe.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.130
I had done reception history

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.270
of various other Anglo
American authors as well.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.790
And so I called up this book, the
Albatross Book of Short Stories,

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.840
which has a lovely silvery sheen.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.870
And I was struck by the sense

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.130
that this book was very
strange automatically.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.430
One, I had never heard of it.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.730
Although I'd been studying
the reception

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.700
of Anglo American authors
in Europe for years.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.850
It was a book in English, yet it
was published in 1935 Germany.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.510
So already, you know, two
years after the book burnings,

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.360
to have some of these names on
the cover is pretty extraordinary.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.770
Louis Golding, for
example, is a Jewish author.

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.570
Aldous Huxley has an
obviously very dystopian vision

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.120
and was very critical,
overtly critical,

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.130
of the Nazi regime in his essays.

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.220
DH Lawrence was very controversial.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.140
I mean, it's not exactly the
Nazi's top list of desired authors.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.420
And after a little more
digging, it just got stranger.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:32.830
So I found that Albatross had its
official headquarters in Hamburg,

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.860
Germany, and its editorial
office in Paris.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.190
Yet, it was in fact largely
funded by British-Jewish interests

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.840 position:56%
in London -- back in England, right.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:52.010
So what happens is that it
was founded in November 1931,

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.180
just a little over a year
before Hitler comes to power.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.670
And by March 1932, the
series has launched.

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.110
These are the first six titles.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.960
And this was an ad designed for
the German book trade newsletter,

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.750
so there's German sprinkled
between --

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.050
German descriptions sprinkled

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.490
between the English
language titles there.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.640
So as some of you may know,
Albatross was forged explicitly

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.400
to wrest control of the
continental market in English books

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.610
from Tauchnitz, which
was a German firm.

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.810
Bernard von Tauchnitz, in
1841, hatched this great idea

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.870
that he would print
English language books

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.990
and that would give
British publishers

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.640
and authors copyright
protection on the continent.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.800
And so Tauchnitz was the
only name in town in fact

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.030
for accessible English
language books

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.280
that people could actually
afford at the time.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.430
But Albatross leaders knew
that demand for modern books

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.790
in English had escalated over
the '20s and into the beginning

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.340
of the '30s, and they
wanted in on this game.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.380
I also discovered over time
that two of the three leaders

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:02.990 position:56%
of Albatross were in fact Jewish or
considered Jewish by Nazi standards.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.950
So Kurt Enoch on the right,
who eventually became one

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.600
of the cofounders of the New
American Library, he was Jewish.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.580
And on the left here, the director,

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.410
John Holroyd-Reece,
his father was Jewish.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.550
So he was considered -- basically
I've seen uda [phonetic] next

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:21.540
to his name a number of
times in Nazi documents.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:26.390
So there was also Nazi officials
repeatedly referred to Albatross

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.010
as a notorious foreign
firm with, you know,

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:30.420
operating in Jewish circles.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.940
I mean, this language is very
strong in some of the documents.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.110
And so yet, despite that,
I mean, despite the fact

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:40.670
that there's no love lost
between Albatross and the Nazis,

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:44.360
they publish roughly 450 books.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.040
These are reprints of books

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.430
that have appeared elsewhere,
between 1932 and 1939.

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:55.300
So it's very substantial, beginning
with James Joyce's Dubliners.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.210
So modern cutting-edge books.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.990
Ending with, The Way to be
Alive, by William Saroyan,

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:05.990 position:56%
which was ironically the last book
before war started, with this title.

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:11.320
And again, if you look at the
list given to German booksellers

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:15.790
in March 1933, it reads like a
Who's Who of modern literature.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:17.710
Many of these people
are still taught.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:20.610
And you have on here also
James Joyce's Ulysses.

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:23.910
And you have Lady Chatterley's
Lover.

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:26.320
So at this point I
was entirely hooked,

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.730
because I had just pieced together
enough to forge the questions

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:32.440
without really knowing the answers.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.190
So, you know, why would the
Nazi regime tolerate this firm

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:37.880
when it had put so much
weight and so many resources

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.110
into crushing foreign influence?

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:42.200
And especially Jewish influence.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.120
And equally as mysterious,
why would a cosmopolitan firm

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.980
with British-Jewish funding
tolerate Nazi Germany?

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.430
What's going on here?

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:54.030
So if you're feeling a little
like this at this point,

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:57.700
you're feeling like
I was at the time.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:01.800
And it really I got attached
to this historical mystery

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.000
and went in search of it.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.150
Over about 10 years, off
and on, in between teaching

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:11.290
and raising children,
you know, 30 archives

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:13.570
or so in about six
different countries.

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:17.730
So it wasn't as easy as I
thought it would be because --

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:19.370
well, for various reasons.

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:21.930
One is that there were not very
many articles written about it.

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.590
There were a couple of scholars
whose names who I might can talk

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:26.130
with you about later who had --

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.410
one in Germany and one in
Scotland who had done some work.

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.800
There was no central archive.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.350
The Leipzig office
had been destroyed

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:35.100
in Allied bombing raids
in December '43.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.220
The Reich Literary Chamber, which
supervised all the publishing

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:42.460
under the Nazis, their
publishing archives

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:46.340
of all the different publishers had
been destroyed in that same raid.

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.800
So the Paris and London offices
had been vacated after the war.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.240
In fact, the London
office was also bombed.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:57.900 position:56%
So this massive archive which really
should've been a treasure trove,

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:02.880 position:56%
the Reich Literary Chamber, when you
looked at the time in the catalog

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.660
of the German national archives,
there were four entries,

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:10.400
and these were these tiny little
files with almost no information.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.700
And you know that a firm like this,

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.840
they had to have piles
of documents on them.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:20.650 position:56%
So to top it all off, I have to say,
my first research trip, I, you know,

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:23.170
showed up in Berlin, thinking,
okay, that's the central place.

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:26.820
And then I realized, oh, right, the
Nazi's organized things regionally.

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.120
So I had to go to Leipzig.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:31.190
So I called Leipzig saying, I'd
love to hop a train and come

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:32.670
down there and look at files.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.120
And the German archivist
was a little bit like, well,

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.130
who do you think you are,
some like American powerhouse?

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:42.350
And storm in and, you know,
expect files like that?

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:45.810 position:56%
And I said, you know, no, no, I mean
tomorrow, you know, not right away.

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:47.980
But anyway, I think
he thought I was sort

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.880
of like this wonder
powerful woman, I don't know.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:58.480
But anyway, my breakthrough
came when I did what any poor,

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.050
frustrated American
powerful researcher would do

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:04.570
when she doesn't have any
sources, and I went to a mentor,

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:05.870
whom some of you may know.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:10.060
Do you know this guy, anyone?

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.460
[inaudible] On the
Wire, exactly right.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.610
And what is Lester
Freeman always saying?

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:17.500
He's saying, follow the money.

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.020
You got to follow the money.

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.990
So I followed the money.

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:25.840
And, in fact, I had
assumed that I should focus

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:30.410
on the cultural agencies
in Nazi Germany.

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:33.250
But, in fact, it was only when
I started to follow the money

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:34.730
that the bigger picture
came to light.

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.910 position:56%
Three are multiple examples of this,

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:39.520
but my first big breakthrough
happened not too far from here

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:43.390
in a seedy hotel near the
College Park National Archives,

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:45.860
when I realized, of course, as
a foreign firm during the war,

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.210
they would've had to be overseen

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:53.880
by the Reichskommissar
for enemy property.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.010
So I read through all the entries.

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:58.980
And what happens is, you know,
I find British and French assets

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:00.480
but there are no names of firms.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:05.020
Those are in fact in a
handwritten catalog in Germany.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:09.110
So the archivist sends back to me
the news 800 pages of documents.

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:10.410
It's magic.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:11.710
Such a treasure trove.

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:14.820
So that's really how I started to
get a breakthrough on this subject.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:18.340
And it's documents like these,
which may seem very boring

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:21.190
and I know it's quiet blurry,
but this is just a list

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:25.140
of different bureaus or
chambers that were kept

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.990
in the know about Albatross.

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:31.160
And on this list, for example,
is the Reich Literary Chamber,

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.650 position:56%
the Economics Ministry, the
Finance Ministry, the secret police,

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:35.950
the German Foreign Office.

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:39.780
I had never thought of looking at
the German Foreign Office before,

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:41.780
and yet it was really valuable.

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:44.630
And so I'm looking also
at Albatross's German

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:48.690
and French partners, at their bank
accounts, at Reich bank files,

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:50.890 position:56%
German book trade association files.

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:53.150
And I mention all this because
I think when you're working

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.390
in print culture, or you're
working in publishing history,

00:12:55.390 --> 00:13:00.120 position:56%
it's kind of interesting to realize
the most obvious places we might go,

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.510
the literary archives,
the publishing archives,

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:06.150
aren't necessarily
always the only ones.

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:08.790
And it's important at
times to, you know,

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:11.590
look at those regulatory
bodies who set the parameters.

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:14.770
So this is the back story in a way.

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:20.510
And I'm going to move on now to
the first big most obvious question

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:24.320
of why the Nazis tolerated
this firm.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.600
In fact, Albatross leaders
were worried at first

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:30.010
that their books wouldn't
be tolerated.

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:34.890
So there's the first official
boycott of Jewish businesses

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:38.200
that is scheduled for
the 1st of April, 1933.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.230
And on the eve of that, you
have Max Christian Wegner,

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:45.300
who's here on the left, come
to visit Kurt Enoch in Hamburg.

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.040
And Wegner has been
at the Paris office.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.760
And so he flies back
in or takes the train.

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.270
And they have a conversation.

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:56.400 position:56%
They're thinking about moving, you
know, pulling stakes out of Germany.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.460
They're thinking about moving
the warehouse to Switzerland.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:01.270
They're thinking -- you
know, Wegner, as an Aryan,

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:03.570
could potentially purchase
Enoch's firm.

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:05.740
He was, you know, Jewish.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.540
So they're thinking
about all these things.

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:10.200
And over time, things
just settle down.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:14.450
And in fact, what's really
weird about this story is

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:19.180
that the Nazi authorities, in fact,
grant Albatross more leeway both

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:22.040
in terms of the content of
their books and in terms

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:25.470
of the foreign currency that they
allot them in order to take care

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:29.010
of their foreign expenses than they
do other German firms publishing

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:31.550
in German for a domestic
German audience.

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:32.850
So this is weird.

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:34.490
And when German publishers
start to figure this out,

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:37.590
they're also rather irritated,
certain of them, about that.

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:42.630
But the most important reason that
the Nazis tolerated Albatross is,

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:46.060
as I say in my book, that they
found Albatross's presence

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:51.160 position:56%
in Germany less culturally
troublesome and economically useful.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.000
So it's, again, about money.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.480
Because Albatross was registered
in the German Registry of Commerce,

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.210
because the books were
produced in Leipzig,

00:14:58.210 --> 00:14:59.710
they count as German products

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:02.750
in the international trade balance
even though they were published

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:04.640
in English, it doesn't
really matter.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.530
This meant that every book sold
abroad gives the regime foreign

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:10.220
currency, which, of course,
they desperately needed

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:13.020
because they were trying to rearm.

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.290
In essence, the Reich
Literary Chamber was told

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:17.180
to give Albatross a pass.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:22.310 position:56%
And this is a quote from a Reich
literary official to a German reader

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:25.960
who complained about a
volume by Louis Golding.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:29.190
In order to stay competitive
against non-German firms abroad,

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:32.250 position:56%
Albatross is forced to publish
books that in terms of their content

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:34.410
and in view of their authors
cannot always be endorsed

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:35.740
for German readers.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.630
In general, the Albatross-Verlag
has hitherto occasioned

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:40.700
to no objections regarding
the distribution

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:42.830
of such books in Germany.

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:46.460
So in this way I think
Albatross's survival

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:47.850
under the Nazis challenges a lot

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:50.150
of assumptions we might
make about censorship.

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:53.290
I would have assumed -- I mean,
I could see no use for Albatross

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:54.940
from the beginning when I
started the research except

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.570
that the Nazis would
sensor their books.

00:15:56.570 --> 00:16:00.740
And yet, they're really
allowed and in a way encouraged.

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:04.830
So here, you know, censorship
is not a moral issue.

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:06.880
It's an economic issue.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:10.530
They are deciding to -- the
Nazis are willing to let go

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:15.990
of their own ideology in order
to get the foreign currency.

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:18.720
And this is not necessarily
astonishing,

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.170 position:56%
but it's an interesting way to think

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:23.380
about how financial
factors swayed censorship.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:26.080
And another piece of
this economic calculation

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:31.610
which is quite interesting is that
by this point in time, by 1934,

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:34.510
Albatross has taken over
the management of Tauchnitz.

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:36.580
So they used to started
off competitors and end

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:38.460
up on the same masta
[phonetic], as you can see here.

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.890
This is a brochure from 1935.

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:45.070
Albatross wanted to buy Tauchnitz
outright, it was not allowed to.

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:47.580
The Reich Literary Chamber
wouldn't allow it on grounds

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:48.880
that the firm was foreign.

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:51.650
It didn't say Jewish, but
that's probably implied.

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:55.150
So there ended up being a
strange three-way relationship,

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:57.470
that I can talk about later
if anyone's interested,

00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:02.180
between the printer who
printed the two series --

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.830
the Tauchnitz Albatross series --

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:08.490
and Albatross and Tauchnitz
themselves.

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:12.380
So what happens, in essence, is
that if the Nazi regime wants

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.790
to get foreign currency
for Tauchnitz,

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:17.440
it has to keep Albatross
alive at this point.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.330
Because the printer
who prints the book

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:22.070
and is technically the owner
doesn't know what to do,

00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:24.930
how to market a series or
develop it, they're printers.

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:26.230
So it's a strange thing.

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:28.660
And, you know, as I
mentioned before, you know,

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:33.130
the Germans need foreign currency,
and books, as you can see here,

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:36.830
are the third largest export.

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:42.800
This is from a document by
the Reich Literary Chamber.

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.330
Okay, so at this point
I'm switching gears.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:48.180
We have to do a little pivot to
ask the flip side of the question,

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:53.740
which is, why does Albatross
actually stay in Germany?

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.830
They have so many international
connections, they could just pull

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:58.150
up stakes and run their
series from elsewhere.

00:17:58.150 --> 00:17:59.770
Were they just collaborating?

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:01.700
I mean, I did wonder
that for a while.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:05.720
But I soon discovered the Albatross
leaders had their own agendas

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.020
at stake.

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.400
And here's the moment where --

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.410
it's an interesting print
culture moment I think,

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:14.620
that we can see exactly
how Albatross's design --

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:18.480 position:56%
which was created by a German master
typographer, Hans Mardersteig.

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.980
How this design actually
helped advance Albatross's

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:23.590
political agendas.

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:26.920
So to get at these agendas, we need
to take a little trip to Paris.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.290
We're going to go to
the Ile De La Cite.

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:33.900
And we're going to go right north
of the Notre Dame Cathedral.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:36.390
There's a house that
looks like this.

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:37.690
It's 12 Roush.

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:41.350
And here's the beautiful door.

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:44.740 position:56%
And you go through the door to the
inner courtyard, and then you can go

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:47.400
on into the Albatross office,
where you see John Holroyd-Reece,

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:51.130
the director, at work, with
one of his right-hand --

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:53.810
some of his right-hand
men and women there.

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:59.370
And so basically, Holroyd-Reece
took the position --

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:02.660
he played with Albatross's national

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.930
and international affiliations
quite liberally.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:09.970
So he insisted, for example, in
Germany, that Albatross was German,

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:12.300
to benefit and get perks
from the German government.

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.960
And in England, of course,
Albatross was wholly British

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.880
and serves British interests.

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:21.330
And he -- this contention
becomes increasingly important

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:24.290
because as the atrocities are
continuing in Nazi Germany,

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:26.420
there's a question about
why is this firm continuing

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:28.840 position:56%
to have ties and do business, right.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.870
So he always claimed
that -- publicly --

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:34.790
that Albatross had decided to print
and sells its books in Germany

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:37.270
because that was the largest
English-speaking market.

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:40.460
It was worth about a third
of the continental market.

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:43.320
And I have Tauchnitz figures
that substantiate that also,

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.790
before Albatross took
over the management.

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:50.120
So he used the financial or
sales argument to say, okay,

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.360
we're keeping our books
in there for this reason.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:55.100
And this is true as far as it goes.

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:57.980
Yet, I would say that
Holroyd-Reece often told a part

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:01.320
of the truth rather
than the whole truth.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:05.270
He wasn't just the charming
British chap he seems.

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:08.760
In fact, he was born under
the name of Johan Herman Reece

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.360
to a German Jewish father
and a British mother

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:14.040
at an artist colony outside Munich.

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:17.860
When his father died in 1909,
his mother sent him to England

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:21.960
to Repton, the boarding school.

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:26.060
And he became so much an
Englishman in his manner

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:29.390
that he actually fought for
the British in World War I,

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:33.210
without his superior officer even
knowing that he was German born.

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:36.170
And I found out this
in his application

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:38.500
for British citizenship
after the war.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:39.800
So if this were fiction,

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.270
Holroyd-Reece would
really be the perfect spy.

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:45.650
And in fact, one diplomatic
source early in the '30s,

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:47.080
claimed that Holroyd-Reece
had worked

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.380
for the British during World War I,

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:51.360
while he was still
a German national.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:55.460
I will say in 1937, when French
intelligence services heard

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:59.210
Holroyd-Reece describing one
of his many publishing ventures

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:03.410
as a cover -- I'm not interested
in that, it's just a cover.

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:04.890
You know, they said,
well, a cover for what?

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:08.140 position:56%
And they went and talked to him, and
I've seen the French files on this.

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:12.130
And he claimed to be working
for British intelligence.

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:15.390
So this adds another
little wrinkle to the story.

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:18.640
He did speak four languages
at least fluently.

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:22.010
He also worked as a Lloyd's broker
in England and had businesses

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:23.310
in France, which allowed him

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:26.390
to shift money pretty easily
across national lines.

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:29.090
Among other things, he
brokered a deal for heavy metals

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:33.040
for British investors in the
late 1930s, just before the war.

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:36.070
So he's got a lot of
things going on here.

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:38.720
I will also say one funny
little story about him.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.020
And these are some
of the kinds of --

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.580
this story didn't actually
make it into the book,

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:45.540
so it's a bonus feature for today.

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:49.120
During the war, first world war, he
boarded part time with at the home

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.760
of one of his school chums.

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:55.960
And during this time -- he was
later accused in a divorce suit

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.290 position:56%
of having an affair with the mother.

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:01.030
So according to the
Times, he denied the claim,

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:02.910
saying the mother was
lonely and friendless

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:04.750
and was getting no
answers to her husband.

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:06.050 position:56%
And so he would go up to the nursery

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:10.250
to comfort her sometimes,
this was the story.

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:13.680 position:56%
So sometimes, he said, he sat on
the bed and got under the eiderdown,

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.680
but he never got into
bed with Mrs. Wakley.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.720
So you have this part
of the testimony --

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.460
this is just by way of showing you
the character running this firm,

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:22.920
the character behind it.

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:25.380
This is part of the
testimony from the judge.

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:27.150
Did you happen to kiss her
when you were lying beside her

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:28.490
under an eiderdown quilt?

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:29.790
I may have done so.

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:31.540
You need not further cross-examine.

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:34.540
Has a fine slapped
on him immediately.

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.800
So he's quite a character.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:41.370
And you'll understand with this
little personal anecdote included,

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:43.680
that, you know, while
Albatross, like any publisher,

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.530
wanted to sell books,
this guys always had

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:48.180
at least one other agenda going.

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.800 position:56%
He's got a lot of irons in the fire.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:55.300 position:56%
Now, one of Albatross's -- Albatross
didn't just want to sell books.

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:56.980
Tauchnitz wanted to sell books too.

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:59.410
And they can see that
their main clientele

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:01.490
as British and American tourists.

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:03.460
Albatross does something
different, and this is one

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:06.160
of its big innovations
in the market.

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:10.410
They decide they want to
reach out to native Europeans

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:13.130
who do not have English
as their first language.

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:15.680
So, for example, here's EM
Forster's A Passage to India.

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:18.580
At the bottom you can faintly
see Hamburg, Paris, Bologna.

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:21.660
The covers are very cosmopolitan.

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:24.690
Also, they included an explanation

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:27.570
of the color system
in four languages.

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:30.250
And also -- and I'll talk
about that in a moment.

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:32.630
But this is to appeal
to European readers.

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:37.100
If you don't know much about
these books but you want a mystery

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:39.680
for the train, you know
you should grab Red.

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:44.370
So it makes it easier for foreign
readers to actually land on a book

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:46.010
that they might like, right.

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:47.830
And I'll go through the
genres in just a minute.

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:50.530
They also had summaries in
three different languages:

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:52.740
so English, French, and German.

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:57.770
So again, a lot of foreign
booksellers didn't speak English.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:59.440
So then they could look
at the summary on the back

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.050
and say, oh, here's so and so.

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:02.810
Oh, you tend to like love stories.

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:06.070
Well, here you go, this one
would be lovely for you.

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:09.760
So I want to say too, it's
partly the sheer beauty

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:13.590
of the Albatross design that
helps it nudge Tauchnitz

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:14.890
out of the market.

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:17.480
And you can see this, you know.

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.940
Tauchnitz was an innovator
in a particular kind of way.

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:23.720
Albatross invaded that market, it
was an innovator in another way.

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:26.930
But you know, different
genres, different colors.

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:29.210
So murder mysteries are red.

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:31.000
A love story is blue.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.800
Satire or short stories are orange.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.760
Writings of foreign
places are green.

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:40.930
Biographies are purple or kind
of a violet-magenta color.

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:43.750
Yellow is for psychological
novels, such as Woolston.

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:45.700
By the way, the psychological
ones are always the easiest

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:47.560
to find in these book stores.

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.620
The reds are hard to find,
those mystery novels.

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:50.920
I think they got read and reread.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.800
Which is sort of funny.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.650
Albatross also created a
spinoff, the Odyssey Press,

00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:58.140
just to publish Lady
Chatterley's Lover.

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:01.470
These are ads for them,
not the books themselves.

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:03.670
And Ulysses.

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:08.470
So I mean, why reach out to foreign
readers at this point in time

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:10.080
with these beautifully
designed books?

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:11.380
Why does the design matter?

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:12.710
Well, it's helping
to sell more books.

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:15.750
It helps -- in fact, it's
part of a bigger agenda.

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:19.280
The British want control
over the British

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:21.930 position:56%
and American books on the continent.

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:24.330
And think about the time.

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:27.900
This is a world in which books and
especially foreign books are seen

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:29.570
as carriers of national ideology.

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:32.790
So the more you can sell of
your own books, the better.

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:36.240
Governments are stepping back and
considering in a more organized way

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:39.230
than before how can books
be used as propaganda.

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:41.900
So we have, for example,
Geoffrey Faber saying,

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.490
books are not mere merchandise.

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:46.330
Books are a nation
thinking out loud.

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:49.850 position:56%
We have a version of this during the
second world war in the States too.

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:53.070
Books are weapons in
the war of ideas.

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:57.510 position:56%
So, you know, Albatross in its
English language books are wittingly

00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:00.830
or unwittingly in the thick of this
world, right, as it's developing.

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:03.070
And the Nazis were -- another thing

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:04.860
to understand is the Nazis
are obviously way in the lead

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:07.880
when it comes to using books
to serve state interests.

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.900
The British were miserably behind.

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:13.650
And they were very well aware by
1930 that they were very far behind

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:15.870
in promoting their
own culture abroad.

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:18.740
They promoted their
own machines abroad.

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:21.890
So you could -- they had ads for
airplanes and things like that.

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:26.220 position:56%
But they blocked funding for
cultural propaganda across the '20s,

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:29.050
feeling rather arrogant that
they just didn't need it.

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:30.620
There was a small group
that thought they did,

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:32.490
but they couldn't convince
the others.

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:34.890
So you end up with Clifford Norton

00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:37.890
who is the British foreign office
affiliate and wartime investor

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:40.210
to Switzerland, we may tell
foreigners about our airplanes

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:42.840
and our coal strikes but not
about our poets and painters.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:45.550
We met export bacon but not Bacon.

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:47.190
I love that quote.

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:50.020
So, you know, you basically
have Britain has been resting

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:51.320
on its laurels.

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:55.260
And by 1934 though, the French and
German governments were estimated

00:26:55.260 --> 00:27:00.850 position:56%
to be spending over a million pounds
annually on cultural propaganda.

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:06.800
So you have to think -- so
by 1934, the people who are

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.160
in the foreign office managed
to convince the government

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.560
to fund a similar cultural
propaganda initiative.

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:14.000
It was the British Council.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.300
But guess what its budget was?

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:17.040
I couldn't even believe this.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.870
5000 pounds.

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:23.200
So a million pounds versus 5000.

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:28.220
So this meant that when you have
Holroyd-Reece sitting in his office

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:30.550
in Paris -- which he
loved luxury, be the way,

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:32.330
as you can sort of see here.

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:33.630
Tapestries.

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:34.930
Medieval sculptures.

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:36.540
There are all kinds of
things he has in his house.

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:43.100
But when he helped to found
and fund Albatross in 1931,

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:44.590 position:56%
he was inherently advancing the work

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:47.170
of the British Council
before it even existed.

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:49.520
So he founded Albatross
four years earlier

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.840
and with twice the startup funding
that he British Council had.

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:56.170
And that they're saying too,
Albatross fit to a T the goals

00:27:56.170 --> 00:27:59.170
of Sir Reginald Leeper, who founded
the British Council in December --

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:02.750
the first head of the British
Council in December '34.

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:06.800
That it would be better for private
firms to promote British culture

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.310
so that it would come in under
the radar than it would be

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:13.090
for the government
officially to promote anything.

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:17.120
So with this idea, books
and propaganda in mind,

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.240
if you think about that, the
sales figure I said before,

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:24.440
roughly a third of
the market, is German.

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:28.020
That means your largest
English reading audience

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:30.620
in continental Europe
is Hitler's Germany.

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:34.750
And for the Nazis, they
just care about the 70

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:36.760
or 68% that's getting exported.

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:41.330
But for Holroyd-Reece to say
that there's 30% of the market

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:43.470
that still exists there,
is important.

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:46.100
And obviously as Germany annexes
more and more territory late

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:48.790
in the '30s, that number grows.

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:52.950
The reason that's important
is that --

00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:56.060
and this help explain why
would Albatross stay put.

00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:57.990
It's not about the money.

00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:59.650
It's about their presence there.

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:01.920
In fact, Holroyd-Reece
was miserable with money.

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.780
They hardly ever made money.

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:06.900
It was about keeping
the books there.

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:10.270
And at this point in time, because
of German import restrictions,

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:14.540
it was very, very hard for
British publishers to get books

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:17.890
in if they wanted to
sell them in that market.

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:25.010
So in fact, the Albatross-Tauchnitz
operation becomes a huge boom

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:26.910
for the British Council.

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:30.860
So you have in November 1938, the
British Council's trying to figure,

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:33.790
should we start up some
libraries over there?

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:36.010
How can we get -- do we
do student exchanges?

00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:37.310 position:56%
What are we going to do to make sure

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:39.670
that Anglo-American culture
stays alive over there?

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:43.890
And in a report in November
1938, they say, again, cheapness

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:46.940
and excellence of Tauchnitz and
Albatross books place English

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:49.320
and American literature within
reach of any who are interested

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:52.110
and the most we could do would
be to present a small number

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:53.970
of carefully chosen
books to institutions

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:55.810
which are training younger people.

00:29:55.810 --> 00:30:00.350
So they got this inside
track that's already --

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:03.860
you know, gives them an
advantage in this world

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:05.930
of cultural propaganda
at this particular time.

00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:07.470
How did they gain that?

00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:10.720
They gain it because of
their design and because

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.570
of their selection of authors.

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:18.060
In essence, Tauchnitz was
not producing modern authors

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:22.520
until the very last couple of
years before Albatross comes

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:23.820
into existence.

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:27.450
And so what happens is
Albatross also floods this market

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:31.480
with modern books that have
a lot more liberal ideas,

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:34.920
that would not have been able to
be easily accessible beforehand.

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:37.910
Okay, I want to come
back to this question

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:39.870
of lost history with
which I started.

00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:42.610
And there's one print
culture piece I want to do

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:44.240
and then just two conclusions.

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.880
So I started off with this idea

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:50.740
that Albatross has largely
been erased from history.

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:53.820
And a lot of people
have asked me why.

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:56.480
How did a firm that was
once the largest purveyor

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:59.730
of English language books in
continental Europe in the 1930s,

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:01.450
just like just disappear, poof?

00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:02.750
Where did it go?

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:05.940
So I can speak more
on this, you know,

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:07.440
afterwards if anyone's interested.

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.550
But there's a basic
combination of factors.

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:12.670
I mean, one is copyright
issues after the war.

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:16.670
One is that Albatross had
German ties before the war

00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:17.970
and after the war.

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:21.940 position:56%
That doesn't really suit -- you
know, it doesn't serve your interest

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:24.450
to have had German ties
that were too strong.

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:25.790
But I would also say it became --

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:28.240
Albatross became a victim
of the paperback revolution

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.020
that it helped to develop.

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:34.010
So the most obvious case is,
of course, Penguin books.

00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:37.280
So when you see that little
Albatross on those books, you know,

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:38.580
people think Penguin, right.

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:41.680
And how many bookshelves have you
seen if you're book collectors

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:44.840
or lovers books, all the
different colors, right,

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:47.490
collected on the bookshelf
from the early Penguins.

00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:51.260
So it's been long known
within book history

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:54.700 position:56%
that Penguin took Albatross's model.

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:59.160
But what's really more interesting
even than that is that, in fact,

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:02.670
Allen Lane had signed a
memorandum of agreement to partner

00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:06.550
with John Holroyd-Reece, the
Albatross director, in 1934.

00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:11.110
And so what you have is
Holroyd-Reece realizing

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:13.200
that he can achieve
greater economies of scale

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:16.550
if he can include the
British market.

00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:19.700
Because these books were not
allowed in the British market.

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:23.810
And so he teams up
with -- the idea is

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:28.930 position:56%
that Allen Lane will print the books
in England and Lane will sell them

00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:32.800
in England and Holroyd-Reece
will sell them on the continent.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:37.260
So in the document it says, John
Holroyd-Reece will explain to,

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:38.640
you know, Lane's people,

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.100
the economies of scale,
how to get the most.

00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:42.520
He was amazing with that.

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:45.280
He had Hans Mardersteig , the
guy who designed the covers --

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.820
he had him come up to Collins,
which was an Albatross partner

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:51.690
in Edinburgh, and show them
how they use a different font

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:53.100
so they could get more
words on the page.

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:54.920
But it would still look beautiful.

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:58.020
But this is the kind of thing
Holroyd-Reece was doing.

00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:02.070
But in any case, so he shares
all of his economies of scale

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:03.590
with Lane, and what does Lane do?

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:04.980
We all know.

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:06.930
There's Penguin, the
next two, right.

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:11.500
So I think -- Penguin was just
the beginning, by the way.

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:13.980
We have Start Editions, which
is a group of British publishers

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:17.780
who get together to try to
get the continental market.

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:21.150
There's Zephyr out of --
Zephyr Books out of Sweden,

00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:22.920
which emerges during the war

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:28.980
and when the Germans
forbid Tauchnitz books

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:32.230
from being exported anymore
and Albatross books then.

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:33.530
And here we have Kurt Enoch.

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:35.120
The story comes full circle.

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:38.720
Kurt Enoch, who was Albatross's
Jewish partner, lands in New York.

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.600
And during the war, works
for American Penguin.

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:46.450
I got this photo from his
first cousin once removed

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:48.470
who actually worked for
the IMF here in town

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:50.640
for years, just retired last year.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:54.110
But essentially what happens
is, is Albatross can't hold

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:55.620
up against the competition anymore.

00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:57.930
There are these -- you've
got Kurt Enoch coming back

00:33:57.930 --> 00:34:00.370 position:56%
with his New American Library books,

00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:03.150
where they're so much
more cheaply produced.

00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:06.290 position:56%
They have access to the whole
American market, and they're selling

00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:08.100
for a third to a quarter
of the price

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:10.270
that Albatross has
as its price point.

00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:14.550
Albatross just goes under
after the war at that point.

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:17.860
Okay, and with that, just a couple
of points to leave you with.

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:21.320
The first has to do with something
I wasn't really able to address

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:22.620
in the talk today because
I was trying

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:25.270 position:56%
to give it a print culture emphasis.

00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:28.410
I've largely told you
a tale of institutions:

00:34:28.410 --> 00:34:31.490
Albatross versus the Nazis.

00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:34.370
However for me over the years,

00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:38.420
probably one of the most compelling
things about the research I ended

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:41.320
up doing was -- and it's one

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:43.850
of the reasons I hope you'll
consider reading my book,

00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:47.020
is that it's really also a
story of individual actors.

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:48.320
You have Kurt Enoch.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:49.620
You have Max Christian Wegner.

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:50.920
And you have John Holroyd-Reece.

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:53.930
And all three of these
men are German-born men,

00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:58.110
who chose against the odds
to found a multinational,

00:34:58.110 --> 00:35:04.210 position:56%
cosmopolitan publishing house,
really at the absolutely worst time.

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:07.380
So you have the ripple effects
of the American Great Depression.

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:09.670
You have European economies
foundering.

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:10.970
You have the rise of fascism.

00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:13.060
And yet these guys persist.

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:16.720
And they're almost always, by the
way, in trouble with the Nazis,

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.020
for one reason or another.

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:20.700
But they sort of manage
to like wiggle around.

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:22.170
They find ways to get around.

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:26.300
They will pull the wool over the
Nazi's eyes with his emigration,

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:28.120 position:56%
which is a story that's in the book.

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:32.660
But I think for me, I find
their attempts to maneuver

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:37.540
around the Nazi regime increasingly
meaningful, as we live right now

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:39.800
in a particular political
culture in our own moment.

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:41.700
And maybe it's really
appropriate to say this in DC.

00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:45.320
But, you know, individual agency
seems to matter more than ever.

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:48.380
I think we need it more than ever.

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:50.150
And it's really important
we continue to believe

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:53.530
that what we do matters up against
these powers that be in extreme

00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:55.280
of executive orders
that's threatening

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:57.010 position:56%
to ruin whole pieces of our society.

00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:59.730
So for me, actually this book
has a strange relevance now

00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:02.990
that I never expected it
would have when I wrote it.

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:05.700
The second thing I'd like to leave
you with, and then I'm really done,

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:10.740
is this rather naught
question of collaboration.

00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:12.290
It would be really
nice to say that, oh,

00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:14.720
Albatross is inherently
subversive because its books were

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.470 position:56%
in English, because they were there.

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:18.250
You can't really entirely say that.

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:21.940
I mean, I do think that they
had an important presence

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:24.680
and certainly British
propaganda agencies were happy

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:25.980
that they were there.

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:30.370
But in multiple artistic realms,
it was all for light entertainment.

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:34.550
Because it was seen as
distracting people from, you know,

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:35.850
the hardships of the day.

00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:40.580
And so in a sense, if you include
Albatross in that entertainment

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:43.690
that was available to people,
you could say in a way, you know,

00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:46.130
are they playing an instrument

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:48.240
in Google's orchestra
too in their own way.

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:53.350
You know, despite their good
intentions in this bigger context.

00:36:53.350 --> 00:36:57.470
But I also think there's
this fact too.

00:36:57.470 --> 00:37:00.790
That the more the Nazis cracked
down on Anglo-American books

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:03.670
and anything Anglo-American
in Europe during the years

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:06.690
of the occupation and the war,
the more that Albatross --

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:10.960
which is, by the way, largely
allowed during the war --

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:14.640
that they become one
of the last voices

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:18.620
for Anglo-American
culture in occupied Europe.

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:22.110
And it's my hope that through
the recovery of more documents

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:24.880
over time, that we'll actually
build a better understanding

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:27.500
of what these brightly bound
books meant to the readers

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:31.750
who accessed them under the
occupation and under fascism.

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:33.550
Thanks.

00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:37.190
[ Applause ]

00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:38.490
&gt;&gt; Take some questions?

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:39.790
&gt;&gt; Sure, yeah.

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:45.100
I'll just have a sip of
water and then we can go.

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much for coming.

00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:55.120
I know it's the beginning of
Columbus Day weekend also.

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:57.510

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:25.680
&gt;&gt; I have tried really hard to
crack this Holroyd-Reece case,

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:26.980
British intelligence case.

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:31.350
I have a file number,
it's absolutely maddening.

00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:33.600
Long story short, there's
someone who worked at Tauchnitz

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:35.240
who Holroyd-Reece mentored.

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:37.920
And that guy ends up a prisoner
of war in England after the war.

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:39.630
So I've had his file.

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:43.040
In that, there's a mention,
please send this document

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:45.720
over to so-and-so's who has
the John Holroyd-Reece file,

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:47.020
with a file number.

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:51.740 position:56%
So I see that, and magic, okay, I
can do a Freedom of Information Act.

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:53.040
So I do that.

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.520
I put in two separate FIAs.

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:58.740
And I was told by the Brits
essentially something like,

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:01.480
we are sorry, we do not have
the requisite information.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:03.100
So that's tricky.

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:05.930
I've looked at a ton of
foreign office documents.

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:09.680
I have not looked at the monitoring
service, which is far later.

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:12.750
Currently there's a huge
project to look at the Ministry

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:14.650 position:56%
of Information documents in England.

00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:17.120
And Simon Elliot is
the head of that.

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:19.860
I've written people within
that to try find out, hey,

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:22.250
have you ever come across
the name of Holroyd-Reece.

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:25.030
I have lots also of other
circumstantial evidence,

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:31.250
places he was -- he was in Germany
right before Hitler came to power.

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:36.630
He magically knows to leave France
the day of the invasion of Poland.

00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:40.400 position:56%
I mean, there are -- he's in France.

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.180
I know he's in France when the
French officials don't know he's

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:44.480
in France.

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:49.680
There are just a lot of
weird things about him

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:52.600
that don't entirely add up.

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:54.770
[inaudible] Well, Delmar,
it's interesting.

00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:58.560
He knew Brendan Brackett,
who was the first head

00:39:58.560 --> 00:39:59.860
of Ministry of Information.

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:01.540
So I presume he knew Delmar.

00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:05.300
And in fact, this Tauchnitz
employee, who ends up a prisoner

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:07.790
of war, wanted to work for Delmar.

00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:13.410
And was not allowed to because
the Brits didn't trust him.

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:17.740
But I've done -- I also contacted
the scholars who wrote the books,

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:21.520
the Official Histories MI Five
and MI Six, to ask them, you know,

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:24.880 position:56%
a number of questions about, you
know, where do you suggest that I go

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.180
to look for this information.

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:28.100
And one of them said, look,
if you worked for MI Six

00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:32.680 position:56%
and had any ties there, it's a black
box, you're never going to find out.

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:35.510
You know, because they
don't out their people.

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:38.750
There's something -- if anyone
has ideas, send them to me.

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:41.460
Please email me, because I'm
happy to keep researching.

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:45.180
But August, maybe you'll have to
make that your personal project.

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:47.350
You can look up [inaudible].

00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:48.650
We'll talk later.

00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:35.850
So there are some -- there's
Smaller I think is his last name.

00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:38.540
I believe he used to
work for Penguin.

00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:39.840
You know what?

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:42.050 position:56%
I can look at the bibliography,
because there are a couple of things

00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:44.380
in here that I would recommend.

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:47.970
Certainly Albatross was not
the first person to think

00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:49.270
of doing paperbacks, right.

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:50.860
I mean, you have Reclam in Germany

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:53.920
and you have those little
yellow books that were out.

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:57.640
And you have plenty of cheap
books, paperbacks, in France also.

00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:02.240
I think what Albatross does
differently is they're producing --

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:05.040
they're trying to give that
aura of really high quality.

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:08.300 position:56%
A paperback is part of a collection.

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:12.960
It's part of a series,
an edited series.

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:16.820 position:56%
This idea of the [inaudible] comes
from -- there's an editorial policy.

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:19.450
So I think that's where
they're trying

00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:22.680
to make paperbacks
highbrow in a way.

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:25.120
But certainly they have
lots of precursors.

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:27.370
I'll show you, I'll look in there.

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:29.440 position:56%
Hans Smaller is his name, I believe.

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:33.310
Yeah? What's your name?

00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:35.510
Suzanne.

[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:48.910
I thought long and hard about that.

00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:51.960
And the one thing is it's
not an exact replica.

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:54.430
The other thing is
that I have documents

00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:57.860
from the Nazi files showing that --

00:42:57.860 --> 00:42:59.250
because they were looking
into copyright

00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:01.370
at the time for various reasons.

00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:06.050
And The Bird itself was
copyrighted in Luxembourg

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:09.880
through this publishing holding
company that owned Albatross.

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:15.180
So Albatross had investors
behind it that --

00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:20.140
so, in essence, this publishing
holding company went defunct.

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:21.870
And they were the holders
of the copyright.

00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:23.740
So I had a document
that told me that.

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:29.760
So that's -- [inaudible] I
haven't had any repercussions, no.

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:33.710
And we're also hitting that
point too where I checked on --

00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:36.340
for example, with James Joyce's
Ulysses, I was looking at that

00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:37.640
as a precedent, but
the James Joyce --

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:41.380
International James Joyce Society
has regulations on copyright.

00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:44.710
And in terms of the years when that
would have been designed and put

00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:48.900
out there initially, it's
apparently no longer an issue.

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:50.700
Yeah?

[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:23.420
But that was one of the things
that Holroyd-Reece said actually

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:25.490
in an interview in
the postwar world.

00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:27.770
He wanted to bring Albatross
back in the postwar world.

00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:30.530
And he had these grand plans of
doing an international Albatross.

00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:33.900
So Albatross would not only
do reprints in English,

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:37.080
but they would do translations
from English into other languages.

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:39.720
So stepping on a lot of toes,
right, of other publishers.

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:41.860
There are major copyright
issues there.

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:44.330 position:56%
But what he said in an interview was

00:44:44.330 --> 00:44:46.520
that he had chosen the name
Albatross because it carried

00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:49.600
across languages and was
instantly recognizable as a word,

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:52.250 position:56%
but also because -- exactly right --

00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:54.530
it was the protected
sort of species.

00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:57.110
[inaudible] the person who
comes up against the Albatross.

00:44:57.110 --> 00:44:59.200
And in fact, it was
Albatross in the end obviously

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:01.340
that it took the final hit.

00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:04.260
Susan, I do want to come back
to your question just briefly.

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:07.300
I mean, Yale was really
tight on copyright

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:08.820
for all kinds -- for everything.

00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:11.620
So they I believe also
had their lawyers

00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:13.900
or their people backcheck it.

00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:18.370
I've never been so proofed on,
you know, every last quote,

00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:20.880
everything had to have --
I had to have permissions

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:22.900
and show permissions
for every single thing.

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:24.550
Which is understandable.

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:27.430
[inaudible] Thank you.

00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:29.720
I was really happy
they went with it.

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:32.300
I was really excited about
the design and I brought two

00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:34.900
of the books down to try
to convince the editor

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:38.010
that he should consider it.

00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:45.390
[inaudible] Well, I used
mystery genre color on purpose.

00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:48.470
Although the research
is, you know, whatever,

00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:50.580
it's standard scholarly
research at one level,

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:52.820
I tried to write it like a story.

00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:55.200
It's a dense story
in parts, you know.

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:57.770
Because it's involving
looking at books.

00:45:57.770 --> 00:46:00.920
And, you know, for example,
there's a chapter where a part

00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:04.340
of Huxley's Beyond the
Mexique Bay was excised.

00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:06.650
And I talk about, you
know, there's that too.

00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:10.530
Most of the books that
did not happen with.

00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:14.100
But that particular book, he called
Hitler the king of the new stupid,

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:16.010
so that wasn't really going to fly.

00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:20.830
So there are chapters that deal
with things like that, you know,

00:46:20.830 --> 00:46:23.010
that have a little -- I'm
a literary scholar too.

00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:26.240
I'm a literary historian, as
well as a publishing historian.

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:29.980
But I tried to write it a little
like -- a little mystery in it.

00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:32.510
So yeah.

[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:06.850
So now Tauchnitz already had
quite strong distribution.

00:47:06.850 --> 00:47:10.300
In fact, in the Denuo munsha
[phonetic], which was a kind

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:14.740
of slightly intellectual journal
of the day, in the early '30s,

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:16.840
there was an ad saying, you
know, you can find Tauchnitz

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:19.970
on the smallest island
here to the, you know,

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:21.540
big urban centers and everything.

00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:26.480
So Tauchnitz had ready
started in that zone.

00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:29.890
But Kurt Enoch was the one who
worked promotion and distribution.

00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:35.530
And they did expand
the number of outlets.

00:47:35.530 --> 00:47:40.180
So they had -- in the '30s,
they had 6000 different outlets

00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:43.100
across continental Europe where
you could buy these books.

00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:47.230
Certainly railway stalls ready,
but they expanded the number.

00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:50.330
And then another thing they
did was to go more heavily

00:47:50.330 --> 00:47:51.630
into the school book market.

00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:54.190
So Tauchnitz always
had a student series.

00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:58.220
And the student series would
be often a portion of a book

00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:00.730
and it would have questions and
it would have some translation.

00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:02.970
It would have a glossary.

00:48:02.970 --> 00:48:06.690
What Albatross did was sort
of take that idea but throw

00:48:06.690 --> 00:48:09.080
out the structure and sort of say,

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:10.960
any of our books could
be school books, right.

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:15.290 position:56%
And you can see this -- I don't have
it in this particular slideshow.

00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:20.190
But I was doing some research in
Dutch this last year and they had

00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:26.840
in the Dutch book trade
newsletter, there was an ad for --

00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:31.520
just about school books, you
know, time to buy school books.

00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:32.820
And then there's, you
know, Albatross

00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:37.200
and Tauchnitz right
there, in 1934/1935.

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:41.140
So they're more radically -- and
this in fact is one of the things

00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:44.070
that -- this is one of the things

00:48:44.070 --> 00:48:49.020
that the Nazis liked
about Albatross.

00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:51.690
Was that they kind
of envied those --

00:48:51.690 --> 00:48:56.300 position:56%
during the war, they wanted to use
those distribution networks in order

00:48:56.300 --> 00:49:00.540
to develop their own series
in German but on that model

00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:03.150
of the continental book in German.

00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:05.470
You know, they want
that distribution.

00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:07.510
There are a couple chapters
on that too in the book.

00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:12.720
But the Nazis actually use
Albatross as a model, you know,

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:18.510
they co-oped them as it were.

00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:26.040
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:27.340
Interesting.

00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:33.750 position:56%
They didn't have to worry -- you're
saying communist leaning authors or?

00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:39.530
[inaudible] It's because
they're Anglo-American authors.

00:49:39.530 --> 00:49:43.580
So they purchased their
rights from British publishers

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:45.870
and from America publishers
basically.

00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:48.810
There were a couple of exceptions.

00:49:48.810 --> 00:49:51.990
There's a famous Swedish
author, whose name I'm blanking

00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:57.290
on right now, who wrote
the History of Capri.

00:49:57.290 --> 00:49:58.740
&gt;&gt; Axel Munthe.

00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:00.040
&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you.

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:02.060
So they had some Axel Munthe books.

00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:04.020
But those were written
in English I believe.

00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:05.320
&gt;&gt; Yes, they were.

00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:07.550
&gt;&gt; And so that's seen
as sort of an exception.

00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:11.900
I will say though, in
terms of like Steinbeck,

00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:15.450 position:56%
there's a Steinbeck story collection
right before the war starts.

00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:20.910
And they excised a
story about a gathering

00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:23.320
of communist leaning workers.

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:28.120
And they excised that
story from the volume.

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:31.690
So they were clearly,
you know, trying to do --

00:50:31.690 --> 00:50:34.750
I don't want to portray the
Albatross leaders either

00:50:34.750 --> 00:50:36.370
as these total radicals.

00:50:36.370 --> 00:50:38.440
They don't want to get
into so much trouble

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:40.320
that they can't sell
the books there anymore.

00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:44.390
But I was really surprised
that there was

00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:47.360
so little problem with censorship.

00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:51.690
The one book that really got
into the biggest trouble --

00:50:51.690 --> 00:50:53.750
well, DH Lawrence's
Lady Chatterley's Lover

00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:58.500
in English was suppressed not only
in German but also in English.

00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:02.080
But also what's the book?

00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:10.890 position:56%
Gray Wolf by HG Armstrong, who wrote
-- what's the famous book he wrote?

00:51:10.890 --> 00:51:13.290
Sorry, too many details in my
head today, I can't remember.

00:51:13.290 --> 00:51:19.950
But he had been -- he wrote a book
essentially about the Turks --

00:51:19.950 --> 00:51:23.860
and he'd been in World War
I but imprisoned in Turkey.

00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:29.310
And so he basically had a lot of
dirt on Ataturk and was writing

00:51:29.310 --> 00:51:31.300
about that liberally in
this particular book.

00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:33.590
And the Germans -- it goes
out on the market in Germany

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:38.420 position:56%
and then suddenly someone catches
wind of this, and they don't want --

00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:40.090
the foreign ambassador
to Turkey is like we have

00:51:40.090 --> 00:51:43.400 position:56%
to have this book suppressed because
we don't want to alienate the Turks.

00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:45.850
And so we want to keep them
as potential military allies.

00:51:45.850 --> 00:51:47.340
We can't afford to let
this book out there.

00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:49.290
But that's the one book, apart

00:51:49.290 --> 00:51:52.170 position:56%
from DH Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's
Lover, that I really saw

00:51:52.170 --> 00:51:58.660
that there was some kind of action
taken against it in an overt way.

00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:00.550
I mean, there are a
couple of other --

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:05.000
like Louis Golding's books end up
on the list of undesirable, harmful

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.970
and undesirable literature.

00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:09.270
He's Jewish, so.

00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:13.480
Anyway. Any other last questions?

00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:15.050
You've been lovely as an audience.

00:52:15.050 --> 00:52:16.470
It's just so fun to talk to people

00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:18.870
who know a little bit
also about the background.

00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:20.670
Thanks.

00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:24.750
