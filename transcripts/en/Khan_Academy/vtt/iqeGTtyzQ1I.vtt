00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.980
So in this diagram over here,
I have this big triangle.

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.000
And then I have all these
other little triangles

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.900
inside of this big triangle.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.000
And what I want to do is
see if I can figure out

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.780
the measure of this
angle right here.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.020
And we'll call
that measure theta.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.030
And they tell us a
few other things.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.010
You might have seen
this symbol before.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.150
That means that these
are right angles

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.010
or that they have a
measure of 90 degrees.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.040
So that's a 90-degree angle,
that is a 90-degree angle,

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.570
and that is a 90-degree
angle over there.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.914
And they also tell us that this
angle over here is 32 degrees.

00:00:29.914 --> 00:00:31.080
So let's see what we can do.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.100
And maybe we can solve this
in multiple different ways.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.600
That's what's really
fun about these

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.730
is there's multiple ways
to solve these problems.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.870
So if this angle
is theta, we have

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.970
theta is adjacent
to this green angle.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.470
And if you add them
together, you're

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.110
going to get this right angle.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.910
So this pink angle, theta,
plus this green angle

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.030
must be equal to 90 degrees.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.230
When you combine them,
you get a right angle.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.160
So you could call this
one-- its measure is

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.830
going to be 90 minus beta.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.840
And now we have three
angles in the triangle,

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.750
and we just have
to solve for theta.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.560
Because we know this angle
plus this angle plus this angle

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.970
are going to be
equal to 180 degrees.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:26.670
So you have 90 minus theta plus
90 degrees plus 32 degrees--

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.840
so I'm going to do that
in a different color--

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.370
is going to be equal
to 180 degrees.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.950
The sum of the measures of
the angle inside of a triangle

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.000
add up to 180 degrees.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.790
That's all we're
doing over here.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.090
And so let's see if we can
simplify this a little bit.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.130
So these two guys--
90 plus 90's going

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.310
to be 180, so you get
180 minus theta plus 32

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.960
is equal to 180 degrees.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.580
And then what else do we have?

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.930
We have 180 on both sides.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.750
We can subtract that
from both sides.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:00.830
So that cancels out.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.160
That goes to 0.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.190
And then you have negative theta
plus 32 degrees is equal to 0.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.070
You can add theta to both sides.

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.180
And you get 32 degrees
is equal to theta,

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.220
or theta is equal to 32 degrees.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.310
So it's going to actually be
the same measure as this angle

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.070
right over here.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.560
That's one way to
do the problem.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.900
There's other ways that we
could have done the problem.

00:02:25.147 --> 00:02:27.480
Actually, there's a ton of
ways we could have done this.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.340
We could have looked at
this big triangle over here.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.465
And we could've said, look.

00:02:30.465 --> 00:02:33.960
If this is 90 degrees over here,
this is 32 degrees over here,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.600
this angle up here
is going to be

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.760
180 minus 90 degrees
minus 32 degrees.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.350
Because they all have to
add up to 180 degrees.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.886
And I just kind of
skipped a step there.

00:02:47.886 --> 00:02:49.260
Actually, let me
not skip a step.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.080
Let me call this x.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.910
If we call the measure
of that angle x,

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.540
we would have x plus 90.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.230
I'm looking at the biggest
triangle in this diagram right

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:06.420
here. x plus 90 plus 32 is going
to be equal to 180 degrees.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.120
And so if you subtract 90
and 32 from both sides.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.970
So if you subtract 90 from
both sides, you get x plus 32

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.250
is equal to 90.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.210
And then if you subtract
32 from both sides,

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.485
you get x is equal to--
what is this-- 58 degrees.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.280
Fair enough.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.740
Now, what else
can we figure out?

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.814
Well, if this angle over here
is a right angle-- and I'm

00:03:33.814 --> 00:03:35.980
just redoing the problem
over again just to show you

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.940
that there's multiple
ways to get the answer.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.648
We were given that
this is a right angle.

00:03:39.648 --> 00:03:41.930
If that is 90 degrees,
then this angle over here

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.760
is supplementary to it, and
it also has to be 90 degrees.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.490
So then we have this angle
plus 90 degrees plus this angle

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.260
have to equal 180.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.910
Maybe we could call that y.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.600
So y plus 58 plus
90 is equal to 180.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.120
You can subtract
90 from both sides.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.890
Subtract 90 from both sides.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.240
This will become 90.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.585
Subtract 58 from both sides, you
get y is equal to 32 degrees.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.540
Well, if y is 32 degrees,
it is complementary.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.350
It is complementary to
this angle right over here.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.411
It is complementary-- let
me do that in a new color,

00:04:25.411 --> 00:04:26.160
not supplementary.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.380
It is complementary.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.480
It adds up to 90 degrees.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.350
It is complementary to
this angle over here.

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.610
We could call it z.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.820
So these two combined are
going to add up to 90 degrees,

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.750
or z is going to be
equal to 58 degrees.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.320
And now we're
inside the triangle

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.310
that we care about
to figure out theta,

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.450
theta that we've already figured
out earlier in this video.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.860
Well, this z is 58 degrees.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.510
If this angle over here is
90, then this one over here

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.180
is also going to be 90,
because they're supplementary.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.880
So you have 58 degrees.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.570
I wanted to do that
in that orange color.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.520
So if you have 58
degrees, so you

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.820
have 58 plus this 90,
plus 90, plus theta

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.110
now is going to be
equal to 180 degrees.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.060
You can subtract
90 from both sides.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.840
That becomes 90,
and then you have

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.980
58 plus theta is equal to 90.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.630
Subtract 58 from both sides.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.786
You get theta is equal
to 32 degrees again.

00:05:25.786 --> 00:05:27.160
And so we've got
the same answer.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.670
I just wanted to
do that, show you

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.980
that there are multiple
ways to do these problems.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.188
And as long as you're doing
things that are logically

00:05:33.188 --> 00:05:36.250
consistent, you're making
assumptions that you can make

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.520
and then logically
deducing step by step,

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.880
there's multiple ways to
get that right answer.
