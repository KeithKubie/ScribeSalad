history of psychology there's been a
struggle between what can we learn about

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:07.790
struggle between what can we learn about
 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.250
struggle between what can we learn about
psychological states in humans and

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260
psychological states in humans and
 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.890
psychological states in humans and
animals what can we learn about

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900
animals what can we learn about
 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.660
animals what can we learn about
psychological states by studying

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670
psychological states by studying
 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.099
psychological states by studying
conscious states and people and

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109
conscious states and people and
 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.810
conscious states and people and

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.269
unconscious states and so forth there's
always the struggle between animal human

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279
always the struggle between animal human
 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.290
always the struggle between animal human
conscious unconscious and the

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300
conscious unconscious and the
 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.589
conscious unconscious and the
behaviorist got rid of that because they

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599
behaviorist got rid of that because they
 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.689
behaviorist got rid of that because they
said it's you know we can't study

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699
said it's you know we can't study
 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.810
said it's you know we can't study
consciousness because it's not an

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820
consciousness because it's not an
 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.150
consciousness because it's not an
objective thing that you can measure so

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160
objective thing that you can measure so
 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.620
objective thing that you can measure so
they said what we should do is just

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630
they said what we should do is just
 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.110
they said what we should do is just
study observable behavior so they got

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120
study observable behavior so they got
 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.729
study observable behavior so they got
rid of consciousness then the cognitive

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739
rid of consciousness then the cognitive
 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.860
rid of consciousness then the cognitive
revolution came along and brought the

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870
revolution came along and brought the
 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.869
revolution came along and brought the
mind back to psychology but it didn't

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879
mind back to psychology but it didn't
 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.520

got rid of it brought back the mind is
 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.319
got rid of it brought back the mind is
an information processing device so when

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329

were thought of as information

were thought of as information
processing functions so you could learn

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549
processing functions so you could learn
 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.840
processing functions so you could learn
a lot about the way the brain processes
