00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.350
Vsauce! Kevin here.

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:07.710
Possessed witches, bedeviled dancing, crazed
laughter and a TV show that actually made

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.249
people sick. It’s not fiction. It’s mass
hysteria.

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:17.740
Clinical mass hysteria describes the spread
of a psychologically-manifested illness. One

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.529
or two people show signs of illness that they
blame on poison gas, genies or a ghost, and

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:29.519
suddenly others begin to show the same symptoms
-- or worse. Mass hysteria typically occurs

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.940
in high-stress situations among people in
confined areas like schools, factories or

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.039
small villages in Colonial Massachusetts.

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:45.350
Haha, I get it. Mass hysteria. Colonial Massachusetts.That's
very funny! Hey, Mike from Idea Channel here.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.059
Kevin, do you mind if I?

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:48.719
Oh go right ahead. Thanks, man!

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:56.390
The Salem Witch Trials of 1692 were a catastrophic
overreaction to mass psychogenic illness.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.780
Two young girls began having fits of screaming
and contortions - symptoms that commonly accompany

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.420
mass psychogenic illness - which spread to
other girls in the Salem Village. The town’s

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.890
verdict was that the devil had turned the
girls into witches, and panic consumed the

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.979
villagers until 20 people were tried and executed.
Modern theories for what caused the first

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.020
two girls’ symptoms range from eating rye
bread infected with fungus to contracting

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.360
bird-borne encephalitis lethargica. Doctors
found no evidence of injuries or explanations

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.670
for the girls’ behavior, and in the absence
of a scientific reason, the occult filled

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.340
the gap and what ensued was quite literally
a ‘witch hunt’.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.930
The bodies of over 400 people in Strasbourg,
France were infected by a plague of dancing

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.810
in 1518. During a time of extreme famine,
a woman began dancing in the middle of the

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.100
street, and by the end of the month hundreds
more had been consumed by the trance. Officials

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.659
believed the afflicted had to dance the sickness
out of their systems, so musicians were hired

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.829
to keep them moving and guildhalls were dedicated
to the frenzied dancing. Dozens died from

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:12.220
exhaustion, strokes and heart attacks, and
eventually the surviving dancers were loaded

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.320
onto wagons and taken to a shrine to beg for
mercy. Europe experienced dozens of dance

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.500
plagues throughout the Renaissance, with Southern
Italy seeing such an uptick in possessed dancing

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:32.090
that they blamed it on tarantula bites, a
syndrome fittingly dubbed “Tarantism.”

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.120
Laughter might be the best medicine, but it
can also be part of the disease. In 1962,

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.660
several villages in what is now Tanzania couldn’t
stop laughing. Three girls at a boarding school

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.220
started laughing uncontrollably and it spread
throughout the school, forcing it to close.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.900
The girls returned home where the laughter
spread to their neighbors and then to nearby

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.060
villages, eventually affecting thousands of
people. Of course, it’s physically impossible

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.280
to laugh continually for days due to the strain
on respiration, with the current world record

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.200
for longest laughter clocking in at just three
hours and six minutes. The afflicted separated

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.670
their bouts of laughter with crying, fainting
and exclamations of pain from rashes. And

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:23.860
rashes are never funny.
Mass hysteria continues today. In 2006, an

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.340
episode of a popular teen soap opera in Portugal,
called “Strawberries With Sugar,” caused

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:36.340
over 300 students from 14 schools to develop
symptoms depicted by characters on the show.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.780
The dizziness and difficulty breathing forced
some of the schools to close due to what is

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:49.800
now referred to as the Strawberries With Sugar virus, which coincided with students’ stress over fibal exlams.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.100
Don't you mean "final exams"? Yeah, what did I say? You said "fibal exlams".

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.160
Fibal exlams?

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.780
*hysterical laughter*

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.800
Those aren't words! Those aren't words!

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.660
And as always, thanks for watching.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.700
Special thanks to Mike from PBS Idea Channel for helping me out.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.900
Yeah man, thanks for having me.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.500
And all this talk of mass hysteria might make you wonder how it is that people start to believe these kinds of things,

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.000
And it has a lot to do with 'proof', which we're gonna go talk about over on Idea Channel right now.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
