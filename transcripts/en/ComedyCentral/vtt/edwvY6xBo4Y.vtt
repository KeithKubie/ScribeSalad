00:00:01.468 --> 00:00:02.969
(increasingly loud music)

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:04.270
- [Ari Shaffir] Anyone at
home and watching this,

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.072
the worst possible
scenario on drugs

00:00:06.072 --> 00:00:07.407
is that you don't get fucked up.

00:00:07.407 --> 00:00:09.075
(laughter)

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:12.479
(bass-heavy dance music)

00:00:24.724 --> 00:00:26.860 align:start size:84% position:16%
Welcome to This Is
Not Happening presents

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:27.694
One Crazy Night.

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:28.862
So this is what we do:

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:30.663 align:start size:84% position:16%
have a bunch of
comedians tell stories

00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:31.898
about a similar subject.

00:00:31.898 --> 00:00:33.299
So this is just One Crazy Night.

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:34.734
- [Announcer] Please,
put your hands together

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:36.036
for your host, Ari Shaffir.

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:38.304
(applause)

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.011
- Very nice.

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:49.149
How are you guys?

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.084 align:start size:84% position:16%
Thank you very much
for coming out.

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:52.919
Here's the deal.

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:55.555
I'm gonna talk about
drugs, for a second.

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:56.756
Yeah, you guys heard of 'em?

00:00:56.756 --> 00:00:57.724
Have you heard of 'em?

00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:59.426
They're amazing.

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:01.494
(laughter)

00:01:01.494 --> 00:01:03.129
Here's what I do to pass time.

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.698
In my free time, I like
to go to UFC events.

00:01:05.698 --> 00:01:07.434
My friend gets me free tickets.

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:08.568
He works for them, so as a Jew,

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:10.403
that's the exact right price.

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:11.638
(laughter)

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:14.174 align:start size:84% position:16%
That I'm willing to
pay every single time.

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:15.608
Any event really,
it doesn't matter.

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:16.810
Be like, "Hey, I got
two tickets to the,"

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.345
I'm like (screaming),
"Stop right there,

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:20.647
because I'm in."

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:22.482
(laughter)

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:25.652
So I go to these UFC events,
these cage fighting things

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:26.886
and if you ever watch 'em on TV,

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:28.721
it lasts like two
or three hours,

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:30.123
but if you actually
go to one of 'em,

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:32.258
it's like six and
half hours long

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:34.928
and that's way too long
not to be fucked up,

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:36.262
(laughter)

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:38.264 align:start size:84% position:16%
and beer costs so
much at those things,

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:40.834 align:start size:84% position:16%
so I figure you
can just take drugs

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:43.570 align:start size:88% position:13%
and you could smuggle
them inside your system.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.505
(laughter)

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:46.973
So I've taken all
sorts of stuff.

00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:49.309 align:start size:94% position:6%
I've taken ecstasy before
and mushrooms there

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:52.345
and acid, that was
probably the best one

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:53.780
(laughter)

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.181
and pot cookies.

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:56.416
I've taken those.

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:57.917 align:start size:88% position:13%
Those are my normal
ones, just pot cookies.

00:01:57.917 --> 00:02:02.222 align:start size:94% position:6%
So I wanna talk about
pot cookies for a second.

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:04.390
Here's the thing with
certain types of drugs.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.526 align:start size:84% position:16%
Alcohol, weed,
it's not that hard,

00:02:06.526 --> 00:02:08.194
like you smoke it
or you take a shot.

00:02:08.194 --> 00:02:10.096
Within five minutes,
you know how fucked up

00:02:10.096 --> 00:02:12.232
you're gonna get off that thing,

00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:14.834
but some drugs takes
like an hour to kick in

00:02:14.834 --> 00:02:16.836
and by then it's too late.

00:02:16.836 --> 00:02:19.205
(laughter)

00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:22.075
This ride is already in motion.

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:26.045 align:start size:97% position:3%
The fuckin' things have
come down, you're in, so ...

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:27.881
So is that Holy
Grail of drug use

00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:29.482 align:start size:84% position:16%
is taking the
exact right amount.

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:30.717
That's so hard to get.

00:02:30.717 --> 00:02:32.185
'Cause if you take too
much, you're fucked.

00:02:32.185 --> 00:02:33.286
If you don't take enough,
that's the worst thing

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:35.522
that can happen to you.

00:02:35.522 --> 00:02:37.824
The worst possible
scenario on drugs is

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:39.559
that you don't get fucked up.

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:40.793
(laughter)

00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:42.028
So you gotta figure
out how much to take,

00:02:42.028 --> 00:02:43.229
so what I would say is,

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:44.397 align:start size:84% position:16%
no matter what people
tell you to take,

00:02:44.397 --> 00:02:46.266
take like eight percent extra.

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:47.901
You wanna make sure.

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:49.202
So I took this pot cookie at

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:52.939
this UFC fight one time
and you ever start like

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:55.341 align:start size:88% position:13%
getting higher and
higher on a pot cookie?

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:56.709
Like you start blasting off?

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.745
(laughter)

00:02:58.745 --> 00:03:00.280 align:start size:84% position:16%
You know you have
like a range in mind

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.448
from here to here and
then you're just going

00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:03.816
boom, boom!

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:04.884
And you're like still going up.

00:03:04.884 --> 00:03:06.119
(laughter)

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:07.921
Just fuckin' shootin'
through the ceiling

00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:09.722 align:start size:84% position:16%
like Willy Wonka in
the Chocolate Factory.

00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:12.959
You know on the elevator and
it goes right through the top.

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.227
Where I was always like,

00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:15.161
"Why do you make the
ceiling out of glass

00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:17.830
if the elevator can do that?"

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.899
It's just a poor design from
an engineering standpoint,

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:21.401
but whatever.

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:22.635
So I was doing that.

00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:24.170
I was sittin' in my
chair at this UFC

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.207
fuckin' flyin' just sittin'
there enjoyin' it like this.

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:28.208
My friend kept turning to me

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:29.409
every once in awhile.

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:30.777 align:start size:84% position:16%
She'd be like, "Good
fights, right?"

00:03:30.777 --> 00:03:32.445
I'd go (grunting)

00:03:32.445 --> 00:03:34.948
(laughter)

00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:36.282
Like this is not my first time.

00:03:36.282 --> 00:03:37.217
I'm not gonna fuck up.

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:38.151
You gotta do better than that

00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:39.252
if you're gonna try to trick me.

00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:40.753
(laughter)

00:03:40.753 --> 00:03:42.288 align:start size:84% position:16%
Every like hour,
she'd say something,

00:03:42.288 --> 00:03:44.857
I'd just mutter back
at her like (grunting).

00:03:44.857 --> 00:03:45.792
(laughter)

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:47.026
Like, I'm just too good at this,

00:03:47.026 --> 00:03:48.962 align:start size:84% position:16%
but then after like
three hours, she goes,

00:03:48.962 --> 00:03:51.431 align:start size:97% position:3%
"Hey, do you wanna go get
some snacks from concession?"

00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:52.265
And I go,

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:54.434
"Fuck, yes."

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:56.703
(laughter)

00:03:58.838 --> 00:04:01.140
How did you know that?
How did you know that?

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.142
That's exactly what I wanna do.

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:05.545
You're in my mind, right now.

00:04:06.946 --> 00:04:08.147 align:start size:97% position:3%
So I'm like, "Let's go,
let's go to the concession."

00:04:08.147 --> 00:04:09.482 align:start size:88% position:13%
So we stood up, there's
like three steps up

00:04:09.482 --> 00:04:12.685 align:start size:84% position:16%
to the main level
and here's the thing:

00:04:12.685 --> 00:04:14.520
There's a different
level of fucked up,

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.688
no matter what you're on,

00:04:15.688 --> 00:04:17.490 align:start size:88% position:13%
alcohol, drugs, there's
a different level

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:21.594
from when you're sitting
to when you're standing,

00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:22.929
(laughter)

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:24.764
and you think those two
things would be related,

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:27.000 align:start size:84% position:16%
but they're completely
not related.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.468
Like, when you're sittin' down,

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:30.570 align:start size:97% position:3%
you're like, "Okay, I was
pretty bad there for awhile."

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.172
(laughter)

00:04:33.172 --> 00:04:34.340
I think I'm coasting now.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.942
I think we're okay.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.945
I was close to barfing.

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:42.682
When you're like this,
when you're like ...

00:04:42.682 --> 00:04:45.151
(laughter)

00:04:45.151 --> 00:04:46.352
That's always a sign.

00:04:46.352 --> 00:04:47.153 align:start size:88% position:13%
If you ever see somebody
doin' that at a bar,

00:04:47.153 --> 00:04:48.388
just goin like this ...

00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:49.789
(laughter)

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:52.825 align:start size:88% position:13%
Just move away from that
person, immediately.

00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:54.427
So you're like, "Okay,
I think I'm good now.

00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:55.862
It's been like an hour.
I'm in control, yeah.

00:04:55.862 --> 00:04:57.630
I'm in control. Let's do
this," and you stand up,

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.833
you're like, "Oh fuck no.
I'm not in control at all.

00:05:00.833 --> 00:05:02.602
The drug is in control."

00:05:02.602 --> 00:05:04.671
It was gettin' really bad

00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:06.439
to the point where I had
to have a talk with myself

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:07.874
in my brain.

00:05:07.874 --> 00:05:09.108
Like a full discussion.

00:05:09.108 --> 00:05:10.877 align:start size:84% position:16%
That's when you know
shit's going bad.

00:05:10.877 --> 00:05:12.111
When your brain says,

00:05:12.111 --> 00:05:13.379
"Ari, I need to talk
to you for a minute."

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:16.282
(laughter)

00:05:16.282 --> 00:05:18.418
I was like, "What?

00:05:18.418 --> 00:05:19.552
What's happening, brain?

00:05:19.552 --> 00:05:21.054
What's a matter?"

00:05:21.054 --> 00:05:22.755
'Cause I stood up, we went
right out to the front line.

00:05:22.755 --> 00:05:24.023 align:start size:84% position:16%
We got right into
the concession line.

00:05:24.023 --> 00:05:25.224
It was like right after
a fight, so it was like

00:05:25.224 --> 00:05:26.492
perfect timing.

00:05:26.492 --> 00:05:27.694
We got in, people
got in behind me,

00:05:27.694 --> 00:05:29.028 align:start size:84% position:16%
then I started gettin'
real light headed.

00:05:29.028 --> 00:05:29.962
My brain's like,

00:05:29.962 --> 00:05:31.197
"Let me tell you something,"

00:05:31.197 --> 00:05:32.365 align:start size:88% position:13%
and I was like, "What
do you have to tell me?"

00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:33.599
(laughter)

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:36.235
"Like, you only
give me bad news.

00:05:37.236 --> 00:05:39.472
Is everything totally cool?"

00:05:39.472 --> 00:05:40.673
And brain was like,

00:05:40.673 --> 00:05:43.176 align:start size:88% position:13%
"Listen Ari, here's
what's going to happen:

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:44.844
You're going to pass out."

00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:46.879
(laughter)

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:50.083 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I was like,
"What! No fuckin' way!

00:05:50.083 --> 00:05:53.786
No, I'm not doin' that in
a concession line at a UFC.

00:05:53.786 --> 00:05:54.987
No, I'm not doin' that.

00:05:54.987 --> 00:05:56.189
We gotta be another option.

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:57.623 align:start size:84% position:16%
We gotta figure
somethin' else out.

00:05:57.623 --> 00:05:59.092 align:start size:88% position:13%
We're not fuckin'
passin' out right here.

00:05:59.092 --> 00:06:00.693
No, no.

00:06:00.693 --> 00:06:02.128
And my brain was like,

00:06:02.128 --> 00:06:03.296
"Shh."

00:06:03.296 --> 00:06:06.332
(laughter)

00:06:06.332 --> 00:06:07.166
"Shh.

00:06:10.136 --> 00:06:11.304
It's okay, baby.

00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:12.138
It's okay.

00:06:14.006 --> 00:06:17.176
Listen, fighting it,
that's not gonna help.

00:06:17.176 --> 00:06:19.245
You're going to pass out.

00:06:19.245 --> 00:06:21.114
So let me prepare you."

00:06:21.114 --> 00:06:23.483 align:start size:88% position:13%
And I was like,
"Alright cool, I guess."

00:06:23.483 --> 00:06:24.984
But what I gotta do,
so my brain was like,

00:06:24.984 --> 00:06:27.587 align:start size:94% position:6%
"You're gonna fall asleep.
You're gonna wake up

00:06:27.587 --> 00:06:31.724
in about twenty five
seconds on the floor

00:06:31.724 --> 00:06:33.926 align:start size:97% position:3%
and there's gonna be a bunch
of people staring at you.

00:06:33.926 --> 00:06:36.529
(laughter)

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:40.566
And you're prolly gonna feel
really, really embarrassed.

00:06:40.566 --> 00:06:44.237
I want you to get up,
and walk away rapidly."

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:46.472
(laughter)

00:06:49.342 --> 00:06:52.211 align:start size:88% position:13%
And I was like, alright,
I can handle that.

00:06:52.211 --> 00:06:54.213
If that's my future,
that's not so bad.

00:06:54.213 --> 00:06:55.581
I can deal with that.

00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:57.250
So I'm in this concession line,

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.452
everything's gettin' real light,

00:06:59.452 --> 00:07:00.920
it's just gettin' like,

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.822 align:start size:97% position:3%
I don't know if you guys
have ever passed out before?

00:07:02.822 --> 00:07:04.490
You don't black out. I'm
not tryin' to be racist,

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:05.558
but you don't black out.

00:07:05.558 --> 00:07:06.759
(laughter)

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:07.693
Everything gets white
and you white out,

00:07:07.693 --> 00:07:09.328
and then you start sweating,

00:07:09.328 --> 00:07:11.264
like I'm sittin' there, it's
getting whiter and whiter.

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:12.465
Everything. You're
like pouring sweat.

00:07:12.465 --> 00:07:13.966
My t-shirt's like soaked,

00:07:13.966 --> 00:07:16.235
and then the last thing
to go is your hearing.

00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:17.637
It just starts ringing,

00:07:17.637 --> 00:07:19.772 align:start size:97% position:3%
it starts going (increasingly
high pitched humming),

00:07:19.772 --> 00:07:22.742
like that, so I could
barely hear anything,

00:07:22.742 --> 00:07:23.843
I could barely see.

00:07:23.843 --> 00:07:25.144
I'm startin' to go and then,

00:07:25.144 --> 00:07:26.579 align:start size:84% position:16%
right before I
completely shut off,

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:30.817 align:start size:97% position:3%
the last guy in the
concession line got his stuff

00:07:30.817 --> 00:07:32.752
and he like, he left.

00:07:32.752 --> 00:07:35.521
So there, just me
and the counter

00:07:36.656 --> 00:07:39.358 align:start size:84% position:16%
and so I just lunged
at the counter

00:07:39.358 --> 00:07:41.093
and put my hand on it

00:07:41.093 --> 00:07:43.262
and then I locked my elbow

00:07:44.363 --> 00:07:45.565
and then I just went out.

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:46.966
I was just like ...

00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:49.235
(laughter)

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:52.438
(applause)

00:07:55.842 --> 00:07:56.909
I can't see.

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:58.010
I can't hear.

00:07:58.945 --> 00:08:01.047
I don't know what's up or down.

00:08:01.047 --> 00:08:02.448
Every part of my body is asleep,

00:08:02.448 --> 00:08:03.783
every part,

00:08:03.783 --> 00:08:04.817
except my elbow.

00:08:04.817 --> 00:08:06.385
That's the only thing

00:08:06.385 --> 00:08:07.553
keepin' it all together.

00:08:07.553 --> 00:08:08.921 align:start size:84% position:16%
My elbow's like photo
baggage's buddy,

00:08:08.921 --> 00:08:11.591 align:start size:81% position:19%
like, I'll take
it from here, sir,

00:08:11.591 --> 00:08:14.460
and pretend this isn't
about homosexuality.

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:18.030 align:start size:94% position:6%
So I'm like this, for
real, like 20, 25 seconds.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:19.232
Until the first thing that

00:08:19.232 --> 00:08:21.100 align:start size:81% position:19%
starts coming back
is my hearing.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.368
It was like the ringing stopped

00:08:22.368 --> 00:08:23.803
and the first thing I hear

00:08:23.803 --> 00:08:26.239 align:start size:97% position:3%
was the guy behind the
concession stand just going,

00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:27.073
"Sir!

00:08:28.474 --> 00:08:29.308
Sir!

00:08:29.308 --> 00:08:31.077
What can I get you?"

00:08:31.077 --> 00:08:33.980
(laughter)

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.449
I was just like, "You can
get me like one minute.

00:08:36.449 --> 00:08:37.483
That's what I need personally."

00:08:37.483 --> 00:08:39.752
(laughter)

00:08:43.256 --> 00:08:45.725 align:start size:94% position:6%
And then I was able to
like slowly get my footing

00:08:45.725 --> 00:08:48.194 align:start size:94% position:6%
and like the sweating
started to like slow down,

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:49.662 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I looked at
her and I was like,

00:08:49.662 --> 00:08:51.797 align:start size:97% position:3%
"Okay, now like four popcorns
and six pieces of pizza,"

00:08:51.797 --> 00:08:53.566
I said, "Immediately."

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:56.435
And then we'll start talking.

00:08:56.435 --> 00:08:58.304
And I was able to like
completely come back.

00:08:58.304 --> 00:09:00.606
And I was like, "Whoa."

00:09:00.606 --> 00:09:01.874
(deep sigh)

00:09:01.874 --> 00:09:03.109
And then I looked
over at my friend

00:09:03.109 --> 00:09:04.043 align:start size:84% position:16%
and my friend was just
standing next to me

00:09:04.043 --> 00:09:05.778
going like this, like ...

00:09:05.778 --> 00:09:08.047
(laughter)

00:09:13.853 --> 00:09:15.888
And I was like, "What?"

00:09:15.888 --> 00:09:17.557
(laughter)

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:20.826 align:start size:97% position:3%
And she goes, "What. What?
No! You don't get to ask that.

00:09:20.826 --> 00:09:23.629
Like you didn't do anything
outta the ordinary there.

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:25.631
What the fuck was that?"

00:09:27.033 --> 00:09:29.201 align:start size:94% position:6%
'Cause she didn't even
know I had taken anything.

00:09:29.201 --> 00:09:30.703
So to her, for the
last three hours,

00:09:30.703 --> 00:09:32.138
I had just been boring.

00:09:32.138 --> 00:09:33.706
(laughter)

00:09:33.706 --> 00:09:35.174 align:start size:97% position:3%
And then I got to the front
of the concession line

00:09:35.174 --> 00:09:39.378 align:start size:97% position:3%
and started doing the
Twizler dance outta nowhere.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.182
She's like, "What was that?"

00:09:43.182 --> 00:09:45.885
And I was like, "That? That
was someone who just took

00:09:45.885 --> 00:09:48.154
the right amount of drugs."

00:09:50.323 --> 00:09:51.791
That's what I was like.

00:09:51.791 --> 00:09:53.059
(applause)

00:09:53.059 --> 00:09:55.494 line:0%
