00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:43.370
A&amp;Rs like what kind of operations can
 

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:46.780
A&amp;Rs like what kind of operations can
block our main thread well probably the

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:46.790
block our main thread well probably the
 

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:50.110
block our main thread well probably the
most common ones and our network and

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:50.120
most common ones and our network and
 

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.780
most common ones and our network and
disk operations also called as IO now

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:52.790
disk operations also called as IO now
 

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:55.480
disk operations also called as IO now
networks are congested remote servers

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:55.490
networks are congested remote servers
 

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:58.600
networks are congested remote servers
are slow so can be your flash drives or

00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:58.610
are slow so can be your flash drives or
 

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:01.240
are slow so can be your flash drives or
the file system can be busy with other

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:01.250
the file system can be busy with other
 

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:03.640
the file system can be busy with other
operations and so as developers we

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:03.650
operations and so as developers we
 

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:06.130
operations and so as developers we
should never never do network or disk

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:06.140
should never never do network or disk
 

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.650
should never never do network or disk
operations on the main thread but you

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:08.660
operations on the main thread but you
 

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:11.080
operations on the main thread but you
know I just prepared two code examples

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:11.090
know I just prepared two code examples
 

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:13.180
know I just prepared two code examples
to show you that it's not always easy to

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:13.190
to show you that it's not always easy to
 

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:15.100
to show you that it's not always easy to
do the right thing even though if I'll

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:15.110
do the right thing even though if I'll
 

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:18.010
do the right thing even though if I'll
probably agree with me we can still make

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:18.020
probably agree with me we can still make
 

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.590
probably agree with me we can still make
mistakes so here for example in my

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:20.600
mistakes so here for example in my
 

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.590
mistakes so here for example in my
activity on create I decided oh I'm just

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:23.600
activity on create I decided oh I'm just
 

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.360
activity on create I decided oh I'm just
gonna prepare this shirt preferences

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:25.370
gonna prepare this shirt preferences
 

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:26.800
gonna prepare this shirt preferences
object to use later I'm just gonna

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:26.810
object to use later I'm just gonna
 

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:29.170
object to use later I'm just gonna
create it and and not do anything with

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:29.180
create it and and not do anything with
 

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:31.180
create it and and not do anything with
it right now and then somewhere else in

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:31.190
it right now and then somewhere else in
 

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:33.100
it right now and then somewhere else in
my app probably on a background thread I

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:33.110
my app probably on a background thread I
 

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:34.810
my app probably on a background thread I
will actually get some information like

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:34.820
will actually get some information like
 

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.460
will actually get some information like
read an integer or a string or whatever

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:36.470
read an integer or a string or whatever
 

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:39.370
read an integer or a string or whatever
and I thought okay that's good I will I

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:39.380
and I thought okay that's good I will I
 

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:41.500
and I thought okay that's good I will I
will not be doing disk operations on a

the moment you create them and so that's

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:52.160
the moment you create them and so that's
 

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.950
the moment you create them and so that's
that's actually the line of code that

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:53.960
that's actually the line of code that
 

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.800
that's actually the line of code that
does disk access so I was wrong it's

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:56.810
does disk access so I was wrong it's
 

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:59.650
does disk access so I was wrong it's
it's not always obvious and let me show

00:19:59.650 --> 00:19:59.660
it's not always obvious and let me show
 

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:02.110
it's not always obvious and let me show
you another even trickier example so

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:02.120
you another even trickier example so
 

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:05.530
you another even trickier example so
here I'm doing some hypothetical network

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:05.540
here I'm doing some hypothetical network
 

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.960
here I'm doing some hypothetical network
operations in my app so let's say I want

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:07.970
operations in my app so let's say I want
 

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:09.730
operations in my app so let's say I want
to check if my intent contains some kind

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:09.740
to check if my intent contains some kind
 

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:12.670
to check if my intent contains some kind
of URL so I'm comparing the two and then

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:12.680
of URL so I'm comparing the two and then
 

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.830
of URL so I'm comparing the two and then
I say I want to open connection to that

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:14.840
I say I want to open connection to that
 

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.320
I say I want to open connection to that
URL I'm gonna save the headers to some

variable for later use and then I

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:20.300
variable for later use and then I
 

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:21.850
variable for later use and then I
actually open an input stream and

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:21.860
actually open an input stream and
 

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:24.160
actually open an input stream and
finally finally in the end I am reading

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:24.170
finally finally in the end I am reading
 

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:26.950
finally finally in the end I am reading
bytes from the network so this is a

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:26.960
bytes from the network so this is a
 

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.750
bytes from the network so this is a
pretty complicated a P I to be honest

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:28.760
pretty complicated a P I to be honest
 

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.880
pretty complicated a P I to be honest
and how am I as a developer is supposed

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:30.890
and how am I as a developer is supposed
 

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:32.950
and how am I as a developer is supposed
to know if that first line open

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:32.960
to know if that first line open
 

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.990
to know if that first line open
connection creates the network requests

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:35.000
connection creates the network requests
 

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.590
connection creates the network requests
and actually blocks my thread or is it

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:38.600
and actually blocks my thread or is it
 

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.170
and actually blocks my thread or is it
the last one where I actually request to

the last one where I actually request to
 

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.630
the last one where I actually request to
read you know bytes of data to actually

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:43.640
read you know bytes of data to actually
 

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.930
read you know bytes of data to actually
read them into my application or is it

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:46.940
read them into my application or is it
 

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:49.480
read them into my application or is it
something else and well it's not obvious

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:49.490
something else and well it's not obvious
 

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:52.270
something else and well it's not obvious
actually in this example this line of

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:52.280
actually in this example this line of
 

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.490
actually in this example this line of
code will perform a network operation

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:54.500
code will perform a network operation
 

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.350
code will perform a network operation
like the first time I'm trying to access

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:56.360
like the first time I'm trying to access
 

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.140
like the first time I'm trying to access
headers only then will the connection be

00:20:59.140 --> 00:20:59.150
headers only then will the connection be
 

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:00.850
headers only then will the connection be
opened and the first bytes will be read

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:00.860
opened and the first bytes will be read
 

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:03.790
opened and the first bytes will be read
and so as a developer again I failed I

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:03.800
and so as a developer again I failed I
 

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:07.420
and so as a developer again I failed I
would I didn't know which operation does

would I didn't know which operation does
 

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:11.080
would I didn't know which operation does
the network access but fun fact on an

all this because I want to convince you
that just as developers we cannot know

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:27.170
that just as developers we cannot know

that just as developers we cannot know
everything and you will use libraries

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:28.850
everything and you will use libraries
 

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:30.460
everything and you will use libraries
that you don't you're not familiar with

that you don't you're not familiar with
 

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:33.280
that you don't you're not familiar with

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:33.290
or other api's and that's why I suggest
 

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:35.170
or other api's and that's why I suggest
you use strict mode for your debug

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:35.180
you use strict mode for your debug
 

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:37.450
you use strict mode for your debug
builds why why you develop your apps our

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:37.460
builds why why you develop your apps our
 

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:39.370

strict mode is an API that existed on
Android for a long time and it's pretty

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:42.080
Android for a long time and it's pretty
 

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.080
Android for a long time and it's pretty
easy to set up you just set a thread

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:44.090
easy to set up you just set a thread
 

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:46.570
easy to set up you just set a thread
policy in your application on create or

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:46.580
policy in your application on create or
 

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:49.690
policy in your application on create or
in your activity on create and you tell

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:49.700
in your activity on create and you tell
 

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:51.730
in your activity on create and you tell
strict mode I want you to detect all

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:51.740
strict mode I want you to detect all
 

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:53.830

disk operations in my application on
 

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:56.230
disk operations in my application on
this thread and I also want you to

this thread and I also want you to
 

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.870
this thread and I also want you to
detect network operations and then you

00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880
detect network operations and then you
 

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.000
detect network operations and then you
tell strict mode what you want to

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:01.010
tell strict mode what you want to
 

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:03.490
tell strict mode what you want to
to be so first of all of course we want

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:03.500
to be so first of all of course we want
 

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.530
to be so first of all of course we want
to see it in logs so we can debug it

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:05.540
to see it in logs so we can debug it
 

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:08.350
to see it in logs so we can debug it
later but you know logs are easy to miss

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:08.360
later but you know logs are easy to miss
 

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.870
later but you know logs are easy to miss
like log cut can be noisy sometimes so

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:10.880
like log cut can be noisy sometimes so
 

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.580
like log cut can be noisy sometimes so
for my debug builds I'm also gonna go

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:12.590
for my debug builds I'm also gonna go
 

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:14.350
for my debug builds I'm also gonna go
and say penalty death which will

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:14.360
and say penalty death which will
 

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.450
and say penalty death which will
actually crash my app whenever I do the

actually crash my app whenever I do the
 

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:18.100
actually crash my app whenever I do the
wrong thing and access network or disk

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:18.110
wrong thing and access network or disk
 

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:20.470
wrong thing and access network or disk
on the main thread not like I said you

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.480
on the main thread not like I said you
 

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.030
on the main thread not like I said you
don't want to do any of that in your

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:22.040
don't want to do any of that in your
 

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.710
don't want to do any of that in your
production release bills because you

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:23.720
production release bills because you
 

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.050
production release bills because you
don't want your users app to crash okay

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:26.060
don't want your users app to crash okay
 

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:28.270
don't want your users app to crash okay
so now I go back and run my code that I

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:28.280
so now I go back and run my code that I
 

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.670
so now I go back and run my code that I
just showed you and look at my logs

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:30.680
just showed you and look at my logs
 

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.830
just showed you and look at my logs
because my app obviously crashed and I

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:32.840
because my app obviously crashed and I
 

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.200
because my app obviously crashed and I
see the exact cause and I can go and

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:35.210
see the exact cause and I can go and
 

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:37.120
see the exact cause and I can go and
debug that so I can see there was a

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:37.130
debug that so I can see there was a
 

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:39.910
debug that so I can see there was a
strict mode discrete violation and I can

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:39.920
strict mode discrete violation and I can
 

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.980
strict mode discrete violation and I can
see in the stack trace the culprit is

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:41.990
see in the stack trace the culprit is
 

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:44.350
see in the stack trace the culprit is
yeah it's the gut default preferences

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:44.360
yeah it's the gut default preferences
 

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.690
yeah it's the gut default preferences

sir great this lets me actually go and

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:49.700
sir great this lets me actually go and

sir great this lets me actually go and
fix that ok so we covered network and

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:52.700
fix that ok so we covered network and
 

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:54.160
fix that ok so we covered network and
disk operations and how to catch them

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:54.170
disk operations and how to catch them
 

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:56.440
disk operations and how to catch them
you know sometimes you don't even need

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:56.450
you know sometimes you don't even need
 

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:59.830
you know sometimes you don't even need
to hit remote servers or disk to cause a

00:22:59.830 --> 00:22:59.840
to hit remote servers or disk to cause a
 

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.020
to hit remote servers or disk to cause a
long-running operation all it takes is

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:02.030
long-running operation all it takes is
 

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:04.090
long-running operation all it takes is
literally just calculating something for

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:04.100
literally just calculating something for
 

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:06.640
literally just calculating something for
a long time doing a very long loop and

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:06.650
a long time doing a very long loop and
 

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:08.860
a long time doing a very long loop and
something like that so here in this

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:08.870
something like that so here in this
 

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:11.440
something like that so here in this
example this is a sample sudo cool game

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:11.450
example this is a sample sudo cool game
 

00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:13.990
example this is a sample sudo cool game
and how it works is when the user opens

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:14.000
and how it works is when the user opens
 

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.350
and how it works is when the user opens
the app the Sudoku board is actually

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:17.360
the app the Sudoku board is actually
 

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.600
the app the Sudoku board is actually
generated in memory it's not read from

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:19.610
generated in memory it's not read from
 

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:21.430
generated in memory it's not read from
this it's not pulled down from a server

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.440
this it's not pulled down from a server
 

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.350
this it's not pulled down from a server
somewhere and there's actually a pretty

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360
somewhere and there's actually a pretty
 

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.930
somewhere and there's actually a pretty
long complex calculation happening to

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:25.940
long complex calculation happening to
 

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:27.970
long complex calculation happening to
show that first board to the user so

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:27.980
show that first board to the user so
 

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:30.400
show that first board to the user so
they can play it and so it's just one

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:30.410
they can play it and so it's just one
 

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:32.530
they can play it and so it's just one
call generate board and as you can see

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:32.540
call generate board and as you can see
 

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:34.360
call generate board and as you can see
on a on a slow device this could cause

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:34.370
on a on a slow device this could cause
 

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:35.830
on a on a slow device this could cause
an INR because I'm doing that on the

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:35.840
an INR because I'm doing that on the
 

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.350
an INR because I'm doing that on the
main thread so first of all how am I

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:38.360
main thread so first of all how am I
 

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.060
main thread so first of all how am I
supposed to know as a developer that

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:40.070
supposed to know as a developer that
 

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:43.090
supposed to know as a developer that
this call generated can be long well I

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:43.100
this call generated can be long well I
 

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.920
this call generated can be long well I
really suggest that you use Android

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:44.930
really suggest that you use Android
 

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:48.010
really suggest that you use Android
profiler regularly if you ever suspect

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:48.020
profiler regularly if you ever suspect
 

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:49.510
profiler regularly if you ever suspect
there is any performance problem in your

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520
there is any performance problem in your
 

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:52.060
there is any performance problem in your
app so here for example I took a CPU

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:52.070
app so here for example I took a CPU
 

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:54.280
app so here for example I took a CPU
trace of the method generate board in

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:54.290
trace of the method generate board in
 

00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:55.990
trace of the method generate board in
the Android profiler and I can

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:56.000
the Android profiler and I can
 

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.970
the Android profiler and I can
immediately see that it's a complex

00:23:57.970 --> 00:23:57.980
immediately see that it's a complex
 

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:00.280
immediately see that it's a complex
recursive call that takes a long long

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:00.290
recursive call that takes a long long
 

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:03.250
recursive call that takes a long long
time to finish and so now I know I

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:03.260
time to finish and so now I know I
 

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:04.570
time to finish and so now I know I

thing in the end or Android profiler

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:08.570
thing in the end or Android profiler
 

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:10.030

that we just released in the cannery

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:10.040
that we just released in the cannery
 

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:13.090
that we just released in the cannery
today now you can debug and profile your

generate board call what can I do with

00:24:20.919 --> 00:24:20.929
generate board call what can I do with
 

00:24:20.929 --> 00:24:21.100
generate board call what can I do with
it

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:21.110
it
 

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:25.930
it
so strictmode has this has this method

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:25.940
so strictmode has this has this method
 

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:28.690
so strictmode has this has this method
of telling it that a call can be slow so

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:28.700
of telling it that a call can be slow so
 

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:32.650
of telling it that a call can be slow so
here as a developer is the person who

here as a developer is the person who
created this pseudo algorithm I will

00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:35.030

application or hit some other problem
that blocks your main thread and these

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:49.580
that blocks your main thread and these
 

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:51.669
that blocks your main thread and these
are very tricky to debug

00:25:51.669 --> 00:25:51.679
are very tricky to debug
 

00:25:51.679 --> 00:25:54.549
are very tricky to debug
however Android vitals does give you

00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:54.559
however Android vitals does give you
 

00:25:54.559 --> 00:25:57.430
however Android vitals does give you
some information that will help you

00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:57.440
some information that will help you
 

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.350
some information that will help you
debug these kinds of problems so if you

00:25:59.350 --> 00:25:59.360
debug these kinds of problems so if you
 

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:01.390
debug these kinds of problems so if you
open any an ANR in the vital in the

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:01.400
open any an ANR in the vital in the
 

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.370
open any an ANR in the vital in the
vitals console we actually provide you

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:03.380
vitals console we actually provide you
 

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:05.590
vitals console we actually provide you
with the trace files pulled from the

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:05.600
with the trace files pulled from the
 

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.200
with the trace files pulled from the
devices that suffered from these ANR's

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:08.210
devices that suffered from these ANR's
 

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:10.659
devices that suffered from these ANR's
and so you can look at thread States and

00:26:10.659 --> 00:26:10.669
and so you can look at thread States and
 

00:26:10.669 --> 00:26:12.520
and so you can look at thread States and
see if they were blocked waiting on any

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:12.530
see if they were blocked waiting on any
 

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:14.440
see if they were blocked waiting on any
resource to become available and we even

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:14.450
resource to become available and we even
 

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:16.419
resource to become available and we even
highlight the problems that we think

00:26:16.419 --> 00:26:16.429
highlight the problems that we think
 

00:26:16.429 --> 00:26:20.560
highlight the problems that we think
might be happening in this trace okay

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:20.570
might be happening in this trace okay
 

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:22.090
might be happening in this trace okay
and the last thing I want to mention is

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:22.100
and the last thing I want to mention is
 

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:24.070
and the last thing I want to mention is
as a cause of ANR's

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:24.080
as a cause of ANR's
 

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.500
as a cause of ANR's
is slow broadcast receiver handling now

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:26.510
is slow broadcast receiver handling now
 

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:27.350
is slow broadcast receiver handling now
not

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360
not
 

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.840
not
every developer realizes that if you set

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:29.850
every developer realizes that if you set
 

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:31.310
every developer realizes that if you set
a broadcast receiver in your Android

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:31.320
a broadcast receiver in your Android
 

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.860
a broadcast receiver in your Android
manifest and then it gets cold that the

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:33.870
manifest and then it gets cold that the
 

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:35.660
manifest and then it gets cold that the
own receive method actually happens on

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:35.670
own receive method actually happens on
 

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:37.010
own receive method actually happens on
the main thread and you you're not

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:37.020
the main thread and you you're not
 

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:38.990
the main thread and you you're not
supposed to perform any long-running

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:39.000
supposed to perform any long-running
 

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.330
supposed to perform any long-running
operations in it and there's a timeout

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:41.340
operations in it and there's a timeout
 

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:43.760
operations in it and there's a timeout
about about 10 seconds that the system

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:43.770
about about 10 seconds that the system
 

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:45.919
about about 10 seconds that the system
will allow this method to run and then

00:26:45.919 --> 00:26:45.929
will allow this method to run and then
 

00:26:45.929 --> 00:26:49.789
will allow this method to run and then
it will kill your process and so you

00:26:49.789 --> 00:26:49.799
it will kill your process and so you
 

00:26:49.799 --> 00:26:51.940
it will kill your process and so you
know sometimes though whenever you

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:51.950
know sometimes though whenever you
 

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:54.200
know sometimes though whenever you
you're using a broadcast receiver maybe

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:54.210
you're using a broadcast receiver maybe
 

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:56.690
you're using a broadcast receiver maybe
to show a notification to the user maybe

00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:56.700
to show a notification to the user maybe
 

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.789
to show a notification to the user maybe
you still need a little piece of data

00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:58.799
you still need a little piece of data
 

00:26:58.799 --> 00:27:01.690
you still need a little piece of data
maybe from the disk like reading some

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:01.700
maybe from the disk like reading some
 

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.010
maybe from the disk like reading some
name or profile picture to show in a

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:04.020
name or profile picture to show in a
 

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:05.900
name or profile picture to show in a
notification so you actually need to do

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:05.910
notification so you actually need to do
 

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:08.150
notification so you actually need to do
that disk access so what can you do in

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:08.160
that disk access so what can you do in
 

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:11.539
that disk access so what can you do in
this case now broadcast receivers have

00:27:11.539 --> 00:27:11.549
this case now broadcast receivers have
 

00:27:11.549 --> 00:27:13.460
this case now broadcast receivers have
this method called go acing it's

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:13.470
this method called go acing it's
 

00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:15.500
this method called go acing it's
basically a way to tell the broadcast

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:15.510
basically a way to tell the broadcast
 

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:17.870
basically a way to tell the broadcast
receiver from the on receive method that

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:17.880
receiver from the on receive method that
 

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.820
receiver from the on receive method that
you need to do some longer running

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:19.830
you need to do some longer running
 

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:22.159
you need to do some longer running
operation and then you spin up your a

00:27:22.159 --> 00:27:22.169
operation and then you spin up your a
 

00:27:22.169 --> 00:27:23.960
operation and then you spin up your a
separate thread yourself you do the

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:23.970
separate thread yourself you do the
 

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:26.299
separate thread yourself you do the
operation and then remember to call

00:27:26.299 --> 00:27:26.309
operation and then remember to call
 

00:27:26.309 --> 00:27:28.400
operation and then remember to call
finish when you're done if you don't do

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:28.410
finish when you're done if you don't do
 

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:28.820
finish when you're done if you don't do

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:30.770
that
the system will still realize that

00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:30.780
the system will still realize that
 

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:32.450
the system will still realize that
you're blocking and might potentially

you're blocking and might potentially
 

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:35.870
you're blocking and might potentially
kill your app and remember don't treat

00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:35.880
kill your app and remember don't treat

soon as possible ok let's talk a little
 

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:53.180
soon as possible ok let's talk a little
bit about crashes and you know it's

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:53.190
bit about crashes and you know it's
 

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:55.940
bit about crashes and you know it's
really difficult to give general advice

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:55.950
really difficult to give general advice
 

00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:58.280
really difficult to give general advice
on how to avoid crashes in a setting

00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:58.290
on how to avoid crashes in a setting
 

00:27:58.290 --> 00:27:59.630
on how to avoid crashes in a setting
like this because every app will be

00:27:59.630 --> 00:27:59.640
like this because every app will be
 

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.190
like this because every app will be
different every crash will be different

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200
different every crash will be different
 

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.470
different every crash will be different
however I can give you some advice that

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:03.480
however I can give you some advice that
 

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:06.500
however I can give you some advice that
I think might be helpful so you know as

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:06.510
I think might be helpful so you know as
 

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:08.990
I think might be helpful so you know as
four years as an Android developer I've

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:09.000
four years as an Android developer I've
 

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.140
four years as an Android developer I've
seen my code or code from other people

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:12.150
seen my code or code from other people
 

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:14.480
seen my code or code from other people
start up start very simple and we

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:14.490
start up start very simple and we
 

00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:17.090
start up start very simple and we
release something and then things start

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:17.100
release something and then things start
 

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:19.190
release something and then things start
crashing on users devices and so we add

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200
crashing on users devices and so we add
 

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.710
crashing on users devices and so we add
all these safety measures like checking

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:21.720
all these safety measures like checking
 

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.960
all these safety measures like checking
for Knolls everywhere and checking for

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:23.970
for Knolls everywhere and checking for
 

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:26.299
for Knolls everywhere and checking for
activity life cycles and then if that

00:28:26.299 --> 00:28:26.309
activity life cycles and then if that
 

00:28:26.309 --> 00:28:28.490
activity life cycles and then if that
fails we just wrap everything in a

00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:28.500
fails we just wrap everything in a
 

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:30.169
fails we just wrap everything in a
try-catch and just hope that this

00:28:30.169 --> 00:28:30.179
try-catch and just hope that this
 

00:28:30.179 --> 00:28:32.570
try-catch and just hope that this
problem doesn't hit too many users but

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:32.580
problem doesn't hit too many users but
 

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:34.820
problem doesn't hit too many users but
that's not as not the greatest solution

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:34.830
that's not as not the greatest solution
 

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:36.919
that's not as not the greatest solution
right it doesn't actually solve the

00:28:36.919 --> 00:28:36.929
right it doesn't actually solve the
 

00:28:36.929 --> 00:28:39.230
right it doesn't actually solve the
underwrite underlying problem and that's

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:39.240
underwrite underlying problem and that's
 

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:41.330
underwrite underlying problem and that's
why my first piece of advice to you is

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:41.340
why my first piece of advice to you is
 

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.820
why my first piece of advice to you is
don't try to reinvent the wheel and use

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:43.830
don't try to reinvent the wheel and use
 

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:46.880
don't try to reinvent the wheel and use

that solve problems that you as

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:49.140
that solve problems that you as
 

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:51.890
that solve problems that you as
developers face now some of the most

00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:51.900
developers face now some of the most
 

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:55.310
developers face now some of the most
difficult parts of Android we heard

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:55.320
difficult parts of Android we heard
 

00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:56.840
difficult parts of Android we heard
about it from you from developers is

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:56.850
about it from you from developers is
 

00:28:56.850 --> 00:29:00.049
about it from you from developers is
handling life cycles and that's why last

00:29:00.049 --> 00:29:00.059
handling life cycles and that's why last
 

00:29:00.059 --> 00:29:03.500
handling life cycles and that's why last
year we released some of release the

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:03.510
year we released some of release the
 

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:05.330

data view model for handling that and
also we released room and and paging

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:11.190
also we released room and and paging
 

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:13.850
also we released room and and paging

you don't use way clocks that's

00:32:52.109 --> 00:32:52.119
you don't use way clocks that's
 

00:32:52.119 --> 00:32:53.849
you don't use way clocks that's
literally the simplest thing and

00:32:53.849 --> 00:32:53.859
literally the simplest thing and
 

00:32:53.859 --> 00:32:56.279
literally the simplest thing and
actually in modern Android development

there's rarely a situation when you have
 

00:32:58.299 --> 00:33:00.779
there's rarely a situation when you have
to use a way clock if we think about

00:33:00.779 --> 00:33:00.789
to use a way clock if we think about
 

00:33:00.789 --> 00:33:02.430
to use a way clock if we think about
activities so whenever the user is

there's no way to leak it for services

00:33:15.159 --> 00:33:15.169
there's no way to leak it for services
 

00:33:15.169 --> 00:33:17.440
there's no way to leak it for services
if you schedule them as jobs instead of

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:17.450
if you schedule them as jobs instead of
 

00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:19.419
if you schedule them as jobs instead of
having your custom freerunning services

00:33:19.419 --> 00:33:19.429

the job scheduler will hold the wakelock
 

00:33:21.979 --> 00:33:24.369
the job scheduler will hold the wakelock
for you and so again you can don't have

to do that yourselves

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:26.200
to do that yourselves
 

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:29.019
