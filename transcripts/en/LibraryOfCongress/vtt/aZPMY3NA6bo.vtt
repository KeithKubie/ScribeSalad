00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.920
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Good afternoon.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.220
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.540
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Welcome, welcome.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.030
So, thanks for being here.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.330
I'm Pam Jackson.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.520
I'm director for the Center for
the Book here at the Library

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.940
of Congress, and I'd like to
welcome you to our symposium,

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.950
Books Save Lives, a symposium
on trauma and resilience

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.250
in young people's literature.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.640
I'm really grateful to
have your presence here.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.610
We're excited for the
conversation we've created to have.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.390
And we're very pleased to
have the individuals with us

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.480
that we have today on the
panel and as moderator.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.680
Let me say a few words about
the Library of Congress first,

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.030
because we're proud to,
and I'm always ready to say

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.880
that we are the nation's
first cultural institution.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.510
And it is our mission to provide
the American people with the rich,

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.040
diverse, enduring source
of knowledge.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.480
One that can be relied upon

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.510
to stimulate intellectual
and creative endeavors.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.770
And we'd like to focus on the fact
that we encourage endeavoring.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.440
And that that's not actually
a conversation we have often.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.620
What does it mean to endeavor?

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.110
To try to aspire to work to make
effort to push the ball forward,

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.980
maybe not always succeeding,
but at least endeavoring.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.310
And I like to emphasize that as
part of what we talk about today.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.160
And it's certainly consistent with
what today's conversation's about.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
At the Center for the Book, we're
focused on making connections among

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.480
and between our national
and international networks

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.340
and affiliates, and we do
so to create collaborations

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.600 position:56%
and to cause others to do the same
for the purpose of promoting reading

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.520
and literacy and using the
Library of Congress collections.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.770
It's an important part of what
we like to have people know.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.120
There are 167 million things
that are the collections

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.190
of the Library of Congress.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.020
And most people don't
know that we have

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.920
at least 30-some-odd million
items that are not books.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.780
We have treasures, as Dr. Carla
Hayden likes to talk about.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.710
Manuscripts, letters,
pictures, clothing,

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.580
smoking pipes, playing cards.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.510
All kinds of things that are our
nation's history that are symbolic

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.730
and significant pieces
of our cultural heritage.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.950
And we have them for the
purpose of not just having them

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.220
but to have people engage with
them and in them and among them

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.690
and use them as part of
learning and advancing knowledge.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.740 position:56%
And that's an important part of what
we care about and want to make sure

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.670
that you know about, that the
Center for the Book's purposes for.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:03.290
One of the things I can say is
that we have our purpose and focus

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.130
on promoting books and library and
literacy and reading and poetry

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.960
and literature, and we do so
knowing that they're the best tools

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.420
for sustaining and growing
healthy engaged societies.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.280
And, in fulfilling our mission,
we care about empowering people

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.990
to be sensitive to and caring
about the needs of others.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.400
Very consistent with our mission
and purpose is todays talk.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.170
One of the things that I have been
promoting recently is my desire

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.150
and commitment that we keep
the humanity, I'm sorry,

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.040
keep the humane in humanity.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.470
And it looks like we might
need a little more effort

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.030
to do that these days.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.140
So, to today's event.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.120
We bring you five authors who will
share stories about surviving chaos

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.020
and trauma through
fiction and real life.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.430
We wish to thank our
funders for this program

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.410
and our very special partners,
the Center for the Book

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.580
at the Virginia Foundation for the
Humanities and the Maryland Center

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.950 position:56%
for the Book at Maryland Humanities.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.730
Andrea Lewis from Maryland
Center is here today.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.030
Say hello, wave.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.330
Very. Thank you.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.250
Thank you, thank you.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.550
Thank you for your partnership.

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.730
Thank you for your commitment.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.430
We value you as a friend and
affiliate with the Center

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.080
for the Book at the
Library of Congress.

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.030
And we also have that same for Jane

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.260
at the Virginia Humanities
Center who's unable to be

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.810 position:56%
with us today and sends her regrets.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.880
We're also acknowledging,
we want to acknowledge,

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.680
and we hope they'll
be arriving soon,

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.590
Olivia Smith is a media specialist

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.420
from the Digital High
School in Baltimore.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.580 position:56%
They were commuting down here today.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.880
Have they arrived?

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.180
Is that some of the, no, not yet?

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.550
Okay. So we're going to have a
packed house when they get here.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.620
There are about 40 students that
are intending to join us today

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.480
from Baltimore, Maryland
from that high school.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.310
And also, West Potomac High
School in Arlington, Virginia.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.610
Are you with us?

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.230
I'm sorry, what did I say?

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.430
West Potomac High School
in Arlington,

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.610
it's Alexandria, Virginia,
yes, hello.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.230
Welcome. Thanks for
being with us today.

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.950
And we want to remind you,
those of you who are into media,

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.260
our hashtag today is
resilience in books.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.370
So feel free to tweet that out and
pound that out, hashtag that out.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.920
How did it get to be
hashtag and not pound?

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.220
I don't know.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.950
&gt;&gt; To keep from confusing Brits.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.370
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Oh yeah, okay.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.670
Those Brits.

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.850
Okay. But anyway, before we get
started, I do want to mention

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.630 position:56%
that now's a good time to check your
mobile devices to make sure they're

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.500
on silent so they won't
be a distraction.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.630
We are videotaping this event.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.380
So all my silliness
will be captured.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.030
But so too will your
questions and answers.

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.400
So as you participate in
today's talk, which we would love

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.000
to have you do, just know
that we'll be recording you.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.170
And, you can know that today's
recording will be available online

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:53.290
at loc.gov in our collection
videos and also read.gov is

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.590
where you can find a wide variety
of the author talks that the Center

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.150
for the Book has hosted
over the years.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.820
We encourage you to hang out in
that space and see this talk later.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.880
We will send an email to our
listener when the video is posted

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.180
to let you know about that.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.120
And we also will have, which
is another notification,

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.650
a little housekeeping item before
we get to the meat of our program.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.060
Book signing right after
this program outside in the,

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.200
at the long tables as you
came in you saw the books,

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.720
so they're available for purchase
and signing after today's talk.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.670
So please, we encourage you
to spend time with those books

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.970
and spend your resources.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:35.280
Also, there are some, the resource
table out front when you signed in,

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.120
we want you to encourage
you to stop by that table

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.380
if you didn't already do so just
to have more information about some

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:46.530
of the material related to
today's topic including material

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:52.180
from Read LLC, Welcoming Schools,
GLSEN Libraries without Boarders,

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.450
Shout Mouse Press, the
Association of Jewish Libraries

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.560
and the Children's
Lit for Leaders blog.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.090
So some of that information's
available.

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.620
We want to make sure you know
that today's topic is designed

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.230
to have us be in a great
conversation but also be in action.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:11.380 position:56%
You know, there's an opportunity for
us to take away not just thoughts

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.250 position:56%
and feelings and experiences of
others today, which is very valuable

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.470
and why we have talks at all, but
also to be in action about them.

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.680
What could we be doing, what ought
we be doing, what might we do next

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.630
that we weren't necessarily
planning to do an hour ago?

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:27.720
So we encourage you to
think from that lens

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.310
as you listen to today's talk.

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.860
So, now, let me get to
the meat of the program

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.270
and my job is to do two things.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:38.920
First, to acknowledge again
the folks who are with us,

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.660
the panelists, the moderators, but
also to give a particular shout

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.610
out because some of them had to
make heroic and Herculean efforts

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.920
to get here, including,
I think, five airports

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.160
and four trains or
something like that.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.770 position:56%
So there was some experience of bad
weather yesterday, and we just honor

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:57.890
and appreciate you all for being
here and the travels that you made

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:01.590
to join us and that which you
survived including in one case,

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:06.100
our moderator's case,
a 22-hour travel day.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:12.510
So and then I think, yeah,
you can clap for that.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:15.180
[ Applause ]

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.010
I think we also had a
couple of panelists as well,

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:19.310
Meg mentioned that getting caught

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:21.780
up in the Northeast
trying to get South.

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.490
So, thank you all.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:27.370 position:56%
So let me introduce Joan Kaywell who
will be introducing each panelist,

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:29.900
moderating the discussion and
the question and answer period

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:33.040
which will take up the last about
20 minutes of our program today.

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:36.120
She is a professor of English
education at the University

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:39.100
of South Florida where she's
won several teaching awards

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:44.440
for her passion of assisting
preservice and practicing teachers

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.000
and discovering ways
to improve literacy.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.450
She donates her time extensively to
the National Council of Teacher's

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:56.120
of English and its affiliates FCTE
and a bunch of other acronyms,

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.010
and I apologize for
them, so I'm going to,

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:00.910
it's the President's
Assembly on Literature

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:05.010
for Adolescents is another
organization that she's a part of.

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:08.720
She's highly published, 14
textbooks to her credit,

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:13.200
including most recently Between
the Lines actively engaging readers

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.220
in the English classroom.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:22.330 position:56%
And most recently also, there was
the establishment of the federation,

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:27.640
I'm sorry, of the Joan F. Kaywell
Literature Saves Lives Book award

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.970 position:56%
to honor her, to honor you, for your
deep commitment to the profession

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.710
and your fervent belief
in young adult literature.

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:37.430 position:56%
And I just say I've had the
pleasure of meeting you this morning

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:42.080
and your husband and really
admire and appreciate you,

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.020
your leadership in the world.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:50.090
And your, the strength that
your voice provides for others.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.350
So thank you so much for being with
us, and please join me on stage.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.150
Let's welcome Joan Kaywell.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:10:04.370
[ Applause ]

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:08.010
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: Well, I
am very happy to be here.

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.500
And thank you very
much to the Library

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.290
of Congress folks, all of you.

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:17.740
It is definitely an honor to be
in this room with so much history.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:20.810
And to you all for being
here because you're committed

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:23.010
to the life-saving power of books.

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:26.470
So to reiterate, I'm going
to introduce the panel,

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:28.100
and then I'm going to
ask a bunch of questions.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.400
And about the last 20 minutes

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.030
or so will be your
chance to ask questions.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:34.950
So be thinking while we're
talking about the questions

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:37.470
that are pertinent to you.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:44.280 position:56%
So I'm going to go left to, yes left
to right in introducing the panel.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.840
I think my pal here, Laurie
Halse Anderson probably needs

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.140
no introduction.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:53.290
She's a New York Times bestselling
author who's known for her work

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:58.360
for tackling tough subjects
with humor and sensitivity.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:02.720

for his young readers, qualities

00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:00.000
that have made his titles perineal
favorites on the bookshelves

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.840
of homes, libraries and bookstores.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:08.120
He was first published

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:12.180
And since then, he has more than
30 published books to his credit.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:14.850
His Punk Farm, Lunch Lady

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:19.550
and Platypus Police Squad series
are all currently I the development

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:20.960
for film.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.690

two Ted Talks,

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:29.290

more than 2 million views online.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:30.590
Hold your applause.

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:36.450

All-in-all, he has
published 17 novels

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:47.140
in various genres in
his 11-year career.

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:51.890
His latest novel, Bang,
about the aftermath

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:55.960
of an accidental shooting
has been called heartbreaking

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.580
and tender and realistic.

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:01.460 position:56%
He lives and writes near New York
City with his wife and his children,

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:04.070
and he has a comic book
collection that I think

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:06.430
that even Jarrett would rival.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:08.240
So, hold your applause.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.940

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.760
in children's literature.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.510
Let's give it up [inaudible].

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:45.170
[ Applause ]

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:48.050
Wow. We're in for a treat, eh?

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:50.390
So this is all about
trauma and resilience

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:54.350
and the life-saving power of books.

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:56.170
And so we're going to talk
for this first question

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:59.220
about how can children's
literature build resilience

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:00.700
to trauma and chaos.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.920
And I'm going to start
first with Laurie.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.920
I know that a reader found comfort
in resilience in Fever 1793.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.090
Would you share that story
with us today, please?

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:11.350
&gt;&gt; Laurie Halse Anderson:
Yeah, this goes back to shortly

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:14.990
after the book came out, I
think this was early 2002 I was

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:16.970
at a school, a middle
school in New Jersey.

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:20.960
And I was giving a presentation on
Fever 1793, which for those of you

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.160
who don't know, it
is a historical novel

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.230
about the yellow fever epidemic

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:28.770
that almost destroyed Philadelphia
during George Washington's first

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:31.040
term in presidency there.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.410
And you know, so I'm talking about
gross disease stuff and, you know,

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:37.620 position:56%
all those sorts of things that
middle school students love so much.

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:41.610 position:56%
And we get to the Q&amp;A and this young
girl raises her hand and stands up.

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:44.290
And she says, you know, I
don't really have a question.

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:47.730
But I wanted to tell you that my
father was in one of the towers

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:53.480 position:56%
when the planes hit them in the fall
of 2001, and thankfully, he got out.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.180
But it was really scary for
a long time before we knew

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:59.060
that he was safe, and it's
still been scary ever sense.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:03.470
And when I read your book, it was
the first time I found a character

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:08.660
who understood what I was
feeling when I was so afraid.

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.920
And boy, did that kid
teach me a lot.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.220
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: Thank you.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:16.280
Barry. Can you give
us examples of readers

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.590
who have been helped
by reading Boy Toy?

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:21.340
That's teacher sexual abuse.

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:24.500
&gt;&gt; Barry Lyga: Yeah, I
think in terms of Boy Toy,

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:28.030
which is about a 12-year-old boy
who has an affair with his teacher

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:29.880
and the ramifications of that.

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:33.020
It's sort of obvious to look at
situations of students who got

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:35.750
in touch with me and said wow,
something like that happened to me

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:38.300
when I was that age or something
like that is happening to me now,

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.450
and your book helped me sort of
process the grief and the guilt

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:43.340
and the complexity of it all.

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:47.360
But I think for me, sort the
most eye-opening response I got

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.140
to that book wasn't from somebody
who'd actually been abused.

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:52.930
It was from a young woman who wrote
to me shortly after the book came

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:58.590
out and told me that her boyfriend
had been abused by a family member

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:01.330
in a situation similar to
what happened in Boy Toy

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.170 position:56%
and that the whole time they'd been
together she couldn't understand why

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:06.710
he acted a certain way and
why he did certain things.

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:09.450
And then she read the book and
she went, oh, now I get it.

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:12.660
And she started talking to
him, and he sort of opened

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.000
up to her, and it helped a lot.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.770
And she said to me, because
of this, when I grow up I want

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:19.410
to help people like this.

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:22.150
And the coda on that is
that a couple of years ago

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:24.720
through the magic of
Facebook stalking, I thought,

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.720
you know what, what the hell?

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.820
And I looked her up, and sure
enough, she's a therapist now.

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.430
So, that's a case where
it didn't just help her.

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:33.730
Now it's paying forward.

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:35.240
She's helping other people.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.540
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: Thank you.

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:39.440
What about Adventures of Fanboy and
Goth Girl with bullying in there?

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.510
&gt;&gt; Barry Lyga: Yeah, the
bullying in Fanboy and Goth Girl,

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:44.150
probably the most affecting
email I ever got was the one

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:46.940
that started Dear Author,
you saved my life.

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:50.470
And I think we've probably all
gotten some variation of that.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:54.220
This was a kid who, like the kid in
my book, was sort of misunderstood,

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:57.060
bullied, put upon,
nobody understood him.

00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:00.860
And he wrote to me explaining
in detail his suicide plan

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:03.980 position:56%
and how he was going to kill himself
and the whole ideation of it.

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:07.040
And that he was going to do it
at midnight on this specific day

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.070
that had significance to him.

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:11.300
And then he started reading
my book and he looked up

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.600
and it was like two in the morning.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:16.730 position:56%
And he realized oh, I guess I missed
my chance and didn't kill himself.

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:19.660
So, you know, thank God he was
that anal retentive I guess.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:23.730
But that was a nice email to get.

00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:25.030
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: Thanks.

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:26.410
I'm going to skip to Meg.

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:29.860
Meg, you have Yaqui Delgado
Wants to Kick Your Ass.

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:31.160
That deals with bullying also.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.900
Do you have examples of how
that book has helped kids

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.200
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: I do.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:38.310
And it's, it's not always
a straight line, right.

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:39.850
Because when we're
talking about bullying,

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:41.260
we're also talking about shame.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.770
And we're talking about issues that
kids don't necessarily want to come

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:47.870
to you and immediately
admit what's happening.

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:49.510
But it's been interesting to see.

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:55.310
I had, you know, I had a school
in Virginia that did a day-long

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:57.770
and schoolwide reading
of Yaqui Delgado

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:01.490
to really unpack the ecosystem
of bullying in the school.

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:03.400 position:56%
So not just kids bullying each other

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.740
but like principals
bullying teachers,

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:08.290
students bullying the
student teacher,

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:10.670
parents bullying the principal,
you know, that whole sort

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:12.930
of vicious cycle that gets going.

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:16.980
And they did it as a schoolwide
read and gave this school

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:21.450
that was really struggling with
violence sort of on its campus,

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:26.200
this thing that they
could use safely

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.880
to have difficult conversations
with each other.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.180
So I've had that.

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.280
And then I've had really
unexpected things,

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:37.440
like at the National Book Festival
a couple of years ago a mom came

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.740
through with her daughters.

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.470
She might be here, I see
her often at these things.

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:45.490
I signed the book for her daughter,
and her daughter moved off.

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:48.580
And then the mother said to me,
you know, your talk made me think

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:50.520
of a girl I knew in high school.

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.540
I was terrible to her.

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:58.080
And I'm going to try to
find her and apologize.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:03.530
So, sometimes it's not
an immediate thing.

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:04.830
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: Thank you.

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:10.700
Kekla, I literally finished the X
novel, finished it on the plane.

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:12.510
Well, I did have a few hours.

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:16.200
[ Laughter ]

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.500
And your book touches
on societal bullying.

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:23.170 position:56%
Do you have examples of how society,

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:25.530
how people have been
helped by that book?

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:26.830
&gt;&gt; Kekla Magoon: I think,

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:31.910
I don't know if I have a
specific single story to tell,

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:36.170
but the experience I've had
with that book, and sort of part

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:38.870
of the impetus, you know, for
Ilyasah to want to tell this story

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:41.660
about her father is
that we know a lot

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:42.960
about Malcolm as an adult, right.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.260
We know about his ministry.

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:45.560
We know that he was a
civil rights activist.

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.840
He was a humanitarian and
a leader and a speaker.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:51.380
He's famous for his speeches
and inspired a lot of people,

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:52.680
did a lot of community organizing.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:55.240
He's certainly a misunderstood
figure, right.

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.270
People don't, people may have heard
of Malcolm X but wouldn't be able

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:01.610
to give him much information
about his life and his history.

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:04.440
And so you can find
out a lot about him.

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:09.910
But writing a novel about him
as a teenager is a sort of way

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:12.920
of looking back at a time when
he did not know that he was going

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.370
to become this famous individual.

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:17.370
He had no idea what his
future held for him.

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:21.460
And so one of the most inspiring
and sort of powerful things

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:26.350 position:56%
about that story as a novel is
you're reading alongside a character

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:28.450
who has no idea what he's become.

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:29.750
He feels hopeless.

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:32.120
He feels like the world is against
him, and the world is against him

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.850
in a lot of respects, right.

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:36.320
He goes through a lot
of trauma in his life.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:40.100
From racism, you know, and
society, from classism,

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:44.820
from the loss of his parents,
from, you know, living in the city,

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:49.540
you know, during World
War II where he, you know,

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:53.120
sort of tried to avoid
going to war as a teenager.

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:56.020
So he went through all of
these experiences thinking

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:57.320
that he was worthless.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.620
Thinking that he had no future.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:21:59.920
Thinking that nobody
cared about him.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.220
Thinking that he was unloved.

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:02.520
Thinking that he has
no intelligence,

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.820
even though he knew he was smart.

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:07.250
He did well in school as a young
child, but he lost sort of faith

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:09.260
in himself for a period of time.

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:10.900
So this novel is about
that period of time

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.460
when he lost faith in himself.

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:17.380 position:56%
And so for a teen reader, for
anyone really, the story reminds you

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:20.010
that you don't know
what's next, right.

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:21.380
On those days when
you feel hopeless,

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:23.520
on those days when you feel
like you're not putting a lot

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.090
out into the world, you know.

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:26.750
It just sort of, you have to
wake up the next day and think,

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:28.220
I'm going to try to
be a good person.

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:29.880
I'm going to be somebody who
does something for the world.

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.470
Because what could
happen five years from now

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:33.290
or ten years from now, you know.

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:35.980
And so that's the message
that hopefully is in the book.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.340
And when I go present to teenagers,

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:40.820
it does seem like that has some
resonance looking at that book

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:42.650
and seeing this character
who we know is like,

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:45.070
people wear his letter on a shirt.

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:47.390
We have hats, you know,
you can quote his speeches.

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:48.760
It's 50 years after he was killed.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:51.670
And people still want
to talk about his life.

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:54.160
And for him to, for them to
recognize their own emotions

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:57.160
in his 14-year-old self, their own
hopelessness, their own feeling

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.460
like the world is out to get them

00:22:58.460 --> 00:22:59.920
and they're not going
to amount to anything.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:03.040
To say hey, he felt the way
I did when he was that age.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.770
And now, look what he did.

00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:07.960 position:56%
That's a really powerful experience.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.490
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: And I felt that.

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:13.550
So, continuing on, though, talk
about societal issues again

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:18.410
and how it went down with police
brutality and society and all that.

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:20.350
How has that book helped?

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:21.650
&gt;&gt; Kekla Magoon: I think this
actually echoes something

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:22.950
that Meg said.

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:25.710
It creates a safe space for people
to talk about an issue that's going

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:27.010
on in the world right now.

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:28.960
So this is the novel about
the controversial shooting

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.450
of a black teen by a white
man and his community.

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:34.370
It's a multiple viewpoint novel,
but 18 different perspectives

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:39.050 position:56%
from teenagers and adults within the
community where this loss happened.

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:41.250
And for me, I was watching,
you know,

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:42.960
after Trayvon Martin
was killed in 2012,

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.630
I was watching all the
news coverage and thinking,

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:46.190
we're not getting the
real story here.

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:47.670
We're getting a very surface story.

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:49.470
We're talking about Race
in America, capital R,

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:52.120
capital A. We're not talking
about how it feels when the kid

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:54.170
that was killed was your
science lab partner or the boy

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:55.810
who gave you your first
kiss or somebody

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:57.110
who sat next to you in class.

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:59.300
Or somebody who bullied
you and you're pretty happy

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:00.600
that they're not in
school the next day.

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.320
Those are complicated feelings.

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.430
And so the experience
of being able to talk

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:09.370
about those issues are
very real to my readers

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:12.390
in a slightly removed setting to
talk about the fictional character

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:15.120
of Tyrell, how he feels when
he lost his best friend.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.120
You know, to talk about your
own feelings through the lens

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:20.150
of fiction is a really
powerful experience as well.

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:21.450
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: Thank you.

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:22.820
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: And I
want to hop on one thing,

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:25.600
because I think you're
touching on it.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:26.900
In seeing your community,

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:30.840
seeing yourself there is
really a powerful thing.

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:36.140
So for Yaqui Delgado what happens
is that people will tell me,

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:39.150
teachers especially, will
say that the Latino kids

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:43.660
in their classroom suddenly are
the experts on the language,

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:46.010
on the food, on what
that phrase meant.

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:48.450
And they suddenly are
in the position

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:51.630
of power saying this is how
this looks in our family.

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:53.280
This is what it sounds like.

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.270
It doesn't, it may not seem

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:58.340
like a big deal unless you're
the person who never gets there.

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:00.930
You know, the way their family

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:04.960
and their neighborhood looks
in roles, spoken about.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:09.000
And suddenly it's there and you
have, you have the expertise.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.220
I think that's really
helpful to readers as well.

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:15.740
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: Jarrett, can you
tell us how kids have been helped

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:17.350
by the Lunch Lady series?

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:21.430
&gt;&gt; Jarrett J. Krosoczka: This
past fall I had a book signing

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:23.380
for my books in general.

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:27.470
There was this mother who
happened upon the book signing,

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:32.360
and she picked up a copy of
a Lunch Lady graphic novel.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:36.540
And as I'm signing it for
her, she just began to weep.

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:38.130
She began to cry.

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:39.990
And I was taken aback.

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:44.030
I wasn't sure what was happening.

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:47.510
And she confided in
me that she told me,

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:51.870
she said the Lunch Lady's
books really saved my kid

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:57.100
because she had escaped a
very abusive relationship

00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.410
from her kid's father.

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:03.960
And when she set up a new
life for her and her kid,

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:07.560
the kid just retreated
into themselves.

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:10.180
And they weren't reading.

00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:11.880
They were slipping in their grades.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.860
They just weren't engaging
in school.

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:21.590
And however this happened,
whoever handed that Lunch Lady book

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:24.480
to this kid, she loved it.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.060
And she read all of the
books in the series.

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:31.320
And it's a powerful
thing because for me,

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:34.730
I just wanted to draw a lunch
lady fighting off evil robots

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:38.080
with fish sticks that
turned into nunchucks.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:42.430
Like that was my goal, you know.

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:45.830
So I'll never, you know, and that's
the story that was shared with me.

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:49.240
And these are just all the
stories that were shared with us.

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:53.010
You know, I can only begin to
imagine what other stories are

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:56.620
out there that we may never know.

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:58.500
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: That's true.

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:01.030
And Laurie, Laurie with Speak.

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:02.450 position:56%
Speak's been around for a long time.

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:04.380
Raise your hand if
you've read Speak.

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:05.680
All right.

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:06.980
So see there.

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:08.850
Speak's going to be one of those
books we can all predict 100 years

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:11.190
from now will continue to be read.

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:14.900
Can you offer some stories of
people who've been helped by Speak?

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:16.200
&gt;&gt; Laurie Halse Anderson: Ah man.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.500
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: I know,
where do you start, right?

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:18.800
&gt;&gt; Laurie Halse Anderson: Right.

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.770
This book helped me.

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:24.290
And this book has changed
my life so profoundly.

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:28.090 position:56%
My readers, the readers of this book
have changed my life so profoundly.

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:32.860
Tens of thousands of
communications over the years.

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:34.880
The book's almost 20 years old.

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:40.290
And from, you know, an elderly
woman in her 80s who wrote to me

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:46.880
about being sexually assaulted
at age 12 by some boys at school,

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:48.430
and her parents married her off

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:51.570
to the next traveling
salesman who came through.

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:55.010
And he finally died when she was
in her 70s, and she was taking

00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:57.990
that time from her 70s until the
end of her life to kind of start

00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:01.260
to go back and reflect on
what her life had been.

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:05.800
You know, we write these
books for kids and teens,

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:09.660
but you guys are all pretty much
old enough to know that when you go

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:13.040
through something difficult in
your childhood or adolescence,

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:17.980 position:56%
those scars if not tended with love
and care at the time they're formed,

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:22.950
tend to linger and color your
life for the rest of your life.

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:26.780 position:56%
So I think that even though we write
in the field of youth literature,

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:30.340
we're really talking about the most
significant parts of our humanity.

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:35.170
So Speak has been, I've heard from
all kinds of folks, men and women,

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:38.870
girls and boys, who have been,
were survivors of sexual assault,

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:40.850
different kinds of violence.

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:45.730
But also people who have held
secrets, who have bad things happen

00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:48.260
to him that they didn't
have the language for

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:51.920
or didn't have a friendly
ear to talk to.

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:56.760
And that book helped them see
how our secrets can poison us.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.540
And when I hear from,
especially a young person,

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:02.790
that the boy helped them find
their courage to speak up,

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:05.410
that's just the greatest
blessing in my life.

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:06.710
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: And
I'm going to continue

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:09.540
on with the Impossible Knife of
Memory because you also shared

00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:13.750
that that is very true
or hits home with you.

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:15.710
[Inaudible] how that
writing of that helped you.

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:17.010
&gt;&gt; Laurie Halse Anderson:
Oh my gosh, yeah.

00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:19.240
The Impossible Knife of Memory
is my most recent YA novel,

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:23.050
and it is the story of so
many of our teenagers today.

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:25.570
A young girl whose dad
is home from the war,

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:29.440
Iraq and Afghanistan
veteran with physical

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.410
and emotional wounds,
untreated PTSD.

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:34.660
And this book is for all
those kids out there who have

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:37.550
to parent their parents because
their parents are kind of broken.

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:40.870
And that's the hardest
thing out there to learn.

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:44.060
And it's a reflection of my
experience with my own father.

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:47.310
I wrote it as he was at the
end of her life, so the writing

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:52.630
of the book became a bit of a
healing process for both he and I.

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:57.100
But, you know, especially with
our older teens, they sadly get

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:59.110
so good at putting the mask on.

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:01.960
It's really easy to tell when
10-year-olds are struggling.

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:06.400
But I think that the 17 and 18
and 22-year-olds need us all

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.930
to open our hearts a little bit
wider and give them a little bit

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:11.230
of extra patience and love.

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:15.960 position:56%
Because so many of them are
carrying heavy burdens in our books,

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:19.930
which you so generously put in
their hands, are often the key

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:24.110
to unlock their silence and
strengthen them, whether

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:26.410
or not they talk to
anybody about it.

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:30.960
Just to know that you're not alone
with your suffering is another

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.830
to let you get through
another day sometimes.

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:35.420
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: Thank you.

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:38.640
But the rest of you, how do you
realistically portray a trauma

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:42.670
that you may not have directly
experienced yourselves?

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:49.350
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Well, I start
with questions for myself.

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:53.550
And first, I'd like to
say when I'm writing

00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:57.550
about really difficult things,
traumatic things, I'm also aware

00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:59.160
that I'm writing for young people.

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:03.090
And it's not the same
as writing for adults.

00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:06.120
When I'm writing for young
people, the question,

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:09.450
or the way that I'm thinking
about it is not how I dumb it down

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:13.230
or how I make it prettier or
how I make it less hurtful.

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:15.030
That's not the answer.

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:20.050
The real issue is, how
do you communicate this?

00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:24.740 position:56%
How do you represent this
realistically, and at the same time,

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:28.270
be respectful to where
they are developmentally.

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:32.890
With the tools that they have
at 15, at 16 at 17 at 12,

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:34.870
when they're coming to the page.

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:40.810
So it's this long sort of exercise
in tact, in how I say something.

00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:45.590
And I have to be aware that this is
maybe the first time they're coming

00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:48.020
to experience this with me.

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:50.460
It may not be the reality
of their family,

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:52.330
but it is of their friend's family.

00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:59.150
So, it's just this really delicate
balance of being respectful

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:04.340
of where teens are as they
grow up and staying honest.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:09.600
I think the biggest disservice we
would do would be to be dishonest,

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:14.310
to clean it up and make it less,

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:16.700
reflect less what's
actually happening.

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:20.340 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Barry Lyga: I think one of the
things we always have to remember is

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:24.500
that even though, as human
beings, we are incredibly good,

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:27.710
almost addicted, to
organizing ourselves into groups

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:30.640
so that we can define
who isn't in the group.

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.570
The fact of the matter
is, we're all individuals.

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:36.650
We all experience the world
only through ourselves.

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:41.100
And so I think it, when you
talk about portraying a trauma

00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:44.010
that you haven't experienced,
there's a temptation sometimes

00:32:44.010 --> 00:32:45.520
to think, well I haven't
gone through this

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.210
so how can I talk about it.

00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:50.590
But anybody who's gone through
a trauma is going to react

00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:52.720
to it differently, whether
greatly or slightly,

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.670
than somebody else who's
gone through a trauma.

00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:58.580
So, you look for sort of
a core common humanity,

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:00.400
and you extrapolate from that.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:04.830
And what I've always done is I
can only, I can only liken it

00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:06.490
to method acting in a way.

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:10.870 position:56%
I mean, you know, in Bang, Sebastian
was four-years-old and got a hold

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:12.960
of a gun and shot and
killed his baby sister.

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.630
I have never done that, thank God.

00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:19.430
But I can sit down and think to
myself, what would that feel like?

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:20.730
What might that be like?

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:23.060
How would I react if
I had done that?

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:26.780
And I'm a human being, so my
reaction is going to be a human one

00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:30.500
and hopefully will be recognizable
to other people who read it.

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:36.910
And I think that you can't aim
for 100% fidelity, but you can aim

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:39.810
for [inaudible] and hope
that you're close enough

00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:43.670
that you hit the common notes that
most other people will recognize.

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:48.300
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: All of your
books have been censored some way.

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:52.190
It doesn't take a rocket scientist
to figure out that some teachers,

00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:55.710
librarians, people would be afraid
to have them in their classroom.

00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:59.670
I looked up and in Virginia,
Meg Medina's talk was cancelled

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:02.440
after the principal
refused to allow her

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:05.730
to reference Yaqui Delgado
Wants to Kick Your Ass.

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:09.580
Wouldn't let her show the cover.

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:13.610
Barry Lyga's been censored
all over the place.

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:17.030
An also a lot of self-censorship
with his.

00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:19.540
You know, you're going to bring
in I Hunt Killers, you know,

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:23.000
a kid who's been raised by a
serial killer for a father.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.720
Laurie Halse Anderson's books have
been challenged so many times,

00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:30.530
so many times, that she's
become the spokesperson

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:33.610
for intellectual freedom
around the country.

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:36.130
She's a force to be reckoned with.

00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:38.660
Go to her website.

00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:43.680
Kekla, she's written a book
about it called Media Censorship.

00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:49.540
And Jarrett, Lunch Lady
series, he's been censored

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:54.690
because he's written comic books,
and that's not real literature.

00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:59.240
And Barry, of course, could talk
to about his comic book collection

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:02.920
and how it's messed
him up for life, right.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:04.260
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: It's
so sad about him.

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:06.560
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: I know.

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:09.910
&gt;&gt; Barry Lyga: I'll
never amount to anything.

00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:13.420 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: So all of you, what
do you tell teachers and librarians

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:16.160
who are facing a censorship
situation?

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:19.050
And I'll have Laurie go last.

00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:21.610
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Thank goodness.

00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:24.010
Yeah, because she really
is the queen bee on this.

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:25.380
She really has her stuff.

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:27.320
I mean, here's what I say.

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.620
Fear not, right.

00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:30.150
You're not alone, first of all.

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:33.250
It's happened to other people.

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:36.480
And I feel like, A,
please have read the book.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:41.040
So you know, you can
discuss why this book matters

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.000
to your students and your school.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.510
Why it's literary merit is there.

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:48.100
I think you should
reach out, certainly,

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:50.490
to the Office of Intellectual
Freedom, to the NCAC,

00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:55.810
because they have all kinds of
materials that you can use to shore

00:35:55.810 --> 00:36:00.450
up your relationship with your
principal and your response.

00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:05.140
And certainly, tell the author and
alert the author and the publisher.

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:08.300
Because they can also send
letters of support and so on.

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:13.490
But mostly know, I mean,
I feel so bad sometimes

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:17.740
when a librarian will say, you
know, we've got this challenge

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:20.720
to your book because
here's how I'm thinking.

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.320
There's paperwork.

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:23.930
There's phone calls.

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:25.750
There's people with
pitchforks, right,

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:29.560
saying things like you're
not, you're not a moral person

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.290
or what are you doing to my child.

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:37.270
And this creates so much pain,
really, for the librarian,

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:40.960
for the parent, for
the kid, you know.

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:42.260
And I feel for you.

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:48.120
But I feel like it's so
important to give kids books

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:50.940
that really reflect
what they're up against.

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:52.940
That's it worth the fight.

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:56.580
What do you think?

00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:59.050
&gt;&gt; Jarrett J. Krosoczka: I
was scheduled to be at a bunch

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:01.620 position:56%
of schools that required air travel.

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:04.570
And this one librarian
that was intending

00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:06.730
on hosting me brought
a copy of Lunch Lady

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:09.910
into her principal's office and
said, we're going to get this guy

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:12.650
to our school, and we need to
make sure we get the funding.

00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:15.520
And the principal just took one
look at it and said, you know,

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:20.880
I spent my childhood with my
face in the pages of comics

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:23.010
when I should have been
reading real books.

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:24.650
So I'm not going to
have that man come

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:27.900
to our school and promote comics.

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:31.080
And all I could think of was
like, was her goal in life

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:34.540
to be like superintendent?

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:38.560
But all those years with Archie
and Jughead held her back?

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:42.410
And now she was stuck
as the lowly principal.

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:46.340
And there's a lot to
sort of analyze in that.

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:48.860
You grew up reading comics,

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:51.190
and now you are an elementary
school administrator.

00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:54.440
That is a noble job.

00:37:54.440 --> 00:38:00.180
And so, you know, I do speak to a
lot of librarians who say like, oh,

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:02.380
there's a parent or
there's a teacher.

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:03.990 position:56%
And this isn't a generational thing.

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:08.510
This is younger, middle age,
older educators, parents,

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:12.190
who say only let my kid
check out real books.

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:13.710
No comics.

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:18.350
For me, you know, my
mother was a drug addict.

00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:20.080
I didn't know my father.

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:21.380
I didn't meet him until I was 17.

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:26.280
I was raised by two very lovely
grandparents who drank a lot.

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:29.720
But I had Garfield in the
newspaper every single day.

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:33.290
And I was, I would get
to the comic bookstore

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:36.800
and I would get Spiderman
and X-Men comics.

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.920
And those were my lifelines.

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:42.400 position:56%
You know, those were my escape
portals for what I was dealing with.

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:45.780
So if you're telling your
kid not to read comics,

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:51.790
maybe you're taking the only life
jacket they have in that moment.

00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:57.400
&gt;&gt; Barry Lyga: I think, I
mean, you asked how we respond.

00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:02.260
I always am very careful to say
to the librarian or the teacher

00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:06.150
or whomever has contacted
me, look, I can be as loud

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:08.250
or as quiet as you want me to be.

00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:13.290 position:56%
I can raise a stink and try to reign
hellfire down on your district,

00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:16.820
or I can say nothing and just wait
for you to tell me what to do.

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:20.190
Because I think our first reaction
can sometimes be a very defensive

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:23.270
one, like you're banning
my, screw you.

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:24.570
I'll show you.

00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:25.870
Do you know who I am?

00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:27.170
&gt;&gt; Jarrett J. Krosoczka: I speak
at the Library of Congress.

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:29.010
&gt;&gt; Barry Lyga: I speak at the
Library of Congress for God's sake.

00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:30.310
[ Laughter ]

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:31.610
There's video.

00:39:31.610 --> 00:39:33.450
Look at loc.gov.

00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:35.900
&gt;&gt; Jarret J. Krosoczka:
One p.m. RSVP at hashtag.

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:39.940
&gt;&gt; Barry Lyga: Hashtag
resilience in literature.

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:43.370
But you know, I remember in one
case Boy Toy was being challenged

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:45.290
somewhere, and the teacher told me

00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:47.510
and then begged me not
to say anything online.

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:50.050
And said, you know, the principal
is talking to the parents,

00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:54.230
and it's sort of this very delicate
back channel cold war diplomatic

00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:55.660
pouch type of thing.

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:57.750
And, you know, like a
Jeffrey Archer novel.

00:39:57.750 --> 00:40:00.510
And, you know, if you
make a big stink,

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:02.770
then it could all go
curflewy [phonetic],

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:04.070
but I thought you should know.

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:05.370
And I said okay.

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:06.670
And I didn't say anything.

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:08.930
And a while later I happened to
be in that area and a woman comes

00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:12.880
up to me at a signing and
goes, by the way, we won.

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:14.180
And I was like.

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:15.480
And that's something too.

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.830 position:56%
You know, Boy Toy's been challenged.

00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:18.430
I Hunt Killers has been challenged.

00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:21.380
My graphic novel Mangaman was
challenged for a sex scene

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:25.310
where there is no nudity
and nobody has sex.

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:28.340
Which really is stretching it.

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:32.360
But anyway, that all happened.

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:34.950
And, you know, they've never won.

00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:38.950 position:56%
Which I think speaks to the folks at
the Office of Intellectual Freedom

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:41.580
and National Campaign Against
Censorship and people like Laurie

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:44.840
who have been just freaking
trailblazers in this.

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:48.590
And thank you for that, for
standing up so early and so often

00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:51.960
so that schlubs like
me don't have to.

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:53.830
And I think yeah, you
know, when you're told

00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:55.160
about this you give
them the resources

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:58.460
and you say I am here
to do whatever you need.

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:00.890
And I've always said that
if the censors ever win,

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:02.940
I'm going to buy a million
copies of that book and send it

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:06.340
to every library in
a 40-mile radius.

00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:07.640
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: Chris
[Inaudible] does by the way.

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:10.900
&gt;&gt; Barry Lyga: Yeah,
that's where I got it from.

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:12.200
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: Kekla?

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:13.890
&gt;&gt; Kekla Magoon: Well I don't
have, actually interestingly,

00:41:13.890 --> 00:41:16.960
considering what I write about,
I don't have any direct examples

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.490
or experience of my books
being censored or challenged.

00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:22.080
Which I find interesting because
I write a lot about civil rights.

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:23.570
I write a lot about violence.

00:41:23.570 --> 00:41:27.450
I write a lot about, you know,
race relations and everything

00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:30.570
that you would think
would be challenged.

00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:34.080
And I suspect that my books tend
to subject to acquired reform

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:37.410
of censorship with people not
ordering them to begin with

00:41:37.410 --> 00:41:41.390
or fearing the censorship
conversation that might happen

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:43.730
if they try to use it
in their classrooms.

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:45.730
Which I think is of equal
concern to the books

00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:49.720
that are being actively challenged
but much harder to quantify.

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:53.180
And so that interests me as
part of the conversation.

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:55.980
And then just to say the book
that I wrote, Media Censorship,

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:59.120
is part of a series of
educational books for middle school

00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:00.420
about controversial issues.

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:03.730
And so it's a book that presents
a debate about media censorship

00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:07.860
and when do we ban books and
why and how do we choose sort

00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:10.640
of what gets presented
by introducing teenagers

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:14.090
to that conversation right at
that age when they're first able

00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:16.040
to move beyond concrete
thinking and recognize

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:17.340
that people hold different opinions

00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:19.580
and how do you navigate
those issues.

00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:21.760
So because I think the debate
itself is important, you know.

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:25.010
At every stage of publishing,
at every stage of library usage,

00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:26.310
you know, people are
making decisions

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:29.120
about what material is presented,
what material is published,

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:31.350
what gets into the collection, what
doesn't get into the collection.

00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:32.860
When is that a personal choice?

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:34.160
When is it censorship?

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:36.140
When is it protecting?

00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:37.970
And when is it hurting, you
know, all of those things,

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:40.320
those shades at different places.

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.170
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: And those
weird conversations

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:45.700
where people decide who's the
right audience for your book.

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:49.180
That happens for my books
all the time, you know.

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:52.250
Oh this Latino girl would love this
book, but nobody else, you know.

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:54.970 position:56%
It's like, so that's kind of strange

00:42:54.970 --> 00:42:57.160
or having permission slips
or where they keep it.

00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:01.310
Like all that soft censorship
stuff is really dicey.

00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:02.610
&gt;&gt; Kekla Magoon: Yes.

00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:03.910
Yes. Agreed.

00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:05.210
&gt;&gt; Barry Lyga: And
I brought that up.

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:06.950
I was asked about that when Boy Toy
came out that happened with Boy Toy

00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:09.540
where people just weren't buying
it and putting it on the shelf

00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:10.840
because they were afraid of it.

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:12.140
And so I talked about that.

00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:14.070
And I didn't think I said
anything horribly controversial.

00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:15.480
I was just saying this
is what happened.

00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:19.290 position:56%
And I had some librarians
attacking me saying, well, you know,

00:43:19.290 --> 00:43:22.590
I have a limited budget, and my
kid doesn't care about your book,

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:23.960
but they want Harry Potter.

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:25.780
So are you saying I shouldn't
buy Harry Potter just

00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:27.400
to prove that I'm not a censor?

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:30.920
And I said no, that's not
what I'm saying at all.

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:32.220
I'm not talking about you.

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:33.600
Like if your kid doesn't
want to read my book,

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:34.900
don't buy it, that's fine.

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:38.590
But if you're not buying Kekla's
books or Meg's books or my books

00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:42.010
or anybody up here's books
because you're afraid,

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:45.220
then you should think about it.

00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:46.520
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: The queen.

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:48.860
&gt;&gt; Barry Lyga: We can
all take a break now.

00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:51.250
&gt;&gt; Laurie Halse Anderson:
The big mouth, right.

00:43:51.250 --> 00:43:54.920
It's funny, because when I was a
kid I was always asking questions

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:56.290
and getting into a
lot of trouble for it.

00:43:56.290 --> 00:44:00.480
And I was convinced as a child that
there was something wrong with me

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:03.090
because I didn't understand the
world around me which is why I had

00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:05.540
to ask all those darn questions.

00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:08.400
And you should know that
I'm a preacher's daughter.

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:13.030
So I was raised and I understand
the conservative mindset with a lot

00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:18.610
of love and deep understanding and
incredible frustration sometimes.

00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:21.940
When they first started to pull my
books and call me a pornographer

00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:24.770
and censor what I had written,
boy wait until you have

00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:26.750
to tell your mom that, by the way.

00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:29.750
That was in a newspaper article.

00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:31.870
You think I can get pissed off.

00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:36.970
I took it very personally.

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:38.280
I was like what?

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:42.310
You know, I cried a couple of times
because it was like people thinking

00:44:42.310 --> 00:44:44.530
that I wanted to harm children.

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:47.540
Which is the exact opposite
of what we try to do

00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:50.210 position:56%
and what all you guys try to do too.

00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:52.320
Over the years I've learned
a couple of things though.

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:53.800
It's never about me.

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:59.000
And I've actually learned
how to love the parents

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.730
who try to censor my books.

00:45:00.730 --> 00:45:04.840
I don't love the politicians
who use those parent's fear

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:07.030
for their own political
ends and games.

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:10.510
They can go to hell.

00:45:10.510 --> 00:45:13.200
[ Inaudible ]

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:15.290
But what I've learned
is that the parents

00:45:15.290 --> 00:45:19.150
who bring censorship challenges
love their kids every bit as much

00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:21.330
as I love mine and you love yours.

00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:23.700
And you love the young
people in your lives.

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:25.790
But they're terrified.

00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:29.320
Because they don't know how to talk
to their child or their children

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:32.420
about the subject of
that particular book.

00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:36.020
And for people on the right wing of
politics, that's often about things

00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:37.700
that are sexual behavior.

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:39.930
For people on the left
wing of politics,

00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:42.610
sometimes it's eating disorders
because I've gotten censored

00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:44.660
by everybody, and everybody
in between.

00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:50.290
So when I see a censorship attempt,
what I see is a scared adult

00:45:50.290 --> 00:45:54.880
who probably didn't have people
in their life when they were young

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.200
to talk to them about things.

00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:00.080 position:56%
And it's, you know, when I'm cranky,
it's still pretty early in the day,

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:01.380
if we were having this
in the evening,

00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:03.920
I would call this failed parenting.

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:05.260
Because that's exactly what it is.

00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:08.700
As a parent, your job is to
step up and do the hard things.

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:12.660
And to do your job better
than your parents did theirs.

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:17.160
And that means having to
learn how to talk about things

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:20.080
that your child is going
to experience in the world.

00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:23.210
Please God, please all the
gods, no child ever has to go

00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:24.510
through any of these things.

00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:25.970
But that's just so
completely unrealistic.

00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:31.750
And even for those kids whoa
re super lucky and they can get

00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:34.830
through adolescents in this
incredible bubble of privilege

00:46:34.830 --> 00:46:37.680
and become unscathed, they're
the kids who go to college

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:39.970
and fall apart because
they've never had

00:46:39.970 --> 00:46:43.020
that experience of
building resiliency.

00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:45.900
That's what these books are for.

00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:49.450
These books give comfort to
the children who are struggling

00:46:49.450 --> 00:46:51.240
with pain that they
don't know how to go to.

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:54.690
And it gives knowledge
and compassion to the kids

00:46:54.690 --> 00:46:56.350
who haven't experienced it.

00:46:56.350 --> 00:46:59.040 position:56%
Speaking again as a preacher's
daughter, I'm going to start swaying

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:03.660
up here in a second, trying to
figure out where my Amen corner is.

00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:05.510
Okay, good.

00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:10.050
[ Laughter ]

00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:11.350
Now I'm totally off track.

00:47:11.350 --> 00:47:13.740
I should never make jokes
when I get heated like this.

00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:16.260
Speaking as a, what I know,

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:18.770
particularly from my
faith background is

00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:21.740
that in our sacred
text of Christianity,

00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:24.590
Jesus did not tell us don't.

00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:27.360
Jesus told us stories.

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:29.170
In His wisdom he shared stories.

00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:33.770 position:56%
And I think every sacred text of
any religion that I've ever studied,

00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:37.280
which is certainly not all of
them, you see storytelling,

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:40.710
because that is human
wisdom at its finest.

00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:42.050
Distilled.

00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:43.580
Distilled.

00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:46.800
And you tell a story and the
listener or the reader takes

00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:49.360
that story into their soul,

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:53.920
applies it to their
spirit and grows from it.

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:56.710
That's why these books
are so important.

00:47:56.710 --> 00:48:02.320
So, summarizing, everything
they said was right.

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:08.370
And I think that if we paid
attention, recognizing the place

00:48:08.370 --> 00:48:12.820
that the censors themselves are
coming from, and actually trying

00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:15.320
to operate out of love
and respect for that.

00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:16.860
Because they're hurting.

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:19.410
Imagine if you had a
15-year-old child you know

00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:21.210
that the world is a
very scary place,

00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:23.700
and you don't know how
to talk to your kid.

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:27.830
Or you're so afraid of screwing
up, you don't talk to your kid

00:48:27.830 --> 00:48:30.440
about the super important things
you know you should be talking

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:31.920
to them about.

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:35.010
That's not a fun place
to imagine yourself in.

00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:39.910
So I think there's a lot of room
for all of us to learn and grow

00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:43.200
and having discussions about
these books is a really good place

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.500
to start.

00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:45.800
&gt;&gt; Jarrett Krosoczka:
May I add something?

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:47.100
&gt;&gt; Laurie Halse Anderson: Please.

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:48.400
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: Oh yes.

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:49.700 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jarrett Krosoczka: So my daughter
read Raina Telgemeir's Smile

00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:51.730
when she was about five-years-old.

00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:56.490
And she wanted to buy a copy of
the book for her friend's birthday.

00:48:56.490 --> 00:48:58.350
Her friend was turning six.

00:48:58.350 --> 00:49:00.850
So at the birthday,
the birthday opened

00:49:00.850 --> 00:49:02.440
up the book, and she was elated.

00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:06.490 position:56%
She had always wanted this book,
and the parent shared a look of, oh.

00:49:06.490 --> 00:49:09.900
Because they had had a discussion
about how they weren't going

00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:15.000 position:56%
to have Raina's books in their house
because of the things they read

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.250
about how these books
were inappropriate.

00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:20.670
And so I pulled them aside,
I said well, in the book,

00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:23.070
in this particular book, some

00:49:23.070 --> 00:49:26.900
of the Raina characters'
friends are really mean to her.

00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:31.550
And then in another book,
there's a character who is gay.

00:49:31.550 --> 00:49:35.260
So if you think that your kid
is going to go through life

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:38.840
without these experiences,
you know, why not, you know,

00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:42.160
introduce the thought that your
kid is going to have some friends

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:44.010
that aren't kind to them.

00:49:44.010 --> 00:49:47.510
And how, like we were all saying,
have these conversations now

00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:49.150
through the book and to sort

00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:51.900
of piggyback off what Barry
was saying too is I think a lot

00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:55.120
of the way to broach
these conversations is

00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:58.330
to have these gentle
one-on-one conversations.

00:49:58.330 --> 00:50:02.430
Because sometimes, when you
come out all guns a blazing,

00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:05.220
it might not be the most
effective way to do it.

00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:09.210 position:56%
So I love what you said about trying
to see where that librarian is at

00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:13.510
and what they need and how we
can best support your community,

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:15.340
you know, let the authors
know what you need from us.

00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:20.090
Like, we're so happy to help, be
it a personal letter or a tweet

00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:23.950
or something that could
start a bigger conversation.

00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:27.340
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: I'm going
to switch the question

00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:30.080
to the opposite in a way.

00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:34.360
In my generation, we were never
allowed to talk about issues.

00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:36.590
You didn't air your dirty
laundry out in public.

00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:40.680
I mean that was just, uh-huh,
you're not going to talk about it.

00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:43.970
Uh-huh. And these folks
write about these issues.

00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:49.210
And I have been saying for my
entire career that books save lives

00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:52.170
in a time when it wasn't even
politically correct to say that

00:50:52.170 --> 00:50:55.700
and to be here at the Library of
Congress with a theme of that.

00:50:55.700 --> 00:51:00.810
Just is beyond, I'm just so happy
that we're talking about it.

00:51:00.810 --> 00:51:06.150
So put it out there, you know
I believe books save lives.

00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:08.430
And I've had conversations
with a lot of you all

00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:11.380
about how the life-saving
power of books.

00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:16.060
Can you give us a specific example
of how your books have saved a life

00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:18.770 position:56%
that you know about or when it does?

00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:21.370
And I want everybody
to answer, please.

00:51:21.370 --> 00:51:24.670
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Well,
for me, I think that all

00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:30.470
of our work collectively
removes the isolation and shame

00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:32.730
that accompanies traumatic events.

00:51:32.730 --> 00:51:36.060
And those of you work with kids who
are, you know, victims of trauma.

00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:38.810
And there's so many ways
to think about trauma now.

00:51:38.810 --> 00:51:44.890
I'm so encouraged by all of the
end roads being made on trauma

00:51:44.890 --> 00:51:48.920
in the form of teaching practices
and school practices and so on.

00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:55.900
But there's something comforting
about finding, even in fiction,

00:51:55.900 --> 00:52:01.730
a person who can give voice to
those things you're afraid to say.

00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:04.470
The things you're afraid
to admit are happening.

00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:09.950
The things that you are too
painful to utter out loud.

00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:16.290
And I think that is a sustaining
way of building resilience in kids.

00:52:16.290 --> 00:52:18.530
That's how I think they,
I mean, I don't know.

00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:20.570
Maybe someone has been on the brink

00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:24.280
of doing something terrible reads
my book and decides otherwise.

00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:26.650
But I think it's a
more subtle thing.

00:52:26.650 --> 00:52:30.570
I think it's an acknowledgement of
the complexity of people's lives

00:52:30.570 --> 00:52:32.570
and how families are complex.

00:52:32.570 --> 00:52:36.750
And how you can be in a family
and love very deeply a person

00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:38.560
who also hurts you very deeply.

00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:41.400
And how that exists.

00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:43.330
It's human.

00:52:43.330 --> 00:52:46.160
That is I think what saves lives.

00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:52.690 position:56%
It removes the shame and the feeling
that there's something you're living

00:52:52.690 --> 00:52:59.120
or something about you that
is really impossibly ugly.

00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:01.040
It's human.

00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:02.710
&gt;&gt; Kekla Magoon: I agree for sure.

00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:05.230
I mean I think when I hear
the question, you know,

00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:07.010
has your book saved
a life, you know.

00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:09.130
The story that you
want in a sense, right.

00:53:09.130 --> 00:53:11.660
It's like Barry's story where,
you know, somebody says.

00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:12.960
&gt;&gt; Barry Lyga: Literally.

00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:14.970 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Kekla Magoon: I have child,
called and literally says, you know,

00:53:14.970 --> 00:53:16.880
I was reading your book and
that's why I didn't kill myself.

00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:20.610
I mean that's sort of
the extreme, right,

00:53:20.610 --> 00:53:23.950
of how a book can save a life.

00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:28.340
But I'm, as a writer and
also, I think, as a person,

00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:32.150
as interested in the very nuanced
way that something can save a life

00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:33.970
or something can change somebody.

00:53:33.970 --> 00:53:39.120
I have had numerous teenagers say,
oh, we had to read this for school.

00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:42.100
It's the first book I finished
all the way to the end.

00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:45.860
That is, like I say it and even
still it gives me chills to think

00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:51.340
about being the book that somebody
finished, like to give somebody

00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:55.020
that experience for the first
time, knowing that they came up

00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:57.390
and told me that when I met
them, they're probably going

00:53:57.390 --> 00:53:59.650
to go find another book and try
to get to the end of that one.

00:53:59.650 --> 00:54:01.940
Or, at least think it's possible,
right, that there are books

00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:04.050
out there that might intrigue
them all the way to the end.

00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:06.530
That, to me, is a life
changing small thing.

00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:09.720
I mean it's huge, right, in
it's potential ripple effects.

00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:11.690
But it seems like a
small story for somebody

00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:12.990
to say this is the
first book I finished.

00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:15.480
But when you're 17, to say this is
the first book I finished all the

00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:17.530
way through, and that's
happened more than once

00:54:17.530 --> 00:54:19.170
in several of my books, you know.

00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:22.480
And I know that, you know, other
writers have had that experience.

00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:27.870 position:56%
And, you know, for me, that's a life
change, which is some ripple effect

00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:32.170 position:56%
down the road could be a life saved.

00:54:32.170 --> 00:54:34.510
&gt;&gt; Barry Lyga: Yeah, I'm sorry,
I only have the one story.

00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:38.260
[ Laughter ]

00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:39.560
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: Don't be greedy.

00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:41.280
&gt;&gt; Barry Lyga: I guess
I'm not doing my part.

00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:49.800
I know. But sort o in keeping with
that theme, I think that, I think,

00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:53.040
you know, one of the
interesting things,

00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:54.900
people ask me a lot why do
you write for teenagers,

00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:56.370
and my answer is I don't.

00:54:56.370 --> 00:54:58.410
I write about teenagers.

00:54:58.410 --> 00:55:02.310
I don't really think in
terms of who my audience is.

00:55:02.310 --> 00:55:03.610
I just write the story.

00:55:03.610 --> 00:55:07.260
But one of the interesting things
about the fact that it tends

00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:10.380
to be predominantly teenagers who
read my books is the knowledge

00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:14.310
that a book can change that
person in a fundamental way.

00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:16.070
Adults are set.

00:55:16.070 --> 00:55:17.370
We're done.

00:55:17.370 --> 00:55:18.670
We're set in concrete.

00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:19.970
Every now and then
somebody reads Eat, Pray,

00:55:19.970 --> 00:55:21.270
Love and changes their love.

00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:24.530
But that is extraordinarily rare.

00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:28.580
That's the only one I can think

00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:34.670 position:56%
of that's extraordinarily rare
whereas you can have 12, 13, 14, 15,

00:55:34.670 --> 00:55:38.190
16, 17-year-old kids who read a
book, one book, a single book,

00:55:38.190 --> 00:55:41.710
and go oh, now I know
how my life goes.

00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:43.010
Now I get it.

00:55:43.010 --> 00:55:45.290 position:56%
And whether it's something as
comforting as a gay kid who's afraid

00:55:45.290 --> 00:55:48.120 position:56%
to come out reading a David Levithan
book and goes oh wait, it's safe.

00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:49.420
I can do this.

00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:52.280
Or whether it's, you know, the girl
who read my book and said I want

00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:53.960
to help people and growing
up to be a therapist.

00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:56.760
Whatever it is, I think that's sort

00:55:56.760 --> 00:56:00.840
of the amazing humbling
gratifying thing about the fact

00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:03.840
that teenagers read what I
write is that that's possible.

00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:06.000 position:56%
Whereas, with stodgy adults, I mean,

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.310
you can you can give me
the best book in the world.

00:56:07.310 --> 00:56:09.650
I'm not going to change, I'm not
even going to change my clothes

00:56:09.650 --> 00:56:11.530
after reading it, you know.

00:56:11.530 --> 00:56:14.420
&gt;&gt; Jarrett J. Krosoczka: That's
because you work from home.

00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:17.080
&gt;&gt; Barry Lyga: That's true.

00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:18.380
This is true.

00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:20.390
Odds are, I'm probably
in my pajamas.

00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:22.310
So, yeah.

00:56:22.310 --> 00:56:24.580
&gt;&gt; Jarrett J. Krosoczka: I, you
know, I do hear a lot of stories

00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:28.320
from adults who will share stories

00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:31.270
about how my books turn
their kids on to reading.

00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:34.890
You know, these goofy, silly
books about farm animals who are

00:56:34.890 --> 00:56:38.520
in a punk band or platypuses
that are cops

00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:40.640
or lunch ladies that fight crime.

00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:46.090
But I feel what might be more
pertinent to your question is

00:56:46.090 --> 00:56:49.140
that I think a lot of kids
might be able to see themselves

00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:52.080
in my experience, my
personal experience.

00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:55.890 position:56%
I delivered a Ted Talk a few years
ago where I was very open and frank,

00:56:55.890 --> 00:57:00.180
for the first time publicly,
about my mother's drug addiction.

00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:04.400
About being raised by parents who
were alcoholics, by not knowing

00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:07.320
who my father was, let
alone I didn't know his name

00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:09.030
or what he looked like.

00:57:09.030 --> 00:57:13.630
And so I visit a lot of
schools, and I'll visit schools

00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:16.620
where the tuition is 30,000
a year for elementary.

00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:21.680
I'll visit schools where it's
99% free and reduced lunch.

00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:27.390
And every school I walk into I am
told that there is a kid there,

00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:29.800
and sometimes I get to
meet them on the sly,

00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:33.420
that is in the exact same
position that I was in.

00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:35.910 position:56%
And I've been doing a lot of reading

00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:38.080
up on what the current
statistics are.

00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:44.900
See when I was a kid, I didn't know
other kids had drug addict parents.

00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:49.130
I was the only one being raised
by their grandparents, you know.

00:57:49.130 --> 00:57:52.350
And today about eight million
kids in our country have

00:57:52.350 --> 00:57:55.700
at least one parent that is
suffering from an addiction,

00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:58.610
alcohol or drugs or both.

00:57:58.610 --> 00:58:02.780
And every time I'd put myself
out there either with a Ted Talk

00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:07.720
or a feature on NPR or a
very honest Facebook post,

00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:12.690
I get so many private messages,
sometimes public messages too,

00:58:12.690 --> 00:58:16.680
of people who are just,
they're so relieved

00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:18.340
to know that they weren't alone.

00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:22.210
That this guy who is writing
these books, he has to and had

00:58:22.210 --> 00:58:24.560
to deal with this as well.

00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:29.140
And sometimes they're
people I've known for years,

00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:32.640
and they will then
confide this in me.

00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:35.970
So, will that save a life?

00:58:35.970 --> 00:58:40.460
Perhaps. But certainly, it will
make someone feel less alone,

00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:41.890
and that's always a good thing.

00:58:41.890 --> 00:58:44.980
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: Before Laurie
answers, I wanted to, Jarrett

00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:46.890
and I have become pretty
good friends now.

00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:48.190
We've shared our Ted Talks.

00:58:48.190 --> 00:58:52.720
I also have a Ted Talk on the
life-saving power of books,

00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:54.970
because books did indeed
save my life.

00:58:54.970 --> 00:58:57.190
I'm on sabbatical this year.

00:58:57.190 --> 00:58:58.730
I'm going to be writing my memoir.

00:58:58.730 --> 00:59:01.310
Well, I probably won't
call it my memoir,

00:59:01.310 --> 00:59:04.060
but it will be titled I Could
Have Been a Serial Killer,

00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:05.980
but Instead I'm a Professor.

00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:08.780
Hence, the attraction
to Barry and his work.

00:59:08.780 --> 00:59:14.980 position:56%
But at any rate, I know that books
were a healthy escape option for me.

00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:19.830
And because I could read books,
I could, my vocabulary developed.

00:59:19.830 --> 00:59:21.700
And because I could read books,

00:59:21.700 --> 00:59:23.710
I could read lots of
books on parenting.

00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:28.580
So I was able to break the cycle,
not to complain about my parents,

00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:30.700
but they didn't have a
manual when I was born.

00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:34.510
But we do have manuals now and
books on how to raise kids.

00:59:34.510 --> 00:59:37.830
And I, as a professor,
went to all of them.

00:59:37.830 --> 00:59:42.640
I have the most wonderful son in
the world, who I love and adore.

00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:45.990
And so books do save
lives, change lives.

00:59:45.990 --> 00:59:47.740
And I'm so glad that
we're talking about it.

00:59:47.740 --> 00:59:52.320 position:56%
And I wanted to finish with saying
that when I worked with abused kids,

00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:57.730
the kids, more than anything in
talking with me, said to be able

00:59:57.730 --> 01:00:01.370
to see me as a professor and
happy, they go the message is

01:00:01.370 --> 01:00:03.800
if you've been abused you're
going to become an abuser.

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:06.080
And I go well that's
true, unless you can read

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:08.710
and learn what to do differently.

01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:11.780 position:56%
I said but if you can't read and
you can't learn other ways of being,

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:13.220
you only know what you know.

01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:16.610
And that's what you believe
is normal, and it's not.

01:00:16.610 --> 01:00:17.910
So anyway.

01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:19.890
&gt;&gt; Jarrett J. Krosoczka:
But again, books save lives.

01:00:19.890 --> 01:00:21.400
Comic books save lives.

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:24.280
But also, empty sketch
books save lives.

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:25.580
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: Yeah.

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:26.880
&gt;&gt; Jarrett J. Krosoczka:
Because you can either work

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:30.200
through your feelings, or you can
just create an alternative universe

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:31.880
for you to live in for a while.

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:33.790
So you can either consume
that alternative universe

01:00:33.790 --> 01:00:37.220
or you can create that
alternative universe.

01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:40.180
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Well, I wanted
to say this to you, Jarrett,

01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:46.110
because I remember the day
that I watched your Ted Talk.

01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:48.880
And I have always loved your
books because they're playful

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:51.400
and they make me laugh
so that milk snorts

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:52.810 position:56%
out of my nose and things like that.

01:00:52.810 --> 01:00:56.270
And that's always good.

01:00:56.270 --> 01:00:59.490
But it was a very sobering talk,

01:00:59.490 --> 01:01:05.860
and it was so fulfilling
in such a very deep way.

01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:13.640
And mostly because I felt like
your life as a writer now,

01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:16.330
your happiness, the fact
that you have this baby

01:01:16.330 --> 01:01:21.860
and that you create these joyful
spaces for people, that that is in

01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:23.380
and of itself the message.

01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:27.080
And so kids come up to me all
the time who are in the middle

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:30.740
of being bullied, who find
aggression at school or at home

01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:34.050
or they're in violent
situations at home.

01:01:34.050 --> 01:01:38.560
And they want me to tell them
what to do or how do I solve this.

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:45.900
And the truth is that they
can't un-see the trauma.

01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:48.560
They can't, their life's
work is going to be unpacking

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:50.920
that and making sense of it.

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:55.610
But we can, if we hold
on, get through it

01:01:55.610 --> 01:01:57.570
to the place of happiness.

01:01:57.570 --> 01:02:00.860
And I think that's
what is so powerful

01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:02.720
about your work and your Ted Talk.

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:04.020
And that's it.

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:05.320
That's the end of my
fanning for you.

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:06.620
&gt;&gt; Jarrett J. Krosoczka:
Well thank you.

01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:07.920
I appreciate that.

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:09.220
Thank you.

01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:10.520
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: Laurie.

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:11.820
&gt;&gt; Laurie Halse Anderson: Yeah,
I want to build a little bit

01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:13.120
on what Kekla was saying.

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:14.620
But before I do that, you all have
to read How It Went Down, okay.

01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:16.500
You just have to read this book.

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:19.380
It is a masterpiece of a book.

01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:23.280
It's a very, very important
American story.

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:27.160
Beyond that, if anybody here wants
to learn how to write or wants

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:30.370 position:56%
to learn how to write better, you
need to read that book because it is

01:02:30.370 --> 01:02:35.130
in itself a master class about
writing and point of view.

01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:37.620
And it's just a genius,
genius piece of work.

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:38.920
&gt;&gt; Kekla Magoon: Thank you.

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:42.850
&gt;&gt; Jarrett J. Krosoczka: Can
she print that on the back?

01:02:42.850 --> 01:02:45.480
&gt;&gt; Barry Lyga: Writing it down.

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:47.510
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: There is video.

01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:50.460
[ Laughter ]

01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:52.520
&gt;&gt; Laurie Halse Anderson: But
she was, she brought up something

01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:54.620
that I've experienced a lot too.

01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:57.870
We get these great emails often
written at 3:00 in the morning

01:02:57.870 --> 01:03:01.830
from kids who say, Dear Miss, I
just finished reading your book.

01:03:01.830 --> 01:03:06.050
I haven't finish reading
a book since fourth grade.

01:03:06.050 --> 01:03:08.080
Sometimes third grade, you know.

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:11.970
And that's just such
a great compliment.

01:03:11.970 --> 01:03:16.870
But it makes me wonder that that
to me points out a responsibility

01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:21.250
that this community of people who
love America's children and think

01:03:21.250 --> 01:03:25.620 position:56%
that literacy is a way to strengthen
all of our kids in our country,

01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:28.070
we're failing them a little bit.

01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:31.720
If our kids aren't getting books in
fifth grade that they want to read

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:35.330
to the end and seventh grade that
they want to read to the end.

01:03:35.330 --> 01:03:40.200
And especially for those kids who
are dealing with daily traumas.

01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:43.850
Things like that are often
characterized as escapist fiction,

01:03:43.850 --> 01:03:49.630
graphic novels, comic books,
God forbid fantasy, whatever,

01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:53.440
that gets so judged
often by educators.

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:57.360
You know, that's not quite
what we want, no, is it.

01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:01.510
Here, young person, read
Old Man and the Sea.

01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:04.050
[ Laughter ]

01:04:04.050 --> 01:04:06.880
Please.

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:08.980
&gt;&gt; Jarrett J. Krosoczka: Unless
you're like an old fisherman.

01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:12.540
&gt;&gt; Laurie Halse Anderson: Unless
you're an old, dead white guy

01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:14.160
for whom the book was
written, right.

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:15.670
&gt;&gt; Jarrett J. Krosoczka:
Exactly, yeah.

01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:17.150
The Gordon fisherman.

01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:19.140
&gt;&gt; Laurie Halse Anderson:
That's right.

01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:23.330 position:56%
So I think that when we use the term
save a life, we have to remember

01:04:23.330 --> 01:04:26.730
that there are indeed some readers
whose lives are saved and changed

01:04:26.730 --> 01:04:28.300
because of what they
find in these books.

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:32.050
More significantly, though, is
that especially a young person

01:04:32.050 --> 01:04:36.860
who finds those books that start
to speak to her or his condition,

01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:40.160
and they find that
that's a safe place to go

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:42.370
for whatever their needs are.

01:04:42.370 --> 01:04:45.710
That is a life saved from despair.

01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:49.120 position:56%
Because we all know way too many
adults whose bodies are still alive,

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:52.070
but their spirit's
been gone for decades.

01:04:52.070 --> 01:04:55.660
They are, and they're often living
lives or they're doing hard things

01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:57.490
to themselves and the
people around them.

01:04:57.490 --> 01:05:01.110
So we want to save
lives from despair.

01:05:01.110 --> 01:05:03.920
And that's the function of
literature and storytelling.

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:05.920
And you always know
when you [inaudible]

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:11.170
if you're dealing personally with
something hard, you have somebody,

01:05:11.170 --> 01:05:15.300
that character, to sit next
to you in your discomfort.

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:17.830
To sit next to you in your sorrow.

01:05:17.830 --> 01:05:22.400
And that, just there,
that's often enough.

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:26.830
So I wish that we could, we all
have this responsibility to kind

01:05:26.830 --> 01:05:31.360 position:56%
of scratch our heads a little bit
and figure, start thinking of books,

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:36.490
you know, not as a
way to pass the test.

01:05:36.490 --> 01:05:37.790
Look, I didn't curse, right.

01:05:37.790 --> 01:05:41.850
Because this is being videotaped
and I know, Daddy wouldn't approve.

01:05:41.850 --> 01:05:46.360
But books are that tool.

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:52.350
It's that tool of integrity that
our children are so hungry for.

01:05:52.350 --> 01:05:56.440
And once they know that that tool
is there and it can be trusted,

01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:59.190
because we haven't shoved too
many books that don't speak

01:05:59.190 --> 01:06:00.840
to their condition
down their throats.

01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:03.660
We've allowed them the
dignity of choosing the books

01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:05.570
that are speaking to them, right.

01:06:05.570 --> 01:06:07.120
We're honoring their choices.

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:09.520
We're respecting their choices.

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:14.580
Then, now we start raising a
literate generation of Americans

01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:17.760
who can finally fulfill
their destinies.

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:19.560
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: Thank you.

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:26.110
[ Applause ]

01:06:26.110 --> 01:06:27.530
Now it's your turn.

01:06:27.530 --> 01:06:29.610
This has gone by really
quickly, and we're going

01:06:29.610 --> 01:06:33.470
to give you 20 minutes' worth of
question and answer time from you.

01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:36.400
There are three microphones there.

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:39.310
If you could just kind of line
up there behind the microphone

01:06:39.310 --> 01:06:42.000
that you want to, and
I'll acknowledge you.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:46.320
And we'll get through as many
questions as we possibly can.

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:51.170
So, I'm going to label the
microphones one, two and three.

01:06:51.170 --> 01:06:54.090
We're going to go with
microphone number one first.

01:06:54.090 --> 01:06:55.390
&gt;&gt; Is it on?

01:06:55.390 --> 01:06:56.690
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: Yes.

01:06:56.690 --> 01:06:58.750
Go. If not, I'll repeat you.

01:06:58.750 --> 01:07:00.050
&gt;&gt; Testing, one, two.

01:07:00.050 --> 01:07:01.350
Nope.

01:07:01.350 --> 01:07:02.650
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: Nope.

01:07:02.650 --> 01:07:04.150
&gt;&gt; But I'm loud, so
I'll try to [inaudible].

01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:05.450
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: Now try.

01:07:05.450 --> 01:07:06.750
Okay there, perfect.

01:07:06.750 --> 01:07:08.270
&gt;&gt; So a little bit earlier.

01:07:08.270 --> 01:07:10.170
First of all, I just want
to say thank you so much.

01:07:10.170 --> 01:07:13.440
This is like Christmas for
a high school librarian.

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:18.740
Thank you for this opportunity.

01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:23.570
So earlier there was a question for
Barry Lyga about how does he write

01:07:23.570 --> 01:07:27.290
about a character who's done
something that he's never done.

01:07:27.290 --> 01:07:31.060
I think it was the killer or
the child who shot someone.

01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:33.680
So, and you all do it.

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:38.520
How do we reconcile that with
issues of cultural appropriation

01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:42.740
when we're taking a look at authors
who are writing about someone

01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:48.300
from perhaps an underrepresented
cultural voice

01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:50.740
or some other type of experience?

01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:53.570
And they do not belong
to that group.

01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:55.440
So we talk about their humanity.

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:57.840
Yeah, they're trying to
connect to their humanity.

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:00.250
But then there's always
that other side.

01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:02.650
I was just hoping that some
of you could speak to that.

01:08:02.650 --> 01:08:04.140
Thank you.

01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:05.850
&gt;&gt; Barry Lyga: I worry
about that constantly.

01:08:05.850 --> 01:08:11.370
You know, in the I Hunt Killers
series, Jazz's girlfriend,

01:08:11.370 --> 01:08:13.370
Connie, is African-American.

01:08:13.370 --> 01:08:17.650
And I worried what people
would think of me trying

01:08:17.650 --> 01:08:20.250
to get myself ahead of a
17-year-old black girl.

01:08:20.250 --> 01:08:23.660
Who knows better than me?

01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:29.430 position:56%
In Bang, Sebastian's, the person who
becomes his best friend is Aneesa,

01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:31.040 position:56%
a Muslim girl who has moved to town.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.910
I'm not a Muslim.

01:08:33.910 --> 01:08:36.840
So these are things I worry about.

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:39.700
You know, you hope
that you approach these

01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:42.010
with as much empathy
as humanly possible.

01:08:42.010 --> 01:08:43.850
You do your due diligence.

01:08:43.850 --> 01:08:47.650
You do your work ahead of time.

01:08:47.650 --> 01:08:51.330
And you have to understand
that you're never, number one,

01:08:51.330 --> 01:08:52.920
you're never going
to get it 100% right.

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:55.950
But you're never going to
get anything 100% right.

01:08:55.950 --> 01:09:00.130
And number two, and this is the
toughest lesson for me at least,

01:09:00.130 --> 01:09:02.070
because I'm something
of a perfectionist,

01:09:02.070 --> 01:09:03.670
and I want people to like me.

01:09:03.670 --> 01:09:06.600
You're never going to
make everybody happy.

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:07.930
And I'll give an example.

01:09:07.930 --> 01:09:09.230
I'll take a moment
to give an example.

01:09:09.230 --> 01:09:11.520
In the I Hunt Killers series,
there's moment where Jazz

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:12.820
and Connie are out of town.

01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:14.120
They're in a hotel room together.

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:15.420
They're sleeping.

01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:16.720
Jazz has a nightmare.

01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:18.020
He wakes up, and he looks over
and Connie is next to him in bed

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:22.140
and she's wearing a
silk sleeping bonnet.

01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:25.750
And I read a review of the book,

01:09:25.750 --> 01:09:27.560
something I recommend
authors not do.

01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:32.330
But I read a review of the book
where somebody, this person took me

01:09:32.330 --> 01:09:35.490
to task for othering Connie.

01:09:35.490 --> 01:09:41.990
That bringing up that detail
was making her alien or exotic.

01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:45.130
I should say I have no
idea of the race or gender

01:09:45.130 --> 01:09:46.850
of this person who wrote this.

01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:49.600
I do, however, know the race
and gender of two other people

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:50.900
who wrote to me about this.

01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:53.290
I happen to know they were
both African-American women

01:09:53.290 --> 01:09:56.590
who were thrilled with that moment.

01:09:56.590 --> 01:09:58.860
One, in fact, said when she
got to it she laughed out loud

01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:00.160
because she was reading it in bed

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:01.940
and was wearing her
silk sleeping bonnet.

01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:07.540
And was thrilled beyond belief
that I had bothered to do the work

01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:10.330
and recognize that and
put it into the book.

01:10:10.330 --> 01:10:13.060
And it was at that
point that I went.

01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:16.400
So you can't make everybody happy.

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:18.100
And, you know, if I had
taken that moment out,

01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:19.600 position:56%
I would have pleased the one person,

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:22.170
but these other readers
would have lost something.

01:10:22.170 --> 01:10:27.360
So, I think you, you know,
especially, you know, Jarrett

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:30.140
and I are the straight
white men up here.

01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:33.100
Especially for those of us who have
those privileges, you really have

01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:35.040
to go into it with
a lot of humility.

01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:39.350
And not think, I can do this.

01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:41.460
Which I will admit
early in my career,

01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:43.670
my attitude was, I can do this.

01:10:43.670 --> 01:10:47.460
And it takes a lot of time for
you to realize, you know, what,

01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:50.780
these are people's lives, and you
really have to think about this.

01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:52.540
And I don't know the answer.

01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:55.510
I'm waiting every day for
somebody to come down on me for it.

01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:56.860
I've been lucky so far.

01:10:56.860 --> 01:11:00.940
&gt;&gt; Kekla Magoon: I would say there
are two things I think about.

01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:03.250
Because this is a question
that is asked, you know,

01:11:03.250 --> 01:11:04.830
I'm asked this question often.

01:11:04.830 --> 01:11:08.490
And I have two sort of
conflicting answers, right.

01:11:08.490 --> 01:11:10.920
One is that, you know,
we should all be able

01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:12.220
to write whatever we want, right.

01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:15.370
It's an exercise in empathy to try
and stand in somebody else's shoes

01:11:15.370 --> 01:11:18.010
and write a story that's about
somebody else's experience.

01:11:18.010 --> 01:11:20.440 position:56%
We're always writing about something
slightly different than ourselves.

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:21.930
What lines is it okay to cross

01:11:21.930 --> 01:11:24.220
and what lines is it not
okay to cross gender.

01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:26.170
Okay, I can write about
boys, but can I write,

01:11:26.170 --> 01:11:27.660
you know, a Latino boy, you know.

01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:29.950
All these things, you know,
why does it seem harder for us

01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:31.250
to cross some lines than others.

01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:32.750
These are all good questions.

01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:35.490
I think as writers we should be
able to write anything we want.

01:11:35.490 --> 01:11:36.790
I think we should be
able to experiment.

01:11:36.790 --> 01:11:38.090
We should be able to
try to empathize.

01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:39.390
We should be able to learn.

01:11:39.390 --> 01:11:40.690
I think that's how we grow.

01:11:40.690 --> 01:11:41.990
I think that's how
we build our craft.

01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:46.720
I think the tendency when
people ask this question,

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:49.800
and I don't mean you specifically,
but just the question in general.

01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:53.010
There seems to be an inherent
assumption that if you write

01:11:53.010 --> 01:11:56.360
about a thing, it's going to go out
into the world and be published.

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:58.330
And that's where the question, you
know, the issue comes in, right.

01:11:58.330 --> 01:12:00.680
It's like how does this
book enter the marketplace?

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:04.720
Is it okay for me to talk about
this like sort of publicly, right?

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:06.970
And to me, those are two
separate issues, right.

01:12:06.970 --> 01:12:08.620
What you write about to explore.

01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:10.030
What you write about to learn.

01:12:10.030 --> 01:12:13.440 position:56%
The book that you want, you know, if
there's something burning, you know,

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:14.740
a burning desire to write

01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:16.690
about a particular issue
that's different from yourself.

01:12:16.690 --> 01:12:19.300
But what of that writing
belongs in the marketplace.

01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:21.110
For me, that's a separate question

01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:24.660
because we have a situation right
now in publishing where it's much,

01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:27.920
much easier for white
middle-class Americans,

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:30.830
particularly men, to
get published, right.

01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:33.950
And so what that means is that
there's an inherent assumption,

01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:38.840
right, when, you know, a white
person, let's be general,

01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:41.310
when a white person says, oh I
kind of write across my culture.

01:12:41.310 --> 01:12:43.500
There's an inherent assumption that
that book is going to be published

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:45.120
and that book is going to go
out into the world and that

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:46.870
that book might be criticized
for being out in the world.

01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:50.570
Like those are all sort of
assumptions buried there.

01:12:50.570 --> 01:12:53.620
And I, as a black write, can't
make those same assumptions.

01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:55.380
I can't assume that my book
is going to be published.

01:12:55.380 --> 01:12:59.570
I can't assume that anyone is going
to want that story from me, right.

01:12:59.570 --> 01:13:02.060
And so I think we have to sort of
look at all the different layers

01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:04.750
of what it means to, not just
write, right, because you say

01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:06.480
if I can't write about
anything I want,

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.340
that's sort of censorship
in one way.

01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:11.830
But the marketplace is sort of
already censoring people, right.

01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:14.990
So when we talk about
what's okay to write,

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:16.670
I would argue it's
okay to write anything.

01:13:16.670 --> 01:13:18.790
A separate conversation is
what needs to be published.

01:13:18.790 --> 01:13:20.240
What do we need to hear more of?

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:23.150
And what we're missing right now
is what we're calling own voices,

01:13:23.150 --> 01:13:24.450
right.

01:13:24.450 --> 01:13:25.750
So people writing about
their own experiences.

01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:29.250
And there's going to be, you
know, blurred lines there too.

01:13:29.250 --> 01:13:32.180
I can write a novel about
Malcolm X. He's black,

01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:33.480
so we have that in common.

01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:35.840
But it's different because
he grew up in the 1940s.

01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:37.140
Then he's a man.

01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:39.020
And he became a public figure,
all these things, right.

01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:42.110
So why is that okay and
other things are not okay.

01:13:42.110 --> 01:13:44.190
You know, it's a little bit murky.

01:13:44.190 --> 01:13:48.000
But that's a story that sort
of I got to write, right,

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.570 position:56%
because of my experience and because
of my sort of study of this history,

01:13:51.570 --> 01:13:53.620
right, and what you're talking
about in terms of research

01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:57.810
and putting a lot of sort of
background and experience into it.

01:13:57.810 --> 01:14:03.320
But what I worry about
is when people who come

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:06.330
from a more privileged sort of
position in publishing, right,

01:14:06.330 --> 01:14:10.620
want to sort of tell those stories
because they're needed instead

01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:12.440
of sort of allowing
space for other stories.

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:15.180
So I think those, I think
those should be two separate

01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:16.650
conversations, and they never are.

01:14:16.650 --> 01:14:18.410
They're always one conversation.

01:14:18.410 --> 01:14:22.330 position:56%
Because I think the assumption is if
you write it, it might be published.

01:14:22.330 --> 01:14:27.060
And I think that's where we need
to sort of unpack that difference.

01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:30.130
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: Sir in
the blue shirt, mike two.

01:14:30.130 --> 01:14:33.810
&gt;&gt; Hi, my name's [Inaudible]
Edwards, and I taught for 28 years.

01:14:33.810 --> 01:14:36.460
I guess the mike's not
on, but I'll speak up.

01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:39.200
I taught for 28 years in the
area at Crescent schools.

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:41.150
Now I'm studying positive
psychology at the University

01:14:41.150 --> 01:14:44.560 position:56%
of Pennsylvania, so I've, oh thanks.

01:14:46.110 --> 01:14:51.160
Hi. So I'm really interested in
the intersection between the latest

01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:53.410
in psychology and literature.

01:14:53.410 --> 01:14:54.760
And there are a lot of
great people out there,

01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:57.520
Karen Reivich has done a
lot of work in resilience

01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:59.040
and had a lot of success.

01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:02.210
Someone named Rich Tedeschi,
posttraumatic growth.

01:15:02.210 --> 01:15:04.540
Has anyone heard of
posttraumatic growth?

01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:07.200
These are really important
concepts I think in literature.

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:11.960
And how does kind of the latest
in psychology inform your work,

01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:15.790
especially since you
have such a big impact?

01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:17.450
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: I wish I
could say to you that I'm

01:15:17.450 --> 01:15:20.730
up on all of that research.

01:15:20.730 --> 01:15:24.150
But the fact is that when
I'm writing the story,

01:15:24.150 --> 01:15:31.820
I'm going inside my own
questions that I had growing up.

01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:35.680
Going back to feelings I
had about unresolved things,

01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:37.830
making connections between those

01:15:37.830 --> 01:15:40.030
and what I'm seeing
happening with kids now.

01:15:40.030 --> 01:15:45.500
Like it's not, I'm not
reading the psychology on it

01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:49.270
or teaching practices
and creating text.

01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:53.770
However, in the process
of researching the book,

01:15:53.770 --> 01:15:58.070
any book really, and how would this
character resolve this, etcetera.

01:15:58.070 --> 01:16:00.990
I could speak to that with Burn
Baby Burn, Hector, of course,

01:16:00.990 --> 01:16:05.930
is a character in this book who's
an arsonist who is a young man

01:16:05.930 --> 01:16:10.240
who some readers will write and
say oh that brother, you know.

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:11.540
We hate him.

01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:12.840
He's the bad guy.

01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:17.690
But I think I try to draw a
young man who has mental illness.

01:16:17.690 --> 01:16:21.090
Whose parents have abdicated
their role as his parents

01:16:21.090 --> 01:16:24.720
and who's not getting
medication or care.

01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:28.800
That's what that looks like
when it is allowed to roll.

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:34.760
And so I try to, in any kind
of character that I'm drawing,

01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:37.880
try to draw it with
integrity to the psychology,

01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:39.690
the reality of the person.

01:16:39.690 --> 01:16:44.640
But I wouldn't say that I study it
head-on unless I'm really wresting

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:45.940
with a character.

01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:49.180
For Hector I did sit down
with a psychologist and say,

01:16:49.180 --> 01:16:53.200
when would Hector detach
from his mother?

01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:56.440
And she said, three.

01:16:56.440 --> 01:17:01.940 position:56%
So, if you go back to this book,
you'll see that in pages I'm looking

01:17:01.940 --> 01:17:04.380
for what happened when
Hector was three.

01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:08.810
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: And I think I can
answer, to some degree I can answer

01:17:08.810 --> 01:17:11.290 position:56%
that question as a teacher-educator.

01:17:11.290 --> 01:17:14.340
I think what's happening is
with reader response theory

01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:19.320
in these books that now kids
are disclosing more and more

01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:21.680
than they have ever
done historically

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:25.650
and society that's
ill-equipped to deal with it.

01:17:25.650 --> 01:17:27.530
And so as a result of
that, our schools are

01:17:27.530 --> 01:17:30.770
in a learning curve write now
on how to address these issues.

01:17:30.770 --> 01:17:34.570
But meanwhile, back at the ranch,
one of my doctoral students,

01:17:34.570 --> 01:17:40.170
for example, used Deadline by Chris
Crutcher and did remarkable things

01:17:40.170 --> 01:17:43.220
with a group of students
labeled at risk.

01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:47.120
And when we call them at risk we
mean at risk for failing school.

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:50.550
But mainly because they're
being presented with curriculum

01:17:50.550 --> 01:17:52.670
that doesn't mean a
thing to their lives.

01:17:52.670 --> 01:17:55.410
But you bring in a book like
this that's speaking specifically

01:17:55.410 --> 01:17:56.850
to what's going on, and Deadline

01:17:56.850 --> 01:18:00.700
in particular has this guy
is going to die in a year.

01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:02.800
And so he lives life fully.

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:04.830
And in there there's
a service project,

01:18:04.830 --> 01:18:08.150
and he reads just everything
he can get his hands on.

01:18:08.150 --> 01:18:13.090
And these kids were labeled at risk
modeled their lives after this kid

01:18:13.090 --> 01:18:15.560
and what they would do
and kept journals of it.

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:19.570
Significantly changed these lives
of these kids to the point where,

01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:23.470
ready for this, all of them
graduated from high school,

01:18:23.470 --> 01:18:25.970
and almost all of them
went to college.

01:18:25.970 --> 01:18:28.770
And these kids, according
to predictors,

01:18:28.770 --> 01:18:31.200
would have dropped
out of high school.

01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:34.480
One book. So that's, it's emerging.

01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:36.210
We're living through that.

01:18:36.210 --> 01:18:37.510
So I hope that helps.

01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:39.130
We're at least having
the conversation.

01:18:39.130 --> 01:18:40.430
&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you.

01:18:40.430 --> 01:18:42.470
And I love that you're
going to a psychologist,

01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:44.040
that's great and what's happening.

01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:45.370
Thank you so much.

01:18:45.370 --> 01:18:47.720
&gt;&gt; Hi there.

01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:53.850
Hi there, I'm Karen [inaudible],
and I'm a school counselor.

01:18:53.850 --> 01:18:56.650
So kind of piggybacking off
the theme of mental health

01:18:56.650 --> 01:18:59.310
and the stigma that we're
up against with a lot

01:18:59.310 --> 01:19:00.610
of these mental health disorders.

01:19:00.610 --> 01:19:03.750
So I'm just wondering, because
all of your books present

01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:07.460
such deeply complex issues, what
opportunities might there be

01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:10.800
to partner with like the mental
health community to help, you know,

01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:13.320
our readers to unpack
these very complex issues

01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:15.880
and to process what they're
reading and to really delve

01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:18.010
into the emotions that
they're confronted

01:19:18.010 --> 01:19:21.070
when they read these stories.

01:19:21.070 --> 01:19:23.990
&gt;&gt; Laurie Halse Anderson: In my
experience, it works best when,

01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:26.320
you know, the teachers
have a chance to read ahead

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:27.670
of time, you know, read the book.

01:19:27.670 --> 01:19:31.320
Never read one of these books
first with your students.

01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:34.170
I've heard about that happening

01:19:34.170 --> 01:19:38.020
and it never ends the way
the teacher wants it to end.

01:19:38.020 --> 01:19:42.580 position:56%
But to recognize that, you know, and
it's often that you're always going

01:19:42.580 --> 01:19:47.070 position:56%
to have, you know, in a room of 30
kids, we know statistically how many

01:19:47.070 --> 01:19:49.270
of them have thought
about self-harming.

01:19:49.270 --> 01:19:52.710
How many are struggling with
all these different issues.

01:19:52.710 --> 01:19:55.960
And it's going to feel
very raw for a kid.

01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:59.630
So I have heard from many
teachers who have partnered

01:19:59.630 --> 01:20:01.160
with their school guidance
counselors,

01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:03.500
if their school has
a guidance counselor.

01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:05.210
Or emotional counselor.

01:20:05.210 --> 01:20:09.830
And worked with even health
teachers to make sure, for example,

01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:13.270
that there's posters in
the bathroom, you know,

01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:18.520
over the urinal stalls with
telephone numbers and websites

01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:20.050
where people can reach out.

01:20:20.050 --> 01:20:22.340
And not necessarily put them
in the classroom, right,

01:20:22.340 --> 01:20:23.640
because nobody's seeing that class,

01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:27.300
wants their friends seeing them
writing down that phone number.

01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:30.240
But there's a lot of different
ways a school can be supportive

01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:35.990
of those kids who are struggling
and looking for a place to go.

01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:39.440
But also important, too, I think
for educators to remember is

01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:43.430
that because you have some kids
who are going to be struggling,

01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:48.270 position:56%
it's important to sensitize the kids
for whom this is all new material.

01:20:48.270 --> 01:20:51.520
And that's a really important
life lesson for them to learn

01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:56.010
about how do we have conversations
about these characters,

01:20:56.010 --> 01:20:59.050
whether they're making good
choices, bad choices or whatever,

01:20:59.050 --> 01:21:00.590
in a way that aren't
going to make some

01:21:00.590 --> 01:21:04.560
of those more fragile kids
feel judged or shamed.

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:05.860
Does that make sense to you?

01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:07.160
&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you.

01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:10.340
&gt;&gt; Kekla Magoon: I've definitely
seen that handled really well

01:21:10.340 --> 01:21:14.910
in some alternative schools
and some juvenile facilities

01:21:14.910 --> 01:21:16.510 position:56%
and various places that I've visited

01:21:16.510 --> 01:21:19.360
where they've done really
cool discussion groups around.

01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:23.920
Like [inaudible] for example,
and you know, I've had a couple

01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:26.360
of conversations going in
with either the educators,

01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:28.940
the librarians, about how some
of the material can be triggering

01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:32.040
for those students and how they
have been dealing with that sort

01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:34.950
of separately, right, from my
presentations I'm coming in to talk

01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:37.310
about the material and that.

01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:41.360
I've never had a problem in my
group, right, but it is the kind

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:46.080
of material that can spark somebody
to sort of open something, right.

01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:48.010
And that can go really
well, or it can kind

01:21:48.010 --> 01:21:50.670
of be distressing,
right, to a student.

01:21:50.670 --> 01:21:53.460
And so I've definitely seen some
really creative things happening

01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:57.070
with art, you know,
combining art with the reading

01:21:57.070 --> 01:21:59.970
where they've done collaging
around like some of their feelings

01:21:59.970 --> 01:22:03.250
around the book or pulling
out passages that they like

01:22:03.250 --> 01:22:04.650
or like collaging around
a character.

01:22:04.650 --> 01:22:08.350
And some different things like
that to try to connect different,

01:22:08.350 --> 01:22:11.980
the conversation with sort of
other ways of processing emotion.

01:22:11.980 --> 01:22:13.590
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: And at the
University of South Florida

01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:19.720
where I teach teachers how to teach
English, we do a statistical survey

01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:21.560
of the issues affecting teenagers.

01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:25.420
And then after that, I always
go into where do you go for help

01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:26.840
if something happens and you think

01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:29.160
that your administration
is feeling this kid.

01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:32.250
There becomes a moral issue then
on do you let the kid be failed

01:22:32.250 --> 01:22:36.170
or do you know who to call
for assistance at that point.

01:22:36.170 --> 01:22:37.470
So, thank you for the question.

01:22:37.470 --> 01:22:38.770
Yes mam.

01:22:38.770 --> 01:22:41.910
&gt;&gt; So my question is
about hope and when you

01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:46.710
as writers are crafting stories
about a traumatic experience.

01:22:46.710 --> 01:22:52.490
How conscious are you of crafting
to or writing to a hopeful ending?

01:22:52.490 --> 01:22:57.730 position:56%
Do you feel any obligation, perhaps
especially in the middle grade book,

01:22:57.730 --> 01:23:01.910
to create a hopeful ending or not?

01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:05.960
Or do you feel that hope is perhaps

01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:08.350
like the Bible stories you
were referring to before,

01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:10.680
hope is just a part of
the human experience.

01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:16.000
And so the ending will
sort of resolve itself

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.680
in that direction at any rate.

01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:21.390
&gt;&gt; Laurie Halse Anderson:
I feel a moral obligation

01:23:21.390 --> 01:23:23.250
to write towards hope.

01:23:23.250 --> 01:23:29.100
But I think that's because in
adolescence and even in your 20s,

01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:31.460
you're still point towards hope.

01:23:31.460 --> 01:23:34.710 position:56%
Bad things can happen, terrible,
horrible things can happen to people

01:23:34.710 --> 01:23:38.210
But at that age, you're
still resilient enough

01:23:38.210 --> 01:23:39.750
that you can start reaching.

01:23:39.750 --> 01:23:43.680 position:56%
And the more you have that
experience in hard times of reaching

01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:48.350
for hope, the deeper ingrained
that wonderful habit becomes.

01:23:48.350 --> 01:23:50.660
So that's where my compass points.

01:23:50.660 --> 01:23:52.280
I don't know about you guys.

01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:55.850
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: I feel the same way,
and I also feel like the business

01:23:55.850 --> 01:24:01.040
of growing up is really about
being able to take control

01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:04.480
and have agency, right, over
what's happening to you.

01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:07.840
Over how you're going to respond
to the things that happen to you.

01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:09.470
How you're going to take control.

01:24:09.470 --> 01:24:13.150
So when I'm ending a book, it's
always such a problem, right.

01:24:13.150 --> 01:24:14.780
But when I'm ending a book,

01:24:14.780 --> 01:24:19.210
I feel like the ending
has to be satisfying.

01:24:19.210 --> 01:24:21.970
Nothing has to be tied up perfectly

01:24:21.970 --> 01:24:24.180
because that's now how
problems get solved.

01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:26.690
Sometimes, the solution
is just the best

01:24:26.690 --> 01:24:30.190
of several really lousy
options, right.

01:24:30.190 --> 01:24:32.500
But it has to feel satisfying.

01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:35.810
And I feel like the
character has to move

01:24:35.810 --> 01:24:39.100
to this place where they can speak.

01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:44.110
Or where you get the sense
that they're on the path

01:24:44.110 --> 01:24:47.820
to the next level of saying no.

01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:50.070
This is how it's going
to run for me.

01:24:50.070 --> 01:24:55.060
Do you understand what I mean?

01:24:55.060 --> 01:24:57.960
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: Lady in the back.

01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:02.940
&gt;&gt; Hi. We're from Digital Harbor
High School in Baltimore City.

01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:04.740
I brought my students.

01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:08.410
[ Applause ]

01:25:08.410 --> 01:25:12.030
We got the runaround, so our
children got the last end

01:25:12.030 --> 01:25:18.330 position:56%
of your talk, and because the police
kept sending the bus in circles.

01:25:18.330 --> 01:25:22.410
But we want to know, the students
want to know if you guys do come

01:25:22.410 --> 01:25:25.190
to the schools to talk to students.

01:25:25.190 --> 01:25:29.040
They're very interested in
your stories and your books.

01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:30.340
So.

01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:31.640
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: Field trip.

01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:33.510
&gt;&gt; Barry Lyga: Field trip.

01:25:33.510 --> 01:25:34.860
&gt;&gt; Jarrett J. Krosoczka: How
many seats do you have open

01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:36.160
on the bus for the way?

01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:38.870
&gt;&gt; We have a couple.

01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:40.850
You're welcome to come any time.

01:25:40.850 --> 01:25:42.960
We'd love to have you.

01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:44.850
&gt;&gt; Barry Lyga: Yeah, we all,
I think every single one

01:25:44.850 --> 01:25:46.150
of us does school visits.

01:25:46.150 --> 01:25:49.650 position:56%
I mean, probably easier, we each
have different ways to get in touch,

01:25:49.650 --> 01:25:51.030
but probably start at our websites.

01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:52.330
Does everybody have?

01:25:52.330 --> 01:25:53.630
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yeah.

01:25:53.630 --> 01:25:54.930
&gt;&gt; Barry Lyga: Contact
info on their websites?

01:25:54.930 --> 01:25:56.230
Yeah.

01:25:56.230 --> 01:25:57.530
&gt;&gt; Laurie Halse Anderson:
What's your name please?

01:25:57.530 --> 01:25:58.830
&gt;&gt; My name is Olivia Smith.

01:25:58.830 --> 01:26:00.130
I'm the library media specialist.

01:26:00.130 --> 01:26:01.430
These are my students.

01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:02.730
&gt;&gt; Laurie Halse Anderson: Yay.

01:26:02.730 --> 01:26:04.070
&gt;&gt; So thank you.

01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:06.200
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: And the good
news is that this was recorded,

01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:08.030
so you'll be able to
show this to them.

01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:09.330
&gt;&gt; Excellent.

01:26:09.330 --> 01:26:12.870 position:56%
Thank you so much, and thank you
for the privilege of coming to this.

01:26:12.870 --> 01:26:14.450
&gt;&gt; Laurie Halse Anderson:
We're so glad you guys made it.

01:26:14.450 --> 01:26:17.040
We were worried about you.

01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:18.450
&gt;&gt; John Kaywell: Up front.

01:26:18.450 --> 01:26:19.750
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:26:19.750 --> 01:26:21.050
&gt;&gt; The website's on here.

01:26:21.050 --> 01:26:23.210
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: Oh, the
website's on your program there.

01:26:23.210 --> 01:26:25.360
And that's where you
go to watch the film.

01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:26.660
&gt;&gt; Jarrett J. Krosoczka:
And it'll be

01:26:26.660 --> 01:26:28.730
on the YouTube as well,
I think, right.

01:26:28.730 --> 01:26:30.030
The YouTube?

01:26:30.030 --> 01:26:32.740
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: We're
the YouTube sensations.

01:26:32.740 --> 01:26:36.010
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: Yes mam.

01:26:36.010 --> 01:26:38.980
&gt;&gt; Barry Lyga: Go to YouTube.com.

01:26:38.980 --> 01:26:40.280
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:43.260
So as an author working
on a manuscript based

01:26:43.260 --> 01:26:44.980
in my own childhood trauma.

01:26:44.980 --> 01:26:48.320
I'm really curious how
from a process point

01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:51.580
of view you kind of make it work.

01:26:51.580 --> 01:26:56.590 position:56%
You take the trauma and make it
work for you in your writing process

01:26:56.590 --> 01:27:00.690
versus letting it be
something scary that kind

01:27:00.690 --> 01:27:03.400
of keeps your cursor blinking.

01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:08.340
&gt;&gt; Kekla Magoon: For me I tell
myself there's always revision.

01:27:08.340 --> 01:27:11.830
That's one of the kind of
reminders that is helpful to me

01:27:11.830 --> 01:27:13.660
that the first thing that
comes out doesn't have

01:27:13.660 --> 01:27:15.130 position:56%
to be the way that it ultimately is.

01:27:15.130 --> 01:27:18.460
The first thing that comes out, you
know, nobody ever has to see it.

01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:19.940
That's your sort of
private expression,

01:27:19.940 --> 01:27:21.860
whether it's the cursor
blinking at you

01:27:21.860 --> 01:27:24.460
or whether it's the notebook open.

01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:27.620
You know, sometimes even just
going back and typing the previous,

01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:29.370
retyping the previous paragraph,

01:27:29.370 --> 01:27:30.860
you kind of get back
into the flow of it.

01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:34.920
Things like that remind
yourself what's there.

01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:38.770
And letting it be okay that
it's uncomfortable at times.

01:27:38.770 --> 01:27:42.540
You know, I think we all kind of
write through tears at times or,

01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:45.910
you know, get sort of a I need to
step back now and come back later

01:27:45.910 --> 01:27:47.750
and all of that is okay
and that it unfolds

01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:50.040
in your own time in your own way.

01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:52.420
And I suspect usually the
first draft when you're writing

01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:56.200
from your own experience is
more raw and is less polished.

01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:58.920
And you go back and sort of
figure out what is the story

01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:00.800
from this that I can pull out.

01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:02.350
You know, and it becomes
a separate thing.

01:28:02.350 --> 01:28:05.950
So if you recognize that first
draft as a protected thing

01:28:05.950 --> 01:28:07.250
that nobody's ever going

01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:09.180
to see that's your own
sort of working draft.

01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:11.290
It's your studio, you know.

01:28:11.290 --> 01:28:13.500
It's the rehearsal as
opposed to the performance,

01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:15.840
right, in terms of a play.

01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:19.740
If you can see that as a protected
and safe space for yourself

01:28:19.740 --> 01:28:21.940
to express, I think some
more things will come out.

01:28:21.940 --> 01:28:26.350
And then know that you can mine
that for an actual draft later,

01:28:26.350 --> 01:28:29.220
depending on how far in
the process you are now.

01:28:29.220 --> 01:28:32.030
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: Last
question of the day.

01:28:32.030 --> 01:28:35.260
&gt;&gt; I wrote my question down so I
wouldn't forget what I was going

01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:36.560
to say.

01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:37.860
I wanted to go back to
something that Kekla mentioned

01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:41.330
about soft censorship, about
this parent who won't buy a book

01:28:41.330 --> 01:28:44.020
for their kid or a kid who
self-censors when they see a book

01:28:44.020 --> 01:28:50.640
on display, but they're not sure
they want to take it or not.

01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:53.660
I wonder, how do you as authors
try to reach across that sort

01:28:53.660 --> 01:28:59.080 position:56%
of soft censorship line to get books
that could help children transform

01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:03.440
to those children, even though
they might not necessarily find

01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:06.290
or receive those books?

01:29:06.290 --> 01:29:09.610
&gt;&gt; Laurie Halse Anderson: I
think, in terms of a child

01:29:09.610 --> 01:29:13.360
or a teenager choosing or
not choosing to read a book

01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:17.940
for themselves, that, in my
opinion, is 100% their choice.

01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:22.270
Kids are really, really good at
knowing what they're ready for.

01:29:22.270 --> 01:29:24.920
And sometimes a kid wants to go,
oh, this sounds really interesting

01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:26.800
and then go, yeah, it's not for me.

01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:28.170
And God bless them for doing that.

01:29:28.170 --> 01:29:29.530
That's so smart, right.

01:29:29.530 --> 01:29:31.670
That's self-care, radical
self-care right there.

01:29:31.670 --> 01:29:34.850
So I wouldn't worry at all
about that kind of stuff.

01:29:34.850 --> 01:29:37.890
They get to judge when
they're ready for it.

01:29:37.890 --> 01:29:42.590
In terms of encouraging librarians
and teachers to buy the books

01:29:42.590 --> 01:29:44.700 position:56%
and put them on, I think these kinds

01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:46.080
of conversations are
really important.

01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:48.530
Thank you, again, everybody
for coming and joining us.

01:29:48.530 --> 01:29:51.910
You know, this is the
follow up in social media

01:29:51.910 --> 01:29:53.610
that I hope we'll all
be experiencing

01:29:53.610 --> 01:29:55.360
at the end of this session.

01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:59.530 position:56%
And I think social media in itself,
the ability to reach out and connect

01:29:59.530 --> 01:30:05.270 position:56%
with authors and other readers, to
kind of be strengthened a little bit

01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:09.730
in your role as a gatekeeper to
recognize that actually your job is

01:30:09.730 --> 01:30:14.680
to open the gates to both readers
and books, not to keep them closed.

01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:17.040
What do you think?

01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:19.440
&gt;&gt; Barry Lyga: Yeah, in
a lot of cases, there's,

01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:22.080
in many cases there's very
little we can do as the author.

01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:25.660
I mean, once it's published, so
much of it is out of our control.

01:30:25.660 --> 01:30:29.020
We were talking at lunch about,
you know, we don't even know

01:30:29.020 --> 01:30:33.370
for the most part, did somebody
in Saskatoon buy my book?

01:30:33.370 --> 01:30:35.080
I have no idea.

01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:37.580
You know, did people
in Texas like my book?

01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:39.430
I don't know.

01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:40.730
We don't know that.

01:30:40.730 --> 01:30:44.380
And so I think what the best thing
we can do is make the best book

01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:48.910
possible that hopefully gets
the reviews and the attention

01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:52.730
and the word of mouth
that will make people say,

01:30:52.730 --> 01:30:54.210
I wasn't sure about that.

01:30:54.210 --> 01:30:58.690
But everybody seems to be
saying that this is interesting,

01:30:58.690 --> 01:31:00.560
and this is important,
and this is good.

01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:03.750 position:56%
So maybe, I love the way you put
it, maybe I'll open the gate instead

01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:06.140
of closing the gate for this time.

01:31:06.140 --> 01:31:08.370
&gt;&gt; Jarrett J. Krosoczka:
Which we all are so thankful

01:31:08.370 --> 01:31:12.470
for the brave educators, because
you guys are on the front lines.

01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:15.070
You guys are the ones
that have to have a lot

01:31:15.070 --> 01:31:18.210
of those difficult conversations
face-to-face with people.

01:31:18.210 --> 01:31:21.390
And you want to create
that space for your kids

01:31:21.390 --> 01:31:24.700
so that maybe they can connect
with something they see in

01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:26.510
and of themselves of what they're
going through in these books.

01:31:26.510 --> 01:31:29.730
So thank you for doing
what you guys do every day.

01:31:29.730 --> 01:31:32.400
&gt;&gt; Joan Kaywell: And that's
a nice segue in for me

01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:36.210
to do a little housecleaning
before you thank the authors

01:31:36.210 --> 01:31:38.330
for their wonderful contributions.

01:31:38.330 --> 01:31:42.250
I'm just going to ask if you be
respectful and allow the authors

01:31:42.250 --> 01:31:45.640
to leave here and go down
there so that they can get set

01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:47.690
up for their book signing.

01:31:47.690 --> 01:31:50.010
That way they can go there
in an orderly fashion.

01:31:50.010 --> 01:31:53.430
And their books are going to
be sold out there for you.

01:31:53.430 --> 01:31:56.670
But with that said, now,
will you please join me

01:31:56.670 --> 01:31:58.510 position:56%
in thanking these wonderful authors.

01:31:58.510 --> 01:32:08.500
