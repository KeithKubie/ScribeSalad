00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.639
(Julie Wiskirchen) Hi everybody I'm Julie
Wiskirchen from the Authors Team at Google

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:16.059
and today I'm excited to welcome the, some
of the contributors to "Eat LA," the 2010

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.440
edition of the restaurant guide for food lovers
of Los Angles.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:26.730
I'll just introduce our panel today. First,
we have Amelia Saltsman who's gonna moderate.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.990
She's the author of "The Santa Monica Farmers'
Market Cookbook," a subject dear to our hearts.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.290
An LA native and long-time Santa Monican,
she writes about cooking, markets and food

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.270
for such magazines as "Bon Appetit," and she's
a regular guest on Evan Kleiman's "Good Food"

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.899
show on KCRW.

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:48.399
And we have Linda Burum. She's the author
of "A Guide to Ethnic Food in Los Angeles"

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.140
and an expert on international cuisines. She
writes regularly for such publications as

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.070
the "LA Times" in Los Angeles. She lives in
Santa Monica, but covers all of Southern California

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.730
in her never-ending quest for that great little
market or secret cafe.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.760
Then we have Miles Clements. He writes about
food for the "LA Times," "The District Weekly,"

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.800
and others. He is a Long Beach area resident
and native who also roams the South Bay and,

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.860
indeed, all of LA for his blog, Eat Food With
Me.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.660
And finally we have Pat Saperstein. She's
a savvy sleuth behind LA's best food blog,

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.830
Eating LA. The South Pasadena resident is
also a senior editor at "Daily Variety" and

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.920
in her spare time she writes about restaurants
for the "Los Feliz Ledger" and posts regularly

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.450
on Chowhound.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.500
So please join me in welcoming our panelists.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.500
[applause]

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:43.220
(Amelia Saltsman) Well, thank you. we are
just delighted to be here with you today and

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.130
hope we get lots of good conversation and,
and questions.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:56.690
So the Eat Los Angeles project is the brainchild
of Colleen Dunn Bates who's out of town; last

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.350
day of the college trip with her younger daughter.
I think some of you might have a few memories

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.730
of that.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:14.850
And really the whole idea of this project,
and I keep referring to it as a project because

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:23.040
the book is just one piece as everything must
be these days only there's a whole pie.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:37.010
And this, this really was designed to be a
curated collection of really savvy food resources.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:46.480
You might call it the anti-red covered food
guide. No corporate chains. I think there

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.019
might be a couple of references to maybe Peet's
Coffee, something like that.

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:58.879
But, and not a popularity contest. Basically
Colleen came up with the idea that we all

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:07.999
leapt into with passion, which is we wanted
a book that talked about our city, our county,

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:10.659
that we would wanna use that we could really
trust.

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:22.409
So Colleen put together this team of which
we are four to, to really write all about

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:27.530
everything, [inaudible] every topic, food
topic that you might wanna know about that

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:28.980
we would wanna know about.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:36.239
It's not exhaustive in the sense that it doesn't
cover every single thing, just what we really

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:43.610
like. So, and we're all food writers in the
area. Some of us are even LA natives so we

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:52.640
bring that sort of hip backstory to a lot
of the places that we suss out.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:04:00.519
And do any of you have the first edition?
The last year's? So just to know, just so

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:08.249
you know, you've gotten the new and improved;
250 additional resources, a couple of new

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:09.249
chapters.

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:14.760
One of my favorites is the chapter at the
beginning of the book, "Good Food Neighborhoods."

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:26.790
It really gives you an idea of what a particular,
almost like a micro scene, has to offer; a

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.800
particular swath of Ventura Boulevard in Studio
City that for some reason seems to have an

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:40.570
awful lot of Japanese restaurants; all the
way to neighborhoods in your own backyard.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:48.560
Abbot Kinney, Sawtelle, to field trips. Gee,
I'm finding myself in Artesia, where can I

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.990
go?

00:04:50.990 --> 00:05:03.390
So that's the book and of course with it now
comes eat, I wanna say, eatla.com, and now

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:12.200
the book is completely searchable on the website
which is really nice. And complete with Google

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.780
maps.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:21.160
And let's see, what else have we got? Oh,
and it is, if you have a smartphone it's,

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:28.370
you can do it as, there's a mobile version
and if you have an iPhone right now Eat Los

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:35.120
Angeles is, is an app-like icon. Not quite
all the way to an app.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:42.510
And let's see, of course, we now have a Facebook
fan page and you can follow us on Twitter

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:51.350
and the biggest most recent news is that we
are now gonna be regulars on "Off-Ramp" on

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:57.580
KPCC and I don't remember what time that airs
because whoever listens to anything right

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:03.650
at exactly the time? Just TiVo or Stream or
whatever. So, but you can check that out.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:12.840
So with that I thought what we would do is
each of us could talk a little bit about some

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:18.760
of our latest favorites, discoveries, and
so on, and then we could open it up to discussion

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.610
and questions from you guys unless there's
anything in particular you want us to hit

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:23.860
right off the bat.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:24.860
Anything?

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:32.880
All right. So let's start with Pat and we'll
work our way back up.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:51.250
(Pat Saperstein) Well I wanna talk a little
about the area that my blog kind of specializes

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:52.290
in which is sort of the Silver Lake, Echo
Park, Pasadena, South Pasadena. It's actually

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:53.880
a fairly large area [inaudible].

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:54.880
[pause]

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.550
Basically the Northeast LA-ish area is what
I like to cover the most heavily and I try

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:02.740
to also get downtown as often as I can, although
I'm still not a downtown expert because so

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:08.370
many places keep opening that, down, downtown
that I can't even keep up with them.

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:13.520
But a couple of the places that I would love
to point out that have opened fairly recently

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:23.150
are in Silver Lake. Forage is a great new
place that has really fresh vegetables and

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:30.090
wonderful baked goods and just really nicely
cooked quiches and all different kinds of

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:31.090
things.

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:32.090
[inaudible audience question]

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.510
Well, it's on the website. I think it opened
after the book came out.

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:42.110
And the really novel thing about it is if
you grow food in your garden you can also

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:47.650
bring it to them on Sunday afternoons and
they will, if they like your produce, they'll

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:51.900
accept it and they'll give you some credits
to eat at the restaurant and they'll incorporate

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.110
your produce into their meals.

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:59.690
So that's kind of a fun and different approach.
Although I heard that there could be some

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:04.520
problems with the city over that. So I'm not
sure exactly how that's gonna work out for

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.890
them, but I hope that they're able to keep
doing it.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:11.590
Like the day I was in there they had lemonade
made from the lemons from someone's garden

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:16.500
in Echo Park and it's just a really nice way
to, for them to get involved with the community.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:22.840
But it's also just a higher level of cooking
than most of the places that you see in Silver

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:29.080
Lake, which for some reason seems to attract
kind of mediocre restaurants in a lot of cases.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:34.610
But I think it's more like a Tartine in San
Francisco with just really great attention

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:39.879
to the way they bake and -the flavors that
they bring out in the vegetables and everything.

00:08:39.879 --> 00:08:47.019
And it's just a small place that used to be
a bakery; bring your own wine, nothing, nothing

00:08:47.019 --> 00:08:53.220
fancy; order at the counter, but just a really
good example of kind of the new wave of places

00:08:53.220 --> 00:09:00.140
that pay a lot of attention to local ingredients
but also to making the food taste really good.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:06.860
So that's- one place. Forage. And their website
is foragela.com and they have like a completely

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:12.889
changing menu everyday. So it's, it's a really
interesting place.

00:09:12.889 --> 00:09:20.009
And another place that I've really been liking
lately is CaCao Mexicatessen in Eagle Rock.

00:09:20.009 --> 00:09:27.230
It's a just a kinda also a pretty informal
Mexican place but it's not like any typical

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:32.890
Mexican place. It's not like just a burrito
joint or it's not like a taco truck, it's

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:40.680
kind of a higher level of food, but without
being like an expensive gourmet Mexican kind

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:45.720
of spot like the places downtown; just informal
but really great things.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.980
They've been having venison tacos lately.
I haven't tasted those yet, but I did, their

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:56.670
duck carnitas are just amazing especially
for people who don't eat pork, it's just,

00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:01.110
they're just as good as any pork carnitas
that you could have.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:07.480
And they also do homemade Mexican desserts
and all kinds of Mexican coffee drinks with

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:12.930
dulce de leche coffee drinks and things like
that that are really great. And they make

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:17.509
homemade tortillas you, that you can take
home with you, make your food at home and

00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:21.470
so it's, it's a really great resource also.

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:26.449
And then the other thing I, I really like
to talk about is beer. And we also have another

00:10:26.449 --> 00:10:30.720
writer that contributes to Eat Los Angeles,
Jenn Garbee who writes a lot about beer for

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:36.589
the " LA Times" and other places, but we're
both into beer and the beer scene is really

00:10:36.589 --> 00:10:42.120
exploding in LA recently and it's a great
thing because we've been waiting years and

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.120
years.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:47.230
For years there was just Father's Office on
Montana, was almost one of the only places

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:52.209
you could get good beer in the whole city
and now every neighborhood has a couple of

00:10:52.209 --> 00:10:53.559
great beer places.

00:10:53.559 --> 00:10:59.730
In West Hollywood, The Surly Goat just opened
which has a really amazing selection of beers

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:06.449
and that's owned by the same person as the
Verdugo Bar in EagleÉ, in, yeah, in Eagle

00:11:06.449 --> 00:11:12.450
Rock Glassell Park area which is one of my
favorite beer places and they have one of

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:18.600
the only real beer gardens in town. They don't
have a kitchen, but with the advent of the

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:24.339
food trucks and everything, they've been having
food available on, at their beer garden everyday,

00:11:24.339 --> 00:11:29.180
or people who just barbecue out on the patio
and they're open all afternoon on Saturdays

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:30.180
and Sundays.

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:34.069
People play board games and just hang out
and drink beer and it's really fun; it's the

00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:39.269
kind of place that I think LA has needed for
a long time and hasn't had very many of.

00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:46.589
(Amelia Saltsman) I, I should mention that
on the website, that's the place to go for

00:11:46.589 --> 00:11:52.110
all the latest updates, deals, events, groupons,
the whole thing.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:53.110
(Pat Saperstein) [chuckles]

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:57.449
(Amelia Saltsman) So, we're constantly feeding,
feeding the- mob.

00:11:57.449 --> 00:11:58.449
(Pat Saperstein) [chuckles]

00:11:58.449 --> 00:12:00.209
(Amelia Saltsman) I couldn't think of any
other word and I just went --

00:12:00.209 --> 00:12:01.209
(Pat Saperstein) [gasping]

00:12:01.209 --> 00:12:07.850
(Amelia Saltsman) Okay. So maybe we, we hear
from Miles and then we can come back if --

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:13.269
(Miles Clements) Okay. I'm gonna talk a little
about the South Bay which is where I do most

00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:16.439
of my coverage for the "Times" and for the
book as well.

00:12:16.439 --> 00:12:22.899
And kind of taking up where Pat left off,
one of the kind of bigger trends in the South

00:12:22.899 --> 00:12:26.749
Bay has been kind influx of gastro pubs which,
depending on how you look at it, is either

00:12:26.749 --> 00:12:35.149
a restaurant with a bar or a bar with a restaurant
inside and, they're usually very beer focused

00:12:35.149 --> 00:12:39.809
and lots of craft beers, lots of local beers.

00:12:39.809 --> 00:12:45.040
One of the, I don't know, maybe, more popular
ones is Simmzy's in Manhattan Beach. It's

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:49.940
basically kind of standard American; kind
of up scale, more focused burgers. There's

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:57.660
more attention paid to the food. They have
a really good pulled pork panino that they

00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:02.269
braise the pork overnight in sherry vinegar
and put it in the sandwich and press it. It's

00:13:02.269 --> 00:13:06.139
crispy, fatty, really good.

00:13:06.139 --> 00:13:10.910
The other place is still relatively new. It's
called Hudson House. It's in Redondo Beach.

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:15.721
It's from the same owners as Beachwood in
Venice. And they have, I would say, a little

00:13:15.721 --> 00:13:18.759
bit more of a global skew towards things.

00:13:18.759 --> 00:13:24.259
You can still get burgers and such and they
have a good one it's on a pretzel bun. But

00:13:24.259 --> 00:13:31.249
they also have, if I recall this, ground,
ground lamb skewers which are on sugar cane.

00:13:31.249 --> 00:13:36.790
They roast them over the fire and they have
a yogurt harrisa dipping sauce that's got

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:40.410
a little bit of a heat also.

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:43.452
And there's some other ones that you can find
in the book. I'm not going to go into too

00:13:43.452 --> 00:13:49.660
much details; they all kind of pull from the
same themes. But I would say that probably

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:54.120
the other thing in the South Bay, especially
Torrance, is really known for is Japanese

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.470
food.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:14:01.800
And they have great sushi places, great ramen
houses, but it goes a lot beyond that. And

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:07.959
one of the places that I like a lot is called
Torihei, which essentially is an Izakaya but

00:14:07.959 --> 00:14:13.480
they have basically two parallel menus: one
is a yakitori menu, so grilled chicken parts,

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:19.639
any kind of part you could imagine; and the
other is oden, which is a soupy stew that

00:14:19.639 --> 00:14:23.779
is usually a bunch of different ingredients
in one, and it's usually kind of a homey dish

00:14:23.779 --> 00:14:27.649
and here they separate it out into kind of
an ala carte menu. You can get really, these

00:14:27.649 --> 00:14:34.490
really precise dishes with like a soft-boiled
egg that's topped with salmon roe and it's

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:38.879
just, it's really, I don't know, clear and
flavorful cooking.

00:14:38.879 --> 00:14:43.819
(Amelia Saltsman) You know we, I see that
we're totally, we must be hungry?

00:14:43.819 --> 00:14:44.819
(Miles Clements) [chuckles]

00:14:44.819 --> 00:14:49.240
(Amelia Saltsman) because we're totally focused
on restaurants and one of the things that

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:56.959
I love about this book, because I use it all
the time, is that there, it's not just about

00:14:56.959 --> 00:15:01.459
restaurants, it's about stores, it's about
kitchen supply places.

00:15:01.459 --> 00:15:07.040
I was just thinking, Miles, as you mentioned
Torrance and right away I have Marukai --

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.319
(Miles Clements) Um-hum.

00:15:08.319 --> 00:15:13.449
(Amelia Saltsman) Has anybody been to Marukai?
I mean you can buy furniture, you can buy

00:15:13.449 --> 00:15:19.360
food, I mean it's amazing. So you're going
to find all of those. This is all about everything.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:24.370
(Miles Clements) Right. And along those same
lines you can obviously, you can get a lot

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:26.560
of great food in those stalls in those same
markets too.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:34.269
But the food, as I was going to say, the Japanese
food really does sprand, spread a huge variety.

00:15:34.269 --> 00:15:40.889
There's a really great dessert, dessert shop/bakery
in Lomita called Patisserie Chantilly which

00:15:40.889 --> 00:15:49.179
is basically a French Japanese bakery. And
again I would say it's one of the top Japanese

00:15:49.179 --> 00:15:52.530
bakeries in kind of the greater LA area and
they put a lot of care into their dishes.

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:57.769
They have really, really great cream puffs.
They do one with a sesame cream, a black sesame

00:15:57.769 --> 00:16:02.209
cream. So it has kind of a smokiness of the
black sesame and it's, they're these huge

00:16:02.209 --> 00:16:03.939
things that are like the size of hamburgers.

00:16:03.939 --> 00:16:11.199
But, and, one more thing before I pass it
off onto Linda, is that if you also find yourself

00:16:11.199 --> 00:16:16.809
in the, at some of the farmer's markets on
the South Bay in Torrance or El Segundo there's,

00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:19.790
they have a lot of great vendors there and
one of them whose been kind of building a

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:21.889
huge web presence lately is Bigmista's Barbecue.

00:16:21.889 --> 00:16:23.920
(Pat Saperstein) And he goes, and he goes
to Atwater --

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:28.949
(Miles Clements) He also goes to Atwater Village,
yeah, and he's a, he's a big web guy. He's

00:16:28.949 --> 00:16:33.189
on every possible social networking thing
you can imagine. You can text him orders and

00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:37.550
he's big, his, he doesn't really have a style
of barbecue per se, even though he grew up

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:42.449
in Texas he's learned a lot from other people,
but he's kind of become fairly well known

00:16:42.449 --> 00:16:49.190
for pig candy which is basically bacon smoked
with brown sugar and cayenne until it gets

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:50.571
sweet and spicy and --

00:16:50.571 --> 00:16:51.571
(Pat Saperstein) Definitely one of theÉ

00:16:51.571 --> 00:16:52.571
(Miles Clements) Yeah.

00:16:52.571 --> 00:16:53.571
(Pat Saperstein) Éprobably the best thing
I've eaten in the lastÉ

00:16:53.571 --> 00:16:54.571
(Miles Clements) [laughs]

00:16:54.571 --> 00:16:57.009
(Pat Saperstein) Étwo months, which is that
one strip of one dollarÉ

00:16:57.009 --> 00:16:58.009
(Miles Clements) Yeah.

00:16:58.009 --> 00:16:59.009
(Pat Saperstein) Écandy.

00:16:59.009 --> 00:17:00.009
(Miles Clements) ThereÉ

00:17:00.009 --> 00:17:01.009
(Pat Saperstein) Certainly the best dollar
I'veÉ

00:17:01.009 --> 00:17:02.009
(Miles Clements) [laughs]

00:17:02.009 --> 00:17:03.009
(Pat Saperstein) Éspent anywhere.

00:17:03.009 --> 00:17:05.329
(Miles Clements) It's uh, it's worth the,
the trip if you guys can make it out there.

00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:06.329
[pause]

00:17:06.329 --> 00:17:11.529
(Linda Burum) Well, hi. I thought I'd concentrate
on West LA a little bit since some of you

00:17:11.529 --> 00:17:16.990
are from here. And speaking of stores, we
were just talking about J &amp; T on Wilshire

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:21.679
Boulevard. J &amp; T Gourmet at, it's about 10th
Street on the north side.

00:17:21.679 --> 00:17:27.089
I'm sorry to tell you I didn't bring, that's
in the book, so you can look that one up.

00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:31.590
But you can also Google all these things and
I'm sure you'll find them.

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:32.590
(Amelia Salsman) Topeka.

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:33.590
[laughter]

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:38.251
(Linda Burum) Anyway, J &amp; T is fun because
they make their own, they cure their own hams

00:17:38.251 --> 00:17:44.590
and they make their own hams; they have like
a little, the two guys are from Hungary -- where

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:49.120
do they Ð no, they're from Poland, sorry.
They make, they have all these Polish sausage

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:55.520
hanging in the, in behind the butcher case
and then they have softer sausages in the

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:59.019
case, but they make them all themselves including
the dry cured ones.

00:17:59.019 --> 00:18:07.710
Then over in the freezer you find those dumplings
and stews in, frozen, and then they have a

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:13.990
fish case with some cured fish and butter
from Europe and it's just kind of -- if you

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:19.159
do your own thing. Unfortunately they stopped
making sandwiches which is really sad. [looking

00:18:19.159 --> 00:18:21.791
at microphone] Is this on? Yes, I guess.

00:18:21.791 --> 00:18:28.960
So I made this little list of things that
I found around LA, around West LA that, 'cause

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:36.669
I thought, "Well, you guys are all here."
I did a piece on Izakaya about, I don't know,

00:18:36.669 --> 00:18:42.340
two or three years ago before everybody, everybody
had one in their neighborhood. And they were

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:48.700
kind of underground places at that time. I
mean, very few people had even known the term

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:56.250
I suppose. But around here along Sawtelle
you can find --How-how many people are from

00:18:56.250 --> 00:19:02.220
this part of town that grew up here and know
the area that well? Oh good.

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:06.870
Well, that means that the rest of you will
benefit from this because you probably won't

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:14.159
know them that well. But Furaibo, it started
out as a fried chicken place in, in Gardena

00:19:14.159 --> 00:19:20.519
and then they, well actually they have branches
in Tokyo but, and all over Japan, but they

00:19:20.519 --> 00:19:25.809
do this wonderful fried chicken; they do wings;
they do breasts; and they have funny names

00:19:25.809 --> 00:19:31.059
like The Jane and The Tarzan for different
parts of the animal which they deep fry.

00:19:31.059 --> 00:19:38.630
But more than that it's a pub with all kinds
of sake, all kinds of soju, and all kinds

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:44.039
of little dishes and you can, like all Izakaya,
they're just places where you can order a

00:19:44.039 --> 00:19:46.040
little of this and a little of that and drink
and hang out.

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:49.750
(Amelia Saltsman) It is kind as, are they
Japanese gastro pubs?

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:51.519
(Linda Burum) Yeah, essentially.

00:19:51.519 --> 00:20:00.340
And speaking of that, Musha on Wilshire, M-u-s-h-a,
is a more, what shall we say, au courant type

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:07.130
in that they do more global tidbits. They're,
they're still fairly Japanese but they're

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:17.769
a little more influenced from other cultures.
So that's a good place to know. Also Wakasan

00:20:17.769 --> 00:20:26.250
on Westwood Boulevard, they do a little prix
fixe. It used to be $25 plus whatever liquor

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:33.639
you bought, but now it went up to 35 I understand.
And that, that's very, very purist Japanese

00:20:33.639 --> 00:20:34.639
I would say.

00:20:34.639 --> 00:20:39.510
People come in. They spend the night. They
buy their bottle of soju, but you can get

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:47.570
individual glasses also. And they serve a
multi-course dinner which is about 10 courses.

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:52.799
In this case you don't choose your own like
Furaibo and these other places, but you just

00:20:52.799 --> 00:20:59.190
go with what they have and it's very light,
very delicate food, very, it's enough by the

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:05.790
time if you're a hungry guy you'll, you won't
starve. But it's very refined kind of food

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:08.919
and it's interesting that you get this progression
of courses.

00:21:08.919 --> 00:21:17.950
And then Sasaya on Santa Monica Boulevard
right near, kinda near Sawtelle, is, they,

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:25.730
it's more of a raucous down-home, salary man-type
place with crab cakes and little dishes of

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:30.990
pork belly and all kinds of vege-vegetable
dishes in small plates.

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:40.000
Once again you get, you can have, I think
they for sure have beer, wine, soju and maybe,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.620
maybe hard liquor but I don't remember that,
if you'll pardon me.

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:44.620
(Amelia Saltsman) I think we need to --

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:45.620
(Linda Burum) Wrap it up?

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:46.620
(Amelia Saltsman) We need to save, I think
we need to save the rest forÉ

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:47.620
(Linda Burum) Okay.

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:48.620
(Amelia Saltsman) Éfor the next piece.

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:52.149
(Linda Burum) I just want to say that you
should, how many of you have been at, down

00:21:52.149 --> 00:21:58.889
on Sawtelle Avenue? Yeah, well you know then.
Most of you who haven't gone, it's a real

00:21:58.889 --> 00:22:06.299
field trip because it's lined with, it's lined
with all kinds of Japanese places from tofu

00:22:06.299 --> 00:22:15.830
specialists to places like Blue Marlin which
is crossover food and, of course, Hide Sushi

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:17.010
is famous. Okay.

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:26.150
(Amelia Saltsman) Do you know that Los Angeles
has, historically, three, four, the LA area,

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:27.870
four JapaneseÉ

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:31.340
(Linda Burum) ÉJapanese enclaves...

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:35.720
(Amelia Saltsman) Éenclaves. There's Little
Tokyo downtown. There's Sawtelle, that's the

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:42.929
Sawtelle area. There's Torrance and there's
also I guess what is now called, what I guess

00:22:42.929 --> 00:22:50.570
would be called East Hollywood. Sort of it's
not, if like by Virgil and Melrose that area

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:58.519
I think it's, it, there's a lot of Latin,
Latinos there now, but in the '50s and then

00:22:58.519 --> 00:23:06.900
before the internment in of Japanese Americans
in, of, during World War II, that area was

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:13.090
a very important,
it was called Little Tokyo West. So we have

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:24.460
this, these things that seem like new are
not so new sometimes. And people from outside

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:29.720
of LA, I think, don't understand the depth
that there is to LA because it is so big and

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:36.590
sprawling. It's this wonderful patchwork of
neighborhoods and ambiences, but there's a

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:39.529
lot of heft there; there's a lot of substance.

00:23:39.529 --> 00:23:40.529
Well I --

00:23:40.529 --> 00:23:45.429
(Linda Burum) The Japanese used to do, I'm
going to cut in here. They were big in agriculture

00:23:45.429 --> 00:23:46.940
right in the city. So that's --

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:47.940
(Amelia Saltsman) Yes.

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:52.480
(Linda Burum) you have Sawtelle, they used
to do floral gardens. There were bean fields,

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.480
celery --

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:54.480
(Amelia Saltsman) Right. Celery --

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.130
(Linda Burum) celery fields and that's why
we had --

00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:58.130
(Amelia Saltsman) And strawberries.

00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:02.450
(Linda Burum) Yeah. And then also the workers,
there would be these hotels that were just

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:09.120
for men 'cause the men used to come over from
Japan and work the fields that their friends

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:14.669
owned; relatives and friends. It was just
like a little network and the hotels eventually

00:24:14.669 --> 00:24:18.320
turned into what Sawtelle is today with the,
the places to eat.

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:23.779
But it was like boarding houses in those days.
That was pre-, the pre-war. And then after

00:24:23.779 --> 00:24:27.510
the war when people got out of the internment
camps they came back there because there was

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:32.830
a Buddhist temple, there were churches, there
were places that people who had lost everything

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:41.279
could at least get a bed. And then eventually
they evolved into getting their lives back

00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:42.279
together.

00:24:42.279 --> 00:24:46.889
(Amelia Saltsman) Well, I thought that I would
just tell you what I found at the market this

00:24:46.889 --> 00:24:53.509
week and what's coming. I did a little, a
little scouting. Right now do--How many of

00:24:53.509 --> 00:25:01.370
you shop at farmer's markets? Ooh, nice. How
many of you shop at Santa Monica, anyone of

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:05.470
the Santa Monica markets? Throw out some names
of other markets that you go to.

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:07.231
(voice in audience) Hollywood.

00:25:07.231 --> 00:25:08.231
(Amelia Saltsman) Hollywood.

00:25:08.231 --> 00:25:09.231
Venice, did somebody say Venice? Oh I love
that market.

00:25:09.231 --> 00:25:10.580
(voice in audience) West LA.

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:13.670
(Amelia Saltsman) West LA, the one at on,
um --

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:15.220
[inaudible]

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:19.019
oh, okay. Oh, okay, okay.

00:25:19.019 --> 00:25:22.320
Anybody go to the Mar Vista Market or Playa
Vista? Yeah.

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.529
Okay, great.

00:25:24.529 --> 00:25:33.220
Anyway, what I found this week: purple sprouting
broccoli. Has anybody tried that? It is amazing

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:38.909
and I have a story about that because I helped
Alex Weiser get the seed for that and, just

00:25:38.909 --> 00:25:46.750
so you know, we got it through, with the help
of Jamie Oliver. And it's very nutty; it's,

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:52.980
it's, and it, there's nothing new about purple
vegetables; those are, those have been around

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:58.480
for a really long time. Purple asparagus is
really big right now from the Zuckerman's.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:06.190
There's one farmer who comes just briefly.
Most of the farmers at local certified farmer's

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:13.679
markets are really from within anywhere from
10 to 150 miles; some of them maybe a couple

00:26:13.679 --> 00:26:20.799
of hundred miles, but occasionally those are
the regular farmers. But even in this sprawling

00:26:20.799 --> 00:26:23.429
community of LA.

00:26:23.429 --> 00:26:29.690
But there are a few farmers that come just
for very brief time from farther away. So

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:35.230
Zuckerman's comes from the Sacramento Delta
and they have this, they have amazing asparagus

00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:45.230
including purple asparagus which is super
sweet. And has been around, chefs have been

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:51.960
writing about it for 130 years in Los Angeles.
So, it's, it's definitely not new, it's a

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.720
lot older than that.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:27:03.330
What else did I see? Oh, next week lilacs
are coming. If you like flowers. And two week,

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:09.159
in two weeks we're going to start seeing early
cherries. So be on the lookout for that. What

00:27:09.159 --> 00:27:10.570
else did I spot?

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:19.130
Oh, my big find this week: French leeks from
Windrose Farms. The leeks are, the white part

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:26.379
is probably, maybe, 12 to 18 inches, just
snowy white and tender. You can even use some

00:27:26.379 --> 00:27:32.970
of the darker green part. And what I did was
I just sauteed them like really sweetly, low,

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:39.549
low heat and I threw in some English peas
which are amazing right now and some fresh

00:27:39.549 --> 00:27:44.659
mint. Everything green is incredible right
now. And oh it was so good! And then I had

00:27:44.659 --> 00:27:51.169
a farmer's market egg on top with a little
ricotta cheese. It was really awesome.

00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:57.830
The other thing that is coming are Galante
strawberries. There is one farmer who grows

00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:03.429
Galantes, Jerry Rutiz, and he's at the market,
the Santa Monica Market on Wednesdays, and

00:28:03.429 --> 00:28:06.500
there is an interesting story to that but
I'm not going to take your time with that

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:10.419
now. So you'll have to read that story in
my book, if you have my book.

00:28:10.419 --> 00:28:17.120
So, let's, any questions? 'Cause I also, I
actually have a couple of questions for the

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.350
panel. So, yes.

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:20.020
[pause]

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:34.880
(Male #1 in audience) Thank you for coming.
I noticed that, I mean each of you has your

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:39.309
kind of pet areas, but even in the book there
are some areas of LA that just seem chronically

00:28:39.309 --> 00:28:46.139
left out, like the West Valley, for example.
It's probably got one of the smallest sections

00:28:46.139 --> 00:28:50.559
in the kind, in the area. It doesn't have,
at least according to this book, any specialized

00:28:50.559 --> 00:28:55.389
neighborhoods or anything like that. But there's
tons of great food there. Is there any reason

00:28:55.389 --> 00:28:56.620
it always gets left out?

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:59.490
(Amelia Saltsman) We're working on it. And
we would like to hear from you.

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:04.639
(Linda Burum) I'll tell you why, also, is
that there's so much, pardon me, there's just

00:29:04.639 --> 00:29:08.590
so much around. I know there's a lot of Arabic
restaurants around there.

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:15.759
Rosita Boulevard which I guess starts the
area and then it goes West on and there's

00:29:15.759 --> 00:29:21.140
heaps of Indian, especially in Northridge,
and you have the giant Korean market out there

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:29.129
in Northridge called, do you know the name?
Galleria. And then they have a little food

00:29:29.129 --> 00:29:36.289
court and we know it's there, but there, it's
just when you're doing the book it's so overwhelming

00:29:36.289 --> 00:29:41.240
and we go, "Well, what's the most important
thing to put in?" So we'll start thinking

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:47.779
more about that. I think the Galleria is out
there. But, you know, once you have one Korean

00:29:47.779 --> 00:29:55.929
market, even though there is 20 big supermarkets,
in a book like this, one serves the purpose

00:29:55.929 --> 00:29:59.900
because you can, if you have to pick one or
two that's all you get.

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:03.710
(Male #1 in audience) I think we kind of,
we kind of look to you to tell us which one

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:07.480
is the, we know, of the 20, which are the
two or three that we should go to?

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:08.480
(Amelia Saltsman) Exactly.

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:09.480
(Male #1 in audience) Which are the few we
should avoid?

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:13.809
(Amelia Saltsman) So, what we would, we would
love to hear from you. Anybody in fact, I

00:30:13.809 --> 00:30:23.799
mean you generally. We're looking for hot
tips andinterest. So, definitely, communicate

00:30:23.799 --> 00:30:27.750
through via the website; we're taking notes.
So I got West Valley.

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:29.760
Any other --

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:30.760
Yes.

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:31.760
[pause]

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:41.279
(Amelia Saltsman) And if you want to direct
the question to a particular team member,

00:30:41.279 --> 00:30:42.279
please do.

00:30:42.279 --> 00:30:47.240
(Female #1 in audience) I just moved here
like a week ago so this is real useful because

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.690
I had no idea where to start.

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:49.690
(Linda Burum) From where?

00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:51.610
(Female #1 in audience) From San Francisco.
So--

00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:52.610
(Amelia Saltsman) We have great food here.

00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:55.720
(Female #1 in audience) Okay. That's what
I've heard.

00:30:55.720 --> 00:31:02.679
I'm really looking for, I live in Santa Monica.
I'm really looking for, like, just local fresh

00:31:02.679 --> 00:31:06.380
artisan, rustic bread. Is that somewhere?

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:09.720
(Amelia Saltsman) Yes. I can answer that in,
two:Huckleberry--.

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:12.070
(Female #1 in audience) Okay.

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:21.010
(Amelia Saltsman) on Wilshire and 10th right
next door to Santa Monica Seafood. But Huckleberry,

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:32.220
Zoe Nathan is an amazing pastry chef and bread
maker and you will find incredible bread;

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:37.919
so that's the newest one. In fact, Huckleberry's
just starting, it's their sort of bakery arm

00:31:37.919 --> 00:31:45.080
they have, they own Rustic Canyon as well,
the restaurant, which has great beer and wine.

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:49.460
And also cooks seasonally and supports the
farmer's market.

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:57.480
But Huckleberry just started having a family
dinner night on Thursdays. That's a new thing.

00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.549
So that might be fun; probably long tables.

00:31:59.549 --> 00:32:02.630
(Female #1 voice in audience) Is there another
venue like [inaudible]

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:09.049
(Amelia Saltsman) Yes, on Pico. There is sort
of a classic French baguette and croissant

00:32:09.049 --> 00:32:11.360
bakery on Pico and Lincoln.

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:20.100
(Linda Burum) You know, Bay City's Italian
has good bread for sandwiches. There's all

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:24.580
these have their own style. And I, they bring
it in three times a day. It's still warm when

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:30.679
you buy it. So if you're looking for a baguette-type
thing that, for good sandwiches of course

00:32:30.679 --> 00:32:37.139
they're famous for that, sandwiches. The bread
itself is inexpensive and good. And--

00:32:37.139 --> 00:32:40.299
(Pat Saperstein) [inaudible] on Third Street
[inaudible]

00:32:40.299 --> 00:32:41.659
(Amelia Saltsman) Right.

00:32:41.659 --> 00:32:42.659
-

00:32:42.659 --> 00:32:49.809
(Pat Saperstein) It's very good, but that
is one thing that LA is not quite up to [inaudible]

00:32:49.809 --> 00:32:50.809
so [inaudible]

00:32:50.809 --> 00:32:51.970
(Amelia Saltsman) Well, and let's --

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:56.970
(Pat Saperstein) more gently [inaudible]

00:32:56.970 --> 00:32:59.289
(Amelia Saltsman) Well, and --

00:32:59.289 --> 00:33:03.559
(Pat Saperstein) and if you're around Third
Street or Century City area [inaudible]

00:33:03.559 --> 00:33:08.629
(Amelia Saltsman) Well, and let's not forget
the great classic La Brea. I mean it's still,

00:33:08.629 --> 00:33:14.490
particularly if you get, if you can get La
Brea bread from, at the, at the source even

00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:18.460
at La Brea Bakery on, on, on La Brea.

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:20.490
I would like to get some more questions.

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:21.490
Yes.

00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:25.220
(Male #2 in audience) This is for any or all.
I'm curious about the process when you're

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:29.929
gonna review something or consider it for
inclusion in the book. Do you go with a group

00:33:29.929 --> 00:33:34.210
and trade food? Do you go multiple times?
Or, how does, how does that work?

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:39.320
(Pat Saperstein) We don't, we don't really
approach it the way you would a newspaper

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:44.240
restaurant review where you sort of go multiple
times and evaluate every dish on the menu.

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:50.019
I mean these, the places in this book are
more a compendium of our experiences eating

00:33:50.019 --> 00:33:53.249
all year long in all these different restaurants.

00:33:53.249 --> 00:33:59.059
So some of them might be places that Linda
or Miles have reviewed in the "LA Times" that

00:33:59.059 --> 00:34:04.559
they remembered were great. Some of them might
be places we just stopped in for lunch while,

00:34:04.559 --> 00:34:10.419
near our offices. They're just, it's, it's
just kind of a repository of our experience

00:34:10.419 --> 00:34:16.530
more than a systematic going through each
restaurant and reviewing it the way you would

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:21.379
if you're writing a full review for a magazine
or a, or a blog or something.

00:34:21.379 --> 00:34:24.139
(Linda Burum) I want to say something about
that.

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:30.460
Like if we go to hundreds of Chinese restaurants
throughout the year then certain ones stand

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:36.079
out for whatever reason. Maybe they have a
specialty, the best dumplings or what have

00:34:36.079 --> 00:34:44.720
you. Or, or, or they're just fabulous food.
So we filter all that, like all the Shanghai

00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:50.569
restaurants I know about, maybe 20. What two
am I gonna get to put in, that kind of thing.

00:34:50.569 --> 00:34:52.179
(Female #2 in audience) I have a question.

00:34:52.179 --> 00:34:53.700
(Amelia Saltsman) Does that answer your question?

00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:54.700
Yes.

00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:55.700
(Female #2 in audience) Hi.

00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:56.700
(Amelia Saltsman) Hi.

00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:57.700
(Female #2 in audience) A few of us in this
room are actually from the sales team. So

00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:03.920
we take out our clients a lot of times and
we've kind of tapped out our restaurant in

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:09.910
the Santa Monica area. We have an event coming
up that will probably have about 25 clients.

00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:11.321
Do you have a recommendation in the --

00:35:11.321 --> 00:35:12.321
(Amelia Saltsman) Probably --

00:35:12.321 --> 00:35:17.250
(Female #2 in audience) Preferably in the
Santa Monica area for 25 people, pretty private

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:18.250
dining.

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:20.599
(Amelia Saltsman) Have you been to, have you
been to Fig?

00:35:20.599 --> 00:35:23.810
(Female #2 in audience) We have been there
for lunch for a smaller group.

00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:24.810
(Amelia Saltsman) Uh-hum.

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:26.270
(Female #2 in audience) I just wasn't sure
if they can accommodate a larger group.

00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:27.579
(Amelia Saltsman) I would think that they
could.

00:35:27.579 --> 00:35:28.579
(Female #2 in audience) Okay.

00:35:28.579 --> 00:35:31.970
(Amelia Saltsman) And they're certainly doing
a lot of interesting events. I'm trying to

00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:32.970
think --

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:33.970
[inaudible]

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:34.970
(Amelia Saltsman) Wil-Wilshire was the --

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:39.170
(Female #2 in audience) Don't say Wilshire.
We love the Wilshire, but we go there --

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:40.829
(Amelia Saltsman) Okay. You, you, but just
 --

00:35:40.829 --> 00:35:42.440
(Female #2 in audience) all the time.

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:43.440
(Amelia Saltsman) Okay.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.500
(Pat Saperstein) What about Tasting Kitchen?

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:46.950
(Female #2 in audience) That's on our list.
Yeah, if the second floor would be great for

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:47.950
25 people, I think.

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:48.950
(Amelia Saltsman) Yes, yes.

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:49.950
(Female #2 in audience) Okay.

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:50.950
(Amelia Saltsman) That would, Tasting Kitchen
on Abbot Kinney.

00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:51.950
Any other - does that --

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:53.890
(Female #2 in audience) Yeah, that's a pretty
good list.

00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:54.910
(Amelia Saltsman) Okay.

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:56.960
(Female #2 in audience) Thank you.

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.790
(Amelia Saltsman) Any other questions?

00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:59.790
In the back.

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:00.790
[pause]

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:08.180
(Male #2 in audience) Hi. Some of us are just
interested in a good burger and living on

00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:13.150
the West Side I've been to Apple Pan, The
Counter, and Father's Office. And I don't

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:14.849
know what comes after that. Can you guys give
 --

00:36:14.849 --> 00:36:18.050
(Amelia Saltsman) Ooh, I would say Umami Burger.

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:25.430
(Pat Saperstein) Umami's Burger is open. I
think it's like a block away [inaudible].

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:29.800
So people have different opinions about Umami
Burger. Some people have quibbles with the

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:34.710
service or some people think that they always
come out too rare unless you instruct them

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:40.730
carefully, but it still comes down to what
is really one of the most unique and great

00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:43.710
tasting burgers in town, I think.

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:47.599
I haven't been to the new Santa Monica one
yet. It just opened like a week ago, I think,

00:36:47.599 --> 00:36:53.450
but I would definitely recommend checking
out the one here and also the original one

00:36:53.450 --> 00:37:00.010
on La Brea I think is also a good one to try;
or the one in Los Feliz.

00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:01.010
[pause]

00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:07.211
(Amelia Saltsman) Also a lot of restaurants
have really great burgers such as Rustic Canyon.

00:37:07.211 --> 00:37:12.329
They have had the same sort of burger on their
menu from the day they opened and it's delicious

00:37:12.329 --> 00:37:17.630
on a homemade, on a brioche bun, but it's
like really, really good. Great fries.

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:20.780
(Pat Saperstein) [inaudible]

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:24.980
(Amelia Saltsman) We're blanking.

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:28.130
(Pat Saperstein) [inaudible]

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:36.580
(Male #3 in audience) Does it have bacon and
avocado burgers?

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:37.600
(Amelia Saltsman) Oh, oh, you mean -

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:38.600
(Male #3 in audience) That place is good.

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:39.600
(Amelia Saltsman) on, on -

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:40.600
(Male #3 in audience) In Venice.

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:41.600
(Amelia Saltsman) Howard's, Howard's,

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:42.600
(Male #3 in audience) Howard's.

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:43.600
(Amelia Saltsman) on, on Venice and Sawtelle?
Sepulveda.

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:44.690
(Male #3 in audience) Sepulveda, Venice and
Sepulveda.

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:46.500
(Amelia Saltsman) Sepulveda. Yes.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:47.500
Any other questions?

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:53.680
(Pat Saperstein) I'll, I'll find it out. I'll
let you know. [inaudible]

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:54.680
[laughter]

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:57.220
(Amelia Saltsman) But it's not --

00:37:57.220 --> 00:38:08.670
(Female #3 in audience) [inaudible] No, I
think it's on Santa Monica near [inaudible].

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:09.670
I think it's actually right near [inaudible]

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:10.670
[laughter]

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:11.670
(Amelia Saltsman) Yeah. Yeah, we're having
a moment. Okay. Oh.

00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:12.670
Back here and then up in the --

00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:14.290
(Female #4 in audience) I'm from Singapore
and it's impossible to find authentic Singapore

00:38:14.290 --> 00:38:20.630
food here. Do you guys know of any secret
places that might possibly have Singapore/Malaysian?

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:24.760
I mean, Penang in Pasadena was the closest
I've found but they closed down.

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:32.640
(Linda Burum) Yeah, there was a Penang out
in Duarte, right? It's, I, it's Covina. Penang.

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:33.640
(Female #4 in audience) Okay.

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.990
)Linda Burum) And it, that's the best one
that I've been to.

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.990
(Female #4 in audience) In Covina.

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:40.380
(Linda Burum) There was an Indonesian place
on Motor Avenue called --

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:41.380
(Female #4 in audience) [inaudible]

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:42.380
(Linda Burum) called [inaudible] Cafe.

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:43.380
(Female #4 in audience) I'm sorry, what's
that?

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:44.380
(Pat Saperstein) [inaudible] They just moved
into a larger [inaudible]

00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:45.380
(Linda Burum) No.

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:46.380
(Pat Saperstein) [inaudible] They expanded
into the market next door so --

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:51.940
(Linda Burum) Oh, so it's bigger? So it's
close but not a cigar. But anyway, closer

00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:52.940
 --

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:54.680
(Pat Saperstein) If you haven't been to Indo
Cafe [inaudible]

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:59.099
(Female #4 in audience) I've tried it. It's
close, but not quite Singaporian.

00:38:59.099 --> 00:39:01.609
(Linda Burum) Yeah. That's, well, that's as
close as we can get.

00:39:01.609 --> 00:39:02.809
(Female #4 in audience) I know. I'm really
craving the Ð [laughter]

00:39:02.809 --> 00:39:04.500
(Linda Burum) Unless you wanna drive to Covina
to Penang.

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:05.680
(Female #4 in audience) I'll do that.

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:09.490
(Amelia Saltsman) Please, please let us know
when you find something even closer.

00:39:09.490 --> 00:39:10.490
(Female #4 in audience) Okay.

00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:13.050
(Amelia Saltsman) Okay, to the goal.

00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:15.650
And up front.

00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:16.750
[pause]

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:20.070
Here let me--

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:30.680
(Female #5 in audience) Do you know of any
good places particularly in the Glendale area

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:38.710
that's like a cafe that has good salads and
dessert, kind of like Earth Cafe or the Alcove?

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:44.819
(Pat Saperstein) There is a place that recently
opened in Glendale. I'm blanking on the name.

00:39:44.819 --> 00:39:49.630
It's pretty new. That's really the only place
I can think of that's kind of like that. There's

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:54.310
a new place in Eagle Rock that just opened.
I think it's called Four Cafe that sounds

00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:57.000
like it's gonna be really great for that kind
of food.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:04.010
Its funny right in Glendale you just don't
get as many more progressive kind of eateries.

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:09.839
There's a couple of good Persian and Lebanese
places and there's starting to be some Korean

00:40:09.839 --> 00:40:14.180
places, but there's, there's not much in the
way of just like good, interesting, fresh,

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:15.180
new food.

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:17.740
(Female #5 in audience) Well how 'bout in
that category but elsewhere?

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:22.240
(Pat Saperstein) Yeah, so check out the-the
new Four Cafe in Eagle Rock. I haven't actually

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:27.830
been there yet, but I have great hopes for
it and then Forage in Silver Lake, like I

00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:36.269
mentioned. And I'm trying to think of another
one vaguely in that area. I'll see if I can

00:40:36.269 --> 00:40:37.269
 --

00:40:37.269 --> 00:40:40.510
(Miles Clements) Culver City has a bunch of
new lunch places. I can't remember all of

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:44.690
'em. There's like Chop Chop and they're all
kind of like salad, yeah, salad and lunch

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:47.579
base that might be a good fit.

00:40:47.579 --> 00:40:48.579
[pause]

00:40:48.579 --> 00:40:51.380
(Amelia Saltsman) Maybe one last question?

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:54.240
(Female #6 in audience) I have two actually.

00:40:54.240 --> 00:41:01.641
So one is [laughs] recommendations for Cuban
cuisine that's not like Versailles and the

00:41:01.641 --> 00:41:06.251
other one's for Peruvian food, but that's
not Chinese influence like Mario's and that

00:41:06.251 --> 00:41:09.400
kind of thing, but rather traditional Peruvian.

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:10.400
[pause]

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:16.520
(Linda Burum) Yeah. Well, yeah, and also have
you been down to, what's it called, Mochica?

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:17.680
(Female #6 in audience) No.

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:23.319
(Linda Burum) It is actually Asian influence,
but they don't have so much the stir-fries

00:41:23.319 --> 00:41:31.559
and the noodles, but it's very -- this is
what you should do for Peruvian is go to the

00:41:31.559 --> 00:41:38.390
Mochicha which is in a market called La Paloma
Market. And it's on the web all over so it's

00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:39.609
easy for you to find.

00:41:39.609 --> 00:41:41.359
(Miles Clements) It's right by USC.

00:41:41.359 --> 00:41:46.000
(Linda Burum) It's by USC and they are open
at night I discovered; at least if not every

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.730
night, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. They started
out being only open during the day and closing

00:41:51.730 --> 00:42:00.130
at six 'cause the whole La Paloma complex
was open 'til six only, but now they have

00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:01.990
extended their hours which is fabulous.

00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:10.049
And Puro Sabor in the Valley is, is also a
good Peruvian, but it's more traditional.

00:42:10.049 --> 00:42:17.750
This one that I'm recommending, Mochica, is
more progressive; still it has all the elements

00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:24.420
of wonderful raw fish dishes or, if you call
them raw, marinated, and just it's pretty

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:25.680
creative. Still --

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:35.680
(Pat Saperstein) [inaudible] excellent ceviche
and then some sort of more modern inspired

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:37.358
dishes as well Everything is very light not
[unintelligible] not heavy, greasy.

00:42:37.358 --> 00:42:41.210
(Linda Burum) Well, the guy who owns it was
the chef for a long time at Sai Sai in the

00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:47.630
Biltmore downtown and he's from Peru and now
he's working at a sushi bar to keep this thing

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:52.910
going. Hopefully, we're all hoping that he'll
open a regular restaurant, if you will, but

00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:55.050
you, you can get down there and it's just
wonderful.

00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:56.920
(Female #6 in audience) Cool. Thank you.

00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:58.910
(Linda Burum) And Puro Sabor is not bad either.

00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:02.020
(Pat Saperstein) In Cuban, I don't know, I
went, I went to El Colmao the other day, which

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:07.741
is a very old-school kind of Cuban coffee
shop. It was kind of fun, but I don't know

00:43:07.741 --> 00:43:12.299
if I would really recommend it as like the
best Cuban. It's not that different from Versailles

00:43:12.299 --> 00:43:17.410
but just a different menu but also really,
really old-school. So, I don't know about

00:43:17.410 --> 00:43:18.790
like newer Cuban food.

00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:26.660
(Linda Burum) [inaudible] Yeah, I just did
this, it's not even in the paper yet, but

00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:33.790
I'll tell you anyway. It's called Don, Casa
Don Rolando in North Hills and it's fairly

00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:40.530
formal. The guy used to cook at Madre and
it's a little more refined than a lot of Cuban

00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:48.240
places. There's also, gosh, you, you should
I'll, I'll talk to you afterward 'cause I'm,

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:51.930
it's so hard to keep all these things in your
head, but I know about 20 good places. Now

00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:53.030
there's always Porto's --

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:54.030
(Female #6 in audience) Right.

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:59.059
(Linda Burum) which is actually a bakery and
it's very famous by now. But I, I do know

00:43:59.059 --> 00:44:01.151
a lot of them. I just can't think of it right
this, --

00:44:01.151 --> 00:44:02.151
(Female #6 in audience) Okay.

00:44:02.151 --> 00:44:03.151
(Linda Burum) off the top of my head.

00:44:03.151 --> 00:44:04.760
(Female #6 in audience) Thanks.

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:11.830
(Amelia Saltsman) Also one of the things that
I've been enjoying lately are the happy hours

00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:18.780
in Santa Monica. A lot of, [cough] excuse
me, a lot of Shangri-La. Have you been to

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:23.930
the, to the newly redone Shangri-La and to
their happy hour and to the, really nice,

00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:24.930
huh?

00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:31.470
And The Yard, have you been to The Yard on
Broadway and Second? Yeah. Probably good burger

00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:34.119
there. Fish tacos, very nice. Nice beers.

00:44:34.119 --> 00:44:42.740
So that, that a lot of that is happening around
Santa Monica these days, but I think it's

00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:50.910
almost one o'clock so we're happy to sit here
and keep, keep chatting, but I know you have

00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:51.910
to get back to work.

00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:54.680
[pause]

00:44:54.680 --> 00:45:03.080
I, well I could, if, if there is time I would
ask the panel what they think is sort of in

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:12.100
the trends of, or fads of food. What has,
what is peaking and what might be next?

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:14.970
Not to put you on the spot or anything.

00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:18.290
[pause]

00:45:18.290 --> 00:45:19.290
Food trucks. Yeah.

00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:20.609
We were the first and --

00:45:20.609 --> 00:45:27.480
(Pat Saperstein) Well I'll, yeah, I'll, I'll
just talk about trucks for a second 'cause

00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:31.690
we haven't really touched on that. But I think
the food trucks have actually been a great

00:45:31.690 --> 00:45:36.410
trend for the city because it's brought a
lot, sort of more community and a feeling

00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:40.861
of something really happening to the city
and it's been great for places like I mentioned

00:45:40.861 --> 00:45:46.670
like bars like the Verdugo or the new Eagle
Rock Brewery which weren't able to have kitchens

00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:51.290
before. They can just have a truck pull up.
They can feed their customers and it really

00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:52.650
works for everyone.

00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:57.890
Also where I work on Wilshire and Fairfax
we just had the crappiest selection of restaurants

00:45:57.890 --> 00:46:03.690
ever and now we have like six or eight different
trucks everyday to choose from so it's really

00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:04.690
been an improvement.

00:46:04.690 --> 00:46:12.440
But that said, it is still very faddish and
there's supposedly 60 or70 of them operating

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:18.380
right now and I'm thinking a year from now
I'll be surprised if there's like 40 that

00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:24.190
really stay successful because I'm sure there'll
be a huge shakeout in the summer. It's just

00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:27.660
like restaurants: some are good and some just
aren't very good at all.

00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:34.609
(Linda Burum) This is not, when you're talking
about what's the newest, hottest. This, sometimes

00:46:34.609 --> 00:46:39.390
old things that have been around for a long
time surface. For example, you're seeing a

00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:47.060
lot more widespread Southern Indian and Gujarati
Indian. That is to say purely vegetarian where

00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:54.410
they have the dosa type things. What are those
steamed -- I'm

00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:55.410
{Pat Saperstein) [inaudible]

00:46:55.410 --> 00:46:59.200
(Linda Burum) Yeah, utapan, those are the
pancakes. Anyway, they have all sorts of breads

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:06.309
and baked and steamed bread items with curries
that go with it. So if you're, look, there's

00:47:06.309 --> 00:47:14.559
a place called Annapurna on Venice. There's,
let me see I even wrote a little, [Bilwatchi]

00:47:14.559 --> 00:47:22.069
and Samosa House East. Whereas we always used
to have tandoori, tandoori, tandoori, now

00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:27.970
people are branching out to more regional
type Indian foods and I think, though it's

00:47:27.970 --> 00:47:34.270
been there a thousand years, now it's being
discovered by everybody who even isn't Indian,

00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:35.270
so --

00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:39.140
(Amelia Saltsman) I have a feeling, I'm seeing
people going back to work so I think we need

00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:43.140
to stop. But this has been an awful lot of
fun. Thank you so much.

00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:44.140
[applause]

00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:52.110
(Julie Wiskirchen) Thank, thank you all for
coming and giving us such a great list of

00:47:52.110 --> 00:47:56.740
new places to try and the writers are happy
to sign your books if you wanna get your book

00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:57.740
signed now.

00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:58.059
Thanks a lot.
