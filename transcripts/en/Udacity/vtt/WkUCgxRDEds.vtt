00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.900
As with privacy consent, there
are several data segmentation models.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.370
A completely patient controlled
model is the norm for PHRs,

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.750
where there is no obvious alternative
other than a friend or family member

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.000
who may be more familiar with medical
terminology than the patient.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.440
We mentioned a Provider Assisted Model,
but

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.520
this does require that busy
providers spend time on the task.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.470
And even if they are willing, this may
not work well if the patient's data is,

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.260
as is often the case,
spread among a number of providers.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.900
There are other approaches, including
Organization Controlled Models,

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.670
Hybrid Models and Innovative Tools.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.620
That are typically aimed at providing
patients with more support.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.230
All of these ultimately try to simplify
the complexity in the underlying

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.310
clinical data, which in turn relies on
better structures than are typically

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.230
found in today's EHRs.
