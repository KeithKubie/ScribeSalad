I for the last 10 years I've been a

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:10.549
I for the last 10 years I've been a
 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:12.430
I for the last 10 years I've been a
digital product designer and I noticed

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.440
digital product designer and I noticed
 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.959
digital product designer and I noticed
that my journaling actually allowed me

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:13.969
that my journaling actually allowed me
 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:15.420
that my journaling actually allowed me
to think in a completely different way

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:15.430
to think in a completely different way
 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.019
to think in a completely different way
so even when I would be designing

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:19.029
so even when I would be designing
 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:21.179
so even when I would be designing
different kinds of software applications

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:21.189
different kinds of software applications
 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:23.620
different kinds of software applications
from watch interfaces to video game

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630
from watch interfaces to video game
 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.929
from watch interfaces to video game
interfaces it always started out on

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939
interfaces it always started out on
 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.720
interfaces it always started out on
paper and over time I realized that the

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730
paper and over time I realized that the
 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:29.920
paper and over time I realized that the
more I could actually take my thoughts

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930
more I could actually take my thoughts
 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.650
more I could actually take my thoughts
offline the clearer they would become

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660
offline the clearer they would become
 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.390
offline the clearer they would become
and the more I could focus because I

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400
and the more I could focus because I
 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.710
and the more I could focus because I
mean you could sit down and start typing

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720
mean you could sit down and start typing
 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.539
mean you could sit down and start typing
out you can journal in an app but I

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:37.549
out you can journal in an app but I
 

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:39.009
out you can journal in an app but I
noticed I'd be journaling in an AB next

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:39.019
noticed I'd be journaling in an AB next
 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:41.020
noticed I'd be journaling in an AB next
thing I know I'm ordering shoes online

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030
thing I know I'm ordering shoes online
 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.549
thing I know I'm ordering shoes online
and you have no idea how you got from

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559
and you have no idea how you got from
 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.590
and you have no idea how you got from
one point to the other but when you sit

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600
one point to the other but when you sit
 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.420
one point to the other but when you sit
down with a notebook and as soon as you

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430
down with a notebook and as soon as you
 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.820
down with a notebook and as soon as you
engage with the page you are unplugged

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830
engage with the page you are unplugged
 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.460
engage with the page you are unplugged
so it forces you to really engage with

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470
so it forces you to really engage with
 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.289
so it forces you to really engage with
your thoughts in a way that I feel has

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:53.299
your thoughts in a way that I feel has
 

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:55.509
your thoughts in a way that I feel has
not been accurately replicated in the

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519
not been accurately replicated in the
 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.660
not been accurately replicated in the
digital space so for me the act of

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670
digital space so for me the act of
 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.130
digital space so for me the act of
bullet journaling is an act of thinking

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140
bullet journaling is an act of thinking
 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.990
bullet journaling is an act of thinking
it's an act of unplugging and actually

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000
it's an act of unplugging and actually
 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.810
it's an act of unplugging and actually
processing the information and in my

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820
processing the information and in my
 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.460
processing the information and in my
community I've found that that's also

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470
community I've found that that's also
 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.650
community I've found that that's also
provided significant value to people who

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:08.660
provided significant value to people who
 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.450
provided significant value to people who
get caught up in the rush of everyday

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460
get caught up in the rush of everyday
 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.490
get caught up in the rush of everyday
life it's a moment that you can take

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500
life it's a moment that you can take
 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.070
life it's a moment that you can take
back it's a moment where you can really

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080
back it's a moment where you can really
 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.410
back it's a moment where you can really
have the luxury of sitting down and

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420
have the luxury of sitting down and
 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.050
have the luxury of sitting down and
starting to digest the things that you

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060
starting to digest the things that you
 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.390
starting to digest the things that you
otherwise can easily be overwhelmed by I

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400
otherwise can easily be overwhelmed by I
 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.660
otherwise can easily be overwhelmed by I
think one thing that we often kind of

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670
think one thing that we often kind of
 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.150
think one thing that we often kind of
forget is just because something is

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160
forget is just because something is
 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.780
forget is just because something is
convenient does not make it efficient so

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790
convenient does not make it efficient so
 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.510
convenient does not make it efficient so
a lot of times data entry if you type

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520
a lot of times data entry if you type
 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.560
a lot of times data entry if you type
for example happens a lot faster but in

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570
for example happens a lot faster but in
 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.200
for example happens a lot faster but in
that process a lot gets lost because

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210
that process a lot gets lost because
 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.810
that process a lot gets lost because
you're just kind of parroting the source

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820
you're just kind of parroting the source
 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.540
you're just kind of parroting the source
and I think that it's really important

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550
and I think that it's really important
 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.120
and I think that it's really important
to actually hear what's being said then

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130
to actually hear what's being said then
 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.550
to actually hear what's being said then
just simply kind of spitting it back out

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560
just simply kind of spitting it back out
 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.100
just simply kind of spitting it back out
onto paper so when you're writing a lot

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110
onto paper so when you're writing a lot
 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.450
onto paper so when you're writing a lot
of the time what you want to do is

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460
of the time what you want to do is
 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.580
of the time what you want to do is
reduce the amount of information that

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590
reduce the amount of information that
 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.640
reduce the amount of information that
you're capturing only down to what truly

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650
you're capturing only down to what truly
 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.240
you're capturing only down to what truly
matters

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250
matters
 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.140
matters
so you're distilling information in real

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150
so you're distilling information in real
 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.030
so you're distilling information in real
time and in order to do that you have to

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040
time and in order to do that you have to
 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.279
time and in order to do that you have to
think about what truly matters and I

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289
think about what truly matters and I
 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.600
think about what truly matters and I
feel like writing by hand allows us to

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610
feel like writing by hand allows us to
 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.910
feel like writing by hand allows us to
think significantly more about the

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920
think significantly more about the
 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.840
think significantly more about the
information that

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850
information that
 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.720
information that
we are writing down I mean the actual

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730
we are writing down I mean the actual
 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.810
we are writing down I mean the actual
act of writing activates very many

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820
act of writing activates very many
 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.740
act of writing activates very many
different parts of our brain

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750
different parts of our brain
 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.200
different parts of our brain
simultaneously that from the science

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210
simultaneously that from the science
 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.750
simultaneously that from the science
that I have seen doesn't happen when

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760
that I have seen doesn't happen when
 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.570
that I have seen doesn't happen when
you're typing so for example students

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580
you're typing so for example students
 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.880
you're typing so for example students
that were separated into two separate

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890
that were separated into two separate
 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.520
that were separated into two separate
groups one was allowed to take notes via

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530
groups one was allowed to take notes via
 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.860
groups one was allowed to take notes via
handwriting and the other via typing and

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870
handwriting and the other via typing and
 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.220
handwriting and the other via typing and
the group that wrote by hand retained

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230
the group that wrote by hand retained
 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.580
the group that wrote by hand retained
the information significantly longer and

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590
the information significantly longer and
 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.770
the information significantly longer and
significantly more accurately so I think

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780
significantly more accurately so I think
 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.260
significantly more accurately so I think
that when you concentrate and you focus

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270
that when you concentrate and you focus
 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.390
that when you concentrate and you focus
on writing you are engaging with content

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400
on writing you are engaging with content
 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.370
on writing you are engaging with content
significantly more you have to you're

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380
significantly more you have to you're
 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.120
significantly more you have to you're
the weight of the pen the the the ideas

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130
the weight of the pen the the the ideas
 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.500
the weight of the pen the the the ideas
the concepts that you're trying to

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510
the concepts that you're trying to
 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.110
the concepts that you're trying to
distill down to what matters how your

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120
distill down to what matters how your
 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.700
distill down to what matters how your
handwriting looks how quickly you're

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710
handwriting looks how quickly you're
 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.020
handwriting looks how quickly you're
writing and all those things immediately

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030
writing and all those things immediately
 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.310
writing and all those things immediately
focus your attention more so than I

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320
focus your attention more so than I
 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.100
focus your attention more so than I
would say but typing would so decision

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110
would say but typing would so decision
 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.260
would say but typing would so decision
fatigue is when you find yourself

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270
fatigue is when you find yourself
 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.540
fatigue is when you find yourself
literally exhausted by the amount of

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550
literally exhausted by the amount of
 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.490
literally exhausted by the amount of
decisions that you have to make because

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500
decisions that you have to make because
 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.200
decisions that you have to make because
we're constantly inundated by so many

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.210
we're constantly inundated by so many
 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.670
we're constantly inundated by so many
different things from so many different

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680
different things from so many different
 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.440
different things from so many different
channels all that information requires

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450
channels all that information requires
 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.390
channels all that information requires
our attention and a lot of that

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400
our attention and a lot of that
 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.610
our attention and a lot of that
information actually requires us to act

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620
information actually requires us to act
 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.370
information actually requires us to act
and acting on information is essentially

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380
and acting on information is essentially
 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.040
and acting on information is essentially
making a decision so do you want to go

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050
making a decision so do you want to go
 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.360
making a decision so do you want to go

be physically right you can make
 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.180
be physically right you can make
decisions all day long and you can still

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190
decisions all day long and you can still
 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.020
decisions all day long and you can still
run a marathon but our mind also has a

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030
run a marathon but our mind also has a
 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.840
run a marathon but our mind also has a
limited amount of energy your ability to

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850
limited amount of energy your ability to
 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.260
limited amount of energy your ability to
make decisions becomes worse it can

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270
make decisions becomes worse it can
 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.300
make decisions becomes worse it can
really quickly degrade when you're

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310
really quickly degrade when you're
 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.390
really quickly degrade when you're
constantly making decisions and again

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400
constantly making decisions and again
 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.430
constantly making decisions and again
for me journaling is a big part of that

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440
for me journaling is a big part of that
 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.340
for me journaling is a big part of that
because a lot of these decisions don't

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350
because a lot of these decisions don't
 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.800
because a lot of these decisions don't
add value to our life we're thinking

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810
add value to our life we're thinking
 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.810
add value to our life we're thinking
about things just because they're there

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820
about things just because they're there
 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.670
about things just because they're there
not because they actually mean something

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680
not because they actually mean something
 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.610
not because they actually mean something
to us and a lot of the time I think we

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620
to us and a lot of the time I think we
 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.010
to us and a lot of the time I think we
forget that just because something could

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020
forget that just because something could
 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.650
forget that just because something could
be done doesn't mean that it needs to be

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660
be done doesn't mean that it needs to be
 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.309
be done doesn't mean that it needs to be
done

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:30.319
done
 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:32.260
done
and it certainly shouldn't be taking up

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270
and it certainly shouldn't be taking up
 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.429
and it certainly shouldn't be taking up
our time and our energy and our focus we

00:04:36.429 --> 00:04:36.439
our time and our energy and our focus we
 

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:39.689
our time and our energy and our focus we
live in a we live in an age of unlimited

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699
live in a we live in an age of unlimited
 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:43.089
live in a we live in an age of unlimited
possibility and possibilities all

00:04:43.089 --> 00:04:43.099
possibility and possibilities all
 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:45.969
possibility and possibilities all
require us to make a decision and I

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979
require us to make a decision and I
 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:47.559
require us to make a decision and I
think it's really important to realize

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:47.569
think it's really important to realize
 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:50.109
think it's really important to realize
that we are very limited our attention

00:04:50.109 --> 00:04:50.119
that we are very limited our attention
 

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:52.480
that we are very limited our attention
is limited our time is very limited and

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490
is limited our time is very limited and
 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.899
is limited our time is very limited and
if we start to structure our days around

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:55.909
if we start to structure our days around
 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:59.980
if we start to structure our days around
that concept then we can start to we can

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990
that concept then we can start to we can
 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.899
that concept then we can start to we can
start to protect the time that we do

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:01.909
start to protect the time that we do
 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:04.179
start to protect the time that we do
have and start trying to make decisions

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:04.189
have and start trying to make decisions
 

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:07.839
have and start trying to make decisions
based on things that do matter to us a

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:07.849
based on things that do matter to us a
 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.519
based on things that do matter to us a
thing before we make the decision we

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:09.529
thing before we make the decision we
 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:13.109
thing before we make the decision we
have to make the decision to be very

00:05:13.109 --> 00:05:13.119
have to make the decision to be very
 

00:05:13.119 --> 00:05:15.969
have to make the decision to be very
careful about what we let into our lives

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:15.979
careful about what we let into our lives
 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:18.399
careful about what we let into our lives
and if we don't we suffer from decision

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:18.409
and if we don't we suffer from decision
 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:20.290
and if we don't we suffer from decision
fatigue

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300
fatigue
 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.540
fatigue
