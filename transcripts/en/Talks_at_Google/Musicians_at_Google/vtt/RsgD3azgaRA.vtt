ELEANOR CARMELI:
Hi, I'm Eleanor.

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.862
And I am here on behalf of
the Jewglers in New York.

00:00:04.862 --> 00:00:06.570
We're really excited
to see everyone here

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.350
today and celebrate
the holiday with you.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.730
So I welcome all of you
to put your hands together

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:11.740
for the Maccabeats.

All right, those of you

00:00:44.145 --> 00:00:46.260
who aren't holding up
cell phones, taping this,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.100
put your hands together.

NOAH JACOBSON:
Thank you so much.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.360
Google, how are we doing today?

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.957

00:02:57.957 --> 00:02:59.290
NOAH JACOBSON: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.912
Hold on.

00:02:59.912 --> 00:03:01.370
Now, I don't know
if you know this,

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.050
but this is our
busiest time of year.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.510
And over the past
week, we've been

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.590
in New Orleans, in Houston
for a concert, in Florida.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.240
Probably like 10 or 12
shows in the last week.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.520
So we're a little tired.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.620
And we're going to need
some energy from you guys.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.176
So one more time, I said,
how are we doing tonight?

00:03:18.176 --> 00:03:20.080

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.622

00:03:21.622 --> 00:03:22.580
Much better, thank you.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.650
We are the Maccabeats from
Yeshiva University in New York

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.460
City.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.212
And we are so excited to
be here with you today.

00:03:29.212 --> 00:03:30.420
It's going to be a great day.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.110
We're going to have some fun.

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.990
We can do that if
we do three rules.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.570
Can we listen to
three rules, Google?

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:37.740
Three rules?

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:38.410
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.826
NOAH JACOBSON: I
said three rules.

00:03:39.826 --> 00:03:40.480
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.938
NOAH JACOBSON: The first rule,
if you know one of the songs

00:03:42.938 --> 00:03:45.530
that we're about to sing,
you have to sing along, OK?

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.740
Especially the kids,
very important.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:48.680
You got that?

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.620
Second rule, if you don't
know one of the songs

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.460
that we're about to
sing, we might find it

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.110
in our Maccabeat
hearts to forgive you.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.740
But you have to clap
along for a fast song

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.070
and get a little cellphone
wave going for a slow song, OK?

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.510
Third rule is that
after the show,

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.600
you must purchase
as much merchandise

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.340
as you possibly can.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.120
I'm totally kidding about
the first two rules.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.620
This next song is Lecha Dodi.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:16.903
We hope you enjoy.

JULIAN CHAIM HOROWITZ:
You know, they

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:01.298
told me to expect people to
be a little brighter here

00:08:01.298 --> 00:08:03.960
than everywhere else.

HOROWITZ: All right,

00:12:46.174 --> 00:12:48.406
has anybody been to the
mall in the last few weeks?

00:12:48.406 --> 00:12:49.656
Anybody here been to the mall?

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:54.200
Don't get out too much, huh?

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.076
All right, I've got to stop.

00:12:57.076 --> 00:12:59.700
All right, well, if you do go to
the mall at this time of year,

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:03.270
starting from about two or three
weeks ago, what kind of music

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:04.280
do you hear?

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:09.850
Let's see, this is a Q and
A. Answer-- Christmas music,

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:10.440
exactly.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:14.630
And there's always your Jewish
friend who's like, you know,

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:16.252
I love Christmas music.

00:13:16.252 --> 00:13:18.710
And it's such a shame, because
all the good Christmas music

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:20.459
was written by Jews.

00:13:20.459 --> 00:13:22.250
But you know what,
that's a two-way street.

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:26.280
All the good Hanukkah music
was written by non-Jews, too.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.140
So we decided to
rectify that last year.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.370
We actually-- most
Maccabeats music

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:33.090
is cover music or parody music.

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:36.320
We actually decided to write
an original Hanukkah song

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.050
for the very first time,
which was really a lot of fun.

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:40.900
It was a new venue for us.

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:53.275
So this is our original
Hanukkah song, "Shine."

00:13:53.275 --> 00:13:54.650
[MUSIC - THE
MACCABEATS, "SHINE"]

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:49.030
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:52.390
NOAH JACOBSON: So we get asked a
lot of questions as Maccabeats.

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:55.400
People are very, very
curious about our experience.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.090
So one of the questions
that we always get

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:01.780
is, did you ever expect
in your wildest dreams

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:04.089
that you would start
this a cappella

00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:07.540
group at Yeshiva University
which essentially looks

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:12.530
like the cast of Book of Mormon
and that your group would go on

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:16.544
to garner about 15 million
views on YouTube collectively?

00:17:21.427 --> 00:17:22.010
Yeah, YouTube.

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:24.496
JULIAN CHAIM HOROWITZ: That's
right, we can say that here.

00:17:24.496 --> 00:17:27.079
NOAH JACOBSON: And the answer
we give them is, yes, we totally

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:29.494
thought that would happen.

00:17:29.494 --> 00:17:30.910
No, the answer is
we really didn't

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:32.285
think that would
happen but we've

00:17:32.285 --> 00:17:36.020
had so many really awesome
amazing experiences thanks

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:37.430
to this whole experience.

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:40.330
And one of those awesome parts
of being in the Maccabeats

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.190
is all the travel we get to do.

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:46.320
So in the three years since
"Candlelight" came out,

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.840
we've been to over 35
states in the United States.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:54.620
We've done shows in China, New
Zealand, Australia, England,

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:57.457
South Africa, really
all over the world.

00:17:57.457 --> 00:17:59.040
And we have a really
good time with it

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.581
and we have a lot
of fun on the road.

00:18:00.581 --> 00:18:02.970
So do you guys want to
hear a story from the road?

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:04.590
A Maccabeats story
from the road?

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:05.335
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:05.335 --> 00:18:07.210
NOAH JACOBSON: Awesome
enthusiasm, thank you.

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:09.420
10 points.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:13.320
So we were in
Houston, Texas, which

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.670
happens to be my favorite city
because that's where I'm from.

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:18.420
And in the music
videos, I actually

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:19.936
wear an orange space suit.

00:18:19.936 --> 00:18:21.940
I don't know if
you've seen that.

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:26.730
And the space suit is sort
of an homage to my hometown,

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:29.250
to Houston, because
NASA's based in Houston.

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:31.720
So when we went to Houston
to do a show there,

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.746
there were about 1,500
people in the show.

00:18:33.746 --> 00:18:35.220
It was a huge show.

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:38.480
And NASA heard that we
were coming to Houston.

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:43.660
And they said, do you guys want
to go on a VIP tour of NASA?

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:45.780
And we said, sure.

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:48.670
And so we went, and
it was so much fun.

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:52.520
We were in these fake spaceships
and we were pressing all sorts

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.970
of buttons that we shouldn't.

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:55.952
And it was just so much fun.

00:18:55.952 --> 00:18:58.160
And while we were there,
the person showing us around

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.790
said, look up there.

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:02.840
And we looked up, and there
was this observation deck.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.420
And there were all
these children,

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:08.230
these little children,
waving frantically at us.

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:11.410
And he said, do you want to
know why they're waving at you?

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:13.770
And I said, yeah, you know,
we're in the Maccabeats.

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:16.070
It's kind of a big
deal, whatever.

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:17.820
He said, no, they think
you're astronauts.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:22.209
So it was fun.

00:19:22.209 --> 00:19:24.750
And we go all over the world
and we have a great, great time.

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:29.010
And every place that we go is a
new experience, something new.

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:31.477
And for us, being at
Google is so cool.

00:19:31.477 --> 00:19:32.310
It's really so cool.

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:33.768
So thank you so
much for having us.

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.470
So just for you guys,
we're going to debut,

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:43.050
do our live debut of our
new Hanukkah song this year.

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:44.220
It's called "Burn."

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:46.090
We hope you enjoy it.

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:46.690

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:47.800
this is good news and bad news.

live debut of our new Hanukkah

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:51.496

is this is the live debut of
our new Hanukkah song, "Burn."

cut us some slack.

who've been to one of
our shows before know

00:23:31.605 --> 00:23:34.795
that these beautiful but
unfortunate chords mean

00:23:34.795 --> 00:23:36.420
that our time here
is coming to an end.

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:37.990
But my mother would
never forgive me

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:40.624
if we went all the way to
Central Park for our next show,

00:23:40.624 --> 00:23:43.040
which starts in five minutes,
without my first introducing

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.069
to you to all these
nice young Jewish guys.

00:23:45.069 --> 00:23:46.860

JULIAN CHAIM HOROWITZ: As
you've just heard, there it is.

No two Maccabeats hail
from the same place.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:39.746
It's our music which
brought us together

00:24:39.746 --> 00:24:42.470
and our music which brings
us together with you today.

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:44.796
This final, I guess, kind
of medley of two songs

00:24:44.796 --> 00:24:46.170
are really what
that's all about,

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:47.810
the power of music,
the power of harmony

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:49.393
to bring all sorts
of different people

00:24:49.393 --> 00:24:51.640
together in all sorts
of wonderful ways.

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:53.230
So without further
ado, please join us

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:55.040
in these wonderful prayers.

00:31:07.142 --> 00:31:09.600
JULIAN CHAIM HOROWITZ: We have
time for just one more song.

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:13.330
And it probably should be
a Hanukkah song, right?

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:15.040
It's the right time of year.

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.560
Does anybody have any requests
for what that song should be?

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:18.060
Any--

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:19.594
AUDIENCE: "Candlelight."

JULIAN CHAIM
HOROWITZ: Did someone

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:22.380
say "I Had a Little Dreidel"?

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:24.160
That's my favorite
Hanukkah song.

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:24.960
We'll do that.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:28.052
We'll do that song
that you're asking for.

00:31:28.052 --> 00:31:29.510
And a few of you
mentioned it to us

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:31.610
backstage that you
know the words.

00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:33.100
So we'll do it on
two conditions.

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:34.622
Condition number
one is-- and I hope

00:31:34.622 --> 00:31:35.830
the cameras are getting this.

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:38.090
If everybody who
can, please stand up.

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:45.224
Even you, that's right.

00:31:45.224 --> 00:31:46.640
Condition number
two, a few of you

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:49.239
mentioned to me backstage
that you know the words.

00:31:49.239 --> 00:31:50.780
I'm sure the kids
all know the words.

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:52.702
Parents, I know you
also know the words.

00:31:52.702 --> 00:31:55.035
So we've done this song so
many times we kind of blocked

00:31:55.035 --> 00:31:56.050
the words out of our memory.

00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:57.300
So you'll have to help us out.

00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:57.800
All right?

00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:58.883
Do we have a deal, Google?

00:31:58.883 --> 00:31:59.845

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:04.230
I heard coders are
the best crowds.

00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:04.730
All right.

00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:06.300

have a deal, Google?

JULIAN CHAIM
HOROWITZ: All right.

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.384
Can we crank it up
all the way here?

00:32:11.384 --> 00:32:12.550
Turn it up to 11, all right?
