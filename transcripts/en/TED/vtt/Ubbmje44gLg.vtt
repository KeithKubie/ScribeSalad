00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.650
It's story time.

00:00:15.492 --> 00:00:17.292
Settle back, and I'll begin.

00:00:18.643 --> 00:00:23.508
Once upon a time, a mother duck
sat patiently on her nest of eggs,

00:00:23.532 --> 00:00:25.265
waiting for them to hatch.

00:00:25.953 --> 00:00:29.222
And then one day, she felt
something move beneath her.

00:00:29.246 --> 00:00:30.555
Crack, crack!

00:00:31.397 --> 00:00:35.813
Filled with happiness, she watched
as her eggs hatched one by one.

00:00:37.726 --> 00:00:39.917
I don't know about you,
but when I was little,

00:00:39.941 --> 00:00:43.186
story time was always
one of my favorite parts of the day.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.543
And I loved reading to my two sons
when they were small, too.

00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:49.049
It's that special time

00:00:49.073 --> 00:00:52.874
when a parent and child
can be totally absorbed together

00:00:52.898 --> 00:00:55.184
in mystical kingdoms, fantastical beasties

00:00:55.208 --> 00:00:58.520
or scruffy little ducks
that turn out to be swans.

00:00:59.616 --> 00:01:01.926
Well, that's how it is for some children,

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.870
but for other children,

00:01:03.894 --> 00:01:06.710
there isn't a parent around
to read to them.

00:01:08.093 --> 00:01:10.360
I'd like to tell you about Sophie.

00:01:11.292 --> 00:01:14.616
Sophie's five years old
and lives with her parents.

00:01:15.982 --> 00:01:18.324
One day, there's a bang at the door.

00:01:18.348 --> 00:01:21.133
Sophie hears lots of shouting;
her mum's crying.

00:01:21.157 --> 00:01:24.232
She sees the police
dragging her father away.

00:01:24.256 --> 00:01:26.923
Sophie's afraid. She starts crying, too.

00:01:27.574 --> 00:01:29.089
Weeks go by.

00:01:29.113 --> 00:01:31.764
Sophie doesn't know
what's happened to her dad.

00:01:31.788 --> 00:01:33.960
When she asks her mum, her mum gets upset.

00:01:33.984 --> 00:01:35.775
So she stops asking.

00:01:37.307 --> 00:01:38.648
Sophie waits.

00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:41.065
She really misses her dad.

00:01:41.836 --> 00:01:44.947
Every day, she hurries home from school,
in case he's come back.

00:01:46.042 --> 00:01:48.909
On many nights,
she cries herself to sleep.

00:01:51.212 --> 00:01:53.299
Children at school start to tease her.

00:01:53.323 --> 00:01:54.657
They call her names.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.100
Somebody's mum has heard
that Sophie's dad is in prison.

00:02:00.082 --> 00:02:03.129
Sophie pretends to be ill
so she doesn't have to go to school.

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:06.755
And her teacher can't understand
why she's so far behind

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:08.125
with her schoolwork.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.863
After what seems
a long, long time to Sophie,

00:02:13.887 --> 00:02:15.379
a letter arrives.

00:02:15.403 --> 00:02:16.791
It's from her dad.

00:02:16.815 --> 00:02:19.180
The writing is very messy.

00:02:19.204 --> 00:02:23.250
The letter makes her mum cry,
but she reads a little out to Sophie.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.884
He says that he's OK
and that he's missing them.

00:02:27.744 --> 00:02:29.077
It's a short letter.

00:02:30.006 --> 00:02:33.408
Sophie says she'd like to go
and see her dad, wherever he is.

00:02:33.432 --> 00:02:38.098
But her mum says it's too far away,
and they can't afford the journey.

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.979
Then one day the phone rings.

00:02:41.003 --> 00:02:43.741
"Sophie, come speak to daddy."

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:47.809
Dad sounds different, far away.

00:02:48.571 --> 00:02:50.421
He says he can't talk for very long,

00:02:50.445 --> 00:02:53.452
and anyway, it's very noisy
wherever he is.

00:02:53.476 --> 00:02:56.580
And Sophie doesn't know
what to say to him.

00:02:58.631 --> 00:03:01.392
Well, as stories go,
that's not a very nice one.

00:03:01.416 --> 00:03:06.069
In the United Kingdom, 200,000 children

00:03:06.093 --> 00:03:10.248
experience the shame and isolation
of a parent in prison.

00:03:11.117 --> 00:03:13.172
Two hundred thousand.

00:03:13.196 --> 00:03:15.506
That's more than the number
of children each year

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.947
who are affected
by their parents divorcing.

00:03:18.307 --> 00:03:21.307
And it can affect the children
of prisoners very deeply.

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:23.420
There can be problems at school,

00:03:23.444 --> 00:03:27.412
and they're three times more likely
to suffer from mental health issues.

00:03:28.932 --> 00:03:30.434
In so many ways,

00:03:30.458 --> 00:03:35.241
children are the unintended victims
of their parents' crimes.

00:03:35.784 --> 00:03:37.315
In so many ways,

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:41.403
children are the overlooked victims
of their parents' crimes.

00:03:43.936 --> 00:03:46.976
Until last November,
I was a serving prisoner,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.499
imprisoned for fraud.

00:03:48.974 --> 00:03:51.574
I was dishonest, and I paid the penalty.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.675
Before that, I'd been
a practicing solicitor for 30 years.

00:03:56.172 --> 00:03:58.887
I'd had a happy and stable upbringing,

00:03:58.911 --> 00:04:00.109
a good education,

00:04:00.133 --> 00:04:03.077
a happy marriage, which,
I'm pleased to say, continues.

00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:05.648
I have two adult sons.

00:04:06.387 --> 00:04:09.974
When they were growing up,
I did my best to be around for them

00:04:09.998 --> 00:04:11.450
as much as I could.

00:04:11.474 --> 00:04:13.703
And I took a careful interest
in what they did.

00:04:13.727 --> 00:04:16.680
I read to my boys every night,

00:04:16.704 --> 00:04:21.519
and ironically, our favorite story
was "Burglar Bill."

00:04:21.543 --> 00:04:23.688
(Laughter)

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.820
But when I got to prison,
it soon became apparent

00:04:27.844 --> 00:04:31.959
that my background was very different
to that of most of the prisoners.

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:35.641
Few of the men that I met
had had a decent education.

00:04:35.665 --> 00:04:40.434
Indeed, many associated education
with humiliation and failure.

00:04:40.458 --> 00:04:44.620
I can tell you firsthand
that prison is dehumanizing.

00:04:45.592 --> 00:04:49.020
Prisoners harden up,
they shut down, they close in ...

00:04:49.863 --> 00:04:51.310
just to survive.

00:04:52.166 --> 00:04:54.562
And this can be devastating for families.

00:04:56.546 --> 00:05:00.724
In fact, maintaining contact
with your family from prison

00:05:00.748 --> 00:05:02.681
can be very difficult indeed.

00:05:03.613 --> 00:05:06.763
And if a child does get to see
their parent in prison,

00:05:06.787 --> 00:05:09.898
they have to go through
the same pat-down searches as the adults.

00:05:09.922 --> 00:05:12.686
They walk through
the same detector frames,

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.871
they're sniffed by the same sniffer dogs,

00:05:14.895 --> 00:05:18.299
and all because some children
have been the unwitting carriers

00:05:18.323 --> 00:05:20.507
of drugs and mobile phones.

00:05:21.567 --> 00:05:23.738
And when they get through
to see their parent,

00:05:23.762 --> 00:05:26.448
they may be tired from a long journey,

00:05:26.472 --> 00:05:29.463
shy, tongue-tied, even upset.

00:05:29.853 --> 00:05:33.424
And it isn't easy for the parents,
who may not be getting along.

00:05:34.227 --> 00:05:36.104
For many reasons, not just these,

00:05:36.957 --> 00:05:41.289
over half of prisoners lose contact
with their children and families.

00:05:41.942 --> 00:05:45.626
How can we help prisoners
to stay in contact with their families?

00:05:46.574 --> 00:05:48.844
When I was a prisoner
at Channings Wood Prison,

00:05:48.868 --> 00:05:51.928
I began working for a charity
called Storybook Dads.

00:05:52.934 --> 00:05:55.630
Storybook Dads began in 2003,

00:05:55.654 --> 00:06:00.891
when Sharon Berry, a civilian worker
in a prison, realized just how much

00:06:00.915 --> 00:06:04.128
many prisoners wanted to stay
in contact with their children.

00:06:04.694 --> 00:06:07.036
And so, armed with a few storybooks,

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.019
she began to help prisoners
to read and record stories

00:06:10.043 --> 00:06:12.110
to send home to their children.

00:06:12.468 --> 00:06:16.272
It wasn't a new idea.
Few ideas like this are new.

00:06:16.611 --> 00:06:17.944
They're great ideas.

00:06:18.942 --> 00:06:21.097
But it was an instant success.

00:06:22.466 --> 00:06:27.433
You may wonder: How does the recording
of the stories work in prison?

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:29.959
Is it difficult for prisoners?

00:06:29.983 --> 00:06:31.450
Can it be challenging?

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.994
Well, the process of choosing,
reading and recording a story

00:06:38.018 --> 00:06:40.291
can be very challenging for prisoners.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.110
Prison is tough,

00:06:44.134 --> 00:06:48.971
and prisoners can't afford to show
any signs of weakness or vulnerability.

00:06:50.234 --> 00:06:53.249
But this, this recording process,

00:06:53.273 --> 00:06:59.265
this can be uncomfortable, upsetting,
sometimes all just a bit too much.

00:07:01.884 --> 00:07:03.685
And prisoners often cry.

00:07:04.741 --> 00:07:09.088
They cry because they regret
missing out on their children's lives.

00:07:09.701 --> 00:07:13.453
They cry because they're ashamed
that they've let their families down.

00:07:13.846 --> 00:07:18.544
They cry because they don't know
how to go about reading to their children.

00:07:20.298 --> 00:07:25.831
But because when they come to us
we offer a private space, one-to-one,

00:07:25.855 --> 00:07:28.927
prisoners don't need to be tough anymore,

00:07:28.951 --> 00:07:31.927
and they can use
their vulnerability as a strength

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:34.351
when contacting with their children.

00:07:35.977 --> 00:07:38.524
I remember one prisoner
who came to record.

00:07:39.095 --> 00:07:42.846
He was a big, hard man
with a reputation for being tough.

00:07:43.358 --> 00:07:45.699
He came along as implacable as ever.

00:07:45.723 --> 00:07:48.783
But when the door of the recording
room closed behind him,

00:07:48.807 --> 00:07:50.551
that facade began to crumble.

00:07:50.909 --> 00:07:54.035
From his pocket, he took
a screwed-up piece of paper

00:07:54.059 --> 00:07:55.729
and quietly began to read the words

00:07:55.753 --> 00:07:59.929
which he'd written as a message
for his two little ones.

00:08:00.555 --> 00:08:02.089
His hands were shaking.

00:08:03.254 --> 00:08:05.561
And then, in a surprisingly quiet voice,

00:08:06.572 --> 00:08:09.718
he began to sing their favorite lullaby.

00:08:10.694 --> 00:08:13.670
You see, there wasn't much
that he could do from behind bars

00:08:13.694 --> 00:08:16.836
to show his children
that he missed and loved them.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.476
But he could do this.

00:08:20.758 --> 00:08:22.726
Once the recording is made,

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:27.266
it's sent to the Storybook Dads
production unit

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:30.836
at Channings Wood Prison in Devon.

00:08:31.258 --> 00:08:32.776
And that's where I worked.

00:08:33.356 --> 00:08:35.794
I was trained, along with other prisoners,

00:08:35.818 --> 00:08:38.470
to edit and produce recordings sent in

00:08:38.494 --> 00:08:40.965
from prisons all over the United Kingdom.

00:08:42.775 --> 00:08:46.823
Using audio and video software,

00:08:46.847 --> 00:08:50.775
the recordings have the mistakes taken out

00:08:50.799 --> 00:08:53.922
and sound effects and music added in.

00:08:55.467 --> 00:09:01.193
And the experience and skill
which the prison editors gain

00:09:01.217 --> 00:09:03.750
helps them in their future employment.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:08.802
Once the recording is finalized,

00:09:08.826 --> 00:09:14.056
it's transferred to a CD or a DVD
and sent out to the families

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:18.253
so that the children can watch them
whenever they feel the need.

00:09:20.026 --> 00:09:24.505
And they listen to these recordings
and watch them a lot --

00:09:26.612 --> 00:09:29.898
at bedtime, in the car ...

00:09:29.922 --> 00:09:33.456
Some even take them to school
to show their friends.

00:09:34.532 --> 00:09:36.127
These recordings,

00:09:36.151 --> 00:09:39.528
they show the children
that they're loved and missed.

00:09:39.954 --> 00:09:41.740
And they show the prisoner

00:09:41.764 --> 00:09:45.922
that they can do something
for their child, as a parent.

00:09:47.375 --> 00:09:49.266
Do you remember Sophie?

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:53.746
Well, one day, just
before Christmas, a parcel arrived,

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:55.408
and this is what was in it.

00:09:56.115 --> 00:09:58.345
Let's listen to a little of it together.

00:09:58.369 --> 00:10:02.625
(Video) Santa: On, Comet!
On, Cupid! On, Donner and Blitzen!

00:10:02.649 --> 00:10:04.554
Charlie: That's his reindeer, isn't it?

00:10:04.578 --> 00:10:06.229
Santa: It is his reindeer, yeah.

00:10:06.253 --> 00:10:09.037
Up, up, higher and higher they flew,

00:10:09.061 --> 00:10:12.323
across land, across oceans they sped.

00:10:12.966 --> 00:10:15.910
Through the magical
northern lights they passed --

00:10:15.934 --> 00:10:18.292
I'd love to see the northern
lights, wouldn't you?

00:10:18.316 --> 00:10:21.682
Charlie: I figure they'd probably look
a bit like that snowman's belly.

00:10:21.706 --> 00:10:23.660
Santa: They probably would, yeah.

00:10:23.684 --> 00:10:25.356
That's a cool snowman, isn't it?

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.748
Charlie: It's very cool indeed, I love it.

00:10:27.772 --> 00:10:30.152
Santa: They visited
all the children in the world

00:10:30.176 --> 00:10:32.910
and left presents for each and every one.

00:10:33.611 --> 00:10:37.250
In the blink of an eye,
they were back in Frogsbottom Field.

00:10:37.274 --> 00:10:38.822
(Charlie Laughs)

00:10:38.846 --> 00:10:40.589
Santa: You think that's well funny?

00:10:40.613 --> 00:10:42.918
Charlie: I want to live
in Frogsbottom Field!

00:10:42.942 --> 00:10:45.172
Santa: Where do you live,
in Frogsbottom Tree?

00:10:45.196 --> 00:10:47.649
Charlie: I don't, I live in this tree.

00:10:47.673 --> 00:10:49.744
I've made it all Christmasy-look.

00:10:49.768 --> 00:10:50.948
Santa: It's nice, that.

00:10:50.972 --> 00:10:52.581
You've done a good job, good job.

00:10:52.605 --> 00:10:54.275
Charlie: Thank you very much!

00:10:54.299 --> 00:10:56.165
(Laughter)

00:10:57.957 --> 00:11:00.998
Alan Crickmore: Sophie and her mum
listened to that three times,

00:11:01.022 --> 00:11:03.307
and they haven't laughed
so much in a long time.

00:11:03.331 --> 00:11:06.450
They can see that he's all right,
they can see that he loves them,

00:11:06.474 --> 00:11:09.895
and the next time he rings,
Sophie's got plenty to talk about:

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:11.846
"What does Charlie the Chimp eat?

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:14.428
Will daddy do another story very soon?"

00:11:15.259 --> 00:11:20.728
Since it began in 2003,
Storybook Dads has grown and grown.

00:11:22.298 --> 00:11:26.055
It now operates as Storybook Dads
and Storybook Mums

00:11:26.079 --> 00:11:28.912
in more than 100 prisons
in the United Kingdom.

00:11:29.506 --> 00:11:33.365
Ninety-eight percent
of the prisoners who take part

00:11:33.389 --> 00:11:36.783
say that it's improved
their relationship with their child.

00:11:37.538 --> 00:11:40.284
And since 2003,

00:11:40.308 --> 00:11:45.317
over 60,000 DVDs and CDs
have been sent out

00:11:45.341 --> 00:11:47.067
to the children of prisoners.

00:11:50.398 --> 00:11:53.867
For Sophie's family and for thousands
of families like them,

00:11:53.891 --> 00:11:56.273
Storybook Dads has been a lifeline.

00:11:57.735 --> 00:11:59.850
Some prisoners say
that it's the first time

00:11:59.874 --> 00:12:03.108
that they've begun to build
a relationship with their child.

00:12:03.815 --> 00:12:06.215
And some poor readers
have been so inspired

00:12:06.239 --> 00:12:08.074
by what they've been able to achieve

00:12:08.098 --> 00:12:11.869
that they've gone to education classes
to improve their own reading skills.

00:12:14.074 --> 00:12:17.037
Let's go back to the story
of "The Ugly Duckling."

00:12:17.061 --> 00:12:22.149
But this time, I'd like to play you
a recording made by a prisoner,

00:12:22.173 --> 00:12:25.439
because it encapsulates
the power of what we do.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:29.861
The prisoner was an Irish Traveller
who couldn't read.

00:12:31.196 --> 00:12:35.099
And he wanted to send a story home
to his daughter for her birthday.

00:12:36.595 --> 00:12:39.460
With the help of a mentor
and some clever editing,

00:12:39.484 --> 00:12:41.284
something magical happened.

00:12:42.484 --> 00:12:45.127
This is an extract from the raw recording,

00:12:45.151 --> 00:12:50.066
where the prisoner is reading the story
by repeating it, phrase at a time.

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:52.010
(Audio) Mentor: He had nowhere to hide.

00:12:52.034 --> 00:12:53.732
Owen: He had nowhere to hide.

00:12:53.756 --> 00:12:55.704
Mentor: So one day, he ran away.

00:12:56.522 --> 00:12:58.831
Owen: Then one day, he ran away.

00:12:58.855 --> 00:13:02.418
Mentor: He ran until he came
to the great marsh.

00:13:02.442 --> 00:13:05.171
Owen: He run until he come
to the great marsh.

00:13:05.195 --> 00:13:07.481
Mentor: Where the wild ducks lived.

00:13:07.505 --> 00:13:09.705
Owen: Where the wild ducks lived.

00:13:11.108 --> 00:13:15.831
AC: And this is a recording --
an excerpt of the recording

00:13:15.855 --> 00:13:21.003
with the mentor's voice taken out
and sound effects and music added in.

00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:24.212
(Audio) Owen: He had nowhere to hide.

00:13:24.236 --> 00:13:26.109
Then one day, he run away.

00:13:26.133 --> 00:13:30.702
He run until he come to the great marsh
where the wild ducks lived,

00:13:30.726 --> 00:13:33.273
and he laid in the rushes for two weeks.

00:13:33.297 --> 00:13:35.448
(Music) (Ducks quack)

00:13:35.472 --> 00:13:38.702
Some wild ducks and geese
come to look at him.

00:13:38.726 --> 00:13:41.862
"You're very ugly," they said,
and they laughed at him.

00:13:41.886 --> 00:13:45.180
(Ducks quack)

00:13:48.429 --> 00:13:52.397
The ugly duckling ran away
from the great marsh.

00:13:52.421 --> 00:13:54.198
(Duck quacks)

00:13:56.087 --> 00:13:59.062
AC: And this is how he finished the story:

00:14:01.383 --> 00:14:03.859
(Audio) Owen: He wasn't
an ugly duckling at all.

00:14:03.883 --> 00:14:08.437
During the winter, he had grown
into a beautiful white swan.

00:14:08.939 --> 00:14:13.046
The other swans looked at him
and thought how beautiful he was.

00:14:13.485 --> 00:14:15.467
"Come with us," they said.

00:14:16.159 --> 00:14:17.310
And he did.

00:14:17.334 --> 00:14:20.365
(Bird sounds)

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:27.943
Well, Tiara, I hope you
have enjoyed this story

00:14:27.967 --> 00:14:31.167
as much as I enjoyed
reading this story to you.

00:14:32.009 --> 00:14:35.762
I cannot wait to be with you again
and hold you in my arms.

00:14:36.731 --> 00:14:38.731
All my love, your daddy, Owen.

00:14:39.303 --> 00:14:41.604
Lots of love, I miss you
with all my heart.

00:14:41.628 --> 00:14:43.895
Goodbye for now, my love. Bye bye.

00:14:44.371 --> 00:14:47.569
(Music)

00:14:51.883 --> 00:14:53.033
(Music ends)

00:14:54.264 --> 00:14:56.705
AC: When he listened
to that recording in his cell

00:14:56.729 --> 00:14:58.893
before it was sent out to his daughter,

00:14:58.917 --> 00:15:00.148
he cried.

00:15:00.172 --> 00:15:02.613
And that's a pretty common
reaction from prisoners,

00:15:02.637 --> 00:15:04.445
as they realize for the first time

00:15:04.469 --> 00:15:06.777
they've been able
to do something for their child

00:15:06.801 --> 00:15:08.815
which they never thought they could.

00:15:09.784 --> 00:15:13.031
They've connected
in the most fundamental way,

00:15:13.055 --> 00:15:15.388
through the medium of storytelling.

00:15:16.473 --> 00:15:18.529
And as for Sophie,

00:15:18.553 --> 00:15:20.526
she wants "The Gruffalo" next time.

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:21.888
(Laughter)

00:15:21.912 --> 00:15:27.191
(Applause)
