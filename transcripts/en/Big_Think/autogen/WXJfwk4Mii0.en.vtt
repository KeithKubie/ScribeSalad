00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.729
need to take that vision and instead of
expanding it outwards we need to look

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739
expanding it outwards we need to look
 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:02.689
expanding it outwards we need to look
inside ourselves

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699
inside ourselves
 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.200

that's where your creative purpose is

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040
that's where your creative purpose is
 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.480
that's where your creative purpose is

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479
about like well he did this and he
 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.359
about like well he did this and he
already did this and tons of people are

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369

something new and you're just looking
 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.039
something new and you're just looking
outwards all the time and you're not

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049
outwards all the time and you're not
 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.870
outwards all the time and you're not
taking that time and that's what a trap

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880
taking that time and that's what a trap
 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.450
taking that time and that's what a trap
of technology is to just always have our

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460
of technology is to just always have our
 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.370
of technology is to just always have our
vision somewhere else somewhere else in

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380
vision somewhere else somewhere else in
 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.719

the future looking outside of ourselves

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729
the future looking outside of ourselves
 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.740
the future looking outside of ourselves
and I think taking the time in the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750
and I think taking the time in the
 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.330

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340
morning to connect with your breath
 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.429
