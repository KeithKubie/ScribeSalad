00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.420
I've restated Stokes' theorem.

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:03.960
And what I want to
do in this video

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.210
is make sure that we get
our orientation right.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.980
Because when we think about
a normal vector to a surface

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.977
there are actually
two normal vectors.

00:00:14.977 --> 00:00:16.560
There-- based on the
way I've drawn it

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.350
right over here, there could be
the one that might pop outward,

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.360
like this.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.800
Or there might be the one that
pops inward, just like that.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.760
Both of those would be normal
to the surface right there.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.890
And also, when we
think about a path that

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.760
goes around the
boundary of a surface,

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.960
there's two ways to
think about that path.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.900
We could be going-- based on
how I've oriented it right now,

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.610
we could go in a
counterclockwise orientation,

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:40.510
or direction.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.370
Or we could go in a clockwise
orientation, or direction.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.110
So in order to make sure
we're using Stokes' theorem

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.620
correctly, we need to
make sure we understand

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.130
which each convention
it is using.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.980
And the way we think
about it is, whatever

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.540
the normal direction
we pick-- and so let's

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.080
say we pick this normal
direction right over here,

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.840
the one I am drawing in yellow.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.205
So if we pick this
as our normal vector.

00:01:05.205 --> 00:01:06.580
So we're essentially
saying maybe

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.740
that's the top, one way
of doing it is, that's

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.080
the top of our surface, then
the positive orientation that we

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.390
need to traverse the path in is
the one that if your head was

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.590
pointed in the direction
of the normal vector,

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.960
and you were to walk along
that path, the inside,

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.180
or the surface itself
would be to your left.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.070
And so, if my head is
pointed in the direction

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.420
of the normal vector-- so
this is me right over here--

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.080
my head is pointed
in the direction

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.320
of the normal vector-- I'm
wearing a big arrow hat

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.590
right over there-- and if I'm
walking around the boundary,

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.980
the actual surface
needs to be to my left.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:48.270
So I need to be-- this is me
walking right over here-- I

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.010
need to be walking in the
counterclockwise direction

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.194
just like that.

00:01:53.194 --> 00:01:54.610
Then that's the
convention that we

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.040
use when we're thinking
about Stokes' theorem.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.280
If oriented this
thing differently,

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.260
or if we said that
no, no, no, no, no,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.560
this is not the normal vector.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.560
This is not the, essentially,
the top that we want to pick.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.470
If we wanted to pick
it the other way,

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.830
if we wanted to go
in that direction,

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.330
If we wanted that to be
our normal vector, in order

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.660
to be consistent, we would
have to now do the opposite.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.490
I would now have to have my
head going in that direction.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.135
And then I would have
to walk, once again,

00:02:26.135 --> 00:02:28.260
and this might be a little
bit harder to visualize.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.440
I would have to walk
in the direction

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.057
that the surface is to my left.

00:02:32.057 --> 00:02:33.640
And now, in this
situation, instead of

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.223
the surface looking
like a hill to me,

00:02:35.223 --> 00:02:37.470
the surface would look
like some type of a bowl,

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.359
or some type of a valley or
something like that to me.

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.150
And the way that I
would have to do it now,

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.774
and it's a little
bit hard to visualize

00:02:44.774 --> 00:02:47.280
the upside down Sal,
but the upside down Sal

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.050
would have to walk in
this direction in order

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.570
for the bowl, or the
dip, to be to my left.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.390
So that's just important
to keep this in mind

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.170
in order for this to be
consistent with this right

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.780
over here.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.140
Put your head in the direction
of the normal vector.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.110
Or you can kind of view that
as the top of the direction

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.900
that the top of the
surface is going in.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.290
And then the contour,
or the direction

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.910
that you would have to traverse
the boundary in order for this

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.280
to be true, is the
direction with which

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.457
the surface is to your left.
