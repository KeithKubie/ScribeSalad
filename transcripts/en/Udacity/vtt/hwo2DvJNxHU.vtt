00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.150
All right,
welcome back to Computer Vision.

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:06.496
This time we're going to start sort of
on some of the small technical details

00:00:06.496 --> 00:00:09.076
of doing recognition.

00:00:09.076 --> 00:00:11.884
Remember we said that recognition
is mostly going to be some form

00:00:11.884 --> 00:00:13.288
of a classification problem,

00:00:13.288 --> 00:00:16.640
now we're going to look at some
methods and some representations.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.007
So today we're going to start
with the one we talked about,

00:00:19.007 --> 00:00:20.832
supervised classification, and in fact,

00:00:20.832 --> 00:00:24.120
almost everything we're going to do is
going to be in the supervised domain.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.520
So in the supervised world, basically
I give you a set of labeled training

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.950
examples, and the goal is to
come up with some function, but

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.320
if you give it a new example,
it'll generate the correct label.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.460
So using the handwritten digit
recognition as a example, so

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.380
here we have some training examples,
right, we've got a bunch of fours and

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.190
a bunch of nines, and you'll notice,

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.580
they're not, it's not trivial right,
because these, these fours, you know,

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.720
could have been a nine, but
no, they're actually fours.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.470
So what I want to do is I want
to come up with a function

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.400
such that if I give it some novel input,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.730
I give it something that looks like
this, it's going to say, what?

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:01.750
Is it going to say four or nine?

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.570
&gt;&gt; Nine
&gt;&gt; Very good.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.330
Very nine.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.360
Megan's been paying attention.
