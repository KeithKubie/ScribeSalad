00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:06.040
After speaking with so many Iranian-Americans for this series, I still had one more question.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.640
"What do people get wrong about L.A.'s Iranian-American community?"

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.180
“We only get a few faces: terrorist, kitschy or campy…”

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.940
“A stereotype is that we’re very lavish, lavish parties, lavish decorating…”

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.120
“The gaudy, the rich…”

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.260
“But we don’t get to be our whole selves, real people.”

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.080
“When I left Los Angeles, I really began to realize that in the rest of the U.S.,

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.480
most people don’t know anything about Iranians.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.220
And for them, Iranians are total strangers that they see on TV that are angry

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.380
and burning things and chanting ‘death to America.’”

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.580
“The Muslim world, we’re not just all violent or terrorist people.”

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.600
“All they heard about Iran was ‘terrorist.’”

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.700
“Obviously, our community is sort of negotiating stereotypes between either Argo,

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.640
or, you know, we have 300…”

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.100
“Shahs of Sunset.”

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.040
“That was the last one I was going to mention.”

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.320
“Shahs of Sunset.”

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.420
“Shahs of Sunset.”

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.600
“The Shahs of Sunset.”

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.760
“This season on Shahs of Sunset…”

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.380
[screaming]

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.580
“More attitude!”

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.100
“Ladies, you're in my shot!

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.460
It’s my birthday!”

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.380
“I’ve never related to those stereotypes.”

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.480
“For Iranians, it’s become so humiliating. That’s the only thing they’re associated with.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.220
And it’s not like that doesn’t exist – I always say, it does exist –

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.040
but there’s so much more than that.”

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.580
“The Shahs of Sunset, I love that show.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.560
Hey, let Americans see that we can party too! Let them see Iranians are fun people –

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.900
they bring a tiger to the party!”

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.240
“L.A.’s Iranian community is incredibly diverse.”

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.580
“Persians are very deep people – they’re very poetic, they’re very kind.”

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.620
“We are Iranian. We’re just like everybody else.”

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.220
“I’ve been here since I was three and I’m a practicing attorney.”

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:54.740
“Every one of our ethnic as well as religious minorities are well represented here.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.380
We do have a large Armenian community, a large Bahá'í community, a large Jewish community...”

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:10.300
“...every single class, of every certain interest, and vocation, and gender, sexuality…”

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.900
“What people get wrong the most – they associate Iranians with money.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.160
There is a wealthy population but most of us do not have money and we've very much

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.660
had to struggle to survive in California.”

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.320
“How do you identify yourself in terms of Iranian-American, Persian-American, Persian-Iranian?

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.580
What kind of language do you use?”

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.240
“I say Persian because that’s what I heard, growing up as a kid.”

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.980
“It’s a very complicated question.”

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.940
“Most people who hear the word ‘Persian’ don't actually even know what it means.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.740
I think Persian just sounds like something exotic, and they don’t even realize it is Iran.”

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.080
“So I think a lot of people, maybe first-generation folks who might have immigrated here,

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.100
and perhaps doesn't want to use the term Iranian.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.360
But we can reclaim that and repurpose it and be like – and make it cool.”

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.460
“For me being Iranian isn’t just my connection to that country, but being Iranian

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.320
is also about being a part of this mosaic of cultures in this country.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.000
Having people know that I'm Iranian is an important thing for me.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.620
Partially because, at this moment in time, we are so discriminated against.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.320
People feel like they have no image what an Iranian is

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.200
and they can’t even imagine meeting one.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.780
I think it's important to represent Iranians and to point out they are also doing all these other things too."

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.820
You just watched the last video in our "Untold America" series about Iranian-Americans.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.620
Make sure you watch the first three videos in the series too.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.440
There's breakdancing, Persian ice cream, videos of me as a baby -- it's definitely worth it.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.800
Also, we have another great AJ+ explainer channel called "Because Facts" so make sure

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.840
to check them out too. And let us know what stories you want "Untold America" to cover next.
