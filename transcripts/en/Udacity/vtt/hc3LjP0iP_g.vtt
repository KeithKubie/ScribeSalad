00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.630
Awesome work incorporating
user input into your game.

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:06.042
In this level, you learned how
to pull for key presses and

00:00:06.042 --> 00:00:10.260
accelerometer readings as well as how to
create an input processor to listen for

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.690
incoming events like touches.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.467
Now that we've covered a drawing,
movement and input,

00:00:15.467 --> 00:00:18.420
it's time to create
some actual game play.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.480
In the next level, we'll start
working on our first real game.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.980
See you there.
