we have discovered parts of in an
 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.660
we have discovered parts of in an
internal map that we have in our brain a

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670
internal map that we have in our brain a
 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.480
internal map that we have in our brain a
map that tells the rest of the brain

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490
map that tells the rest of the brain
 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.820
map that tells the rest of the brain
where we are in the room or in the world

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830
where we are in the room or in the world
 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.730
where we are in the room or in the world
it's not a GPS almost there are

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740
it's not a GPS almost there are
 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.400
it's not a GPS almost there are
different types of cells

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410
different types of cells
 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.290
different types of cells
o'keefe who is the third price we know

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300
o'keefe who is the third price we know
 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.529
o'keefe who is the third price we know
he found a typo Sanders complacent which

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539
he found a typo Sanders complacent which
 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.320
he found a typo Sanders complacent which
is active only when animals or humans

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330
is active only when animals or humans
 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.080
is active only when animals or humans
are in one certain place we found

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090
are in one certain place we found
 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.870
are in one certain place we found
another type of cell that fires is

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880
another type of cell that fires is
 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.750
another type of cell that fires is
active in many places and those places

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760
active in many places and those places
 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.490
active in many places and those places
were sent is active tend to form

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500
were sent is active tend to form
 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.600
were sent is active tend to form
strictly exceptional patterns so the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610
strictly exceptional patterns so the
 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.029
strictly exceptional patterns so the
many locations in the room when a cell

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039
many locations in the room when a cell
 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.180
many locations in the room when a cell
is active form a grid or like a

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190
is active form a grid or like a
 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.700
is active form a grid or like a
coordinate system that tells the brain

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710
coordinate system that tells the brain
 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.250
coordinate system that tells the brain
where we are the animal is walking and

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260
where we are the animal is walking and
 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.290
where we are the animal is walking and
it can be an animal it can be a human

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300
it can be an animal it can be a human
 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.789
it can be an animal it can be a human
being then you can record with tiny

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799
being then you can record with tiny
 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.929
being then you can record with tiny
sensors in the brain and you record the

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939
sensors in the brain and you record the
 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.109
sensors in the brain and you record the
electrical pulses that are released from

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119
electrical pulses that are released from
 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.679
electrical pulses that are released from
these cells and you magnify them 10,000

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689
these cells and you magnify them 10,000
 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.399
these cells and you magnify them 10,000
times and then we can listen to warm by

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409
times and then we can listen to warm by
 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.480
times and then we can listen to warm by
one cell and then if we now listen to

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490
one cell and then if we now listen to
 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.450
one cell and then if we now listen to
one place cell and this is the area

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460
one place cell and this is the area
 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.469
one place cell and this is the area
where the animal is walking around this

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479
where the animal is walking around this
 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.770
where the animal is walking around this
is the rat and then it's silent silent

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780
is the rat and then it's silent silent
 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.010
is the rat and then it's silent silent
silent and then suddenly you start to

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020
silent and then suddenly you start to
 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.170
silent and then suddenly you start to
hear and then the rat is moving out

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180
hear and then the rat is moving out
 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.289
hear and then the rat is moving out
again and whenever the animal is coming

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299
again and whenever the animal is coming
 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.289
again and whenever the animal is coming
back to this place it's the same thing

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299
back to this place it's the same thing
 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.840
back to this place it's the same thing
happening and it doesn't matter how the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850
happening and it doesn't matter how the
 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.899
happening and it doesn't matter how the
animal is coming in from which

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909
animal is coming in from which
 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.050
animal is coming in from which
directions and the interesting part is

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060
directions and the interesting part is
 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.190
directions and the interesting part is
that these places are they are located

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200
that these places are they are located
 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.150
that these places are they are located
in different areas in the environment so

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160
in different areas in the environment so
 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.160
in different areas in the environment so
one place L would be active here and

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170
one place L would be active here and
 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.100
one place L would be active here and
here and so on but then the grid cell

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110
here and so on but then the grid cell
 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.050
here and so on but then the grid cell
that we found doesn't have one single

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060
that we found doesn't have one single
 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.570
that we found doesn't have one single
active field but it has several ones and

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580
active field but it has several ones and
 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.380
active field but it has several ones and
they are separate like edward said like

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390
they are separate like edward said like
 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.420
they are separate like edward said like
each field looked like a checkerboard

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430
each field looked like a checkerboard
 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.949
each field looked like a checkerboard
just how do you say it to the chest yeah

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959
just how do you say it to the chest yeah
 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.259
just how do you say it to the chest yeah
Chinese checkerboard thank you so then

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269
Chinese checkerboard thank you so then
 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.990
Chinese checkerboard thank you so then
where the marbles should go that is

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000
where the marbles should go that is
 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.509
where the marbles should go that is
where the activity field is and we know

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519
where the activity field is and we know
 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.660
where the activity field is and we know
that this Chinese checkerboard they have

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670
that this Chinese checkerboard they have
 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.130
that this Chinese checkerboard they have
all these small triangles in between all

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140
all these small triangles in between all
 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.680
all these small triangles in between all
marbles and that's exactly the firing

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690
marbles and that's exactly the firing
 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.229
marbles and that's exactly the firing
pattern of the grid cells and then the

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239
pattern of the grid cells and then the
 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.509
pattern of the grid cells and then the
grid cells come in different sizes and

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519
grid cells come in different sizes and
 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.170
grid cells come in different sizes and
big fields big distance between the

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180
big fields big distance between the
 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.009
big fields big distance between the
fields small and so on and this is the

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019
fields small and so on and this is the
 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.590
fields small and so on and this is the
information that goes into the

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600
information that goes into the
 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.960
information that goes into the
hippocampus which is the place cell

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970
hippocampus which is the place cell
 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.289
hippocampus which is the place cell
where Jung don't give Foundation and the

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299
where Jung don't give Foundation and the
 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.250
where Jung don't give Foundation and the
interesting part is that the hippocampus

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260
interesting part is that the hippocampus
 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.150
interesting part is that the hippocampus
with places if you lose yourselves in

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160
with places if you lose yourselves in
 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.819
with places if you lose yourselves in
this structure you cannot remember what

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829
this structure you cannot remember what
 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.770
this structure you cannot remember what
you had for breakfast if you had

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780
you had for breakfast if you had
 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.479
you had for breakfast if you had
breakfast at all and if you lose the

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489
breakfast at all and if you lose the
 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.090
breakfast at all and if you lose the
same cells you can't find your way and

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100
same cells you can't find your way and
 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.000
same cells you can't find your way and
environment and the input to these cells

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010
environment and the input to these cells
 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.270
environment and the input to these cells
that is the grid cells so the grid cells

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280
that is the grid cells so the grid cells
 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.030
that is the grid cells so the grid cells
are tightly involved in both spatial

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040
are tightly involved in both spatial
 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.450
are tightly involved in both spatial
navigation and memory
