JENNY MURPHY: Hi there
everybody.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.300
Welcome to the first on-air
edition of the Google+

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.820
Platform Office Hours.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.830
So before we dig into stuff,
I'm going to do a quick

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.800
introduction and we're
all going to say hi.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.460
I'm Jenny Murphy.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.400
I'm a Developer Programs
Engineer here.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.000
I'm at the Googleplex
in Mountain View.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.350
And something cool I guess,
I've been building--

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.190
I've been building a lot of
cool stuff on the Google+

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.465
Platform as you might expect,
because I do it every day.

00:00:27.465 --> 00:00:30.910
But I can't talk about some of
the stuff I'm working on.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.050
But if you check my personal
blog, you will find a lot of

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.640
stuff I've been hacking at
recently, including a little

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.120
comments widget that you can
use to learn to play with

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.020
comments in your blog.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.070
JONATHAN BARRY: And I'm
Jonathan Barry.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.390
I'm a Developer Advocate
on Google+.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.915
I work on hangouts specifically
at Googleplex,

00:00:49.915 --> 00:00:51.120
because I'm right
next to Jenny.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.400
That's pretty obvious.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.485
But something cool that I've
been working on, almost ready

00:00:57.485 --> 00:01:01.770
to release, so you get to hear
it first. We've got the Jazz

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.480
client for our JavaScript
API--

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.455
sorry--

00:01:06.455 --> 00:01:09.250
our layer APIs working
inside of a hangout.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.070
So that means things like
blogger, moderator, latitude--

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.590
anything that's in our
new API stack--

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.180
it can be found at
code.google.com/api/explorer--

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.350
is now available to hangout.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.640
It's pretty exciting.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.020
JENNY MURPHY: Great.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.020
It's the first I've heard
about it too.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.730
All right, so let's
go left to right.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.770
So [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:34.920
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.630
So I'm [? Gavin ?]
from Austria.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.290
So I've been doing lots of stuff
with the Google APIs.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.330
Recently, the most recent thing
is hangout apps I've

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:52.490
been doing this hangout disco,
which is a [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.090
rendered 3D room that you have
little entries for every

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.720
participant, which can walk
around and they can wave and

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.970
turn their heads,
which I can't.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.840
The most popular thing I've
been doing is on my Plus

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.625
Statistics tool, which reads all
of your public posts which

00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:14.990
the API will return.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.950
And then it will calculate all
kinds of statistics for the--

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.910
counts how many pictures
you've posted, how many

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.906
comments you've got, how many
Plus Ones you've got.

00:02:25.906 --> 00:02:29.140
So it does all kinds of fun
stuff, really, and people

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.450
really seem to like numbers.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.930
So got to have them.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.520
And I also included
some charts.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.170
We have the charts API, which
is really good to play with.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.420
Yup, that's about it.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:43.430
JENNY MURPHY: How
about Fraser.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.860
You're next.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:45.510
FRASER CAIN: All right.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.490
So my name is Fraser Cain, and
I'm the publisher of "Universe

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.800
Today." And we've been
using Google+ for

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.020
all kinds of things.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.270
So let's see, I'm located on
Vancouver Island in Canada.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.520
So we record the astronomy
podcast now.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.680
We do it as a live Google+
hangout so people can watch.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.070
And then at the end of the
recording of the show, we

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.590
invite everyone in and they
can sort of join in and

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.920
hangout, and that's publicly
available to lots of people.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.960
We've actually been doing
that for about four

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.300
or five months now.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.560
We've had it on the air for
the last probably month.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.140
We do a weekly space roundup
with a whole bunch of space

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.940
science journalists.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.190
So from MSNBC and Discovery
and Discover.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.490
Phil Plait from "Bad Astronomy."
And my co-host

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:33.050
Pamela Gay.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.670
And so once a week we kind
of do a roundup.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.400
It's almost like a CNN
style news roundup.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.920
It's pretty cool.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.670
We've actually been hacking
the hangouts quite a bit.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.990
So what we do is we have a
separate website where we're

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.760
able to pull in the embed code
for the actual stream, and so

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.410
it sort of makes it a
permanent location.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:55.670
You can always go and
check it out.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.160
We're making all that code
freely available.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.430
We've actually integrated
Twitter and Google+ comments

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.330
into this page at
the same time.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.620
So you can kind of see all
of the comments that are

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.600
happening, but you do have to
come back to Google+ to

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.470
actually comment on it.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.040
We've been creating a
infrastructure of building

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.500
role playing games-- playing
role playing

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.390
games through Google+.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:21.130
So using the Google Apps, you
can actually go and roll dice

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.980
within the app itself, and the
results the die role are shown

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.980
to everybody, so it's
not cheating.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.010
We've actually also built an
extension that does that, so

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.810
everyone who's going to be
playing the game, it actually

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.630
modifies their interface and
you can roll dice and the

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.120
results are shown
to everybody.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.210
And the latest iteration
with the apps right

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.810
now is we're actually--

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.490
my partner on this, Charles
Jaimet, has built-- you

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.950
actually can embed a game board
into the hangout with

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.290
the apps, and you can actually
move pieces around and see

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.170
people's positions.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.210
So we're still trying to figure
it out, but it's pretty

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.010
cool technology.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.740
So yeah, we doing
tons of stuff.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.650
JENNY MURPHY: Very cool.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.020
All right, Allen, you're next.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.800
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: Hi there.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.170
I'm Allen Firstenberg
from New York.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.710
Mostly I've been focusing on the
hangout plus API, and with

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.170
a wide variety of stuff.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:22.390
So I've been doing some games,
some parlor games.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.750
The last round of things that
I've been working on has been

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.550
some apps to work with
preschool children.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.110
So the preschool children and
their parents can do something

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.070
interactive together through
a hangout or

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.280
through an Android app.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.630
So I've been trying to create
apps that cross that line,

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.050
work on multiple platforms. And
I'm very much targeting

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.864
the hangout API as one of
my primary platforms.

00:05:50.864 --> 00:05:52.310
JENNY MURPHY: Very cool.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.280
And finally, last but
not least, Martin.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.550
MARTIN: OK.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:56.040
Hi.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.550
I'm Martin.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.490
I'm a computer science
student from Germany.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.090
And I've been working with
Google+ API ever since the

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.700
first day it went public.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.670
So I do a lot of experiments
with it.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.060
Also like [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
commenting engine

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.780
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.070
Most recently, I'm working on
various Chrome extensions that

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.610
enhance your Google+
experience.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.900
So I started a tool which
you can bookmark

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.360
posts directly on Google+.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.475
And I'm also part of the team
that's working on the my

00:06:25.475 --> 00:06:26.760
hangouts extension.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.960
So yeah, if you're interested
in trying any one of them,

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.030
check out my profile.

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.050
You'll find all the
things in there.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.630
JONATHAN BARRY: And actually,
anybody watching this video

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.850
afterwards, we'll provide all
the links for all the cool

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:41.140
demos that people
talked about.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.730
JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:43.150
Get out.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.050
So without further adieu, I'm
going to dive into that live

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.930
coding I promised, and
we'll actually be--

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.090
we're going to create a tool
that will be relevant for this

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.840
hangout itself.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:59.030
So I'm going to fire up screen
sharing and show you what I'm

00:06:59.030 --> 00:06:59.740
talking about.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.540
You can see the hall of
mirrors just briefly.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:03.630
And here we go.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:09.000
So the problem I'm trying to
address, this little hack, is

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.670
we have our hangouts on air.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.043
And we were fielding
questions, if

00:07:15.043 --> 00:07:15.670
any of you were watching.

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.060
Just reply a comment on the
thread, and we're going to be

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.990
responding to those questions
later on in the hangout.

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:25.430
And this works really well,
except after a little while

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.475
the auto updating of this page
turns off, and I'm going to

00:07:29.475 --> 00:07:31.340
have to reload it every
few minutes to

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.800
see the latest comments.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.190
And while you're doing all the
other stuff and hangouts on

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.240
there, that can be a little
bit distracting.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.800
So I'm going to use the comments
API to write a little

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.490
tool that pulls the
API and sucks

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:45.740
down the latest comments.

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.620
So let me show a little
mock-up of what I'm

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.150
envisioning.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:54.730
So there's a little
tool you go to.

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:58.000
You pop in your activity ID for
your favorite activity.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.100
And I've already gone and
grabbed the activity for this

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:04.220
post. Hit a button--

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.470
oops.

00:08:08.855 --> 00:08:10.780
Actually, not up and
working yet.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.700
Initial.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:17.160
We show the mock-up, you pop in
the ID and you hit submit.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.320
And what it does is it
posts the comments--

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.370
it fetches the comments and
it inserts them into

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.300
the page at the top.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:27.490
As time passes, it fetches the
new comments, and keeps

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:30.430
updating them as time passes, so
that we can just look back

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:33.760
here and see the latest
activity.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:38.169
So back to the working
version.

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:41.289
Let's take a look at the code
that this mock-up uses before

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:43.370
we dive into the JavaScript
Client Library and APIs.

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:50.800
So here's the code for
that little mock-up.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.340
We have some HTML elements,
which is where

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.690
the stuff gets inserted.

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:56.440
Nothing too exciting here.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.310
We have the definition list
where the comments actually

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:00.030
end up getting pushed.

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:03.250
We have that forum with the
little button that you saw

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:08.250
called a JavaScript method
right now, and some text.

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:12.230
This JavaScript method is right
up above, and you can

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.040
see it's pretty simple
right now.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:17.700
All it does is call another
method and passes in a chunk

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:22.260
of JavaScript objects, which is
the little comments you saw

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:23.510
showing up right here.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.190
And the structure looks like
something we may get back from

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:32.785
an API, but it's just
a format of what a

00:09:32.785 --> 00:09:34.550
comment might look like.

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.590
And it's calling the
method down below.

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:41.150
And this method just does
a bunch of little HTML

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:42.320
manipulations.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.210
It creates some elements.

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:46.340
It copies some data into them.

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.350
Cleans up some other stuff,
strips some tags out, and then

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:51.880
inserts it into that definition
list in the HTML.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.170
So this is our starting point.

00:09:56.170 --> 00:10:00.150
We have a little chunk of
locally running JavaScript to

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.270
insert some data.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.400
So how do we go from here to
something that's actually

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.790
working and pulling down the
comments for our activity?

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:13.080
We could hit the reference docs
and try and figure out

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.980
all the methods we need to call,
and how the JavaScript

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.370
Client Library works.

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:22.020
But I prefer to work from
examples whenever I can.

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.125
So digging around--

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:27.750
sorry about that.

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:29.710
Make it a little
more readable.

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:34.290
So I noticed there was this
really cool blog post. It was

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:37.090
published when we released
the alpha version of the

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:39.910
JavaScript Client Library.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:43.500
And scrolling down here, we can
see there's a really neat,

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:48.580
simple, like 50-line example
showing you how to use the

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:52.280
JavaScript Client Library
to search some Google+

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.530
activities.

00:10:56.710 --> 00:11:02.885
So let's come and paste that
into our own file and see what

00:11:02.885 --> 00:11:04.110
it looks like when it runs.

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:06.190
So here's the exact same code
from the blog post,

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:08.160
just paste it in.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:14.090
And I'm going to pull it up in
my browser, reload, and we can

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.480
see it running.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.130
So what it looks like it's
doing is it's searching

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:22.840
Google+ for Google+.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.970
And taking a page of activities
that it finds and

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:29.920
just telling us a little
bit about them.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.930
And if we go back to the code,
we can totally see this makes

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:34.190
a lot of sense.

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:36.810
Because we look at the document,
we only see one HTML

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:39.590
element, which is where it's
inserting, apparently

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:43.160
inserting all the activities
it finds.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:47.330
We see that it's sourcing the
JavaScript Client Library.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:50.100
And it's using an onload hook
to call an initialization

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:56.130
function, which is the only
other function in this file.

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:57.985
And we can see what this
function does.

00:11:57.985 --> 00:12:01.510
It bootstraps the JavaScript
Client Library.

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:05.210
It loads it, and sets it up
to use the Google+ APIs.

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:09.280
Then it sets up a query.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.900
It's doing one query.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.980
It's searching for activities.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:15.890
We can see the query, Google+,
which correlates to what we

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:20.755
saw on the screen, and it's
specifying an order.

00:12:20.755 --> 00:12:25.410
Then upon execution, it's taking
the response and doing

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:28.730
some HTML manipulations to
insert the stuff into that

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:30.250
content below.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.090
See the little content
right there.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:34.530
This is really close to what
we're trying to build with our

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:38.560
little comments sucker
downer feature.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.220
In fact, you can probably just
get started by copying the

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:43.150
stuff we see here.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:45.660
So let's start with that.

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.120
First, we need the JavaScript
Client Library before we can

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.560
do anything else, so we'll
copy that into our code.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.690
We'll go up here.

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.840
There's one difference between
the example from the blog

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.530
post, and what we're working
on now, is the example from

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:06.053
the blog post uses an
initialization function, or

00:13:06.053 --> 00:13:07.960
rather it's calling it
initialization function once

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.300
the JavaScript Client
Library loads.

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:12.890
We're using a button, so we
don't really need to do that.

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:14.160
So we can remove that.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.760
And we're just sourcing the
JavaScript Client Library.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.140
Then let's grab this whole
initialization function and

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.420
just start from there.

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:29.730
So punch in the net, and let's
replace our insert a comment

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:30.980
function like that.

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.880
So now we have taken the example
from the blog post,

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:46.400
pasted it into our
little tool, and

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.450
let's see what happened.

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:49.700
We haven't actually changed
anything yet.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:53.480
But let's see what happens
when we run it.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:58.650
So we load our local file, and
we can see that it's working.

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:00.780
We haven't broken the example.

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:04.160
It's going, it's running a
search, and it's inserting it

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.210
into our page, which means we've
actually accomplished a

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:09.160
surprising amount for just
having pasted a little code.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.770
We've managed to source the
JavaScript Client Library,

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:13.670
which means it's available for
us to use, and we've managed

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:17.040
to run a query from our tool,
which means we're

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.410
really close actually.

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:21.410
But it's the wrong query, and
we're doing the wrong thing

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:22.200
with the data.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.220
So let's tackle these problems
one at a time.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.240
First let's figure out what the
correct query to run is

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.710
and let's run it.

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:30.260
So we can see here in
our code that we're

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.460
running activity search.

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.780
We could hit the reference
docs and figure out which

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:38.440
method we should probably run,
but I like hands-on tools.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.870
So I'm going to go to the API
explorer, which a lot of

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:42.605
people have probably seen.

00:14:42.605 --> 00:14:44.880
It's one of my favorite
little tools.

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:48.310
And it shows us all the
available Google+ APIs, what

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:49.380
we can do with them.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.700
Right now it's running
activity search

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.365
with the query Google+.

00:14:53.365 --> 00:14:58.870
And we can see that the text
here corresponds to the code.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:02.320
So knowing that, it's probably
a good guess that we can just

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.740
take other methods and
run them and use the

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:07.310
parameters we see here.

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:13.530
So let's try a comments dot
list. But a comments dot list

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:16.520
doesn't take a query, it
takes an activity ID.

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.910
So we'll take an activity ID.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:26.180
And just to save us the trouble
of paging through

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:30.000
results, let's set a max result
to the maximum size,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.780
which is 100.

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:37.910
Also, our activity
ID isn't Google+.

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:43.250
It's actually a long string,
which I fetched earlier on.

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:47.550
This is the activity ID of the
Google+ post that you're

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:49.590
looking at right now if you're
watching the hangout on air.

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:54.030
JONATHAN BARRY: Now, of course,
you could have gotten

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:57.020
that activity ID from
a search, right?

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.680
JENNY MURPHY: I could have
gotten it from a search, or

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.490
more easily I could have gotten
it from an activities

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:04.400
list, because activities list
is only going to show my

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:04.790
activities.

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:07.970
So I can show you
that right now.

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:13.490
So that's my profile ID, and
we can actually see--

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:16.980
there's a trailing space.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:17.820
Here we go.

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:22.080
We can actually see this
activity ID in relative

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.040
activities responded from
the API explorer.

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.500
But going back to the
demo, let's see

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:29.420
what this looks like.

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:32.620
So we load our little page.

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:33.980
We run it.

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:36.540
And we see a whole bunch
of undefineds.

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:39.560
This means we've probably
successfully executed the

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:43.570
query against the comments list
endpoint, which is half

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:44.960
of the problems we're
trying to deal with.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.760
We just haven't-- we're not
responding to it correctly,

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.681
we're not dealing
with it right.

00:16:48.681 --> 00:16:50.050
But that's pretty easy.

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:56.490
All we need to do is invoke
our little insert a new

00:16:56.490 --> 00:17:01.240
comment method on the results
from that query.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:04.172
So let's take a look and
try and do that.

00:17:04.172 --> 00:17:05.690
Let's see what happens.

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:10.650
So let's trim down the stuff we
have up here a little bit.

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:16.150
We still need to find a place
where we're going to be

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:18.740
inserting our comments, although
the class name is a

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:20.369
little different, or the
ID will be different.

00:17:20.369 --> 00:17:23.550
And we have favorite activity
comments instead of content.

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:25.630
So that's going to go insert
at the bottom of the page

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:28.380
instead of up at the top.

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:32.140
And then we're going to have to
loop through the results,

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.566
just like on the blog
post example I did.

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:39.910
Except we're going to handle
them a little differently.

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:42.470
Rather than just doing all the
HTML manipulations here, we're

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:43.960
going to offload into
that method.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.600
And we're going to do it for
each one of the response dot

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:55.890
items. And it looks
like we might have

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:56.850
something that works.

00:17:56.850 --> 00:18:00.140
But how can we be sure that the
response, the structure of

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:03.690
the response matches what our
insert new comments method

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:07.820
expects with that
comment.actor.image.url and

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:10.500
comment.actor, and
all that stuff.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.320
Since we're doing it with the
JavaScript client, we can do

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.000
this pretty easily.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.490
We can use your favorite web
browser debugging tools, like

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:19.200
Firebug or Chrome dev tools
to figure this out.

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.006
So let's just make sure that
everything lines up.

00:18:21.006 --> 00:18:24.300
So we're going to save
it, reload our page,

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:25.550
fire up the dev tools.

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:29.440
Go over to the script tab.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.520
Sorry the font's tiny.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:33.910
I actually can't make
this bigger.

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:40.150
But just run the query.

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:42.870
And take a look at
what comes out.

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:44.760
So hopefully this is visible.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.750
We can see there is an array
of 25 items coming out.

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:51.480
And each one of these items just
happens to have the same

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.990
structure as that JSON that we
were passing into that insert

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:55.840
a new comment method.

00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:00.320
As an actor with a display name,
and an image, and it has

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:03.280
an object with the content,
which is very convenient,

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.320
because that means
we don't have to

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:05.960
change any of that code.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.420
We can just pass these responses
in straightaway.

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:14.580
So let's see it in action.

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:19.760
So we'll hit the play button,
let it keep running.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.430
Remove the break point and
let it finish running.

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:25.110
We can see comments up here.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.080
But there's one kind of
a downside right now.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:33.270
If I keep hitting this button
and keep running the query,

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:35.490
it's going to keep inserting
comments and our page is going

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:36.620
to get longer and longer.

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:40.430
Because the rest of the
API is stateless.

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:44.220
It doesn't know what comments
we've already fetched.

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:46.200
We're going to have to be
responsible on the client side

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:49.780
for making sure that we only
deal with the comments we have

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:50.390
received once.

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:52.660
So we only insert them into
the web page once.

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:53.530
This is pretty easy.

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:56.410
We can use a little local index
for the good stuff, a

00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:58.380
little hash.

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:01.570
So let's add this
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:03.330
So I'm going to create a little
hash in the global name

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:07.455
space, because I guess I'm a
little sloppy like that.

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:17.280
And then all we need to do is
conditionally insert the

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.775
comment if we've never
seen it before.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:30.590
So what we're going to index is
by the ID of the comment.

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:33.520
So if we've never seen the
comment before, then we will

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:44.050
insert it, and then mark it as
something that we've not seen.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:52.650
So reloading our app.

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:04.580
We can see that it's not loading
all the comments.

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:10.300
JONATHAN BARRY: Google hangouts
using live debugging.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.740
JENNY MURPHY: So let's jump
ahead to one that's working.

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:21.230
So we can see it actually
doesn't debug it.

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:23.450
I'll just show you what the
final outcome looks like.

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:24.700
MALE SPEAKER: I think
you missed the--

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:33.440
FRASER CAIN: Were you looping
through your reading?

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.660
JENNY MURPHY: I am looping
through the reading response.

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:38.170
But rather than spend
time debugging--

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:39.710
MALE SPEAKER:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:44.442
items. Items record I. In the
if statement because you--

00:21:44.442 --> 00:21:45.650
JENNY MURPHY: Oh, right, right.

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:46.975
Thank you.

00:21:46.975 --> 00:21:51.164
Yeah, this is the peril
of live debugging.

00:21:51.164 --> 00:21:52.670
JONATHAN BARRY: The joy
of live debugging.

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:55.100
JENNY MURPHY: The joy
of live debugging.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:57.670
So we can actually see
it in action now.

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:01.830
I've kind of jumped ahead for
the sake of time diversion,

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:04.260
but it has a couple of
other tweaks too.

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:05.630
It does the same looping.

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:07.860
It conditionally selects
the right comments.

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:10.290
And it also keeps running that
query over and over again,

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:13.870
just using a set interval.

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:14.550
And that's it.

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:20.260
This is how easy it is to write
a little tool using the

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:21.265
comments API.

00:22:21.265 --> 00:22:23.020
I'm going to switch back.

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:23.960
Stop my screens.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.060
Hey there everyone again.

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:27.365
Sorry, some technical
difficulties.

00:22:27.365 --> 00:22:29.950
I actually hit the close button
for the hangout instead

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:32.170
of the close button for
screen sharing.

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:35.880
So pardon the discontinuity,
but luckily the demo was

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:38.770
wrapping up anyway.

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:41.740
So how about we field
some questions?

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:48.470
So before I dive into questions,
does anyone who's

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:50.600
in the hangout have any
comments about--

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.070
or anything?

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:53.610
Comments or questions
before we dive into

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:55.180
the stream of questions?

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:59.400
FRASER CAIN: When could you make
that available in a more

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.550
official capacity, because
that would be very cool?

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:04.350
JENNY MURPHY: The little comment
streamer downer?

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:04.715
FRASER CAIN: Uh-huh.

00:23:04.715 --> 00:23:09.510
JENNY MURPHY: Well there is one
limitation is that it's

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:11.750
currently pulling down the
comments in the order that

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:12.690
they were made.

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:15.690
So once the posts hit the 100
comments, you have to start

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:17.580
paging through the records.

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:20.750
Fortunately, we're adding an
enhancement really soon, like

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:22.700
some time in the next couple
days, where we're going to

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:27.810
allow you to reverse the order
of the comments you request.

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:30.450
So you'll get the newest
comments first, so that you

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:32.910
can pull without paging through
over and over and over

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:34.730
again, and burning through
all your quota.

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:36.530
FRASER CAIN: Oh, burning
through your quota.

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:37.000
Right.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.590
JENNY MURPHY: And that will
make this much more

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:41.720
performant, much more
quota efficient, and

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:42.880
make it more feasible.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:46.270
So once that's available, I'll
be releasing the code for it.

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:47.570
FRASER CAIN: And then
theoretically someone could

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:51.700
create an extension to
incorporate that into a

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:52.860
hangout itself.

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:53.590
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:56.500
Actually, you could probably
make it a hangout app, which

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:59.310
displays the comments for the
currently running hangout.

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:01.300
That shouldn't be a problem.

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:04.040
FRASER CAIN: Well, except that
it's pretty hard to start up a

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:06.830
hangout app for most people.

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:08.145
That it would probably
be easier--

00:24:08.145 --> 00:24:09.780
MALE SPEAKER: [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:11.450
FRASER CAIN: --in the short
term to just create an

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:13.550
extension for Chrome that--

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:16.640
and then you would feed in the
activity ID, and then it would

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.700
start to show up the comments
somewhere on the interface of

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:19.680
the hangout itself.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.640
That would be really helpful.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:22.020
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah.

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:23.830
It's one of the cool parts about
the JavaScript Client

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:25.880
Library is because it's
JavaScript you can put it in a

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:26.600
lot of places.

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:30.060
You can put it in the hangouts,
as Jonathan just

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:31.930
described you can now do.

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:33.250
You can put it in the
Chrome extension--

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:34.680
Almost, very soon.

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.810
And actually, we could just
throw that into a blog post

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:38.700
somewhere as long as it's
somewhere we can run

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:39.710
JavaScript.

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:42.450
And then anyone could come and
hit a button and say keep a

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:45.260
feed of my most recent
activities posts.

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:47.100
So that may be the
first version

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.410
that appears somewhere.

00:24:51.456 --> 00:24:52.800
FRASER CAIN: I don't know if
you've noticed that after

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.070
every sort of hangout on air
live, everyone wants to know

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:57.982
how they can make
a full screen,

00:24:57.982 --> 00:25:00.010
like within the first--

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:00.590
JONATHAN BARRY: Yup,
I saw that.

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:01.850
FRASER CAIN: --three comments.

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:04.660
So if anyone doesn't know,
there's a pretty cool

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:07.080
extension called Better Hangouts
On Air that you can

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.250
install that gives you little
buttons down at the bottom of

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:11.370
any hangout that you're watching
that lets you full

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:14.190
screen it, maximize the window,
embed it into another

00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:16.610
website, that kind of thing.

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:17.470
JENNY MURPHY: Very cool.

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:19.195
Yeah, it's really cool to see
all the Chrome extensions that

00:25:19.195 --> 00:25:21.420
have really made things
a lot better.

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:27.810
So I'm going to start fielding
some of the questions using

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:32.230
that same little widget I just
showed you guys to the right.

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:37.320
Anna is going first
in, first out.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.910
So [? Holly Cronus ?]

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:41.380
asked a question.

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:42.320
Thanks for the hangout.

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:45.380
What is the status of releasing
a Circles API?

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:47.050
That's a great question.

00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:49.010
The status really
hasn't changed.

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:50.870
It's something we know
it would really

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:52.450
cool to make available.

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:54.760
But it's something that's
in the future.

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:58.280
So unfortunately, as we often
say, we can't really say a lot

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:00.930
about the feature, because
things are always kind of

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:03.280
changing, and we want to make
sure that if we promise you

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.089
something that it's really
going to come out.

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:12.020
So let's hit the
next question.

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:20.490
Someone asked about hangout
to full screen.

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:21.880
Fraser already mentioned
there's a cool Chrome

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.550
extension for that.

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:26.430
So it was a question
like that.

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:32.650
And someone's mentioning
they cannot see the

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:33.700
text from the video.

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:35.350
Sorry about that.

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:39.700
I'll try and make it a little
bit bigger next time.

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.310
I have one with 20 point,
but it's apparently

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:43.180
not quite big enough.

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:45.170
FRASER CAIN: It looks very good
in the hangout itself.

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:48.760
So all of us could see it
quite well I think.

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.560
JENNY MURPHY: All but the
hangout on air is much smaller

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:51.310
on the window.

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:51.860
FRASER CAIN: Yeah.

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.300
So we see it--

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.840
the people who are in hangout,
we see it at full screen

00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.130
resolution, 720.

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:03.020
We can see lots of subtle
details and great sound.

00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:09.110
But the one that's published
live on air is I think 360p,

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:14.280
maybe 480, and the sound
quality's reduced as well.

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:18.860
So it's pretty hard to make
us visible on air side.

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:21.610
So just be aware of that when
you're trying to communicate

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:22.210
that kind of stuff.

00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:25.636
You've got to really
oversize it.

00:27:25.636 --> 00:27:26.060
JENNY MURPHY: Thanks, Fraser.

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:29.060
Well we'll set the width to 40
characters wide next time, and

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:31.670
really make it big.

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:35.110
That'll definitely be fun.

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:38.980
FRASER CAIN: Or make the thing
that shows up on the live side

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:40.305
higher definition.

00:27:40.305 --> 00:27:42.200
JENNY MURPHY: That is definitely
another solution

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.490
that we can definitely
lobby for.

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:46.070
I definitely see the
benefit of it.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.832
FRASER CAIN: Now you're
in our world.

00:27:50.832 --> 00:27:52.050
JENNY MURPHY: True that.

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:54.410
Exactly.

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:59.530
So a lot of questions
about the extension

00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:00.780
of the screen size.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.930
JONATHAN BARRY: While Jenny's
going through the comments.

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:16.467
Anybody who is in the actual
hangout that you guys joined a

00:28:16.467 --> 00:28:18.560
few minutes ago.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.640
First of all, why don't
you do a proper intro.

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.596
Everybody's saying what they've
done on Google+, a

00:28:22.596 --> 00:28:24.990
little bit about themselves,
and where they are.

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:30.680
ABRAHAM WILLIAMS: So I'm Abraham
Williams. I am mostly

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:34.690
a JavaScript developer at InboxQ
here in San Francisco.

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:38.680
And I built a Search+
for Google+.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:44.000
It essentially does instant
search in the Chrome Omnibox.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.400
And also, I've been working on
a HTML5 RTS game that I hope

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.330
to eventually get into
the games platform.

00:28:54.036 --> 00:28:55.286
JENNY MURPHY: Very cool.

00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:00.870
So still feeding up
to the comments.

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:02.700
FRASER CAIN: Abraham, did you
see that somebody had created

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.930
Command and Conquer in HTML5?

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:06.180
ABRAHAM WILLIAMS:
I noticed that.

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:07.940
I haven't had time to
look at it yet.

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:10.780
But it's definitely on
my list to look at.

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:13.730
JONATHAN BARRY: So it's funny
how [UNINTELLIGIBLE] shared

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:16.770
that link last week, and they
took down their servers.

00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:20.412
So they're still having some
issues with rendering not the

00:29:20.412 --> 00:29:22.170
HTML5 piece because that
works offline.

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:27.630
The actual static file
serving is down.

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:30.270
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:31.910
JENNY MURPHY: Very cool.

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:33.130
So I've managed to find another

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:34.420
question in the stream.

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:35.810
What editor am I using?

00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:37.560
Not really about the Google+
platform, but

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.110
I'm happy to answer.

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:40.340
I'm using IntelliJ.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:42.870
I'm a big fan of the JetBrains
IDEA products.

00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:45.160
I would probably be using
WebStorm, but

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.430
IntelliJ was there.

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:49.630
When I'm not using IntelliJ,
I'm in Camp [? BI ?].

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.840
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: You also
had a long question--

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.090
where'd it go--

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:58.940
a long question from Steven
[? Ancliff ?].

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:00.850
There was a two-part question.

00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:05.410
The first was asking about when
we're going to be able to

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:07.810
write Google+ using the API.

00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:12.120
And the second was asking some
questions regarding Python.

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:14.920
JENNY MURPHY: Ah, let me
bring that one up.

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.430
JONATHAN BARRY: I think Jenny
touched a little bit about the

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:20.680
writing for API answering
the circle question.

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.270
No ETA.

00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:24.685
For anybody's who's watched our
Office Hours before, we

00:30:24.685 --> 00:30:25.935
just don't have answers
for that.

00:30:28.496 --> 00:30:30.590
I don't want to be
a broken record.

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:32.570
But regarding the Python one.

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:34.730
JENNY MURPHY: So the other half
of this question, which I

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:38.780
missed on the first half, is
will we be covering Python

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.210
examples in this hangout?

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:45.215
I recently started learning
Python via Google Python class

00:30:45.215 --> 00:30:48.170
and would love to see some
examples in this language.

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:51.540
So the short answer is not in
this specific hangout, but we

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:53.780
can definitely do it
in future sessions.

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:56.070
So if you have any specific
things you would like to see

00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:59.670
us do with the Python Client
Library, because it's a pretty

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:02.350
cool client library
too, let us know.

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:05.410
Otherwise I'll make something
up, and we'll do this in a

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:05.960
future hangout.

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:08.730
Maybe next week, maybe
the week after.

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:09.440
But definitely.

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:13.020
So if people have any languages
or technologies they

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:15.710
want to see us using,
please let us know.

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:17.360
Very happy to take
your suggestions.

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:25.770
There's another question
from Abdula.

00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:29.420
Are there any plans to provide
hangout APIs with functions to

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:33.610
create hangouts for specified
Google accounts or circles?

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:35.520
I mean the ability to
create hangouts

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:37.200
from external portals.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.510
So it sounds like you're looking
for like a button or

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:42.270
badge or something that you can
embed in an external site.

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:45.290
And when people click on it,
it creates a hangout.

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:46.700
Which is a really cool idea.

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.255
It's kind of the idea of
hangouts everywhere.

00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:54.080
But this isn't something
we have right now.

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:56.217
And as a result, it's
not something I

00:31:56.217 --> 00:31:57.420
can really talk about.

00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:00.410
I can't really make conjecture
about what we're really--

00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:03.940
JONATHAN BARRY: We've heard
that request before from

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:08.230
people who run plus pages, and
people who are doing things

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:12.700
like last Saturday there was
an artist who did body

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:16.215
painting and a hangout on
a third-party site.

00:32:16.215 --> 00:32:19.080
So it makes sense.

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:21.700
And we've definitely conveyed
that the team to look into

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:22.680
trying to go somewhere.

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.706
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah, because
we think it's really cool.

00:32:24.706 --> 00:32:25.480
JONATHAN BARRY: No promises.

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:26.410
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah.

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:29.920
We like pushing for
cool things.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:31.170
So next question.

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:39.320
So Daniel asks about page
analytics on pages and stream

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:41.920
of posts related to--

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.990
people have mentioned that page
and page and control,

00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:46.040
whatever is shown.

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:48.390
So he's asking about analytics
for Google+

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:50.250
pages it sounds like.

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:53.150
Again, cool idea.

00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:54.250
I think it sounds really cool.

00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:56.340
And this is more kind
of the core--

00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:59.750
probably going to be more of
the core of Google+ stuff

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:01.930
rather than the Google+
platform.

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:03.980
So a really good place to send
this feedback, which I think

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:07.020
is great feedback, being a plus
page user myself, we'll

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:09.900
be using that little send
feedback link in the bottom

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:12.420
corner of the Google+
application.

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:15.560
And I promise it gets routed to
someone who does read it.

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.530
A lot of it's aggregated.

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:19.000
We don't always reply
to everything, but

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:19.730
someone does read it.

00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:21.908
And that's great feedback, that
I've also heard from a

00:33:21.908 --> 00:33:23.158
lot of other people too.

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:31.900
So another question, or it looks
like a few questions

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:32.465
from [? Abbon ?]

00:33:32.465 --> 00:33:34.760
McDaniel.

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:37.320
Is there a way to do pushed
out notification to the

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:38.970
Google+ API?

00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:41.790
I'm building something that
listens to Google+ developers

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:46.690
for I/O 2012, and notifies me
when the announcement is made.

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:49.320
Because he's paranoid he's
going to miss something.

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:56.450
Will there be a push API,
specific terms, to be produced

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:57.930
during that day?

00:33:57.930 --> 00:33:59.000
This would be really cool.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.265
There's a lot of different
push standards out there.

00:34:01.265 --> 00:34:05.250
Like one that we like a lot at
Google is pubsubhubbub, which

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:06.220
is very hard to say.

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:08.120
JONATHAN BARRY: Push.

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:08.419
JENNY MURPHY: Hmm?

00:34:08.419 --> 00:34:11.210
JONATHAN BARRY: Push is the
easier way to say it.

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:12.050
JENNY MURPHY: Push, yeah.

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:14.210
Push technologies.

00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:15.489
We think they're really cool.

00:34:15.489 --> 00:34:19.159
We see a lot of potential
for them.

00:34:19.159 --> 00:34:25.105
But again, this is another
future-looking thing.

00:34:25.105 --> 00:34:27.244
Can't make any promises.

00:34:27.244 --> 00:34:28.449
This is something we
just don't know

00:34:28.449 --> 00:34:29.409
the specifics about.

00:34:29.409 --> 00:34:31.840
So there's not a lot
we can tell you.

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:33.239
JONATHAN BARRY: We even
have to long poll.

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:35.210
Watch your quota.

00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:36.810
Do your search.

00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:37.150
JENNY MURPHY: Exactly.

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:39.360
So for now you can just keep
doing-- using a technique

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:42.239
similar to what I showed you
on the comments API--

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:49.270
you can keep pulling the API and
examining the new content

00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:50.520
for each one of those polls.

00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:55.139
Cool.

00:34:55.139 --> 00:34:57.030
So now that I've hammered
through a bunch of questions,

00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:59.740
anyone in the local hangouts
have anything?

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:01.750
FRASER CAIN: I think that people
are now asking their

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:03.460
questions on the new
stream page.

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:05.250
You might want to check
that as well.

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:07.330
JENNY MURPHY: Good point.

00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:08.690
FRASER CAIN: Looks like there's
about eight comments

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:09.910
over there.

00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:11.850
JENNY MURPHY: So in the
meantime, Ed asked a question

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:15.960
on the previous post, since
now we've forked it.

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:17.640
And he asked, how long
is the wait for

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.770
increased quota limit?

00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:22.190
So we're actually doing a lot
of things to try to improve

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:26.550
our response time for
quota requests.

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:28.820
And we're working on a
process right now.

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:30.540
We're making it faster
and faster.

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:36.020
But the real answer is that
it kind of depends.

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:43.480
It depends on how much quota
you're asking for, and if

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:45.710
you've kind of met all
of our instructions.

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:48.460
If you want to get a response
as quickly as possible, make

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:50.740
sure that you follow the
instructions we have up there,

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:53.560
including linking to
your application.

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:55.600
And following our terms
of service, like

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:57.800
having a privacy policy.

00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:59.060
If you do those things,
we'll be able to

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:00.310
respond much faster.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.990
JONATHAN BARRY: And just to make
sure that everybody else

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:08.500
knows that you can actually
submit a request for

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:11.050
additional quota through
the developer console.

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:13.200
And that goes to our team, and
we review all the things that

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.950
Jenny mentioned.

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:17.080
And it is on a case-by-case
basis.

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:17.740
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah.

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:21.480
So it's hard to say exactly
how long it takes.

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:24.170
ABRAHAM WILLIAMS: Just so
people have examples.

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:27.340
The last time I did it, I got
a response within 24 hours.

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:31.170
So it's generally, in my
experience, been very fast.

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:33.150
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah, but it's
because you give us very

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:34.270
detailed quota requests.

00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:35.520
It helps a lot.

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:39.560
So I'd probably err on the side
of telling us too much

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:42.030
more than too little.

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:43.280
Saves us research time.

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:49.590
So I'm looking at the other
thread now that

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:50.610
Fraser pointed me to.

00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:51.940
See if there's any
questions there.

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:57.520
So there's the same questions in
there a few times, which is

00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:00.510
when will hangouts on air
be open to more people?

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:03.420
When will everyone who's
watching be able to create

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:05.200
their own hangouts on air.

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.950
And this is a pretty
experimental technology.

00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:09.860
We're opening it up to a very
small number of people.

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:13.000
In fact, I've personally only
gotten access really recently,

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.430
and I'm a Googler in developer
relations.

00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:21.850
So we're being really cautious
with expanding it.

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:23.540
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: Was the crash
earlier an indication on

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:25.680
why it's still experimental?

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:26.690
JENNY MURPHY: Yes.

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:30.800
It was more an err of the
driver than the vehicle.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.300
I actually hit the wrong button
and killed the hangout.

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:36.060
But that's the kind of things
we're trying to improve before

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:37.410
we open it up to a
wider audience.

00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:39.187
Because we want to make sure
that everyone who uses this

00:37:39.187 --> 00:37:42.900
has as good an experience
as they can.

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:47.180
FRASER CAIN: But there's got
to be some legal issues and

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:49.840
copyright issues as
well to make it

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:50.960
available to a wider audience.

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.040
It's a--

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:53.920
JONATHAN BARRY: So for people
who are actually in the

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:58.200
hangout, you must have saw
a friendly legal screen.

00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:01.160
And all participants that are on
on-air hangout have to read

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.320
and confirm.

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:09.520
There are a bunch of legal
things in the US, and

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:12.410
exponentially more
around the world.

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:17.770
So like Martin, if he does
something that's OK in the US,

00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:19.840
that might not be OK in
Germany, for example.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:23.560
Especially around
the media laws.

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:26.500
MARTIN: There are a lot
of things, yeah.

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:28.600
FRASER CAIN: You've got to have
some very brave lawyers,

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:32.820
because with the sort of
potential for shenanigans with

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:35.360
this technology, I'm
really impressed.

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:38.290
They've got to just be
very brave lawyers.

00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:39.917
JONATHAN BARRY: I think we have
frightened lawyers, and

00:38:39.917 --> 00:38:41.180
many of them.

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:44.930
But we have a very compelling
community of people.

00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:48.845
So we're pushing them hard.

00:38:48.845 --> 00:38:50.700
JENNY MURPHY: Very cool.

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:52.200
So I see one more question.

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:56.180
I guess I'll field
one or two more.

00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:59.475
Austin asks is there going to
be a centralized hangouts

00:38:59.475 --> 00:39:01.950
portal where all the hangout
related stuff is

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:04.150
going to reside in?

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:06.920
So I'm assuming you're talking
about active hangouts that you

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:08.860
can go for discovery.

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:11.620
Discovery's definitely something
we care about.

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:14.440
As you can see in the Google+
interface, we're constantly

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:18.320
kind of adding new things to the
side column that make it

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.620
easier for you to find hangouts

00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:22.180
that are running currently.

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:24.300
And we're trying to improve
discoverability within the

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:25.890
application itself.

00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:29.920
As for what we do in the future,
not really sure.

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.640
That's something I can't,
again, can't talk about.

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:33.700
As you can see we're
making little

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:35.090
improvements here and there.

00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:36.110
FRASER CAIN: Can I
ask a question

00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:37.290
based on that comment?

00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:43.540
Is the lack of discoverability
or the ramp of discoverability

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:48.320
sort of also trying to work in
the performance of the service

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:50.570
able to handle growing
amounts of hangouts?

00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:53.060
Like you don't want to open
up the floodgates too far?

00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:55.740
Like if you could have them
perfectly discoverable, would

00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:59.720
that make you happy today, or
would you rather sort of

00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:00.960
increase the volume?

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:03.870
I don't know if I'm making
any sense there.

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:05.550
JONATHAN BARRY: I don't know
whether I'd be able to answer

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:11.170
that question, because that's
more about strategy and user

00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:12.020
experience.

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:14.770
But what I will tell you is most
of the features you're

00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:17.130
seeing in Google+ have
been iterative.

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:22.640
And that's because everything
we add is deliberate, small

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:24.770
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:27.350
And that's why we get this
massive flood of feedback from

00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:29.030
all the passionate users.

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:31.380
And then we take our own
strategy around how we want

00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:35.590
the product to go, and the
usability studies, and

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:37.620
brilliant designers to
come up with the

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:40.880
smallest little button.

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:42.230
FRASER CAIN: Well yeah, I'm just
wondering whether it was

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:44.490
more an issue of capacity and
bandwidth, because I'm sure

00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:49.870
providing free video streaming
to hundreds of thousands of

00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:52.890
people simultaneously is
taxing on servers.

00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:54.030
JONATHAN BARRY: It is taxing.

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:56.170
Fortunately, we've been
investing in the technology

00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:57.990
for many, many years.

00:40:57.990 --> 00:41:01.100
The original Google Talk
plug-in for one-to-one

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:02.790
communication, YouTube

00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:05.120
infrastructure, all that stuff.

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:09.050
But yes, it is a constant
challenge for anybody.

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:10.660
JENNY MURPHY: We're also very
concerned with making sure

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:12.880
that the quality of experience
people have in hangouts

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:14.240
remains very high.

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:16.670
Because what we've discovered
from feedback is that people

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:18.770
are having a really good time
in hangouts, and they're

00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:20.665
having an experience that's
different than they've had in

00:41:20.665 --> 00:41:21.910
other video chats before.

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:23.790
And we want to make sure
that we keep that

00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:26.630
experience top notch.

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:29.170
And we think that the current
social model plays

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:32.100
a big part in that.

00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:34.230
Cool.

00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:36.760
So we're about out of time,
so I guess it's about

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.070
time to wrap up.

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:39.843
So does anyone have any closing
thoughts before we

00:41:39.843 --> 00:41:41.093
call it a day?

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:44.920
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: I know you
can't comment on future plans,

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:47.670
but what are your future plans
on how you're going to be

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:51.730
running your weekly
office sessions?

00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:52.665
JENNY MURPHY: Weekly
office sessions.

00:41:52.665 --> 00:41:54.480
It seems like a lot of people--
we got a lot of

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:57.960
feedback from the chats
during this.

00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:00.170
Probably be doing some
smaller assignments.

00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:02.410
I'll probably be bugging a lot
of you guys, and a lot of

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:04.170
other people in the community
afterwards to see how to

00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:06.690
improve it as much as we can.

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:08.330
We'll definitely change
the way we live

00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:10.534
coding, if we do it again.

00:42:10.534 --> 00:42:11.500
JONATHAN BARRY: We
will do it again.

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:12.350
JENNY MURPHY: We will
do it again.

00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:16.560
We will figure out how to do
it-- just very short lines.

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:18.650
And we'll see.

00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:21.660
This is a little bit of an
experiment, and each week is

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:22.830
one step in that experiment.

00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:26.310
JONATHAN BARRY: And just the
general architecture is we're

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:28.570
going to be topic-focused.

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:30.890
Obviously, opening it up for
questions, both in the stream

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:32.280
and the participants.

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:34.040
But we really actually want
to educate in each one.

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:37.280
So today was the
comment widget.

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:39.660
We already have a request for
doing something in Python.

00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:42.390
We have a bunch of hangout stuff
that we want to build as

00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:43.110
sample apps.

00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:46.040
And as new things do allow,
we're going to try to

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:49.052
incorporate those into the
Office Hours, not just hey, we

00:42:49.052 --> 00:42:50.460
released something.

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:51.300
Go read the docs.

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:55.450
Actually try to show you how
to use it when it's fresh.

00:42:55.450 --> 00:42:56.630
JENNY MURPHY: Although, when
we do release things, we'll

00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:57.860
definitely be talking
about them.

00:42:57.860 --> 00:42:59.670
But we want to make sure it's
interactive and educational

00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:00.450
when we do it.

00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:03.190
So when people come back later
to watch the videos, they're

00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:05.650
useful to them and they can do
something with everything we

00:43:05.650 --> 00:43:06.800
talk about.

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:08.400
FRASER CAIN: It might be cool
as well to have some of the

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:10.310
people actually demonstrate
some of the things that

00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:12.770
they've built, and how
they got things done.

00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:15.900
So other people screen sharing
as well would be pretty cool.

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:17.050
JENNY MURPHY: We would
love that.

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:19.520
So anyone out there in the world
who's building something

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:21.890
cool, come and show it to us.

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:24.790
I'm happy to hangout and even
in one-on-ones just to see

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:26.000
whatever they're building.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.060
And yes, we would love to hear
from people in the developer

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:32.510
community about what they're
building, and we'd love to

00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:34.800
help you show it off in
our Office Hours.

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.010
JONATHAN BARRY: We may
even do that--

00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:37.390
why don't we do that
next week?

00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:39.180
JENNY MURPHY: If we have someone
who has something to

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:43.555
show that's pretty cool, we'll
definitely bring it up some

00:43:43.555 --> 00:43:44.553
time in the next few weeks.

00:43:44.553 --> 00:43:46.640
JONATHAN BARRY: Perfect.

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:48.260
Well guys, I want to thank
everybody who joined us in the

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:50.580
hangout, everybody who watched
the on-air, and all the

00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:52.670
commentaries in the stream.

00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:52.920
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah.

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:55.110
Thanks so much for bearing with
us, especially as the

00:43:55.110 --> 00:43:58.100
hangout forked into a
second copy when I

00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:00.200
hit the wrong button.

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:03.120
But thanks a lot, and I'll see
you guys all next week.

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:04.150
Goodbye.

00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:04.610
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: Thanks.

00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:06.110
Bye.

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:07.360
MARTIN: Bye.
