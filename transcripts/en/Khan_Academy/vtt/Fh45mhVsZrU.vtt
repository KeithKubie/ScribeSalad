00:00:00.192 --> 00:00:01.823
preciou- [Voiceover] Hello
grammarians, hello Rosie!

00:00:01.823 --> 00:00:02.670
- [Voiceover] Hi David!

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:03.503
- [Voiceover] How are you?

00:00:03.503 --> 00:00:04.336
- [Voiceover] Good, how are you?

00:00:04.336 --> 00:00:05.938
- [Voiceover] Good, today
we are going to talk about

00:00:05.938 --> 00:00:08.105
run-ons and comma splices.

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:12.351
So a run-on sentence is what happens

00:00:12.351 --> 00:00:14.690
when two independent
clauses are put together

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.041
in one sentence without any punctuation

00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:21.632
or coordinating conjunctions
like and, but, or.

00:00:21.632 --> 00:00:25.799
So Rosie what is a good
example of a run-on sentence?

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.440
- [Voiceover] We bought
nails we bought a hammer.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.593
- [Voiceover] Yeah, so we
can see that this sentence

00:00:32.593 --> 00:00:36.343
contains two individual,
independent clauses.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.573
So we've got number one, we bought nails,

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:42.255
number two, we bought a hammer.

00:00:42.255 --> 00:00:43.579
Now there are a couple of different ways

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.253
we could make this a legal sentence,

00:00:45.253 --> 00:00:48.041
but right now as it stands
this is a run-on, right?

00:00:48.041 --> 00:00:49.426
- [Voiceover] So there
are a couple of ways

00:00:49.426 --> 00:00:50.982
we could fix this sentence.

00:00:50.982 --> 00:00:53.680
One way would be just to
add a semicolon in there.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.780
So you've got two independent clauses.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.641
- [Voiceover] We bought nails, semicolon,

00:00:58.641 --> 00:00:59.855
we bought a hammer.

00:00:59.855 --> 00:01:01.115
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:01:01.115 --> 00:01:03.333
Another way you could
do that would be to just

00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:06.453
add a comma and then the conjunction and,

00:01:06.453 --> 00:01:09.159
so you're connecting those two clauses.

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.386
- [Voiceover] So this is a
run-on sentence without this and,

00:01:11.386 --> 00:01:13.905
and this comma, and it's called that

00:01:13.905 --> 00:01:16.847
because it's sort of like
a runaway train, you know,

00:01:16.847 --> 00:01:21.014
it doesn't have enough stoppage
in it is how I would put it.

00:01:22.031 --> 00:01:23.620
So that's what a run-on sentence is,

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.110
and now I wanna talk about comma splicing.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.637
And the word splice,
not a super-common term

00:01:29.637 --> 00:01:33.440
if you are neither a
sailor or a film editor.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.715
But splicing is a word
that originally meant

00:01:36.715 --> 00:01:39.169
to take two ropes, untangle them,

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:40.900
and weave them back together.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.329
It's a sailor's term
related to rope lines.

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:47.246
In our case for grammar, a splice,

00:01:47.246 --> 00:01:50.439
a comma splice is an inappropriate joining

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.106
of two independent
clauses by using a comma.

00:02:02.014 --> 00:02:05.687
So Rosie, this is Li'l
Tony, Crime Fighting Pony.

00:02:05.687 --> 00:02:06.719
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.807
- [Voiceover] So for
example, in this sentence,

00:02:08.807 --> 00:02:11.570
I love Li'l Tony 2: Pony Up 2 the Streets,

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.552
it's my favorite movie in
the Li'l Tony franchise,

00:02:14.552 --> 00:02:16.600
a very fine series of non-existent films.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.379
The problem with this
sentence is that right now

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.776
it's got this comma in the middle of it,

00:02:22.776 --> 00:02:26.238
and this comma inappropriately joins

00:02:26.238 --> 00:02:28.878
these two independent clauses.

00:02:28.878 --> 00:02:32.128
Oh, and this whole time I forgot to say

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.410
two independent clauses
inappropriately joined by a comma.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.426
So okay, so we've got
independent clause number one,

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:43.245
remember this thing could
stand on its own as a sentence,

00:02:43.245 --> 00:02:44.895
I love the name of this movie.

00:02:44.895 --> 00:02:47.276
I love Li'l Tony 2: Pony Up 2 the Streets.

00:02:47.276 --> 00:02:48.852
That could be its own sentence on its own,

00:02:48.852 --> 00:02:50.835
end it with a period, period.

00:02:50.835 --> 00:02:53.525
It's my favorite movie in the
Li'l Tony franchise, period.

00:02:53.525 --> 00:02:56.613
But we have these two
independent clauses, right?

00:02:56.613 --> 00:02:59.780
We cannot join them with just a comma.

00:03:00.643 --> 00:03:03.154
We could say I love Li'l Tony
2: Pony Up 2 the Streets,

00:03:03.154 --> 00:03:06.778
comma, and it's my favorite
movie in the Li'l Tony franchise

00:03:06.778 --> 00:03:10.061
or as we did in the previous example,

00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:12.507
we could also throw in a semicolon,

00:03:12.507 --> 00:03:13.856
which is I think what I would rather do.

00:03:13.856 --> 00:03:16.115
I love Li'l Tony 2: Pony Up 2 the Streets;

00:03:16.115 --> 00:03:18.585
semicolon, it's my favorite movie

00:03:18.585 --> 00:03:19.861
in the Li'l Tony franchise.

00:03:19.861 --> 00:03:21.990
And Rosie, you will notice
that I have underlined

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.501
these titles.

00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:24.533
- [Voiceover] Oh yes.

00:03:24.533 --> 00:03:26.037
- [Voiceover] Because these are the names

00:03:26.037 --> 00:03:28.491
of published works, even
though we made them up.

00:03:28.491 --> 00:03:30.083
- [Voiceover] Right, exactly.

00:03:30.083 --> 00:03:31.404
- [Voiceover] But okay,
but for real I would love

00:03:31.404 --> 00:03:34.667
to see like a Li'l Tony,
Crime Fighting Pony series.

00:03:34.667 --> 00:03:35.500
- [Voiceover] Totally.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.706
- [Voiceover] So to review,

00:03:36.706 --> 00:03:38.754
when you're looking at a run-on,

00:03:38.754 --> 00:03:41.606
you're looking at two independent
clauses that are together

00:03:41.606 --> 00:03:43.971
in one sentence, that are
joined inappropriately

00:03:43.971 --> 00:03:46.758
without punctuation or conjunctions.

00:03:46.758 --> 00:03:49.196
So, we bought nails we bought a hammer.

00:03:49.196 --> 00:03:51.341
There's not really a place to know

00:03:51.341 --> 00:03:55.174
where the division between
clauses is in that,

00:03:56.712 --> 00:04:00.036
and so the thing to do is
either to add some kind of,

00:04:00.036 --> 00:04:03.766
is to add a comma and a conjunction,

00:04:03.766 --> 00:04:07.244
or to combine them using a semicolon.

00:04:07.244 --> 00:04:09.478
The same deal with a comma splice,

00:04:09.478 --> 00:04:12.274
it's just that a comma splice is a run-on

00:04:12.274 --> 00:04:14.598
that hasn't been fixed all the way.

00:04:14.598 --> 00:04:16.459
- [Voiceover] Right,
the comma's being used

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.660
but we need some bigger
punctuation in place of the comma,

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.683
something like a semicolon,

00:04:22.683 --> 00:04:26.315
in order to make a
distinction between those two

00:04:26.315 --> 00:04:27.941
independent clauses.

00:04:27.941 --> 00:04:29.655
- [Voiceover] So that is
how you identify and fix

00:04:29.655 --> 00:04:31.800
run-ons and comma splices.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.434
You can learn anything, David out.

00:04:33.434 --> 00:04:35.434
- [Voiceover] Rosie out.
