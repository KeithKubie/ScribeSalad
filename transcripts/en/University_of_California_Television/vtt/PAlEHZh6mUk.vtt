00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.900
- Welcome to a conversation with history.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.040
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.590
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.330
Our guest today is E.J. Dionne Jr.,

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.220
who is a senior fellow at
the Brookings Institution

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.363
and a columnist for the Washington Post.

00:00:44.363 --> 00:00:46.240
He's the author of several books,

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.088
including Why Americans Hate Politics,

00:00:49.088 --> 00:00:51.910
They Only Look Dead: Why Progressives

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.920
Will Dominate the Next Political Era,

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.930
and he's the editor of two books,

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.079
one with John J. DiIulio,

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.210
What's God Got To Do With
the American Experiment,

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.160
and most recently, a
book with William Crystal

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.470
called Bush vs. Gore: The
Court Cases and the Commentary.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.690
E.J., welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:13.590
- Good to be here.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.031
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:16.031 --> 00:01:18.110
- I was actually born
in a hospital in Boston

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.540
but I was raised in a place called

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.480
Fall River, Massachusetts, which is

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.720
a factory town about 15
miles south of Boston.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.280
A lot of people go through my hometown

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.463
on the way to Cape Cod.

00:01:29.184 --> 00:01:32.900
I love my hometown, I've
spent time up there.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.210
My mom died a few years
back, I get up a little less.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.583
It was a very political town.

00:01:37.583 --> 00:01:39.210
A friend of mine once said

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.923
that there were three kinds
of people in Fall River,

00:01:41.923 --> 00:01:43.038
people running for office,

00:01:43.038 --> 00:01:43.871
people getting ready to run for office,

00:01:43.871 --> 00:01:46.190
and people recovering
from running for office.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.640
And I think you just sort of,

00:01:48.971 --> 00:01:51.443
you got interested in politics
just by breathing the air.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.460
- And how did your parents
shape your character,

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.630
do you think, in retrospect?

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.840
- Well, in a lot of different ways.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.500
I mean, my mom was a teacher
and librarian most of her life.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.370
She worked and retired at age 75.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.767
And so, you know, books were,

00:02:08.767 --> 00:02:13.590
I got to love books and
book learning through her.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.120
My dad was a dentist who
loved newspapers and politics.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.704
I mean I think I'm
totally a creature of my,

00:02:19.704 --> 00:02:21.739
and happily so, a
creature of my upbringing.

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.948
My dad would get four Sunday newspapers

00:02:23.948 --> 00:02:24.920
and he loved to argue politics.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.900
My whole family loved to argue politics.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.480
And so, in fact my dad argued,

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.614
my dad and I argued all the time

00:02:32.614 --> 00:02:35.420
about A, politics and B,
why the Red Sox were losing.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.420
- And in these arguments,
you often would take

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.250
positions that you might not have held,

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.710
but you were forced to
think about them and argue.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.610
- Right, my dad had a wonderful idea,

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.524
which I hope I, you
know, sort of stick to,

00:02:49.524 --> 00:02:51.422
which is, he thought it was a good thing

00:02:51.422 --> 00:02:53.332
for kids to argue with their parents.

00:02:53.332 --> 00:02:54.626
He thought it was a good thing,

00:02:54.626 --> 00:02:55.480
they sorta sharpen your mind

00:02:56.554 --> 00:02:57.510
and you sorta have to come to terms

00:02:58.523 --> 00:02:59.456
with whatever you're arguing about.

00:02:59.456 --> 00:03:00.800
So he would, my dad was a conservative,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.270
but I always say he was a
compassionate conservative

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.570
before compassionate
conservatism was cool.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:06.800
But he was also very independent-minded.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.820
So he was against the
Vietnam War before I was,

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.834
which is very much the reverse

00:03:10.834 --> 00:03:13.170
of what happened with a
lot of people at that time.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.650
But he would usually take a position

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.796
well to the right of his own

00:03:16.796 --> 00:03:17.950
and I would often take a
position to the left of my own,

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.050
and we would go at it.

00:03:20.092 --> 00:03:21.540
And the lesson I learned from that,

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.670
and also from my, my dad's
family was a very large family

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.530
and that was a very
political time with Vietnam

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.704
and every family event
was a political argument,

00:03:30.704 --> 00:03:32.650
and it was a politically diverse family.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.756
And I guess what it taught me

00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:36.300
is you can disagree with someone
and love them all the same,

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.580
that there's something, argument
itself is not a bad thing.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.620
To me, civility, which is a
very popular word these days,

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.630
civility is not about being mushy

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.890
or not disagreeing on anything

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.876
or pretending that you have,

00:03:48.876 --> 00:03:51.130
you know, consensus when it doesn't exist.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.870
Civility is respecting the
person you disagree with.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.370
And that's what's in short supply,

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.850
not assuming that the
person you disagree with

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.040
is sort of Al Capone or Hitler
or some character like that.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.022
- And a key in this, I guess,

00:04:04.022 --> 00:04:06.364
is also listening, actually, to the other.

00:04:06.364 --> 00:04:08.280
With the respect goes the notion

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.580
that you actually listen
to what their saying,

00:04:11.623 --> 00:04:12.456
and that you might possibly learn

00:04:12.456 --> 00:04:13.590
from what the other side is saying.

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:17.447
- There's a philosopher
at Boston University

00:04:17.447 --> 00:04:19.050
called Glen Tinder, and
he has a wonderful idea.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.423
He says that what we need to create

00:04:21.423 --> 00:04:24.139
is what he called the attentive society.

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.160
And he says the attentive society

00:04:26.248 --> 00:04:27.081
is a place where we all acknowledge

00:04:27.081 --> 00:04:29.900
that we need to give and receive
help on the road to truth.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.980
And I think that's, I love that idea.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.010
And also, Christopher Lash talked about

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.020
argument in a similar way, where he said,

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.870
you know, if you really
engage in argument,

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.300
you're actually putting
your own views at risk,

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.630
because you really have
to enter imaginatively

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.380
into the ideas of the other person.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.630
And that's a lot more fun

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.580
than just yelling at somebody, I think.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.777
- You said in one interview,

00:04:52.777 --> 00:04:56.947
"I grew up believing that
politics was not only a good thing

00:04:56.947 --> 00:04:59.295
"and an important thing,
but that it was fun."

00:04:59.295 --> 00:05:00.128
- Right.

00:05:00.128 --> 00:05:01.650
I mean, again, this is a product

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.290
of Massachusetts and
Fall River in particular.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.417
Mary McGrory, the great columnist,

00:05:06.417 --> 00:05:09.040
once said that every baby
born in Massachusetts

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.120
is born with a campaign manager's gene.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.382
And I think there's a
lot of truth to that.

00:05:14.382 --> 00:05:17.060
You know, people were very involved,

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.160
from the sort of lowest
level to the highest level.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.168
They cared a lot about, you know,

00:05:22.168 --> 00:05:24.459
we have great mayor's races
and city council races.

00:05:24.459 --> 00:05:27.292
You know, it was, for a kid who,

00:05:27.292 --> 00:05:30.450
this isn't always the
best model for politics,

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:31.982
but it is part of it.

00:05:31.982 --> 00:05:33.190
There's a kinda competition in politics

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.580
as there is in sports.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.730
And when you look at it it's actually

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.840
an interesting endeavor
that people are engaged in.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.710
And then, I also think, you know,

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.670
you're a product of where you came from,

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.900
you're also the product of
the time you grew up in.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.760
And I grew up in a time when

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.634
politics was held in very
high esteem in the country.

00:05:50.634 --> 00:05:52.840
Eisenhower was president.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.790
I was born in 1952 and was eight years old

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.894
when John Kennedy was elected.

00:05:57.894 --> 00:05:59.360
And what you had there were two models,

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.860
different kinds of leadership,

00:06:01.785 --> 00:06:04.070
but people whom Americans respected.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.660
And we were coming up
sorta the Depression period

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.623
and World War II, where people felt,

00:06:09.595 --> 00:06:10.660
you know, government and, if you will,

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.749
collective endeavor actually
accomplished good things.

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:16.510
And so, you know, that's my view

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.380
and I'm gonna stick with it.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.630
And it shaped me and it sorta pains me

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.240
that, you know, when I look at

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.140
sorta the experience kids
have now of politics,

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.830
you know, we went through a long period

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.140
of disengagement, scandal and the like,

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.460
and it creates a wholly
different attitude,

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.580
for completely understandable reasons,

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.520
toward public endeavor.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.889
- Let's talk about that in a minute,

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:41.420
but one element I wanna
add here is your education.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.713
You went to Harvard.

00:06:43.645 --> 00:06:46.410
And how did that add a layer?

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:49.640
And then you went on to become
a Rhodes Scholar in England.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.347
So I'm just curious how this civic culture

00:06:55.869 --> 00:07:00.869
and this citizenship way of modality

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.763
were influenced by your education.

00:07:04.763 --> 00:07:06.990
If I can link the two, I mean,

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:08.720
one of the good things
about going to Harvard

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.135
was that it was close to my hometown,

00:07:11.135 --> 00:07:11.968
it was about 50 miles away.

00:07:11.968 --> 00:07:14.727
And at the time, I was
there from '69 to '73,

00:07:14.727 --> 00:07:18.010
and this was a time of a
lot of antiwar activity.

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:20.274
And there was a wonderful
man in my hometown

00:07:20.274 --> 00:07:21.743
who's very very important to me,

00:07:21.743 --> 00:07:23.820
he was like a second father,
my dad died when I was 16,

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.270
and his name was Burt Yaffe and he ran

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:28.560
for Congress in 1970
as an antiwar Democrat.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.120
I always say we ran 50,000 votes

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.031
better than the previous Democrat,

00:07:34.031 --> 00:07:35.380
the bad news is that we
lost by 25,000 votes.

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.670
But he was a fabulous guy.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.610
And I used to bring
down lots of my friends

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.770
to work on various political
campaigns in Fall River,

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.940
and that was a time when
there were a lot of people

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.910
who were Marxists or
claiming to be Marxists,

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:49.420
and I always told them it was about time

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:50.910
they actually met the working class

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:52.650
that they love to talk about so much,

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.540
and I said, you know,
you'll actually like them.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.474
And you know, so for me it was,

00:07:57.474 --> 00:07:59.640
I didn't feel, when I went up there,

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.250
you know, sometimes people go to college

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.240
and, you know, again, for
understandable reasons,

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.740
kinda separate from their hometown,

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.140
and for me it was really good to,

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.860
I had enough distance,
it was 50 miles away,

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:08.860
and yet it was close enough

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.313
that I felt the two came together.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.850
You know, some of it, there are sort of

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:17.943
several different things
that I think of now

00:08:17.943 --> 00:08:21.414
that I took away from that
experience, academically.

00:08:21.414 --> 00:08:25.170
One was, I got interested in sorta

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:27.628
political philosophy and social theory.

00:08:27.628 --> 00:08:29.719
One of the bests courses I will ever take

00:08:29.719 --> 00:08:32.640
was a debate between Michael Walzer,

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.479
the great sort of social democratic

00:08:34.479 --> 00:08:37.300
or democratic socialist
political philosopher,

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.880
and Robert Nozick, the
libertarian political philosopher.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.487
And they gave a class called
capitalism and socialism.

00:08:43.487 --> 00:08:45.020
And to watch these guys hammer out,

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.448
I mean, first of all, for a kid to see

00:08:47.448 --> 00:08:48.567
what philosophical argument is about

00:08:48.567 --> 00:08:50.460
and what philosophical examples are,

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.080
Nozick was particularly brilliant

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.690
at finding the right example
to make his libertarian point.

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:58.900
You know, Walzer was, you
know, one of the people

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:00.933
who very much shaped my view.

00:09:00.933 --> 00:09:03.390
You know, there's some
other folks, Marty Peretz,

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:06.776
who also went to Brandeis,
as you noted earlier.

00:09:06.776 --> 00:09:09.570
Then, on the practical level,

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:11.630
I learned a lot about computers,

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:13.020
polling, and that sort of thing.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.890
Bill Schneider was one of my teachers

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:16.690
who actually got me into journalism.

00:09:17.806 --> 00:09:20.606
So that was a kinda
set of technical skills

00:09:20.606 --> 00:09:22.080
that served me well.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.260
My first real job was helping set up

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:25.530
the New York Times CBS polls.

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:26.770
So that's another piece.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:31.280
And then, the time I
was there was the first

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.020
moment when they had opened
up the divinity school

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.660
to undergraduates, and I have
always had this interest,

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.350
partly, again, we're a creature
from where we come from.

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.040
My parents were sort
of seriously religious

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.963
and not overly pious, which
is a good combination.

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.170
And you know, so I took courses

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.220
with Harvey Cox up at the divinity school.

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.980
And I always tell students that,

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.940
never assume that some
course you wanna take

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.850
will be professionally useless.

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:58.892
It turned out that one of the most

00:09:58.892 --> 00:09:59.725
professionally useful courses I took

00:09:59.725 --> 00:10:01.870
was the one on the transcript
that looks least useful.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:05.530
It was called Eschatology and Politics.

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:07.540
And Harvey Cox was very engaged

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.424
with the liberation
theologians in Latin America.

00:10:10.424 --> 00:10:12.420
And sometimes we'd get stuff to read

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.570
that was sorta xeroxes
coming up from Chile.

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:16.860
Or it wasn't even xerox
then, it was mimeograph.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.940
And then, you know, some many years later,

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:20.804
here I am covering the Vatican

00:10:20.804 --> 00:10:23.099
where the central issue
is liberation theology.

00:10:23.099 --> 00:10:24.680
So intellectually, I think those were

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.610
sort of, you know, critical experiences.

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:29.546
And then, obviously, a lot of friends.

00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:33.551
I still have friends I stay in
touch with from those times.

00:10:33.551 --> 00:10:35.640
- Two points emerged when I
read about your background.

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.905
One was that, during the Vietnam War,

00:10:38.905 --> 00:10:42.280
your default position was always

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.470
to get your radical friends

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:46.260
to be able to explain their positions

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.518
so the people in your
hometown could understand.

00:10:49.518 --> 00:10:52.110
Or at least that was the
argument you made to them.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.576
And then the other was
that your dissertation

00:10:54.576 --> 00:10:57.865
as a Rhodes Scholar was really on

00:10:57.865 --> 00:11:02.150
what liberalism got right in
the Civil Rights Movement,

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:03.640
but what it didn't get right

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.280
and the impact it had on American policy.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.480
Talk about those themes,

00:11:08.647 --> 00:11:10.727
'cause they're kinda themes that run

00:11:10.727 --> 00:11:11.863
through a lot of your work, basically.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.410
- When I look back on
the antiwar movement,

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:16.210
the thing that always bothered me most

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:20.720
was a sense of elitism that the, you know,

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.310
that President Nixon and
all the other Republicans

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:25.188
really took advantage of.

00:11:25.188 --> 00:11:26.461
And they didn't make it up.

00:11:26.461 --> 00:11:30.780
There was, at times, a
contempt for ordinary people.

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.240
And here you had privileged kids

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.451
sitting around this great university,

00:11:35.451 --> 00:11:38.430
and the people fighting the
war were people, you know,

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:41.060
working class whites, African-Americans.

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.070
And it just, you know, it pained me

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:48.030
because this sense of, you know,

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:49.700
average people was not the sense

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.030
I knew to be true from my own experience.

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:54.570
And so, I enjoyed taking,
as I said earlier,

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:57.216
I enjoyed having kids
come down to Fall River

00:11:57.216 --> 00:12:00.970
because then these folks
are no longer an abstraction

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:04.240
where either you glorify
them in some Marxist theory

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.485
or you dump on them as kind of

00:12:06.485 --> 00:12:08.190
bigoted or ignorant or something.

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:11.110
And that's not, you know,
all people are complicated,

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:12.680
but there's a lot more wisdom there.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.650
And it was out of that that I,

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:20.273
I was also interested in the
race issue and, you know,

00:12:20.273 --> 00:12:22.290
the thesis is, it compares Britain

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:24.440
and the United States on the race issue.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.250
And I always thought
that there was a problem

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:29.070
with theories that, again,

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:32.670
there's sort of an Archie
Bunker view of history

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:35.160
that says, you know,
the white working class

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.360
is always hostile to African-Americans,

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:41.431
there is an enlightened white
elite that's very tolerant.

00:12:41.431 --> 00:12:44.426
And to me, the real story was that,

00:12:44.426 --> 00:12:47.340
you know, working class,
low middle class whites

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.350
were usually the people who were in direct

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:50.790
conflict with African-Americans.

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:52.520
And a lot of these conflicts were not

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.070
because someone was an evil racist,

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:56.360
it was because there was
a real conflict situation

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.090
that wealthier people
could buy their way out of.

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:01.600
And what I talked about in the thesis is,

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.920
you know, how this played out in politics.

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.430
I've always been interested
in the idea of community.

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:09.770
Probably my favorite conservative
political philosopher

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:11.760
is a man called Robert
Nisbet who wrote a book

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.643
called The Quest for
Community back in the '50s.

00:13:14.705 --> 00:13:16.460
- And his book was adopted
by radicals, actually.

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.699
- It's a fascinating, actually,

00:13:18.699 --> 00:13:20.940
I got to meet Nisbet once and he told me

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.331
that he hated the New
Left, and yet he said

00:13:23.331 --> 00:13:25.830
the New Left brought his
book back into print.

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:28.663
And he always had the
honesty to acknowledge that.

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:33.690
And the community, I thought,
was not just some abstraction,

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:35.540
it's a resource that people can draw on,

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:37.830
and that, when we talked about conflicts

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:40.872
over integration, I thought these were

00:13:40.872 --> 00:13:43.030
real conflicts over turf and over

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:45.350
control of something
tangible and valuable,

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:47.094
so that we shouldn't have been

00:13:47.094 --> 00:13:48.990
as shocked as we were when there were

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:52.660
conflicts over busing or conflicts over,

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:55.072
or blockbusting where, in effect,

00:13:55.072 --> 00:13:57.370
both whites and blacks were exploited

00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:59.630
when whites were scared
out of the neighborhoods

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:01.070
when African-Americans tried to move in.

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:03.250
And so, I thought we could
do better on civil rights

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:04.950
if we had a more nuanced sense

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:07.070
of what these conflicts were about

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:09.430
for the people who were involved in them.

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:10.880
- Now your first book,

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.640
well we should say, you became a reporter,

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.870
you were at the New York Times,

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:18.020
you had assignments in
different places in Europe,

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.080
and then you also covered local politics

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:24.390
and after a decade you
joined the Washington Post.

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:25.223
- Right.

00:14:25.223 --> 00:14:30.100
- And your first book was
Why Americans Hate Politics,

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:33.910
and in some ways, it really addresses

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:35.870
some of the things that
we've touched upon,

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:40.152
namely, that ideas have consequences,

00:14:40.152 --> 00:14:43.069
but that, in American politics,

00:14:43.069 --> 00:14:46.702
things had gone wrong because people,

00:14:46.702 --> 00:14:50.170
two different groups, the
liberals and conservatives,

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:54.650
were really frozen in their
notions about the other sides.

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:56.440
Talk a little about that.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.520
- That was a fun book to do

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.913
because it allowed me to kinda go back

00:15:00.913 --> 00:15:02.813
and look at some history
that I had cared about.

00:15:02.813 --> 00:15:05.700
And so I was trying to think about,

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:08.100
you know, this was written in the middle

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:11.040
of the first Bush
Administration, and you know,

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.650
a sense of what had gone wrong on the left

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:16.040
and what had gone wrong
on the right to produce

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.802
the kind of impasse it seemed
we were in at that time.

00:15:19.802 --> 00:15:22.800
But the core argument of the book is that

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:26.010
politics in America was cast
as a series of false choices,

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:29.261
and that, you know, we argued, say,

00:15:29.261 --> 00:15:31.770
about whether feminism was a good thing

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:33.320
or family was a good thing.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.218
In fact, most Americans think

00:15:35.218 --> 00:15:37.580
equality between men and
women is a good thing

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.420
and that the family is a good thing

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:40.620
and that that wasn't a very constructive

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:42.100
or helpful way to talk about the problem.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.420
And you could go through
a whole series of issues.

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:46.780
You know, government is
good or government is bad.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.950
Well, in fact, government can be both.

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:50.870
And so there was a, you know,

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:53.730
there was a kind of argument
that was not productive..

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:56.960
I think Clinton took
advantage of that argument.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.120
He ended up quoting the book quite a lot,

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.900
which was actually both wonderful

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:02.180
and embarrassing to a reporter

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:03.680
who was covering the campaign.

00:16:04.855 --> 00:16:06.420
You know, I suppose in
the end I was happier

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:07.840
that he quoted it than ignored it,

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.350
but it was a fun, it was a
very interesting period for me

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:13.790
because I wasn't yet, excuse me,

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:15.971
I wasn't yet a columnist,
so I was actually

00:16:15.971 --> 00:16:19.100
trying to cover this fair and square.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:20.290
And I think I did that.

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:23.808
You know, people can look
at the stuff and judge.

00:16:23.808 --> 00:16:26.150
But anyway, it was a fascinating period

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:28.560
and I think he and a
number of other politicians

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.980
sorta grabbed the idea that you had to

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.380
get out of this argument
into something else,

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.825
and that that's what the
country was looking for.

00:16:35.825 --> 00:16:38.599
Oddly, Ross Perot had some
of that sense too, in 1992.

00:16:38.599 --> 00:16:42.138
There were a lot of, apparently, I'm told,

00:16:42.138 --> 00:16:45.561
a lot of Perot supporters bought
my book also at that time.

00:16:45.561 --> 00:16:47.490
- In looking at some of your writings,

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:50.780
I saw two among other insights,

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.600
but I just wanted to focus on two.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:56.470
In describing this gridlock,

00:16:56.470 --> 00:17:01.380
on the one hand, ideas
were, you emphasize again

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:04.270
that ideas are important,
but they have consequences.

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:05.280
And you look at the ideas

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.110
of the conservatives and the liberals.

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:10.360
But in some ways the ideas become sticky.

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:14.450
People don't wanna move
beyond where they are

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:16.650
and empathize, as you said earlier,

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:20.150
Lash talked about getting in
the mind of the other side.

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:23.956
So in a way they needed a
little of your old hometown

00:17:23.956 --> 00:17:26.290
in the national debate, in the sense

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:28.560
of actually listening to the other side

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.020
to see what could be learned

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.360
from the other side so that you could

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.867
get a common position
that elevated things.

00:17:34.867 --> 00:17:37.167
- I think you put that
better than I could've.

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:41.510
At the end of the 2000 election,

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:45.800
I went to a little town
called Gallipolis, Ohio,

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.230
which is in the Ohio River Valley

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:49.560
right over the border from West Virginia.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.630
And I spent the day there wandering around

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:53.980
and there was a, one of my
favorite stories out of that

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:56.900
was, I visited the two party headquarters,

00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:00.270
which were on, they were both
facing this lovely square

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:02.900
and looking out into the Ohio River.

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:06.010
And I discovered that,
from the guy running

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:08.680
the Democratic headquarters,
that somebody in town

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.234
had tried and tried and
tried to get through

00:18:11.234 --> 00:18:12.540
to the Republican headquarters and failed,

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.030
so they called the Democratic headquarters

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:15.935
and said, could you get this message

00:18:15.935 --> 00:18:17.353
up the street to the
Republican headquarters?

00:18:19.257 --> 00:18:21.170
And they did, and they, you know,

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:24.350
and so the connection was made.

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:27.390
It wasn't the case that,
because that happened,

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:29.230
the guy at the Republican headquarters

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:31.150
agreed with the guy at the
Democratic headquarters.

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:33.514
They disagreed fundamentally
on a lot of things.

00:18:33.514 --> 00:18:36.800
It just meant that they were neighbors.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.168
In the kind of politics that's

00:18:40.168 --> 00:18:42.964
practiced through the mass media,

00:18:42.964 --> 00:18:46.408
people aren't neighbors,
people don't know each other.

00:18:46.408 --> 00:18:49.530
It's very easy to say truly nasty things

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:51.710
about somebody you have never met.

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:53.130
I mean, once in a while it's easy

00:18:54.006 --> 00:18:54.893
to say nasty things about
someone you've actually met,

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:57.043
but it's much harder, and I think,

00:18:57.884 --> 00:18:59.581
you know, you're seeing that in many

00:18:59.581 --> 00:19:01.426
different levels of politics.

00:19:01.426 --> 00:19:03.780
In Congress these days,
people are spending

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.744
less time in Washington,
more time in their districts.

00:19:06.744 --> 00:19:08.730
People don't know each other's families.

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:10.710
And again, it's easier, if your little kid

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:13.750
plays soccer or baseball with
somebody else's little kid,

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:16.252
your personal attitude toward
the person is different.

00:19:16.252 --> 00:19:18.240
Now that doesn't mean you don't disagree.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.040
It doesn't mean you don't fight like crazy

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.730
for something you care about.

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:24.160
But it does change the
nature of the relationship

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.710
with the person and the
nature of the argument.

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:30.086
And in terms of these, well go ahead.

00:19:30.086 --> 00:19:31.470
- No go head, did you want

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:33.770
- No, what I was gonna say,
I was trying to sort of

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:36.500
get to the question
about, I like that notion

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:40.060
of the stickiness of ideas, and, you know,

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:45.060
when is flexibility a violation
of your own principles

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:48.920
and when is flexibility important?

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:52.127
And I think that, you know,
there were certain ideas

00:19:52.127 --> 00:19:57.093
at the time, you know,
people who were right

00:19:57.093 --> 00:20:00.200
about civil rights couldn't come to terms

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.338
with why downscale whites might have

00:20:03.338 --> 00:20:07.490
certain grievances that were
more than just resentments.

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:11.121
People who were feminists
couldn't understand

00:20:11.121 --> 00:20:14.440
that the strength of the other side's

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.682
commitment to family and vice versa,

00:20:16.682 --> 00:20:19.271
that people would use it on the right,

00:20:19.271 --> 00:20:22.060
you know, feminists were demonized as if

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:24.560
they were proposing that all children

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.130
be herded into sort of collective care

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:28.480
for 15 years of their lives.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.833
I mean people, it was a
parody of the actual position,

00:20:31.833 --> 00:20:33.210
and that happens a lot in politics.

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:36.030
- Another example which
actually broadens this a little,

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:38.780
you used in something I read

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:43.780
the example of the Bush campaign,
the first president Bush,

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.299
in his campaign against Michael Dukakis

00:20:46.299 --> 00:20:49.840
on the issue of the pledge of
allegiance in the classroom,

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:53.528
and the extent to which their,

00:20:53.528 --> 00:20:57.020
at one level it was kind of malicious,

00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:00.351
this whole discussion,
but on another level,

00:21:00.351 --> 00:21:05.351
the slogans and the short
version of the story really,

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:12.040
underneath it, lay a real
conflict about values.

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:16.069
And that we were avoiding
getting into the discussion

00:21:16.069 --> 00:21:21.069
about one group's concern
about their values

00:21:22.039 --> 00:21:24.020
and the erosion of those values.

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:26.064
Talk a little about that.

00:21:26.064 --> 00:21:27.400
- Well I thought the '88 campaign

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.930
should have taught those
of us in journalism

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:32.930
a lot of lessons, because,

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:35.630
the pledge, I thought,
was an interesting example

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:39.497
because, at one level,
it was a phony issue,

00:21:39.497 --> 00:21:44.086
Dukakis' interpretation
of what free speech meant

00:21:44.086 --> 00:21:46.397
for Jehovah's Witnesses, you know,

00:21:46.397 --> 00:21:49.580
Jehovah's Witnesses had
originally brought this case

00:21:50.425 --> 00:21:52.978
- And he signed legislation,
essentially, that banned

00:21:52.978 --> 00:21:55.220
- He vetoed a bill that required

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:57.810
the pledge of allegiance on the grounds

00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:00.590
that you couldn't force people
like Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:02.320
who conscientiously objected to that,

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.800
to recite it in school.

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.690
And of course, the shorthand was

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:07.990
Dukakis vetoed the pledge of allegiance.

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:11.880
And actually, oddly, it
was a story I ended up,

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.300
in quotes, breaking, because Newt Gingrich

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.200
called me one day and said, hey,

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.611
I've got this veto message
you should look at.

00:22:18.611 --> 00:22:20.112
And what was fascinating was

00:22:20.112 --> 00:22:21.933
the Dukakis did not take it seriously,

00:22:21.933 --> 00:22:25.150
thought it was kind of a joke issue.

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:27.050
What I thought the press
should have done with that

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:29.100
is said, okay, there is a side to this

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:32.850
that is a kind of, this is
sort of exploitation politics,

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:33.830
but what was Bush getting at?

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:35.450
What Bush was getting at is that

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:38.370
a lot of parents worried
about the messages

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:40.630
that their kids were getting in schools,

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:42.720
and they wanted their kids not only

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.030
to learn to read, write, and count,

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:47.320
but also wanted them to
get a sense of values.

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.659
And you know, one of
the values is a kind of,

00:22:49.659 --> 00:22:51.880
you know, intelligent patriotism.

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.720
I mean the irony is that
the pledge of allegiance

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:55.789
was written by a socialist.

00:22:55.789 --> 00:22:57.930
It's actually more a
communitarian document

00:22:57.930 --> 00:22:59.683
than it is a right-wing document.

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:04.640
And that if, as reporters, I
think it would have been better

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.700
if we had tried to cover that second level

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:10.220
and say, okay, what is Bush
really getting at here?

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:13.619
Why does this issue have
traction with people?

00:23:13.619 --> 00:23:17.030
And then we might've told an interesting

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:19.940
story about the country
as well as the campaign.

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.260
- And this is an argument,
by the way, that you made,

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:26.450
which is that, in a way,
reporters covering campaigns

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:29.670
should be investigative
reporters of ideas.

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:32.150
Namely, what are the
ideas of the candidates

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:34.300
and what are the long-term,

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:36.010
where do those ideas
come from and what are

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:39.243
the implications of the
ideas in actual politics?

00:23:40.089 --> 00:23:41.993
- Right, and it's nice
of you to mention that.

00:23:41.993 --> 00:23:44.199
I mean I use that term,
investigative reporting of ideas,

00:23:44.199 --> 00:23:46.290
because so much of the political culture

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:48.540
is dominated by scandal these days.

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:52.060
And this is not, this is
said with great respect

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:53.300
for investigative reporters.

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:55.360
We would be in a lot of
trouble if they didn't exist.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:56.630
So it's not to denigrate them

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:58.944
but rather to raise up that art and to say

00:23:58.944 --> 00:24:01.670
we should have investigative
reporting on that side,

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:04.080
but we also need to take more seriously

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.540
what candidates actually say.

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:08.310
I mean it's a great irony
that party platforms,

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:10.821
which are always dismissed, turn out to be

00:24:10.821 --> 00:24:14.640
very good guides to what
candidates actually do in office.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.750
It is very often the
case that the candidate

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:21.350
does what he or she
says he or she will do,

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:23.360
and when they don't do it it's often

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.761
because of circumstance and not because

00:24:25.761 --> 00:24:27.110
of some betrayal of principle.

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:29.360
And therefore, if we paid more attention

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:30.890
to what candidates actually said,

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:33.690
we would give readers more of a sense

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:35.110
of what might actually happen.

00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:37.036
And then also to look underneath

00:24:37.036 --> 00:24:39.800
to what their real commitments are.

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:41.740
I mean, for example, I always thought,

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:44.570
in the 2000 election, that George Bush

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:48.150
was much more candidly
conservative than he was portrayed.

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:49.772
Yes, he was very good at using

00:24:49.772 --> 00:24:51.940
soothing, moderate language,

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:53.720
but he didn't lie about where he stood.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.230
He didn't lie about the big tax cut

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:57.350
or the privatization of social security.

00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:59.629
And I thought that portraying him

00:24:59.629 --> 00:25:02.890
as moderate missed the boat,

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:06.905
and in an odd way, not only was a problem

00:25:06.905 --> 00:25:09.270
in terms of how people
perceived the choice,

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:11.830
but also, in a sense,
was disrespectful to him.

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:13.860
I think he was actually a conservative

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.910
and made it very clear.

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:19.517
And so, we spend so much time on character

00:25:19.517 --> 00:25:22.190
that we forget that what these guys

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:23.620
and women actually believe

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:25.200
has real effect on us later on

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.354
when they try to put it into practice.

00:25:27.354 --> 00:25:31.410
- And what is the reason
for all the static?

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:33.760
I mean we're obviously not a small town,

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.840
that is, the national election,

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:40.840
not like Fall River where you came from.

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:44.210
I mean, what institutionally
do you think is at work

00:25:47.175 --> 00:25:50.629
that obfuscates rather than clarifies

00:25:50.629 --> 00:25:53.453
what's going on in a campaign.

00:25:53.453 --> 00:25:56.090
- Well partly, there's a wonderful book

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:58.740
by a guy called, two academics,

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.814
Marty Shefter and Ben Ginsberg,

00:26:00.814 --> 00:26:04.250
called Politics by Other Means.

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:06.880
And they argue that what we used to

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.650
settle through elections we now settle

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:11.640
through non-democratic mechanisms.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.759
Namely, we go to the courts,

00:26:13.759 --> 00:26:16.784
we have newspaper disclosures,

00:26:16.784 --> 00:26:19.480
or we have congressional investigations.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.320
Now we've always had those things,

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:22.750
but what they argue is

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:24.210
the terrain of battle has shifted

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:26.470
from trying to win an
argument with the public,

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:30.160
which is a democratic
way to carry out things,

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.610
and instead we have this
other kind of politics.

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:35.520
That kind of politics is then reinforced,

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.020
I think, by the rise of a certain style

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:41.040
of cable television
which thrives on having

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.530
one big story, and the big story is often

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:46.265
more effective when it's a scandal story.

00:26:46.265 --> 00:26:49.140
And so, we carry out our,

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:51.460
instead of carrying out arguments,

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:54.930
we basically try to discredit,

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:57.180
completely discredit the
person we're arguing with.

00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:00.640
I use the term the politics
of moral annihilation.

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.067
That's kind of what we do
in politics these days.

00:27:03.067 --> 00:27:05.806
And that oddly is one of the reasons

00:27:05.806 --> 00:27:06.790
why I think Clinton survived impeachment,

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:09.950
is because I think that the
public was furious at Clinton,

00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:12.284
they thought what he had done

00:27:12.284 --> 00:27:14.090
was at best dumb and at worst wrong.

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:16.020
But they did not like the process

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:17.920
through which he was being brought down,

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:20.084
and they didn't like the focus,

00:27:20.084 --> 00:27:21.780
you know, the more there was focus on it,

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:23.440
the more there was sympathy for Clinton,

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:24.850
not because people liked what he did

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:27.643
but because they didn't like this process.

00:27:27.643 --> 00:27:31.290
- Is the fact that news
and political discussion

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:34.380
is becoming entertainment an issue here

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:36.470
in the sense that it's really not

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:39.812
about elucidating and
educating, but creating a show?

00:27:39.812 --> 00:27:43.070
- Entertainment should
never be undervalued.

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:44.700
And I mean, you know, when we look back

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.230
to periods in our history where there were

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:48.723
high levels of political participation,

00:27:48.723 --> 00:27:50.633
before the turn of the century,

00:27:50.633 --> 00:27:53.490
campaigns were mostly entertainment.

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:54.323
We shouldn't romanticize.

00:27:54.323 --> 00:27:57.070
I'm often guilty of romanticizing

00:27:57.070 --> 00:27:58.197
my home town and small towns,

00:27:58.197 --> 00:28:01.590
and there are always problems
in that kind of politics too.

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:05.180
But a lot of it was parades and, you know,

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:07.240
fascinating invective that was amusing,

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:10.160
so I don't denigrate the entertainment,

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:13.178
I wish politics were more
entertaining to people.

00:28:13.178 --> 00:28:15.910
I don't think it's so much entertainment

00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:20.860
as it is, you know, there's a formula

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:24.020
that people have found is
successful for getting viewers.

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:26.530
You know, these are rather
small audiences on cable shows,

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:30.340
but you don't need a huge
audience to be successful.

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:31.780
So what you're doing is engaging

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:36.020
a certain style of political
junkie on those channels,

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:38.200
and then that begins to
reflect back to the rest

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.560
of the coverage on other channels,

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.491
and even occasionally into newspapers.

00:28:42.491 --> 00:28:45.050
So it's not so much
entertainment that bothers me,

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:50.050
it's a kind of sometimes
almost staged conflict.

00:28:50.079 --> 00:28:55.079
And it's the staged
part that's the problem.

00:28:57.190 --> 00:29:01.710
- In reading your books and
many of your op ed pieces,

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:06.430
not all of them, but you
know, looking here and there,

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:11.430
I'm struck by two things
that emerge in your writing.

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:15.800
One is a real kind of philosophical basis

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:19.932
for your understanding
of what is at stake.

00:29:19.932 --> 00:29:24.932
For example, you just
discussed the 2000 election,

00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:28.100
and I think you were
saying that Bush actually

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:32.380
was pretty clear about where
he stood on the big issues.

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:33.730
He's for the individual,

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:36.320
he's for really limiting government,

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.927
although not doing away with it.

00:29:38.927 --> 00:29:41.720
And the same is probably true of Al Gore.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:45.830
So on the one hand, one
sees in your writing

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:48.691
this kind of zeroing in on the problem

00:29:48.691 --> 00:29:53.010
because of your philosophical
roots, so to say.

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:55.530
But then, on the other
hand, there is a theme,

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:57.568
and you actually said somewhere,

00:29:57.568 --> 00:29:58.807
"I think politics is really the essence

00:29:58.807 --> 00:30:01.517
"of the democratic
process, but what politics

00:30:01.517 --> 00:30:04.910
"ought to be about is solving problems."

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:07.564
And in some way during this period

00:30:07.564 --> 00:30:10.390
where we weren't getting at the issues,

00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:13.453
we weren't addressing either
one of those, were we?

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.600
- I mean, I think you're right that

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.070
there's a tension in this view,

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:21.407
maybe even a contradiction in my view.

00:30:21.407 --> 00:30:24.050
But it seems to me that,

00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:25.820
it's Arthur Schlesinger Junior who said

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:28.710
that politics ought to
be the search for remedy.

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:31.564
And I think when most
people come to politics,

00:30:31.564 --> 00:30:34.330
they have orientations.

00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:36.223
And actually, I think there is, you know,

00:30:37.554 --> 00:30:39.030
every individual is more
philosophically-oriented

00:30:40.425 --> 00:30:41.679
than he or she might even think.

00:30:41.679 --> 00:30:43.930
Most people have quite
coherent worldviews.

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:45.330
And you see that in polling,

00:30:46.196 --> 00:30:48.160
where people actually do
have coherent worldviews,

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.420
tend to vote for the candidate

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:51.740
who is closest to that worldview.

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:54.028
I mean the more I've looked at polling

00:30:54.028 --> 00:30:55.320
the more I've been impressed
that people get the idea.

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.506
They know what they're doing.

00:30:57.506 --> 00:31:00.810
But when people look to government,

00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:03.000
they tend to have a very
practical view of government.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.410
There's no political science concept

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:07.130
that Americans are operationally liberal

00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:08.440
and philosophically conservative.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.600
They're skeptical of government, and yet,

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:14.138
when something goes wrong,
they want it to do something.

00:31:14.138 --> 00:31:17.210
Bill Cohen, former senator
and secretary of defense,

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:20.106
once said "Government is the
enemy until you need a friend."

00:31:20.106 --> 00:31:23.910
And he was, it was funny,
I quoted him in column once

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:25.550
saying that, and he came up to me

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:27.490
about six or eight months later

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:29.220
and he said, you know,
shouldn't have said that to you,

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:31.710
the Democrats in my state are
using that as their slogan

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:34.380
and their attributing
it to me, which is true.

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:36.210
But I think that's the way people are.

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:38.580
They want government to step in

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:41.940
when there are sort of
large things going wrong

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:43.720
that they believe with reason

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:47.280
cannot be dealt with
simply by individuals,

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:50.198
especially by non-privileged individuals.

00:31:50.198 --> 00:31:54.870
And I think the kind of
relentless attack on government,

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:58.430
largely from the right, sort
of discredited that idea.

00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:01.360
And yet I still think
that's where Americans were.

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:03.440
And I think you saw that
in the Clinton years

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:06.980
where there was a softening of
the anti-government rhetoric.

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:08.730
And Bush is very interesting in that way

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:13.730
because his rhetoric is quite
sympathetic to government.

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:18.000
And yet his program is actually,
you know, Reaganism redux.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.723
Because the pressure from these tax cuts

00:32:19.723 --> 00:32:22.710
is designed to reduce
the size of government,

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:25.284
as a lot of, you know, some
honest conservatives have said.

00:32:25.284 --> 00:32:27.850
But the fact that he had
to change the rhetoric

00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:30.550
suggests that we moved away some

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:34.128
from the idea of always
demonizing government.

00:32:34.128 --> 00:32:39.128
- In both your books, in which, in a way,

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:43.100
you're looking for a progressive solution

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:47.820
to this stalemate, and
after listening to you now,

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:49.780
I would almost call it a progressive

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:52.508
conservative position that you have.

00:32:52.508 --> 00:32:54.493
- How so? That's an interesting concept.

00:32:54.493 --> 00:32:55.960
- Well I think, in other words,

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.310
your emphasis on community, basically.

00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:02.003
In other words, that your
notions of social justice

00:33:07.133 --> 00:33:11.440
strike me as having a community dimension,

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:15.381
and this strikes me as
going back to your roots.

00:33:15.381 --> 00:33:18.000
And I think it enriches what you're saying

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.800
'cause it moved you beyond

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:23.147
the purely simple social justice position.

00:33:23.147 --> 00:33:27.349
So that's my take on you, is that fair?

00:33:27.349 --> 00:33:30.236
- That's very interesting.

00:33:30.236 --> 00:33:32.540
I mean, I'm a liberal Catholic

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:34.070
is another way to put this.

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:35.410
Being Catholic was important,

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:38.830
the church was important to us, and a,

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:41.350
you know, I think if you sort of take

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:43.050
what the church says seriously,

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:45.320
what the social teaching says,

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:49.610
you end up being progressive
on social welfare matters,

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:52.010
that is to say, you know, the priority is

00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:54.333
on the poor and on the least among us,

00:33:54.333 --> 00:33:56.570
and you value community.

00:33:56.570 --> 00:34:00.985
And that is, you know, that
is not trivial or abstract.

00:34:00.985 --> 00:34:04.370
And so, you know, I'm sure that that

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:06.080
kind of shapes what you have called

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.464
a progressive conservatism.

00:34:08.464 --> 00:34:12.583
For me, my politics are a combination of

00:34:12.583 --> 00:34:15.000
sorta that Catholic tradition,

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.012
a sorta Michael Walzer
social democratic tradition,

00:34:19.012 --> 00:34:22.460
and then a kinda practical
moderate tradition.

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:25.860
I have affection for a
group that no longer exists,

00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:27.370
practically, liberal Republicans,

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:30.020
which is that, okay, we have these,

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:32.550
you know, commitments, these
philosophical commitments,

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:34.390
and then the question becomes

00:34:34.390 --> 00:34:35.223
what do you do about it?

00:34:35.223 --> 00:34:36.690
How do you get something done?

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:39.050
And so, you know, sometimes I say

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:41.759
my heart's on the left and
my head's more in the center.

00:34:41.759 --> 00:34:46.240
But it's, you know, but my
heart is still on that side.

00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:48.570
And for me, the struggle in politics

00:34:48.570 --> 00:34:50.050
is trying to figure out how to

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:52.878
sorta give practical life
to a set of aspirations

00:34:52.878 --> 00:34:55.890
without becoming foolishly utopian.

00:34:55.890 --> 00:34:58.369
I mean, another of my
heroes is Reinhold Niebuhr,

00:34:58.369 --> 00:35:00.610
you know, sorta Christian
realist, great theologian,

00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:03.210
and I think that was what his struggle was

00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:06.370
is how can you maintain ideals

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:08.600
and yet be practical about the nature

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:11.434
of human beings and the nature
of the political enterprise.

00:35:11.434 --> 00:35:15.440
- And I guess another
ingredient in a lot of your work

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:20.357
is a focus, amidst all of
this morass of politics

00:35:20.357 --> 00:35:23.010
and the failure of the ideologies

00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:25.660
to move beyond their first position

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:28.700
is a sense of how the lower middle class

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:30.370
and the middle class was hurting,

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:32.830
and that these were, in a way,

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:35.328
the key voters in the politics

00:35:35.328 --> 00:35:37.300
of the '80s and the '90s,

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.470
and addressing their problems,

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:41.360
especially what they were feeling

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:44.220
because of the impact
of the global economy

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:47.430
and what they saw as the
erosion of moral values.

00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:50.160
But on the other hand, they
were hurting economically.

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:52.645
Talk a little about that.

00:35:52.645 --> 00:35:55.889
- You know, I think it's a simple fact

00:35:55.889 --> 00:35:59.520
that they were the key
to most of the political

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:01.570
transformations that
happened in that period.

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:03.140
They were the Reagan Democrats,

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:07.092
they were the people who
came back to Clinton in '92.

00:36:07.092 --> 00:36:09.712
Some of them went to Perot in that period.

00:36:09.712 --> 00:36:12.820
And, you know, so that just as,

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:15.380
if you were interested in where
American politics was going,

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:17.490
that was one of the, they were one of

00:36:18.351 --> 00:36:20.230
the most important groups
to pay attention to.

00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:21.063
So there was on that level,

00:36:21.063 --> 00:36:24.430
and then there is on the
level of social justice

00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:26.140
and what makes a democracy work.

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:29.090
And we did a pretty
good job, as a country,

00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:30.600
from the period after World War II

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:34.450
'til about the mid-'70s,
in creating an economy

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:37.170
that lifted everyone up simultaneously.

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:40.350
When Kennedy said "a rising
tide lifts all boats"

00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:42.930
it was actually true,
and you go back and look

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:45.450
and the poor gained as much in income

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:49.144
as the wealthy and the
middle class in that period.

00:36:49.144 --> 00:36:50.409
And then, for reasons,

00:36:50.409 --> 00:36:51.500
some of them having nothing
to do with politics,

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:54.350
that went haywire after the oil shock.

00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:58.153
And so you began to
develop this widening gap.

00:36:58.153 --> 00:37:00.197
And, you know, it goes back to,

00:37:00.197 --> 00:37:02.360
you know, our founders talked about

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:04.960
needing a kind of mass,
property-owning base,

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:07.820
middle class base to have
an effective democracy,

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:10.110
and I think that is still true.

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:13.513
And if you allow large
inequalities to grow,

00:37:13.513 --> 00:37:17.240
you have both injustice
and dangers to democracy.

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:20.370
And so, you know, that's, you know,

00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:21.570
that's where a lot of that came from.

00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:23.788
And then, you know, the simple fact is,

00:37:23.788 --> 00:37:26.890
you know, a lot of those
folks were folks I knew

00:37:26.890 --> 00:37:30.400
and had a, you know, I
sometimes write my column,

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:32.290
my column is in my hometown paper,

00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:35.210
and I sort of always have
in the back of my head,

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:37.900
what would somebody back in
my hometown think of this?

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:41.660
How would this affect
the folks I grew up with?

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:46.404
And, you know, Fall River
was a working class town

00:37:46.404 --> 00:37:48.216
with an upper middle class,

00:37:48.216 --> 00:37:53.216
where there was a sense
of linkage between people.

00:37:53.788 --> 00:37:56.795
There weren't gated communities.

00:37:56.795 --> 00:37:58.380
I mean my dad was a dentist,

00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:00.300
so I was hardly a working class kid,

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:02.000
but a lot of my friends
were working class kids

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.810
and we didn't, you know,
it took me a long time

00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:06.370
to realize how, you know,
that these divisions

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:09.726
actually met something outside
the context of my hometown.

00:38:09.726 --> 00:38:11.366
I mean you knew, you were aware,

00:38:11.366 --> 00:38:13.110
somebody had more money and
somebody had less money,

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:15.470
but there was more of a
linkage than you see now,

00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:17.220
I think, in a lot of places.

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:19.969
I don't know how you recreate that.

00:38:19.969 --> 00:38:23.280
That's easier in a small town than it is

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.550
in a large metropolitan area.

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:28.235
- In retrospect, I guess you believe

00:38:28.235 --> 00:38:31.741
that President Clinton,
though personally flawed,

00:38:31.741 --> 00:38:35.490
really transformed our politics,

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:40.260
or at least changed the terms of debate

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:42.150
so we could get onto the problems.

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:44.443
Is that fair and would
you like comment on that?

00:38:44.443 --> 00:38:46.707
- I guess that's basically what I think.

00:38:46.707 --> 00:38:48.010
I mean, I've guess I've
come to the conclusion

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:49.520
that everything you say about Clinton

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:52.470
is true and so is its opposite.

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:55.310
That you can look at, you know,

00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:57.740
did he reform welfare in ways that

00:38:57.740 --> 00:38:59.330
might end up endangering the poor?

00:38:59.330 --> 00:39:00.163
Yes.

00:39:01.229 --> 00:39:02.640
Did he spend more money
on the working poor,

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:04.409
billions and billions of dollars,

00:39:04.409 --> 00:39:07.300
which really did help
lift up a lot of people?

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:08.475
That's true too.

00:39:08.475 --> 00:39:11.640
Did he, you know, usher in this period

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:14.780
of great sort of capitalist excitement

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:17.160
where everybody seems
obsessed with the market?

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:17.993
Yes.

00:39:17.993 --> 00:39:19.307
Did he also reinvigorate government

00:39:19.307 --> 00:39:20.890
and get people to accept that,

00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:22.880
no, the market all my
itself is not enough?

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.130
Yeah, he did that too.

00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:26.687
And so, you know, the
conclusion you can draw

00:39:26.687 --> 00:39:27.520
is did he move politics to the left? Yes.

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:29.745
Did he move politics to the right? Yes.

00:39:29.745 --> 00:39:34.745
For me, Clinton is just such
a great lost opportunity.

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:37.110
I mean I think he did have

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:39.590
the capacity to transform politics.

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:43.710
I think he understood where Americans were

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:45.960
and had, in my view, a reasonable sense

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.910
about where we should go.

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:50.230
I didn't agree with everything he did,

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:51.480
but I thought, on balance,

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:53.470
he was trying to move us to a place

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:56.370
where we sort of rejoin this kind of,

00:39:56.370 --> 00:39:58.400
if you will, Harry Truman,
Roosevelt tradition

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:01.440
of sort of intelligent use of government

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.810
on behalf of problem
solving and social justice.

00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:06.720
And he got us part of the way there.

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:11.473
But the scandal really, the
scandals got in the way of,

00:40:11.473 --> 00:40:13.830
wasted of a lot of his time, first of all.

00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:15.890
He had to use a lot of his intelligence

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:17.090
and energy to get out of trouble

00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:19.090
as opposed to getting somewhere.

00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:21.060
And they ended up dividing us in ways,

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:23.200
I mean it's another irony of Clinton

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:26.623
that he came in with the idea
of creating a new consensus,

00:40:26.623 --> 00:40:29.190
and thanks in part to the scandals,

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:32.020
the country again was very deeply divided.

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:34.720
And you look at the results
of the 2000 election

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:35.960
and we are kinda perfectly

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:39.286
symmetrical halves now, as a country.

00:40:39.286 --> 00:40:43.001
- But as a progressive, that part of you,

00:40:43.001 --> 00:40:48.001
you fault Clinton for, let's
look at welfare reform.

00:40:50.109 --> 00:40:55.109
In the end, he ended
welfare as we knew it,

00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:57.280
which you see as an achievement,

00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:00.690
but he really didn't deliver

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:05.330
the progressive component of that reform.

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:07.600
- Right, if you compare what he proposed

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:09.880
at the beginning with
what he signed at the end,

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:11.563
they were quite different.

00:41:11.563 --> 00:41:13.820
I mean the idea that Clinton
had at the beginning,

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:16.070
which I agreed with, was,

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:18.880
that the government policy should be

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:20.730
more pro-work than it had been.

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:22.620
There should be incentives for people

00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:24.702
to move off welfare, to work.

00:41:24.702 --> 00:41:28.475
It made sense to have
some kind of time limits

00:41:28.475 --> 00:41:32.070
to see if you could move
people into the workforce.

00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:33.544
But that had to be matched with

00:41:33.544 --> 00:41:37.300
real social supports, because, you know,

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:39.090
some of the people on welfare,

00:41:39.090 --> 00:41:40.500
some of the folks on welfare

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:43.877
could be moved relatively easily into work

00:41:43.877 --> 00:41:47.727
and would seize the
opportunity if they had it,

00:41:47.727 --> 00:41:48.990
but there are other folks on welfare

00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:52.220
who have very serious personal problems,

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:53.420
and we shouldn't sort of,

00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:55.530
I think, in a way, during
the welfare debate,

00:41:55.530 --> 00:41:57.779
neither the left nor the
right wanted to acknowledge

00:41:57.779 --> 00:42:01.390
that some share of that population was,

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:03.290
there were drug problems,
there were alcohol problems,

00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:06.490
family breakup problems, and
that we shouldn't pretend

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:07.870
that those folks didn't need a lot of help

00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:09.600
if they're gonna get from here to there.

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:11.060
And what I objected to in the end,

00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:13.810
to the welfare bill, was
that, if you were gonna

00:42:13.810 --> 00:42:17.226
trade off radical change
in the welfare system,

00:42:17.226 --> 00:42:19.800
part of the trade off should have been

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:21.532
that you would put more support in

00:42:21.532 --> 00:42:23.810
to help people move from here to there.

00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:26.070
Now we were lucky so far, as a country.

00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:28.280
Low unemployment does wonderful things.

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:30.900
And people at the bottom have more

00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:34.070
bargaining power when labor is scarce.

00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:36.520
And so, the welfare
bill have worked better

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:39.770
than I thought it would
in this good climate.

00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:41.520
And I think the long-term test,

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:43.690
I think now you're gonna
see some real problems.

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:46.460
The notion that there's a lifetime limit

00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:49.760
on people on welfare, what if
there is a terrible recession?

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:52.070
What happens to the person
who hit the five year limit

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:55.130
and has no money with
which to feed their kids?

00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:56.732
What are we gonna do about that?

00:42:56.732 --> 00:42:58.310
Are we gonna say sorry,
you've hit your limit.

00:42:58.310 --> 00:42:59.300
That was parts of the welfare bill

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:01.900
I thought were both wrong and impractical.

00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:05.495
- Let's talk about your work as a writer.

00:43:05.495 --> 00:43:09.703
In one sense, as a columnist
for the Washington Post

00:43:09.703 --> 00:43:13.890
who writes with, I must say, a lucidity,

00:43:13.890 --> 00:43:17.440
but a simple statement of the problem

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:19.460
linked to real people's lives,

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:21.820
I get the sense that a column for you

00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:26.140
is a form of participation
in a national conversation

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:29.405
not unlike the conversation
you had in your hometown.

00:43:29.405 --> 00:43:32.609
- I sometimes jokes that, you know,

00:43:32.609 --> 00:43:35.150
for better or worse I was kinda trained

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:37.681
from a young age for this kind of work.

00:43:37.681 --> 00:43:40.900
And it's true, I think a column,

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:45.190
you know, I think different
columns do different things.

00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:47.342
I mean I do think, over time,

00:43:47.342 --> 00:43:50.082
you develop a sense of
who your readers are,

00:43:50.082 --> 00:43:52.450
what they're looking for,

00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:55.300
and I think it's an interesting problem

00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:57.690
for columnists because, you know,

00:43:57.690 --> 00:43:59.450
you discover over time,

00:43:59.450 --> 00:44:01.400
because nice people write you letters,

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:04.220
that you're speaking through
some group of people,

00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:06.760
that some set of people
come to identify with you.

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:08.670
Mary McGrory, again, to cite her,

00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:10.200
said sometimes she thought she was

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:12.513
writing columns in certain periods

00:44:12.513 --> 00:44:14.196
to make certain people feel better.

00:44:14.196 --> 00:44:15.472
You know, because they felt better

00:44:15.472 --> 00:44:17.930
knowing somebody had some
view similar to theirs.

00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:20.329
And that's good, but it's, again,

00:44:20.329 --> 00:44:22.840
that's not sufficient because sometimes

00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:23.860
you wanna challenge people,

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:25.270
you don't wanna be entirely predictable,

00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:27.560
you don't wanna become a prisoner

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:30.110
of the very kind of predictable ideology

00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:32.370
that I criticized in my earlier books.

00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:33.790
So sometimes you wanna challenge

00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:37.059
even the people who agree with you.

00:44:37.059 --> 00:44:39.100
So that's one tension.

00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:40.580
I think another tension is

00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:45.580
how can you be tough and
unequivocal and also reasonable?

00:44:45.787 --> 00:44:48.665
And that, you know, I don't like,

00:44:48.665 --> 00:44:52.523
you know, endless sorta
harsh personal attacks,

00:44:52.523 --> 00:44:56.828
and yet, I don't like, you know,

00:44:56.828 --> 00:44:58.390
a sorta tonally wishy washy columnist.

00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:01.068
When you're a columnist as
opposed to a newspaper reporter,

00:45:01.068 --> 00:45:05.596
you're there to present
a strong point of view.

00:45:05.596 --> 00:45:07.730
And I think for me it's been a struggle,

00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:08.840
as I've been doing this now

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:11.320
for I guess almost eight years,

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:15.380
there is the old journalist side of me

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:17.910
that was, you gotta be fair to both sides.

00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:19.470
This is a different enterprise.

00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:22.760
And so I've been trying to
learn, how can I sort of,

00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:24.910
and I'm sure I've executed
this very imperfectly,

00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:28.290
but how do you maintain the sense of

00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:29.470
the facts have to be right,

00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:31.310
people who disagree with you

00:45:31.310 --> 00:45:32.630
should come to it and at least say,

00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:34.170
well he's not distorting what I think

00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:36.022
even though he disagrees with it.

00:45:36.022 --> 00:45:36.855
How can you do all that kinda thing

00:45:36.855 --> 00:45:39.300
and yet still take strong opinions?

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:42.485
For me, the recount, the
Bush-Gore fight in Florida,

00:45:42.485 --> 00:45:46.190
I think it'll turn out
to be, for me personally,

00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:49.930
an important moment, because
I really did get angry.

00:45:49.930 --> 00:45:51.650
I was very unhappy with what happened.

00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:53.990
And I actually wrote
in a column once that,

00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:57.130
please permit me a personal statement,

00:45:57.130 --> 00:45:59.892
I'm surprised at how
angry I am about this.

00:45:59.892 --> 00:46:03.450
And, you know, in a way,
I think for me in Florida

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:06.210
is when I sort of fully accepted

00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:08.090
that I was, you know, a columnist,

00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:09.340
still trying to tell the truth,

00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:11.900
still trying to elucidate the argument,

00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:13.690
but that there was a time when you

00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:15.550
simply had to sorta say

00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:19.510
I believe this is true and
I'm gonna fight for it.

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:22.293
- We had Conor Cruise O'Brien here

00:46:22.293 --> 00:46:25.300
and we talked about this

00:46:27.296 --> 00:46:30.500
dichotomy between rationale and passion.

00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:33.137
And he said, "You have to
think about the issues,

00:46:33.137 --> 00:46:35.847
"but the feelings proceed the thought,

00:46:35.847 --> 00:46:38.890
"and then of course are
qualified by the thought."

00:46:38.890 --> 00:46:41.040
Does that kind of process go on

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:43.370
in your mind in that
way or a different way?

00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:46.470
- I don't know if I would wanna
pretend to that profundity.

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:51.373
That's a very nice formulation.

00:46:58.140 --> 00:46:59.530
In some ways I probably trust reason

00:46:59.530 --> 00:47:01.563
more than I trust passion.

00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:05.079
And that's probably just sort of

00:47:05.079 --> 00:47:07.470
deep inside me in some way.

00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:12.470
And I'm sometimes suspicious of passion.

00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:14.620
I guess the word I'd like better

00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:16.766
than passion might be commitment.

00:47:16.766 --> 00:47:18.709
Or it might even be loyalty.

00:47:18.709 --> 00:47:22.494
Where you are sort of,

00:47:22.494 --> 00:47:25.040
you're concerned about groups of people,

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:27.010
you're concerned about certain traditions,

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:28.670
you're concerned about certain values,

00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:31.341
and those inform your use of reason.

00:47:31.341 --> 00:47:34.130
And you don't, those commitments,

00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:36.400
you pray that those personal

00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:39.330
and intellectual and
philosophical commitments

00:47:39.330 --> 00:47:43.136
don't get in the way of
your capacity to reason.

00:47:43.136 --> 00:47:46.463
And that's probably
also kinda Catholic too.

00:47:47.863 --> 00:47:49.859
- Is writing hard for you?

00:47:49.859 --> 00:47:52.657
Or do your words flow easily?

00:47:52.657 --> 00:47:55.510
- I've always loved writing.

00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:57.700
I've never regarded myself and do not

00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:00.220
today regard myself as a great writer.

00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:01.990
I think I'm a clear writer.

00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:05.633
I mean the writing, the essays I'm writing

00:48:05.633 --> 00:48:07.703
that I like best are Orwell's essays,

00:48:08.574 --> 00:48:10.340
Politics and the English
Language, Why I Write.

00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:13.436
Why I Write's very interesting
because Orwell said that

00:48:13.436 --> 00:48:15.117
"I wrote best when I
really cared passionately

00:48:15.117 --> 00:48:17.717
"about a question, especially
a political question."

00:48:18.690 --> 00:48:23.090
I find that writing doesn't
come that difficult,

00:48:23.090 --> 00:48:24.940
but there are moments when I sit down

00:48:26.068 --> 00:48:29.310
and I'm a sort of inveterate reviser.

00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:31.810
I constantly look at a sentence I write,

00:48:31.810 --> 00:48:33.250
even after the column is in print,

00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:35.390
and I say why didn't I change that word?

00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:38.380
Why did I use that clunky phrase?

00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:39.883
But as I go along, I mean on,

00:48:41.101 --> 00:48:42.858
today, before we got together,

00:48:42.858 --> 00:48:44.490
I had to edit a column with my editor,

00:48:44.490 --> 00:48:47.427
and, you know, we do this over the phone,

00:48:47.427 --> 00:48:51.290
and right 'til the moment
we hang up the phone,

00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:54.790
I find myself saying,
changing a word here or there.

00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:57.950
So to sort of get the basic idea down,

00:48:57.950 --> 00:49:00.549
to get the sort of
sentences that I like down

00:49:00.549 --> 00:49:02.705
is not difficult.

00:49:02.705 --> 00:49:04.344
But then, for me,

00:49:04.344 --> 00:49:06.324
and different people
have different methods,

00:49:06.324 --> 00:49:07.800
some people I admire greatly

00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:09.580
produce very nearly perfect
sentences the first time around

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:11.753
and never have to touch
them, that's not me.

00:49:14.254 --> 00:49:16.480
And the process of revision is fun.

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:19.565
In fact, my son is in a class where

00:49:19.565 --> 00:49:22.730
there's a lot of emphasis on writing,

00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:25.545
and the teacher asked me to come in

00:49:25.545 --> 00:49:26.463
and talk about revision.

00:49:27.449 --> 00:49:28.647
And I think what I'm gonna do

00:49:28.647 --> 00:49:30.090
is take a passage of Harry Potter

00:49:30.090 --> 00:49:31.420
and talk about what that passage

00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:33.570
might have looked like
five drafts earlier.

00:49:34.495 --> 00:49:36.550
And how do you get from here to there.

00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:38.950
So that tends to be the
way I like to write.

00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:41.640
The other problem with a column is

00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:43.870
how good is your idea on any given day?

00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:46.440
And how deep is your well of ideas

00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:49.820
on days when nothing obvious hits you?

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:52.553
Do you have some thoughts that,

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:54.323
do you have some thoughts, ideas,

00:49:54.323 --> 00:49:56.340
subjects you wanna write about

00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:58.183
that carry you on those days?

00:49:59.656 --> 00:50:00.489
And that's an interesting challenge.

00:50:00.489 --> 00:50:01.810
And people, the good thing about it

00:50:01.810 --> 00:50:03.710
is people give you ideas all the time.

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:07.001
Either because they
know you write a column

00:50:07.001 --> 00:50:08.380
or because you run into some smart person

00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:09.730
who suddenly makes you see the world

00:50:09.730 --> 00:50:10.810
in a way you didn't before,

00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:13.490
see some event in a different way.

00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:15.880
- And I guess you do a lot of talking

00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:18.730
with influential people in
Washington on the one hand,

00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:21.152
but I get the sense that
you're also talking,

00:50:21.152 --> 00:50:25.650
you're out on the, hustling, so to speak,

00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:27.007
sort of listening to average people

00:50:27.007 --> 00:50:28.357
and what their concerns are

00:50:29.395 --> 00:50:31.053
and trying to mediate these two.

00:50:32.074 --> 00:50:34.259
- That's a really nice thing to say.

00:50:34.259 --> 00:50:35.643
I probably don't do it nearly enough.

00:50:37.454 --> 00:50:39.529
I do like to go out in the country.

00:50:39.529 --> 00:50:40.493
I mean, in fact, for me personally,

00:50:41.548 --> 00:50:42.585
I've traveled somewhat less because

00:50:42.585 --> 00:50:44.095
I now have three little kids

00:50:44.095 --> 00:50:45.651
and the travel looks a little different

00:50:45.651 --> 00:50:47.133
when you have kids.

00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:51.220
And it's voluntary, I
like being with them.

00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:53.497
But during the campaign I did try,

00:50:53.497 --> 00:50:56.580
you know, I try to get
out and around the country

00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:57.930
as much as is plausible.

00:50:57.930 --> 00:51:02.350
And I do enjoy, you know,
I find it satisfying,

00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:04.625
like that little Gallipolis column.

00:51:04.625 --> 00:51:06.607
I'm not sure that column had any

00:51:06.607 --> 00:51:09.530
sort of profound insights in it at all,

00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:10.929
and yet I tremendously enjoyed

00:51:10.929 --> 00:51:13.574
just kind of dropping into this community

00:51:13.574 --> 00:51:17.410
and sort of listening to the way people

00:51:17.410 --> 00:51:18.507
were talking about politics

00:51:18.507 --> 00:51:20.660
and the difference between that

00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:23.479
and the way we do it in Washington.

00:51:23.479 --> 00:51:25.429
I'm not a basher of inside the Beltway.

00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:27.223
That is a term used by some people

00:51:28.616 --> 00:51:29.449
inside the Beltway to bash
other people inside the Beltway.

00:51:30.794 --> 00:51:32.454
So I think it's a phony
distinction to some degree.

00:51:32.454 --> 00:51:34.347
But there is some reality about how

00:51:34.347 --> 00:51:36.143
a person, whether inside
or outside the Beltway,

00:51:37.604 --> 00:51:39.394
who is not a professional,
they talk about politics

00:51:39.394 --> 00:51:41.090
over the fence than the way those of us

00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:42.530
either in the media or in politics

00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:44.700
might talk about the
same set of questions.

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:46.520
- How would you advise students

00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:49.210
to prepare for the future if A,

00:51:49.210 --> 00:51:51.947
they wanted to either be in politics or,

00:51:51.947 --> 00:51:55.012
A be in politics or B
write about politics?

00:51:55.012 --> 00:51:57.890
- You know, the joke has been for a while,

00:51:57.890 --> 00:51:59.530
if you wanna be in politics,

00:51:59.530 --> 00:52:01.070
from the moment you make that decision,

00:52:01.070 --> 00:52:03.150
don't do anything controversial

00:52:03.150 --> 00:52:06.510
or interesting, let alone amoral.

00:52:06.510 --> 00:52:08.190
- [Harry] Clinton proves it.

00:52:08.190 --> 00:52:09.740
- Maybe he proves the opposite.

00:52:13.930 --> 00:52:15.345
I don't know, I guess I'm,

00:52:15.345 --> 00:52:17.593
I sorta like the idea of using

00:52:17.593 --> 00:52:21.923
your years in college as a time

00:52:21.923 --> 00:52:25.178
to sort of expand what you know

00:52:25.178 --> 00:52:30.178
and not as a time to be
narrowly professionally focused.

00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:32.700
Obviously, if you're a scientist,

00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:34.300
if you wanna be a scientist you need to,

00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:36.240
you've got a series of building blocks,

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:38.898
and it wouldn't be bad to have
more scientists in politics.

00:52:38.898 --> 00:52:42.497
But, you know, I think that there is,

00:52:42.497 --> 00:52:45.570
sometimes people are very
professionally driven.

00:52:45.570 --> 00:52:47.806
I think that, especially
in journalism or politics,

00:52:47.806 --> 00:52:52.210
you know, knowing a lot
about how to write and speak

00:52:52.210 --> 00:52:56.590
and knowing a lot about
history can be much more

00:52:56.590 --> 00:53:00.322
helpful than studying the
techniques of this or that.

00:53:00.322 --> 00:53:03.420
I have sorta the same view,

00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:05.425
I mean I respect journalism schools,

00:53:05.425 --> 00:53:07.330
I know a lot of good people at them,

00:53:07.330 --> 00:53:10.486
but I like the idea of
journalism schools after college

00:53:10.486 --> 00:53:13.030
and to be a sorta generalist
while you're in it.

00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:15.100
And then, also, just do the stuff.

00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:17.679
I mean one of the beauties of
newspaper writing especially

00:53:17.679 --> 00:53:20.550
is anybody can be a newspaper writer,

00:53:20.550 --> 00:53:22.717
anybody can learn how to write a sentence.

00:53:22.717 --> 00:53:25.560
You know, and you have
opportunities in college papers,

00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:27.600
a lot of small towns are very short

00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:29.040
of good people to write for newspapers.

00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:31.537
You have a lot of
opportunities to do that.

00:53:31.537 --> 00:53:34.840
And the other thing is just obvious,

00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:36.720
which is have some experiences.

00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:40.720
Don't necessarily commit yourself

00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:44.138
immediately to a path, do some things,

00:53:44.138 --> 00:53:46.274
have some things you can draw on

00:53:46.274 --> 00:53:48.650
when you start doing this kinda work.

00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:53.053
- One final question, short
answer because of the time.

00:53:53.053 --> 00:53:58.053
How do you see problems ahead of the time?

00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:01.077
As a writer, it's very clear in your work

00:54:01.077 --> 00:54:03.561
that somehow a muse strikes you

00:54:03.561 --> 00:54:07.610
and you're grappling
with a problem, in a way,

00:54:07.610 --> 00:54:11.180
before ideas about the
problem have reached fruition.

00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:14.900
Right now you're working on,
or you have been working on

00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:17.340
religious-based organizations,

00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:19.154
and I think you were doing that, actually,

00:54:19.154 --> 00:54:22.500
before it became a national conversation

00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:26.190
in the way it has with
President Bush's new initiative.

00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:28.790
Tell us briefly about, what is it?

00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:29.830
Is it the reading?

00:54:29.830 --> 00:54:31.420
Is it your knowledge of history?

00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:33.960
Or is it just keeping informed?

00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:36.476
- Well I hope what you said is true.

00:54:36.476 --> 00:54:39.900
I mean I was always struck,

00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:41.970
Michael Harington, the
great American socialist,

00:54:41.970 --> 00:54:43.830
had a book where his, the subtitle was

00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:45.798
The History of the Future,

00:54:45.798 --> 00:54:49.530
and I have always enjoyed trying to think,

00:54:49.530 --> 00:54:52.210
sometimes successfully,
sometimes unsuccessfully,

00:54:52.210 --> 00:54:54.070
about how would this time look

00:54:54.070 --> 00:54:55.560
if you looked at it in 10 years?

00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:58.230
If I were reading a
book about this moment,

00:54:58.230 --> 00:55:01.950
what would that book say
about what happened afterward?

00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:06.070
And it's just a habit of
mine, for better or worse.

00:55:06.070 --> 00:55:08.720
But as I say, some of it is luck

00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:10.210
and some of it is just when

00:55:10.210 --> 00:55:11.750
something you happen to care about

00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:14.320
also happens to become an important issue.

00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:15.480
I mean I've been interested in

00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:18.058
the faith-based thing for some time.

00:55:18.058 --> 00:55:21.196
I don't pretend I saw the huge interest

00:55:21.196 --> 00:55:23.950
that now exists in it coming,

00:55:23.950 --> 00:55:25.490
and yet it just struck me as natural

00:55:25.490 --> 00:55:26.910
that we were, it was very clear

00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:28.370
that we were renegotiating

00:55:29.330 --> 00:55:31.774
the question of faith and public life,

00:55:31.774 --> 00:55:35.200
that it was clear that the religious right

00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:37.610
had had an effect in making
people think about this,

00:55:37.610 --> 00:55:39.690
but also that there was a kind of

00:55:39.690 --> 00:55:42.640
revival among moderate and
progressive religious people,

00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:46.480
an intellectual revival
and a revival of activism.

00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:49.730
And I think you could see that out there,

00:55:49.730 --> 00:55:51.410
and then the rest has
happened more quickly

00:55:51.410 --> 00:55:54.019
because of Bush's election.

00:55:54.019 --> 00:55:56.300
- Well E.J., thank you very much

00:55:56.300 --> 00:55:59.550
for this fascinating conversation

00:55:59.550 --> 00:56:03.030
about your career and why
ideas have really mattered

00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:05.139
and why they matter in politics.

00:56:05.139 --> 00:56:06.267
- Thank you very much.

00:56:06.267 --> 00:56:07.301
- Thank you.

00:56:07.301 --> 00:56:08.310
And thank you very much for joining us

00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:10.233
for this conversation with history.
