00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:06.250
So I have the series-- negative
5/3 plus 25 over 6 minus 125

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.950
over 9 plus-- and it just keeps
going on and on and on forever.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.240
So this right over
here is an infinite sum

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.360
or an infinite series, and
what I want you to do right now

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.320
is to pause this video
and try to express

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.490
this infinite series
using sigma notation.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.390
So I'm assuming you've given
a go at it, so let's just

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.670
look at each term of the series
and let's see if we can express

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.340
it with kind of an
ever-increasing index.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.630
So the first thing that
might jump out at you

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.350
is this oscillating sign that's
happening right over here.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.400
And whenever we see
an oscillating sign,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.358
that's a pretty good idea
that we could kind of

00:00:44.358 --> 00:00:48.360
view this as negative 1 to the
n-th, where n is our index.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.020
So for example, that
right over there

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.580
is negative 1 to
the first power.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:01.440
That is-- this right
over here is negative 1

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.080
to the second power.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.190
That right over there is
negative 1 to the third power.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.610
So it looks like the
sign is being defined

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.120
by raising negative
1 to the index.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.340
Now let's look at the
other parts of these terms

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.640
right over here.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.290
So we have 5, then we
have 25, the we have 125,

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.420
so these are the powers of 5.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.250
So this right over here
is 5 to the first power,

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.980
this right over here is
5 to the second power,

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.280
this right over here is
5 to the third power.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.940
So this part, we're
raising 5 to our index.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.370
Notice, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.350
And then finally,
let's look at this.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.260
We have 3, 6, and 9.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.730
So this literally-- if our index
here is 1, this is 3 times 1.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.160
If our index here is
2, this is 3 times 2.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.110
If our index here is
3, this is 3 times 3.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.250
So this is 3 times 1,
that is 3 times 2--

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.470
let me write it this
way-- 3 times 2,

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.940
that right over
there is 3 times 3.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.630
So this sets us up
pretty well to write

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.160
this in sigma notation.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.440
So let's write it over here
just so we can compare.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.710
So let me give myself some
real estate to work with.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.140
So we could write
this as the sum--

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.535
I'll do it in yellow-- as the
sum, so this is our sigma.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.950
We can start our index
n at 1, from n equals 1,

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.950
and we're going to keep
going on and on forever.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.190
We just keep going
on and on forever.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:50.120
And so it's negative 1
to the n-th power times 5

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:59.250
to the n-th over-- notice
5 to the n-th-- over 3n

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.700
is going to be equal to this.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.270
And you can verify
when n equals 1,

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.771
it's negative 1
to the nth power--

00:03:03.771 --> 00:03:05.770
I'm sorry-- negative 1
to the first power, which

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.200
is negative 1 times 5 to
the first power, which

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.170
is 5 over 3 times 1.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.335
And we can do that for
each successive term.

00:03:12.335 --> 00:03:15.660
And so we're all done.
