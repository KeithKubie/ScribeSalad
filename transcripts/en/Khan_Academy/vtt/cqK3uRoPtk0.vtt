00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.730
Voiceover:Let's say we define

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:03.231
the random variable capital X

00:00:03.231 --> 00:00:05.460
as the number of heads we get

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.333
after three flips of a fair coin.

00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:11.410
So given that definition
of a random variable,

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:12.639
what we're going to try
and do in this video

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.245
is think about the
probability distributions.

00:00:15.245 --> 00:00:16.590
So what is the probability

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.137
of the different possible outcomes

00:00:19.137 --> 00:00:20.999
or the different possible values

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:22.501
for this random variable.

00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:23.697
We'll plot them to see how

00:00:23.697 --> 00:00:26.480
that distribution is spread out

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.100
amongst those possible outcomes.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.866
So let's think about all
of the different values

00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:35.465
that you could get when
you flip a fair coin

00:00:35.465 --> 00:00:36.605
three times.

00:00:36.605 --> 00:00:40.261
So you could get all heads,

00:00:40.261 --> 00:00:42.346
heads, heads, heads.

00:00:42.346 --> 00:00:45.448
You could get heads, heads, tails.

00:00:45.448 --> 00:00:48.394
You could get heads, tails, heads.

00:00:48.394 --> 00:00:51.429
You could get heads, tails, tails.

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:54.762
You could have tails, heads, heads.

00:00:54.762 --> 00:00:58.193
You could have tails, head, tails.

00:00:58.193 --> 00:01:00.662
You could have tails, tails, heads.

00:01:00.662 --> 00:01:03.274
And then you could have all tails.

00:01:03.274 --> 00:01:05.101
So there's eight equally,

00:01:05.101 --> 00:01:07.632
when you do the actual experiment

00:01:07.632 --> 00:01:10.605
there's eight equally
likely outcomes here.

00:01:10.605 --> 00:01:12.371
But which of them, how would these relate

00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:15.320
to the value of this random variable?

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.414
So let's think about,
what's the probability,

00:01:17.414 --> 00:01:20.107
there is a situation
where you have zero heads.

00:01:20.107 --> 00:01:23.744
So what's the probably
that our random variable X

00:01:23.744 --> 00:01:25.621
is equal to zero?

00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:29.505
Well, that's this
situation right over here

00:01:29.505 --> 00:01:30.662
where you have zero heads.

00:01:30.662 --> 00:01:33.241
It's one out of the eight equally

00:01:33.241 --> 00:01:34.328
likely outcomes.

00:01:34.328 --> 00:01:40.220
So that is going to be 1/8.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.741
What's the probability that our random

00:01:43.741 --> 00:01:48.865
variable capital X is equal to one?

00:01:48.865 --> 00:01:49.764
Well, let's see.

00:01:49.764 --> 00:01:53.216
Which of these outcomes
gets us exactly one head?

00:01:53.216 --> 00:01:56.280
We have this one right over here.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.581
We have that one right over there.

00:01:58.581 --> 00:02:01.248
We have this one right over there.

00:02:01.248 --> 00:02:02.324
And I think that's all of them.

00:02:02.324 --> 00:02:05.648
So three out of the eight
equally likely outcomes

00:02:05.648 --> 00:02:09.736
provide us, get us to one head,

00:02:09.736 --> 00:02:11.989
which is the same thing as saying

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.397
that our random variable equals one.

00:02:13.397 --> 00:02:16.462
So this has a 3/8 probability.

00:02:16.462 --> 00:02:18.857
So what's the probability,

00:02:18.857 --> 00:02:19.570
I think you're getting,

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.265
maybe getting the hang
of it at this point.

00:02:21.265 --> 00:02:23.980
What's the probability
that the random variable X

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.768
is going to be equal to two?

00:02:25.768 --> 00:02:27.619
Well, for X to be equal to two,

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:30.152
we must, that means we have two heads

00:02:30.152 --> 00:02:31.947
when we flip the coins three times.

00:02:31.947 --> 00:02:35.783
So that's this outcome
meets this constraint.

00:02:35.783 --> 00:02:37.210
This outcome would get

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:38.775
our random variable to be equal to two.

00:02:38.775 --> 00:02:40.385
And this outcome would make

00:02:40.385 --> 00:02:42.960
our random variable equal to two.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.608
And this is three out of the eight

00:02:43.608 --> 00:02:45.310
equally likely outcomes.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.809
So this has a 3/8 probability.

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:50.354
And then finally we could say

00:02:50.354 --> 00:02:52.214
what is the probability

00:02:52.214 --> 00:02:54.410
that our random variable X

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.800
is equal to three?

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.620
Well, how does our random
variable X equal three?

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.478
Well we have to get three heads

00:02:59.478 --> 00:03:00.618
when we flip the coin.

00:03:00.618 --> 00:03:02.132
So there's only one out of the eight

00:03:02.132 --> 00:03:05.352
equally likely outcomes
that meets that constraint.

00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:08.890
So it's a 1/8 probability.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:09.726
So now we just have to think about

00:03:09.726 --> 00:03:12.152
how we plot this, to see
how this is distributed.

00:03:12.152 --> 00:03:14.605
So let me draw...

00:03:14.605 --> 00:03:17.696
So over here on the vertical axis

00:03:17.696 --> 00:03:20.305
this will be the probability.

00:03:20.305 --> 00:03:24.074
Probability.

00:03:24.075 --> 00:03:25.939
And it's going to be between zero and one.

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:29.791
You can't have a
probability larger than one.

00:03:29.791 --> 00:03:33.900
So just like this.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.700
So let's see, if this
is one right over here,

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.309
and let's see everything here

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:40.391
looks like it's in eighths

00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:42.608
so let's put everything
in terms of eighths.

00:03:42.608 --> 00:03:43.571
So that's half.

00:03:43.972 --> 00:03:45.529
This is a fourth.

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:46.755
That's a fourth.

00:03:46.755 --> 00:03:49.377
That's not quite a fourth.

00:03:49.377 --> 00:03:51.385
This is a fourth right over here.

00:03:51.385 --> 00:03:54.814
And then we can do it in terms of eighths.

00:03:54.814 --> 00:03:59.075
So that's a pretty good approximation.

00:03:59.075 --> 00:04:01.423
And then over here we
can have the outcomes.

00:04:01.423 --> 00:04:04.605
Outcomes.

00:04:04.605 --> 00:04:07.816
And so outcomes, I'll say outcomes for

00:04:07.816 --> 00:04:09.253
alright let's write this

00:04:09.253 --> 00:04:16.124
so value for X

00:04:16.124 --> 00:04:18.317
So X could be zero

00:04:18.317 --> 00:04:21.586
actually let me do those same colors,

00:04:21.586 --> 00:04:24.262
X could be zero.

00:04:24.262 --> 00:04:26.438
X could be one.

00:04:26.438 --> 00:04:29.884
X could be two.

00:04:29.884 --> 00:04:32.203
X could be equal to two.

00:04:32.203 --> 00:04:34.369
X could be equal to three.

00:04:34.369 --> 00:04:36.402
X could be equal to three.

00:04:36.402 --> 00:04:37.512
So these are the possible

00:04:37.512 --> 00:04:38.791
values for X.

00:04:38.791 --> 00:04:40.502
And now we're just going
to plot the probability.

00:04:40.502 --> 00:04:45.335
The probability that X has
a value of zero is 1/8.

00:04:45.335 --> 00:04:48.636
That's, I'll make a little bit of a bar

00:04:48.636 --> 00:04:52.325
right over here that goes up to 1/8.

00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:55.243
So let draw it like this.

00:04:55.243 --> 00:05:01.338
So goes up to, so this
is 1/8 right over here.

00:05:01.338 --> 00:05:03.641
The probability that X equals one is 3/8.

00:05:03.641 --> 00:05:06.867
So 2/8, 3/8 gets us right over

00:05:06.867 --> 00:05:08.545
let me do that in the purple color

00:05:08.545 --> 00:05:11.801
So probability of one, that's 3/8.

00:05:11.801 --> 00:05:13.669
That's right over there.

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:15.307
That's 3/8.

00:05:15.307 --> 00:05:21.403
So let me draw that bar, draw that bar.

00:05:21.403 --> 00:05:23.642
And just like that.

00:05:23.642 --> 00:05:25.175
The probability that X equals two.

00:05:25.175 --> 00:05:26.750
The probability that X equals two

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.386
is also 3/8.

00:05:28.386 --> 00:05:30.014
So that's going to be on the same level.

00:05:30.014 --> 00:05:31.636
Just like that.

00:05:31.636 --> 00:05:35.766
And then, the probability
that X equals three

00:05:35.766 --> 00:05:37.651
well that's 1/8.

00:05:37.651 --> 00:05:40.569
So it's going to the same
height as this thing over here.

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:43.057
I'm using the wrong color.

00:05:43.057 --> 00:05:45.315
So it's going to look like this.

00:05:45.315 --> 00:05:47.859
It's going to look like this.

00:05:47.859 --> 00:05:50.149
And actually let me just write
this a little bit neater.

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:52.127
I can write that three.

00:05:52.127 --> 00:05:54.448
Cut and paste.

00:05:54.448 --> 00:05:56.241
Move that three a little closer in

00:05:56.241 --> 00:05:57.766
so that it looks a little bit neater.

00:05:57.766 --> 00:05:59.242
And I can actually move that
two in actually as well.

00:05:59.242 --> 00:06:03.386
So cut and paste.

00:06:03.386 --> 00:06:04.669
So I can move that two.

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:05.774
And there you have it!

00:06:05.774 --> 00:06:08.320
We have made a probability distribution

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.180
for the random variable X.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.743
And the random variable X

00:06:11.743 --> 00:06:13.502
can only take on these discrete values.

00:06:13.502 --> 00:06:15.024
It can't take on the value half

00:06:15.024 --> 00:06:17.403
or the value pi or anything like that.

00:06:17.403 --> 00:06:20.012
So this, what we've just done here

00:06:20.012 --> 00:06:24.709
is constructed a discrete
probability distribution.

00:06:24.709 --> 00:06:26.976
Let me write that down.

00:06:26.976 --> 00:06:31.127
So this is a discrete,

00:06:31.127 --> 00:06:33.209
it only, the random variable only takes on

00:06:33.209 --> 00:06:34.044
discrete values.

00:06:34.044 --> 00:06:36.536
It can't take on any values
in between these things.

00:06:36.536 --> 00:06:38.359
So discrete probability.

00:06:38.359 --> 00:06:40.686
Probability distribution.

00:06:40.686 --> 00:06:46.183
Distribution for our random variable X.
