basically and what you do can have a lot

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420
basically and what you do can have a lot
 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.330
basically and what you do can have a lot
of weight and importance and even if

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340
of weight and importance and even if
 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.740

an impact on the world you know it will
probably be through my writing but it

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:09.829
probably be through my writing but it
 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:11.410
probably be through my writing but it
could be through you know community

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420
could be through you know community
 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.929
could be through you know community

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740
think at a lot of other schools you
 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.649
think at a lot of other schools you
might meet someone that you went to

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659
might meet someone that you went to
 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:27.999

college with and you didn't know them

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009
college with and you didn't know them
 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.370
college with and you didn't know them
there but you say oh what class were you

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380
there but you say oh what class were you
 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.539
there but you say oh what class were you
and I was this class and there's

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549
and I was this class and there's
 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.669
and I was this class and there's
something in common there but you know

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679
something in common there but you know
 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:36.099
something in common there but you know
it seems to me that having gone to

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:36.109
it seems to me that having gone to
 

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:38.169
it seems to me that having gone to
Carnegie Mellon marks you in this

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179
Carnegie Mellon marks you in this
 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:40.510
Carnegie Mellon marks you in this
different way and and there's just a

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520
different way and and there's just a
 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.760
different way and and there's just a
stronger bond and then a lot I imagine

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770
stronger bond and then a lot I imagine
 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.739
stronger bond and then a lot I imagine
it a lot of other places because of sort

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:44.749
it a lot of other places because of sort
 

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:46.480
it a lot of other places because of sort
of what what people go through here in
