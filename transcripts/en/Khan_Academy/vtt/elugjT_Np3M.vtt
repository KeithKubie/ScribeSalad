00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.607
- [Instructor] We have the
graphs of three functions here,

00:00:02.607 --> 00:00:05.299
and what we know is that one
of them is the function f,

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:07.531
another is the first derivative of f,

00:00:07.531 --> 00:00:10.291
and then the third is the
second derivative of f.

00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:13.280
And our goal is to figure
out which function is which.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.004
Which one is f, which
is the first derivative,

00:00:15.004 --> 00:00:16.564
and which is the second?

00:00:16.564 --> 00:00:18.681
Like always, pause this video and see

00:00:18.681 --> 00:00:20.292
if you can work through it on your own

00:00:20.292 --> 00:00:22.424
before we do it together.

00:00:22.424 --> 00:00:24.428
All right, now let's do this together.

00:00:24.428 --> 00:00:26.870
The way I'm going to tackle
it is I'm gonna try to sketch

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.971
what we can about the derivatives
of each of these graphs,

00:00:30.971 --> 00:00:34.376
or the functions
represented by these graphs.

00:00:34.376 --> 00:00:37.907
So in this first graph
here in this orange color,

00:00:37.907 --> 00:00:41.347
we can see that the slope
is quite positive here,

00:00:41.347 --> 00:00:44.196
but then it becomes less
and less and less positive,

00:00:44.196 --> 00:00:47.236
up until this point where the
slope is going to be zero,

00:00:47.236 --> 00:00:49.344
and then it becomes more and more

00:00:49.344 --> 00:00:51.243
and more and more negative.

00:00:51.243 --> 00:00:54.930
So the derivative of this
curve right over here,

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.391
or the function represented by this curve

00:00:57.391 --> 00:01:01.457
is gonna start off reasonably
positive right over there.

00:01:01.457 --> 00:01:03.919
At this point, the derivative
is gonna cross zero,

00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:05.321
'cause our derivative is zero there,

00:01:05.321 --> 00:01:06.797
slope of the tangent line.

00:01:06.797 --> 00:01:08.655
And then it's gonna get
more and more negative,

00:01:08.655 --> 00:01:10.967
at least over the interval that we see.

00:01:10.967 --> 00:01:13.733
So it might look, I don't
know, something like this.

00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:15.002
I don't know if it's a line or not.

00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:17.507
It might be some type of a curve.

00:01:17.507 --> 00:01:20.735
It would definitely have a
trend something like that.

00:01:20.735 --> 00:01:21.828
Now, we could immediately tell

00:01:21.828 --> 00:01:23.890
that this blue graph is not the derivative

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.296
of this orange graph.

00:01:25.296 --> 00:01:26.450
Its trend is opposite.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.429
Over that interval,

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:29.808
it's going from being
negative to positive,

00:01:29.808 --> 00:01:32.847
as opposed to going from
positive to negative.

00:01:32.847 --> 00:01:34.542
So we can rule out the blue graph

00:01:34.542 --> 00:01:37.441
as being the derivative
of the orange graph.

00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:39.184
But what about this magenta graph?

00:01:39.184 --> 00:01:42.839
It does look like it has the right trend.

00:01:42.839 --> 00:01:46.345
In fact, it intersects the
x-axis at the right place

00:01:46.345 --> 00:01:47.850
right over there.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.517
And at least over this interval,

00:01:49.517 --> 00:01:52.715
it seems it's positive from here to here.

00:01:52.715 --> 00:01:54.669
So it's positive.

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:56.155
This graph is positive

00:01:56.155 --> 00:01:58.876
when the slope of the tangent
line here is positive.

00:01:58.876 --> 00:02:00.687
And this graph is negative

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:04.175
when the slope of the tangent
line here is negative.

00:02:04.175 --> 00:02:06.538
Now, one thing that might
be causing some unease

00:02:06.538 --> 00:02:09.676
to immediately say that this last graph

00:02:09.676 --> 00:02:11.580
is the derivative of the first one

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.373
is we're not used to situations

00:02:13.373 --> 00:02:17.082
where the derivative
has more extreme points,

00:02:17.082 --> 00:02:20.688
more minima and maxima
than the original function.

00:02:20.688 --> 00:02:22.440
But in this case, it could just be

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.135
'cause we don't see the
entire original function.

00:02:25.135 --> 00:02:28.603
So, for example, if this last
graph is indeed the derivative

00:02:28.603 --> 00:02:30.443
of this first graph,

00:02:30.443 --> 00:02:34.276
then what we see is our
derivative is negative

00:02:35.746 --> 00:02:36.579
right over here,

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.432
but then right around here it
starts becoming less negative.

00:02:39.432 --> 00:02:42.940
So if that point corresponds
to roughly right over there,

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.569
then over here our slope
will become less and less

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:48.922
and less negative,

00:02:48.922 --> 00:02:52.371
and then at this point our
slope would become zero,

00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:54.325
which would be right around there.

00:02:54.325 --> 00:02:59.253
So for example, our graph
might look something like this,

00:02:59.253 --> 00:03:00.172
we just didn't see it.

00:03:00.172 --> 00:03:02.511
It fell off of the part of the graph

00:03:02.511 --> 00:03:04.034
that we actually showed.

00:03:04.034 --> 00:03:05.055
So I would actually say

00:03:05.055 --> 00:03:07.286
that this is a good candidate for being,

00:03:07.286 --> 00:03:08.864
the third function is a good candidate

00:03:08.864 --> 00:03:10.899
for being the derivative
of the first function.

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:13.208
So maybe we could say that this is f

00:03:13.208 --> 00:03:15.862
and that this is f prime.

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:17.564
Now, let's look at the second graph.

00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:19.793
What would its derivative look like?

00:03:19.793 --> 00:03:22.797
So over here our slope is quite negative,

00:03:22.797 --> 00:03:25.743
and it becomes less and
less and less negative

00:03:25.743 --> 00:03:28.404
until we go right over here
where our slope is zero.

00:03:28.404 --> 00:03:30.706
So our derivative would
intersect the x-axis

00:03:30.706 --> 00:03:31.539
right over there.

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:33.192
It would start out negative,

00:03:33.192 --> 00:03:36.735
and it would become less
and less and less negative.

00:03:36.735 --> 00:03:38.835
And at this point it crosses the x-axis

00:03:38.835 --> 00:03:42.591
and it becomes more and more positive.

00:03:42.591 --> 00:03:44.882
So we see here our derivative

00:03:44.882 --> 00:03:46.629
becomes more and more positive.

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:47.973
But then right around here it seems

00:03:47.973 --> 00:03:50.021
like it's getting less positive again.

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:53.021
So it might look something like this

00:03:54.134 --> 00:03:56.786
where over here it's
becoming less positive again,

00:03:56.786 --> 00:03:58.518
less positive, less
positive, less positive.

00:03:58.518 --> 00:04:01.812
Right over here, our
derivative would be zero.

00:04:01.812 --> 00:04:04.157
Our derivative would
intersect the x-axis there.

00:04:04.157 --> 00:04:06.010
And then it just looks like it is,

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.396
the slope is getting more
and more and more negative,

00:04:08.396 --> 00:04:09.473
so our derivative is gonna get more

00:04:09.473 --> 00:04:10.949
and more and more negative.

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:12.800
Well, what I very
roughly just sketched out

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.413
looks an awful lot like the
brown graph right over here.

00:04:16.413 --> 00:04:18.168
So this brown graph does indeed look

00:04:18.168 --> 00:04:20.456
like the derivative of this blue graph.

00:04:20.456 --> 00:04:23.569
So what I would say is
that this is actually f,

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:25.484
and then this would be f prime.

00:04:25.484 --> 00:04:26.710
And then if this is f prime,

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.963
the derivative of that is
going to be f prime prime.

00:04:29.963 --> 00:04:31.266
So that looks good.

00:04:31.266 --> 00:04:32.697
I would actually go with this.

00:04:32.697 --> 00:04:34.309
And if you wanted, just for safe measure,

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:35.417
you could try to sketch out

00:04:35.417 --> 00:04:37.442
what the derivative of
this graph would be.

00:04:37.442 --> 00:04:39.022
Actually, let's just do that.

00:04:39.022 --> 00:04:42.323
So over here, the derivative of this,

00:04:42.323 --> 00:04:44.665
so right now we have a positive slope

00:04:44.665 --> 00:04:47.574
of our tangent line is getting
less and less positive.

00:04:47.574 --> 00:04:50.198
It hits zero right over there.

00:04:50.198 --> 00:04:53.345
So the derivative might
look something like this

00:04:53.345 --> 00:04:54.368
over the interval.

00:04:54.368 --> 00:04:56.531
Now, the slope of the
tangent line is getting more

00:04:56.531 --> 00:04:58.821
and more and more and more negative,

00:04:58.821 --> 00:05:01.209
right until about that point.

00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:03.508
So it's getting more and
more and more negative

00:05:03.508 --> 00:05:04.341
until about that point.

00:05:04.341 --> 00:05:06.032
And now it looks like
it's getting less and less

00:05:06.032 --> 00:05:07.634
and less and less negative,

00:05:07.634 --> 00:05:11.954
all the way until the derivative
goes back to being zero.

00:05:11.954 --> 00:05:13.838
And then it looks like
it's getting more and more

00:05:13.838 --> 00:05:16.260
and more and more positive.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.705
So the derivative of
this magenta curve looks

00:05:18.705 --> 00:05:21.297
like an upward opening U.

00:05:21.297 --> 00:05:23.227
And we don't see that over here,

00:05:23.227 --> 00:05:24.627
so we could feel good

00:05:24.627 --> 00:05:26.720
that its derivative
actually isn't depicted.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.579
So I feel calling the middle graph f,

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:31.556
calling the left graph f prime,

00:05:31.556 --> 00:05:34.897
and calling the right graph
the second derivative.
