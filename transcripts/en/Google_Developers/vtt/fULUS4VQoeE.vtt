One thing that is great
about GWT

00:00:02.634 --> 00:00:05.000
is its DOM Abstraction.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.167
So if you are even
a web developer

00:00:08.167 --> 00:00:10.734
and have just coded
some HTML,

00:00:10.734 --> 00:00:12.734
you know
how difficult it is

00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:14.868
to have a page
render properly

00:00:14.868 --> 00:00:16.234
in all the various browsers,

00:00:16.234 --> 00:00:18.968
i.e. Safari, Firefox.

00:00:18.968 --> 00:00:21.534
Once you're building
Ajax applications,

00:00:21.534 --> 00:00:24.567
that's compounded greatly
as well

00:00:24.567 --> 00:00:28.601
'cause you're usually
doing dynamic HTML on demand.

00:00:28.601 --> 00:00:31.100
So the DOM Abstraction
allows us

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.767
to build and render
our U.I.,

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:36.234
coded in one language,

00:00:36.234 --> 00:00:39.501
and it gets compiled down
and render it properly,

00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:43.434
so that regardless
of what browser we're in.
