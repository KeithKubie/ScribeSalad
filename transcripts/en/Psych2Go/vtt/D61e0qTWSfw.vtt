00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.150
If you think psychology is boring, then we've
got news for you, you couldn't be more wrong.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.600
This wild and intriguing branch of science
is filled with all kinds of wacky facts and

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.360
some of them will blow your socks right off.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.560
So strap in because we're about to take you
on a rollercoaster ride straight into the

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.320
human brain.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.540
1.Bravery cells have been found at the hippocampus.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.900
Scientists working at Uppsala University in
Sweden have found out something amazing about

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.750
the human hippocampus.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.559
They've discovered that there are certain
specific cells in the hippocampus that actually

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.080
determine how brave we are.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.620
So, the next time you work up the courage
to ask someone out or to go skydiving, you

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.620
can thank your trusty bravery cells.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.240
2.We will probably not freak out if aliens ever
come to earth.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.540
Hollywood loves to focus on what could go
wrong if aliens ever came to earth.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.920
These movies often end up in massive battles
where the faith of the entire world is at

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.920
stake.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.920
But researchers at Arizona State University
have discovered that real everyday people

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.780
actually have a much more optimistic approach
to alien life.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.380
In fact, they've determined that people would
probably be pretty happy about meeting a new

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.140
life-form from outer space.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.100
3.Teen love is real after all and it can impact
us deeply.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.969
You've probably heard of the old saying "there's
no such thing as teen love".

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:57.500
This stems from the belief that teenagers
are not mature enough to feel real love and

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.759
what they experience is just their hormones
acting up.

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.790
But researchers at Arizona State University
have been taking this phenomenon very seriously;

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.150
they found that teen love is actually so strong
and emotionally impactful that it affects

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.650
mental health and even future relationships.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.600
Your highschool crush was true love after
all.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.400
4.The human brain has a much larger capacity
than we ever thought.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.750
How many gigs of data does an average brain
hold?

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.790
Well scientists thought that they had the
answer until a very interesting discovery

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.110
was made a few years back.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.650
Researchers at the University of California
and others have determined that our brains

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.110
have a capacity 10 times larger than previously
thought.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.420
This means that our brains can hold roughly
the entire internet.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.100
5.Young adults are the most stressed-out people
on earth.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:57.530
It turns out that Millennials actually have
a pretty good reason for complaining so much.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.550
According to a survey conducted by the American
Psychological Association, those aged 18 to

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.480
35 reported the highest amounts of stress,
more than any other age group.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.320
Money and finances were the biggest causes
for stress across all generations.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.300
6.Saffron might just be the best antidepressant
ever.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.530
Today, people are extremely wary of big pharmaceutical
companies prescribing antidepressants and

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.560
other medication that could do more harm than
good.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.600
But according to a number of new studies,
the most effective antidepressants might have

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.190
been under our noses the whole time.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.480
Yes, we're talking about saffron and research
has shown that it's just as effective as pharmaceuticals

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.600
and has no side effects.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.920
7.Were only capable of being close to about
150 people.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.760
The age of social media has opened us up to
an entire world of potential friends where

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.780
everyone can be connected.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.130
At least that's the theory, but psychologists
know that according to something called Dunbar's

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.230
number, the maximum amount of friends our
brains can handle is about 150.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.150
This was confirmed by recent studies which
even took into account the recent rise of

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.590
social media.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.160
Even after all these years, Dunbar's number
seems to hold true.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.560
8.Money can buy happiness...

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.560
Kind of.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.630
You've probably heard it repeated a million
times "money can't buy happiness".

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.260
Well, researchers from Purdue University and
the University of Virginia might have a thing

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.190
or two to say about that; when it comes to
happiness, their research has shown that it

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.470
only takes about $75,000 a year for emotional
well-being.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.510
Boost it up to $95,000 and you won't desire
any more income.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.690
Anything above that and there's no real increase
in happiness.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.980
