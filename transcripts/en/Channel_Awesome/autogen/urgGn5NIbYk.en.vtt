painful and so hurtful to go in there
 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.680
painful and so hurtful to go in there
uh and just so well done I think so much

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690
uh and just so well done I think so much
 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.110
uh and just so well done I think so much
of that comes from keeping him out of

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120
of that comes from keeping him out of
 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.740
of that comes from keeping him out of
the picture

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750
